2015-06-27T23:11:02Z,world,World news,Pope Francis recruits Naomi Klein in climate change battle,"She is one of the world‚Äôs most high-profile social activists and a ferocious critic of 21st-century capitalism. He is one of the pope‚Äôs most senior aides and a professor of climate change economics. But this week the secular radical will join forces with the Catholic cardinal in the latest move by Pope Francis to shift the debate on global warming. Naomi Klein and Cardinal Peter Turkson are to lead a high-level conference on the environment, bringing together churchmen, scientists and activists to debate climate change action. Klein, who campaigns for an overhaul of the global financial system to tackle climate change, told the Observer she was surprised but delighted to receive the invitation from Turkson‚Äôs office. ‚ÄúThe fact that they invited me indicates they‚Äôre not backing down from the fight. A lot of people have patted the pope on the head, but said he‚Äôs wrong on the economics. I think he‚Äôs right on the economics,‚Äù she said, referring to Pope Francis‚Äôs recent publication of an encyclical on the environment. Release of the document earlier this month thrust the pontiff to the centre of the global debate on climate change, as he berated politicians for creating a system that serves wealthy countries at the expense of the poorest. Activists and religious leaders will gather in Rome on Sunday, marching through the Eternal City before the Vatican welcomes campaigners to the conference, which will focus on the UN‚Äôs impending climate change summit. Protesters have chosen the French embassy as their starting point ‚Äì a Renaissance palace famed for its beautiful frescoes, but more significantly a symbol of the United Nations climate change conference, which will be hosted by Paris this December. Nearly 500 years since Galileo was found guilty of heresy, the Holy See is leading the rallying cry for the world to wake up and listen to scientists on climate change. Multi-faith leaders will walk alongside scientists and campaigners, hailing from organisations including Greenpeace and Oxfam Italy, marching to the Vatican to celebrate the pope‚Äôs tough stance on environmental issues. The imminent arrival of Klein within the Vatican walls has raised some eyebrows, but the involvement of lay people in church discussions is not without precedent. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, delivered the keynote address at a Vatican summit in April on climate change and poverty. Anticipating the encyclical, he said he was depending on the pope‚Äôs ‚Äúmoral voice and moral leadership‚Äù to speed up action. When it came to the presentation of the document itself, the pontiff picked a five-strong panel, including a Rome school teacher and a leading scientist. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, who heads the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, used the time to give churchmen a lesson in climate science. The pope has upset some conservatives for drawing people from outside the clergy into the heart of the debate, while critics have also argued the Catholic church should not be involved in an issue that should be left to presidents and policy-makers. But Klein said the pope‚Äôs position as a ‚Äúmoral voice‚Äù in the world ‚Äì and leader of 1.2 billion Catholics ‚Äì gives him the unique ability to unite campaigners fighting for a common goal. ‚ÄúThe holistic view of the encyclical should be a catalyst to bring together the twin economic and climate crises, instead of treating them separately,‚Äù she said. Much of the pope‚Äôs discourse focuses on the need to give developing countries a greater voice in climate change negotiations, a view that sits uncomfortably among some in developed nations. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of people who are having a lot of trouble in realising there is a voice with such global authority from the global south. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre getting this condescending view, of ‚Äòleave the economics to us‚Äô,‚Äù said Klein. She views the rise of Francis as an environmental campaigner as marking a welcome shift not only in the international sphere but also at the Holy See: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing the power base within the Vatican shift, with a Ghanaian cardinal [Turkson] and an Argentine pope. They‚Äôre doing something very brave.‚Äù While the upcoming conference is centred on the pope‚Äôs encyclical, delegates will also be looking ahead to decisive international meetings this year. Before the Paris talks comes a UN summit, where states are due to commit to sustainable development goals, which will inevitably affect the environment. The pope will fly into New York on the first day of the meeting and address the UN general assembly, reinforcing his message and emboldening countries worst affected by climate change. For Klein, the papal visit will mark a much-needed change in the way negotiators discuss the environment. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a way in which UN discourse sanitises the extent to which this is a moral crisis,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt cries out for a moral voice.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-27T23:08:02Z,world,World news,French terrorist attack: mystery of ‚Äòcalm and gentle‚Äô man who beheaded his boss,"‚ÄúAgain,‚Äù they were saying in Lyon on Saturday, with an air of incredulity. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs happened again.‚Äù Just six months after the massacres at Charlie Hebdo and a kosher grocery shop, France finds itself struggling to comprehend another atrocity in its midst. The severed head of a businessman hung on a factory gate on Friday brought the horror of Isis-style beheadings in Syria, Libya and Iraq to a quiet corner of the Rh√¥ne-Alpes region. Yassin Salhi, a truck driver with a history of radical Islamic ties, is in custody in Lyon, after allegedly murdering his employer, Herv√© Cornara, and crashing a truck into a US-owned chemical warehouse. He isn‚Äôt speaking to investigators. One of the other three suspects detained has been released. Paris prosecutor‚Äôs office spokeswoman Agn√®s Thibault-Lecuivre said investigators have not yet established a motive or any link with Islamist terrorist groups. In the centre of Lyon, a Unesco-listed city on the Rh√¥ne, there was disbelief that such a grotesque act of terrorism could have been visited on the region. Newspapers carried anguished editorials discussing how France should confront the first decapitation as an act of terrorism on its own soil.
‚ÄúWe are not used to seeing this here,‚Äù read a headline in Le Progr√®s. And yet, despite the shockingly barbaric nature of what happened, some things were very familiar about Friday‚Äôs attack centred on a chemical plant some 40km (25 miles) from the city centre. As with previous attacks in Europe, Salhi had crossed the radar of the intelligence services. A Salafi ‚Äì a follower of the radical strain of Islam regularly linked to extremism ‚Äì the 35-year-old had been on a watchlist between 2006 and 2008. In Saint-Priest, a suburb of Lyon, where he had lived for the past six months in a nondescript flat in a four-storey block, neighbours described him as a typical member of the community who liked to play football in the street with his three children. ‚ÄúThey are a very normal family,‚Äù said a neighbour who gave her name as Brigitte. ‚ÄúI only talked with madame; he didn‚Äôt say hello or goodbye,‚Äù the 46-year-old housewife told Reuters. But it now appears that Salhi, who was born in France to immigrant parents, was radicalised before he arrived in Lyon. In the eastern town of Besan√ßon, where he lived for several years, he fell in with a fervently Islamist crowd. A former friend said he started talking about Islamic State ‚Äúbut only to ask my opinion, not to praise them‚Äù. Salhi lost weight, grew a beard and started spending time with younger men, mainly teenagers, dressed in khaki and black. They would spend hours discussing Mali, where French troops were stationed on peacekeeping duties. One neighbour became so worried at the change in Salhi she called the police to warn that he was being radicalised. This weekend the hunt was on for those who had turned a man whom a former colleague recalled as ‚Äúalways gentle and calm‚Äù into a killer. According to his security services file, Salhi had attended a radical mosque in Lyon in 2006. There is speculation among some Muslims in the city that he had fallen under the influence of ‚ÄúGrand Ali‚Äù, an extremist imam of mythical status in the region. If such a character exists, he is not short of recruits. The Rh√¥ne region is considered by terrorism experts to be one of France‚Äôs top five breeding grounds for radicalisation. Several Muslim men told the Observer that a small group of Salafis had been attempting a ‚Äúland grab‚Äù on the city‚Äôs mosques in the past couple of years. ‚ÄúThey are trying to take them over,‚Äù one man said. ‚ÄúThey have targeted four mosques. They are turning people against each other. They are not true Muslims.‚Äù Yesterday Salhi‚Äôs neighbours were forced to contemplate the unwelcome attention their suburb had brought. ‚ÄúWe do not need this here,‚Äù said one woman. ‚ÄúThis is only going to create fear.‚Äù Around her several people nodded, but most refused to talk. Local people were not so cowed online. Many posted messages expressing disbelief that someone known to the security services was not being monitored more closely. The authorities estimate that hundreds of French citizens have gone to fight in Iraq and Syria, and monitoring those who return is stretching them to breaking point. What hope, experts ask, is there of monitoring the lone wolves who show no indication that they will turn murderous? However, the Lyon attack fits an increasingly familiar pattern. In 2012 a spate of attacks carried out by Mohamed Merah, a 23-year-old petty criminal, resulted in the murders of three soldiers and four people, three of them Jewish children, in the south-west of the country. In April, the prime minister, Manuel Valls, revealed that five attacks had been thwarted in the country since the Charlie Hebdo attack, including one on a church near Paris when a man armed with a Kalashnikov assault rifle was planning to fire on the congregation. But Friday‚Äôs attack marks an alarming new direction. The attempt to blow up a chemicals company may have been clumsy in execution, but it represents a chilling broadening of ambition. This weekend, security at France‚Äôs nuclear power plants, electricity substations and other sensitive targets was being stepped up, with thousands of police and soldiers assigned to new protective roles. Meanwhile, Lyon‚Äôs Muslim population fears that the attack will exacerbate racial tensions at a difficult time. France has witnessed a rise in Islamophobic and antisemitic attacks in recent months and the far right has been quick to make political capital out of the tragedy. The Front National attacked the government for doing ‚Äúnothing‚Äù to combat fundamentalist Islam and warned that the country was at risk because of an ‚Äúimmigration invasion‚Äù. It was difficult to square such alarmism with the scene in Lyon yesterday. In the baking sunshine, people enjoyed long lunches. The parks were full of children laughing. And yet the city‚Äôs residents know they must ask themselves how, just the day before, a man from one of their suburbs came to decapitate another human being before turning himself into a human bomb. In a Turkish restaurant on the Rue Pailleron, Jacques sipped a coffee. He was 63 and has lived in Lyon most of his life. Was he concerned by what was happening? He shook his head and repeated what many politicians had said in the previous 24 hours: ‚ÄúWe must not give way to fear.‚Äù He repeated the phrase several times, rapping his knuckles on the table for emphasis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-27T23:04:02Z,world,World news,"Pope Francis: he‚Äôs far from perfect, but he is changing things for the better | The big issue","I am certainly not a Catholic apologist in any regard and I agree with many of Nick Cohen‚Äôs points but, as an avowed atheist, he‚Äôs working from a different paradigm to people of faith. He is therefore ill-equipped to make sense of absolutely real convictions that are built on something other than deductive reasoning (‚ÄúA liberal, free-thinking pope? Don‚Äôt kid yourself‚Äù, Comment. In contrast, my terms of reference are as a Bible-believing follower of Jesus Christ who, in his life, death and resurrection provided us with all the instruction and example we need to live a life of radical love within the enveloping perfection of God‚Äôs will and purpose. A cracking example of this dogma-free, open-hearted faith is in Tobias Jones‚Äôs book extract in the same edition of the paper (New Review). Whether or not Catholicism‚Äôs stance on birth control is wholly or partially founded on divine displeasure incurred by the Old Testament character Onan I neither know nor particularly care; it prefers human-generated dogma over the love and compassion exemplified by Jesus and is therefore, in my view, A Very Bad Thing. If that is the policy‚Äôs origin, it seems to me that those who designed it assumed, for whatever reason, that Onan‚Äôs transgression lay in his use of rudimentary birth control. I think it much more likely that the problem was his disobedience in refusing to provide an heir to his dead brother. The pope may be imperfect ‚Äì who isn‚Äôt? ‚Äì but credit where it‚Äôs due. In eschewing many of the excessive trappings of office and in initiating reforms and accepting corporate responsibility for wicked abuses that first happened and then went unpunished, Francis has boldly gone where lesser men have quailed so to do. The mere fact that he has ruffled so many feathers within the Catholic church is a sure sign that this pope is doing many things right and deserves the encouragement of us all, believers or not. Peter Stevens Newton Abbot, Devon Nick Cohen‚Äôs article on Catholic dogma and the environment had me drooling. And yet‚Ä¶ In making a huge point, I wonder whether he has missed a massive one. As I understand it, the bondage that religious people of all types voluntarily place themselves in is that God made everything and ultimately decides everything, and even wars and natural disasters must happen for a good reason, so who are we to protest? This especially applies to people such as the pope, whose job is to remind us to bow to the almighty. So, when he starts to pronounce on the need to protect the environment, even from a dogma-based perspective,surely he is questioning whether God really knows what he is doing? If the pope really believes in what he is saying, he must be arguing for the non-existence of God, or at least suggesting that the divinity only occupies a partnership role in the universe. Colin Padgett Gestingthorpe, Essex Nick Cohen seems to have tired of praising the pope a little too soon. Francis made the valid point that each rich person bears a greater responsibility for global warming than a poor person (the scientific jargon is ‚Äúhas a larger carbon footprint‚Äù), but that‚Äôs where Cohen lost him. The conclusion Francis draws is that the rich should reduce their carbon footprint, not that the poor should be shut out of Europe. After all, this is the pope who visited Lampedusa to give what help and comfort he could to boat people. Cohen seems to treat the average western European‚Äôs carbon footprint as a constant that cannot be challenged. The pope challenges it because he starts from a more reliable constant, the carrying capacity of the Earth and Gandhi‚Äôs dictum that ‚Äúthe Earth has enough to satisfy man‚Äôs need, but not his greed‚Äù. So, he argues, it is more important and more effective to reduce the carbon footprint of rich Europeans than that of poor Africans.

2015-06-27T23:04:02Z,world,World news,"The migrant crisis, Islamist terrorism, Grexit and Brexit: a perfect storm of crises blows apart European unity","The time was shortly after 3am when David Cameron descended from level 80 of the vast Justus Lipsius building in Brussels on Friday. The birds were singing as he was whisked away for a much-curtailed sleep at the British ambassador‚Äôs residence, five minutes up the road. The prime minister is no novice when it comes to long and tedious discussions at European summits. But what he had just witnessed over a seemingly never-ending dinner with the other 27 EU leaders was something different altogether. The immediate crisis under discussion was migration and what the EU should do to handle the many thousands who have crossed the Mediterranean from Africa and the Middle East and arrived via Italy and the western Balkans over recent months. Increasingly, Europe is a magnet for those seeking a better life. But the EU does not know how to react and the problems are spreading. Last week a strike by French workers at Calais caused huge tailbacks on motorways leading to both the ferry port and Channel tunnel as hundreds of migrants ‚Äì mainly from east Africa, the Middle East and Afghanistan ‚Äì tried to take advantage of queueing traffic by breaking into lorries bound for the UK. Against this background, a supposedly cordial working dinner, held high in the Council of Ministers building, rapidly descended into personal insults and finger-jabbing ‚Äì which an exhausted-looking Cameron later summed up as ‚Äúlengthy and, at times, heated discussions‚Äù. Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister, was incensed by the refusal of several countries, including Hungary, which has taken in 60,000 refugees since the beginning of the year, and the Czech Republic, to agree to take part in a compulsory refugee-sharing scheme to help ease Italy‚Äôs burden. Cameron kept fairly quiet. The UK has opted out of EU asylum policy and Renzi, who was in an emotional state, did not need to be reminded of its non-participation. But others took up the cudgels as the row intensified across the table. Dalia Grybauskaite, the Lithuanian president, told Renzi in no uncertain terms that her country would not take part either. Bulgaria, one of the EU‚Äôs poorest countries, took a similar line. Disputes flared. European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, prime mover behind the idea of compulsory burden sharing, and council president Donald Tusk tore strips off each other over what should be done, as inter-institutional solidarity broke down.
Angela Merkel said that the migration challenge was the most serious and difficult she had encountered in the EU during her time as German chancellor (Greece is also somewhat on her mind) as Renzi railed against fellow leaders for betraying the EU‚Äôs values. A voluntary scheme was all that was agreed. ‚ÄúDo as you like,‚Äù Renzi protested. ‚ÄúIf this is your idea of Europe, keep it for yourself ‚Ä¶ you do not deserve to call yourself Europe. Either we have solidarity or we waste our time!‚Äù Solidarity is indeed needed these days in a 28-nation EU that is creaking, not just under the weight of one crisis but several. Greece has been on the brink of defaulting on a payment to the IMF for weeks, placing its future in the euro and the EU in grave doubt, and is now heading for a defining referendum next weekend which could truly lead to Grexit. Meanwhile the UK is heading towards its own in/out referendum, also causing anxiety across European capitals. Nerves and tempers are fraying, as the migrants pour in. The EU is used to expanding its borders, and deepening ties, not losing members and limiting its role. Those from outside who regard their mission as to expose the EU as an unnatural political-cum-economic marriage of nations unsuited to union sense their moment. In a dapper blue suit, Ukip leader Nigel Farage was prowling around the Brussels summit on Friday, declaring that the ‚Äútriple crisis‚Äù was the beginning of the end for the EU, the moment it would be shown to have over-reached itself ‚Äì when the poorer south would fracture from the wealthier north, when the consequences of open borders would divide members, and all would begin to implode. It was already happening with Greece. ‚ÄúI always said the euro would take 10 years to self-destruct and it is happening,‚Äù he said. Greece‚Äôs problems haunted two days of talks. Meetings of heads of government and emergency gatherings of finance ministers and senior officials were called on and off in rapid succession, as a result of lack of progress but in full knowledge that a deal had to be done within days to avoid the first loss of a euro member and possible Grexit from the EU. All wrestled with how to reach a compromise with a leftwing government led by the combative Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras. Greece has to transfer ‚Ç¨1.54bn to the IMF by Tuesday, to unlock more bailout funds from Brussels. Without the money, Athens can‚Äôt afford to pay up and may be forced out of the single currency that was supposed to be the glue that bound Europe‚Äôs inner core of true believers together in perpetuity.
Diplomats oscillated between rushes of optimism that Tsipras might give ground and accept more reform at home, including cuts to Greek pensions and a growing realisation that, in his Syriza movement, there are forces that might never bow to austere demands from distant Brussels authorities for fiscal discipline, whatever the price for Greece. As one EU official put it on Friday: ‚ÄúWe simply can‚Äôt second-guess them any more. We thought they would do a deal when it came to it ‚Ä¶ There are some who think it may be best to let them go.‚Äù Yesterday, ahead of the latest ‚Äúemergency‚Äù meeting of finance ministers, there was more talk about a plan B for Greece (what to do to prevent a Greek default from causing economic contagion across the EU) than the endlessly discussed plan A (how to stitch a compromise together). Among diplomats there was a growing view that, if the wider damage to Europe could be contained, perhaps the EU was better off saying goodbye to Tsipras and Greece, than in spending endless time and money attempting to force a square peg into a round hole. As for the ‚ÄúBritish problem‚Äù, it hardly raised its head during this summit. It was one crisis too many, and not the most pressing. That may not bode well for Cameron‚Äôs attempts to achieve a renegotiation of British membership before he holds an in/out referendum either next year or in 2017. The last thing EU leaders wanted was to spend precious time nit-picking over UK demands to amend treaties and change rules on founding principles, such as the freedom of movement of workers, which few will entertain anyway. Cameron had billed the meeting as the moment when he would launch his plans for reform and focus minds on the fact that the UK means business. The original plan was that he would be given time at the start of the dinner meeting to lay out his stall in some style. As it was, they managed to squeeze him in for five minutes at 11pm ‚Äì between their arguments over migration. Cameron said people in the UK were unhappy with the EU, but avoided much detail. One official said it was a welcome intermission which allowed people a little time to ‚Äúredraft the conclusions on migration‚Äù ‚Äì suggesting minds were not entirely on what the prime minister had to say. Eight pages of summit conclusions on other matters ended with a fourth item of fewer than two lines, entitled just ‚ÄúUK‚Äù. It read: ‚ÄúThe UK prime minister set out his plans for an in/out referendum in the UK. The European Council agreed to revert to the matter in December.‚Äù It is not that other EU leaders do not want to help Cameron, but more that they have not got much time or energy to do so. Talks will now grind on at official level for months over UK demands to curb welfare payments for EU migrants, demands to opt out of ‚Äúever-closer union‚Äù, demands to give more powers to national parliaments to block EU laws, and demands to ensure that what goes on inside the eurozone does not compromise the interests of those outside. At this summit Cameron‚Äôs tone was different, less truculent. No doubt he realised that this was not the moment for UK grandstanding. He also seems to have accepted the need to build alliances, and that winning treaty changes in the EU for Britain requires a subtler, friendlier approach than when he came to Brussels to block things. This time he is the ‚Äúdemandeur‚Äù in the relationship, not the blocker. At his press conference after the summit, Cameron did something he has refused to do recently at home. He said clearly that he would prefer the UK to stay in the EU. ‚ÄúI believe it is beneficial for Britain,‚Äù he said, abandoning recent neutrality on the matter. A diplomatic memo leaked to the Guardian showed he had made a similar point to EU leaders. Cameron opened his concluding press conference with a long, strong statement on the appalling terrorist attacks in Tunisia, France and Kuwait, stressing the need for global solidarity and cooperation to hunt terrorists and enhance security. Again, preaching about the national interest at such a moment would have seemed out of tune. With the EU so preoccupied, there were signs that Cameron may also now be soft-pedalling on his more controversial demands for treaty change, particularly the idea of banning EU migrant workers from claiming social benefits, such as tax credits or child benefit, for four years. There was no mention of this specifically in his short talk at dinner, something that did not escape the notice of those who listened. It was whisked over in very general comments about reform as if it were just too incendiary to touch. The ‚ÄúBritish problem‚Äù as a whole was not of the moment. But, at some point soon, it will come to a head. If Cameron fails to achieve much more than the status quo ‚Äì which may be the case ‚Äì it will not escape the notice of Eurosceptics at home who will say it proves that the EU can never change and shows, therefore, that Britain should leave. EU leaders say they will do their best for Cameron, but not if he overplays his hand and refuses to speak up about the benefits of Europe. As the EU‚Äôs crises multiply, and migration and terrorism threaten, there may be ill temper, tension and division at Europe‚Äôs core but there is an underlying determination to hold together. They talk differently now about losing the non-believers. ‚ÄúWe know the British debate,‚Äù said one EU diplomat discussing the referendum. ‚ÄúWe really have to help where we can because the UK is important ‚Äì but, in a way, it is like Greece: we cannot do so if the price is too high, and not if it means Europe cannot function as we want in the world.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-27T22:25:40Z,world,World news,Gulf states share shock of terror attack on mosque in Kuwait,"The aftermath of the attack on a Shia mosque in Kuwait has resonated well beyond its borders into neighbouring Gulf countries, which have long shared both its worldview and its fears that Islamic State is stalking them. On Saturday, Kuwaiti officials announced arrests linked to the Friday blast at the Imam al-Sadiq mosque, which killed 27 and maimed 200 more, as security at places of worship from Sharjah to Doha was tightened and rhetoric against the group intensified across the region. Officials in Kuwait had long said an attack of the type carried out during Friday prayers would be very difficult to stop. The fact that it took place in the holy month of Ramadan, when worshippers were likely to be less on their guard than usual, made it even more so. Isis had made no secret of its intentions to launch attacks during Ramadan, with its spokesman, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, releasing a speech earlier last week calling for strikes in the remaining three weeks of the fasting month, which would lead to greater blessings in the afterlife. Kuwait is home to one of the largest Shia minorities in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and has often been named by Isis leaders as a ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù target. Shias have been the most prominent foe of Isis throughout the past three years of the group‚Äôs latest incarnation and during the decade prior to that, following the ousting of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, whose demise led to a loss of influence among the country‚Äôs Sunnis. However, in the eyes of Isis, Kuwait‚Äôs sins go further than harbouring Shias; the desert state maintained one of the largest US military bases in the world throughout the occupation of Iraq and has been a supporter of the air campaign launched last August against the terror group, even though it had not contributed military forces. The UAE, Bahrain and Qatar have sent jets to bomb Isis targets in Iraq, although their contributions had begun to wane by late last year. Most had avoided publicising their involvement, with the risk of provoking some kind of backlash a central consideration. The GCC views Isis as an existential threat to its members and is especially fearful of Isis being seen as a vehicle to advance political aims if states are unable to do so. Since 2013, Isis has used the area it controls in Iraq and Syria to consolidate a foothold in the Middle East and train militants sent back to their home countries to wreak havoc. Up to 800 Kuwaitis are thought to have travelled to join Isis, and several hundred are believed to have returned. It is not yet known whether Friday‚Äôs suicide bomber was a returned fighter, a homegrown local or a member of the group from elsewhere. However, Isis is making much play of producing battle-hardened ideologues who will transplant the virulent ideology it espouses into other parts of the Middle East and north Africa. It already has active followers in Egypt, Yemen, Libya and Tunisia, all of whom have sworn allegiance to the Isis leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and has been trying to gain momentum in the Gulf states. Of all the Gulf autocracies, Kuwait is considered to have one of the most efficient security structures. The UAE, though, is considered more formidable. Its rulers have feared a threat from political Islam, a stance that has placed them at odds with Qatar, which supports the Muslim Brotherhood across the region. The common threat from Isis has, however, led them to set differences aside and present a united front against precisely the co-ordinated three-continent spectacular carried out on Friday. The tight timing of the strikes and their geographical spread make it highly likely they were centrally choreographed ‚Äì something the organisation has not been able to do until now. ‚ÄúThey are planning something big,‚Äù a source close to Isis warned the Observer last week. ‚ÄúThey now have capabilities that they didn‚Äôt have six months ago and they are determined to show you.‚Äù The source said that, while the US-led airstrikes had killed several dozen leaders and made communication between cells more difficult, they had not stopped Isis from securing strategic ground and were acting as a rallying call for fighters around the region. ‚ÄúThey like using the message that Muslims are under attack from the Americans again. It helps them recruit people.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-27T22:06:05Z,world,World news,Tsipras‚Äôs shock call for vote on Greek bailout sets day of destiny for Europe,"Five years of wrenching austerity that have left many Greeks traumatised and pauperised are about to get a lot worse. Creditor governments meeting in Brussels on Saturday night pledged to halt Greece‚Äôs bailout on Tuesday after the leftwing government abandoned five months of negotiations with its European lenders and called a referendum that may propel the country out of the euro. The decision to end the bailout on Tuesday was taken by 18 countries, with only Greece dissenting. Its delegate, Yanis Varoufakis, the finance minister, then left the session which focused on damage limitation and preventing Greek financial turmoil from spreading to other vulnerable parts of the eurozone. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a sad day,‚Äù said ministers from across the continent as Europe braced itself for more turbulence and leaders started shifting to avoid the blame for the debacle. The climax to 10 days of fraught bargaining in Brussels and Luxembourg was the decision by Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, to call a plebiscite on the terms of Greece‚Äôs bailout, stunning the other eurozone governments. ‚ÄúI am very negatively surprised,‚Äù said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch chair of the committee of eurozone finance ministers. ‚ÄúThe situation [in Greece] will deteriorate very rapidly ‚Ä¶ How the Greek government will survive, I do not know.‚Äù The committee has been in quasi-permanent session for the past week, as proposals and counter-proposals bounced back and forth between the two sides in a war of propaganda and what eurocrats have taken to calling ‚Äúpaperology‚Äù. The finale came on Friday with a last offer from the creditors ‚Äì the European commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund ‚Äì which represented a take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum, revamping the pensions system, creating a new VAT regime, slashing the defence budget, and cutting proposed taxes on business in return for a five-month bailout extension worth ‚Ç¨15.5bn (¬£11bn).
Financial experts from both sides were still negotiating in Brussels late on Friday when the call came through from Athens ordering them to quit, Dijsselbloem said. Tsipras then went on television to announce the plebiscite. The creditors‚Äô ultimatum would have solved little, but it would have kept Greece in the euro at least until Christmas, giving both sides a chance to cool off, build trust and buy time all round. Tsipras‚Äôs referendum gamble upended all that. He promised to heed the outcome of the popular vote on 5 July, but then made clear to the Greek electorate where he personally stood. ‚ÄúI call on you to decide whether we should accept the extortionate ultimatum that calls for strict and humiliating austerity without end, and without the prospect of ever standing on our own two feet, socially and financially,‚Äù he thundered. ‚ÄúWe never considered giving in ‚Ä¶ These proposals prove that certain partners are not interested in reaching a viable and beneficial agreement for all parties, but rather the humiliation of the Greek people.‚Äù The decision and the manner in which it was delivered caught his negotiating partners off guard, not least as it came within hours of Tsipras‚Äôs return from a Brussels summit of EU leaders on Friday, where he had private talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel and President Hollande of France. At their post-summit press conferences, neither of the two sent any signals of the bombshell from Athens. Neither did summit chair Donald Tusk.
Some eurozone ministers called Tsipras‚Äôs decision ‚Äúbizarre‚Äù and said they were mystified about what he was trying to do. ‚ÄúThe question of Greece‚Äôs eurozone membership has been officially opened,‚Äù said a Deutsche Bank analyst. The negotiations that have been taking place since Tsipras‚Äôs leftwing Syriza movement won national elections in January have resembled trench warfare for months and, in recent weeks, have degenerated into a slanging match. The referendum is to answer the question as to whether the Greeks accept more creditor-imposed austerity as the price of staying in the euro. This raises many more questions than it answers. If the people vote yes when Tsipras has absolutely rejected the terms and advised voters to follow him, it would appear that he would have to resign. If he stayed in office with a yes verdict behind him, there would be zero confidence on the other side of the table, especially among the Germans, in negotiating with him. ‚ÄúThere are concerns of credibility,‚Äù said Dijsselbloem. There would also be no trust in Tsipras committing to a deal and implementing it. And it is not even clear whether what the Greeks are to vote on will still exist in a fortnight, since the bailout lapses on Tuesday. The Greeks could be delivering an answer to a phantom question. But the legal and procedural problems proliferate. Without bailout funds, Greece is heading for a major default next month, when it has to redeem more than ‚Ç¨3 bn of bonds with the ECB. But there is no legal provision for ejecting a country from the euro. Indeed, all EU members, except those like Britain with an opt-out, are obliged to join the euro. Many people, such as Martin Schulz, the president of the European parliament, believe that exiting the euro means leaving the EU altogether. The Eurozone finance ministers rejected Tsipras‚Äôs demand to extend the bailout until after the referendum and then sent Varoufakis out of the room while they proceeded with talks about how to deal with a Greek financial collapse and prevent the panic spreading to other parts of the single-currency bloc. Varoufakis‚Äôs spokesman said the referendum decision meant an end to ‚Äúfive years of waterboarding‚Äù. Alex Stubb, the Finnish finance minister, said a large majority on the committee of finance ministers was against extending the Greek rescue beyond Tuesday. The ministers sounded surprised by the referendum decision and voiced feelings of betrayal by Tsipras. In the marathon negotiations of the past 10 days, some complained the Greek officials had not told them of the referendum call and that now it was too late to do anything about it.
But the impact of a Greek collapse will impact deeply politically and economically on the rest of Europe, sparking recrimination over the conduct of five years of austerity and bailouts that, in the Greek case at least, have failed. Greece owes ‚Ç¨320bn, most of it to eurozone governments, and a full default will prove expensive for the others, not least Germany, which has ‚Ç¨92bn at stake. As the Greek parliament prepared to vote on staging the country‚Äôs first referendum in 40 years, eurozone finance ministers agonised over their so-called plan B ‚Äì how to quarantine Greece inside the eurozone‚Äôs financial system in an exercise in damage limitation. Whether capital controls would be imposed was up to the Greek authorities, said Stubb. ‚ÄúThis is a choice the Greek government has made. I‚Äôm quite sad about it.‚Äù On Tuesday, Athens also has to repay ‚Ç¨1.6m to the IMF. Without a rescue package in place, it is not clear where the money is coming from. THE DEAL Greece‚Äôs international creditors want to strike a deal to stop Athens defaulting on its debt and possibly tumbling out of the euro by extending its bailout by six months and supplying up to ‚Ç¨18bn (¬£12.9bn) in rescue funds. The negotiators representing Greece‚Äôs lenders are also proposing to pledge debt relief, though it would come with strings attached and not as part of the current bailout package. The creditors ‚Äì the European commission, the International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank ‚Äì want Athens to impose higher rates of VAT on areas that were previously given discounted rates and to accelerate pension reforms as the price of fresh loans and the possibility of debt relief. The purpose is to generate a 1% budget surplus that allows Athens to repay its debts while funding public services and welfare payments. The six-month rescue extension being mooted would see Greece qualify for ‚Ç¨7.2bn in bailout funds still to be disbursed as well as ‚Ç¨10.9bn already lent to the country but earmarked for recapitalisation of its weakened banks. The latter sum could be quickly transferred to the government to facilitate debt repayments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-27T21:14:15Z,world,World news,Irish couple confirmed dead after Tunisia beach attack,"A family in Ireland has been informed by police in the Republic that their parents are among the 39 dead in the Tunisian terror massacre. The Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin has been in contact with the loved ones of the husband and wife from Co Westmeath in the Irish Midlands, it was confirmed on Saturday night. The couple have been named locally as Laurence (Larry) and Martina Hayes. Irish foreign minister Charlie Flanagan said: ‚ÄúThe process of full and formal identification of victims is continuing in Tunis, and will take a period of time before it is completed. The Irish ambassador and consul are on the ground in Tunisia, working closely with the Tunisian authorities.‚Äù The minister is now advising Irish tourists to exercise caution if travelling to Tunisia. Flanagan said: ‚ÄúMy department‚Äôs travel advice for Tunisia, which was changed in the light of the attack, is to exercise extreme caution. While the Tunisian authorities have declared this incident to be over, we would urge Irish citizens in Tunisia to remain vigilant and to follow any instructions given by the police, tour operator, and hotel staff. ‚ÄúThose wishing to contact my department‚Äôs consular support service can continue to do so throughout the rest of the weekend by calling the main telephone line 01 4082000. ‚ÄúI have condemned in the strongest terms these terrorist attacks. I would like to offer my sincere condolences to the families of all the deceased. ‚ÄúThe ambassador of Ireland accredited to Tunisia, David Cooney, also met EU counterparts in Tunis today to review the situation on the ground. The embassy team will keep me and the government updated through the days ahead.‚Äù Thee family of Lorna Carty, the first Irish citizen confirmed to have been murdered in the atrocity in the resort of Sousse, are said to be distraught over her death. Thee mother of two was on the beach when the gunman opened fire. The Carty family are stalwarts of their local Gaelic sports club in Robinstown, Co Meath. A spokesman for the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in Meath said all matches and training between local clubs Dunderry and Kilmessan had been suspended until further notice as a mark of respect to the Carty family. The murdered woman‚Äôs son, Simon, was on the senior panel for Meath Gaelic football squad and played for the county at Under-21 level. He is a science student at University College Dublin, the same institution where several of the students killed in the Berkeley balcony tragedy also attended.

2015-06-27T20:00:24Z,world,World news,Tunisia beach attack killer‚Äôs stunned neighbours blame ‚Äòbrainwashing‚Äô,"On Thursday evening the gunman who would mow down more than 30 unarmed tourists in a luxury hotel went as usual to prayers at his mosque and walked down the streets greeting people he knew. Neighbours of the family in the Hay Zuhour neighbourhood of the small town of Gaafour in the Siliana region of north Tunisia, said they were still trying to work out how Seifeddine Rezgui, a student at Kairouan university could have done such a thing. A tweet from the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack and gave his jihadi pseudonym of Abu Yahya al-Qayrawani, which referred to the town, an ancient centre of Islamic learning, where he was studying for his degree, according to the Site intelligence group. He had taken out a Tunisian passport in 2013, but had never used it, an official said. ‚ÄúHe was good, good, good!‚Äù said a neighbour and family friend, Monia Riahi, 50, standing with her daughters at the entrance to her house. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve known him since he was small. He was never in trouble with anyone ever. Maybe he was brainwashed or something.‚Äù She added how sorry she was for the dead. Rezgui‚Äôs father, a day labourer, earns less than ¬£10 a day working on farms or the nearby railway line. He has been taken to the Tunisian capital for questioning by the police, along with his mother. Rezgui was reportedly laughing and joking as he set about his murderous attack, and new pictures showed him wandering casually along the beach in shorts and a T-shirt, assault rifle in hands, as he began the killing spree. ‚ÄúI think maybe, just maybe, it was poverty that did it,‚Äù said neighbour Ammar Fazai, 64. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs that old saying: ‚ÄòIf poverty was a man, I would kill him.‚Äô And maybe, like the lady said, they washed his brain and eliminated all the kindness from it.‚Äù Fazai explained that until the zinc and lead mines not far from the town closed in 1993, there was ample work, but unemployment in the area is now high, especially among the young. The Rezgui family also endured tragedy when a brother a year younger than Seifeddine was killed by a lightning strike aged 14 while out in the fields. Two other young siblings are currently staying with relatives while their parents are in Tunis. Local people in the town say that there are many Salafists living there, following a hardline interpretation of Islam and based at the mosque that Rezgui attended daily. But one of the Salafist imams from the town denied that the group would ever incite young men to commit a massacre like Friday‚Äôs attack. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm as totally at a loss to explain this as everyone else. This is not the kind of Islam we preach here at all,‚Äù said the imam of one mosque in town, a middle-aged man who declined to give his name. He believed that the gunman must have been influenced by a far more radical strain of teaching, he added. Confirming the gunman‚Äôs identity, Tunisian prime minister Habib Essid said that Rezgui, 23, was not ‚Äúknown to the security services‚Äù. The region of Siliana is not known for the presence of armed Islamist groups. However, over the past two and a half years the similarly impoverished regions of Kef and Kasserine to its west and south-west have seen ambushes, clashes and other incidents between armed Islamist groups and, attempting to tackle them, the Tunisian army and national guard. Both Kef and Kasserine share long borders with Algeria, where armed groups remaining after the internecine conflict of the 1990s continue to be sporadically active, not far from the mountainous border with Algeria. The Siliana region has no border with Algeria One such group was said by authorities to be behind the attack on Tunis‚Äôs Bardo museum in March, when 22 people, most of them European tourists, were killed and around 50 others were injured. The local produce includes peaches, apricots and melons, all now in season, which sold at roadside stalls. Throughout the summer, the landscape is arid as families in modest homes try to get by on frugal diets, a world away from the western tourist resorts an hour‚Äôs drive away. Recruits from poor towns flock to Islamic State. Up to 3,000 are now fighting with them in Iraq, Syria and latterly Libya, where there have been a string of Tunisian suicide bombers. Military sweeps in the southern mountains saw victories against pockets of jihadists and the killing of Algerian high-profile militant Lokman Abou Sakhr, a reminder that militants do not recognise national borders in their battle to create a caliphate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-27T19:40:24Z,world,World news,EU ministers refuse bailout extension for Greece as referendum looms,"Europe‚Äôs single currency entered the stage of rupture for the first time in its 16-year life on Saturday night when 18 governments told Greece its bailout package would be terminated within days. The country plunged towards financial collapse after its leftwing prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, abandoned negotiations and called a referendum on his lenders‚Äô terms for continuing the lifeline. An emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers took place in Brussels on Saturday evening without Greece for the first time since the crisis began in 2010. It turned into a crisis planning session devoted to quarantining Greece and insulating the rest of the eurozone from the impact of anticipated financial mayhem.
The weekend‚Äôs events threw Europe into weeks of confusion and turbulence as 10 days of intense last-ditch attempts to salvage an agreement between Greece and its creditors collapsed. Tsipras accused the country‚Äôs creditors of a vengeful act of humiliation against Greece and urged voters to follow him in rejecting the terms imposing more austerity in return for cash in the plebiscite on 5 July. Early on Sunday morning, the parliament in Athens voted in favour of holding the referendum. The finance ministers refused to extend Greece‚Äôs bailout beyond Tuesday, hastening the likelihood of Greece‚Äôs ejection from the euro. Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, refused to endorse the collective statement and left the meeting. Tsipras‚Äôs gamble, following an EU summit in Brussels on Friday, leaves Europe‚Äôs leaders, notably Angela Merkel of Germany and Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, with a stark dilemma ‚Äì whether to let Greece sink or swim. It was unclear whether the expiry of the bailout on Tuesday also meant that emergency financial assistance which is keeping Greece afloat would continue. The governing board of the European Central Bank will have to decide this. Without a bailout in place, it will be difficult for Draghi to continue supplying Greece with billions in liquidity assistance, funds that are currently keeping the country from default. Over the next 48 hours Draghi faces the biggest decision he has ever had to take. The powerful central banker who pledged in 2012 to do whatever it takes to save the euro has to decide whether he will and can save Greece, or at least keep it alive until after the popular vote. Draghi‚Äôs and Merkel‚Äôs decisions will have grave consequences for Greece which is staring into the abyss of defaulting on its colossal debts and being ejected from the euro, but will also have major impact on the single currency‚Äôs health and stability. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going into totally uncharted waters,‚Äù said Michael Noonan, the Irish finance minister. Saturday night‚Äôs eurogroup meeting said the governments ‚Äústand ready to do whatever is necessary to ensure financial stability of the euro area‚Äù. Their meeting was the fifth to be held in 10 days. The decision to end the bailout, shunning the Greek requests to extend the rescue until after the national referendum, means that Greece is likely to go bust. ‚ÄúGreece ended the negotiations unilaterally. There is no basis for further negotiations,‚Äù said Wolfgang Sch√§uble, the hawkish German finance minister. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see any possibility for doing anything. On Tuesday the programme ends.‚Äù
Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chaired the meeting in Brussels, said with his referendum decision Tsipras had ‚Äúclosed the door‚Äù for talks with the creditors. The ECB has been providing life support to Greece for months by supplying billions in liquidity to the Greek banks. If Draghi pulls the plug, he could be held responsible for potential riots on the streets of Athens and national unrest. If he keeps the funding channels open, he will be accused of acting illegally and overstepping his mandate by financing a eurozone government.
Dijsselbloem declined to say whether so-called emergency liquidity assistance could continue without a bailout programme in place. The ECB‚Äôs governing council would need to take that decision. Alex Stubb, the Finnish finance minister, said a large majority on the committee of finance ministers was against extending the Greek rescue beyond Tuesday. The ministers were surprised by the referendum decision and voiced feelings of betrayal by Tsipras. In the marathon negotiations of the past 10 days, some of them complained, the Greek officials and ministers had not told them of the referendum plan. Whether capital controls would be imposed was up to the Greek authorities, said Stubb: ‚ÄúThis is a choice the Greek government has made. I‚Äôm quite sad about it.‚Äù The impact of a Greek collapse will have a deep political and economic impact on the rest of Europe, causing recriminations over the conduct of five years of austerity and bailouts which, in the Greek case at least, have failed. ‚ÄúThis is about our destiny,‚Äù said Peter Ka≈æim√≠r, the Slovak minister. Greece owes ‚Ç¨320bn, most of it to eurozone governments, and a full default will prove very expensive for the others, not least Germany which has ‚Ç¨92bn at stake.
As the Greek parliament prepared to vote on staging the country‚Äôs first referendum in 40 years, Greeks raided ATMs and hoarded euros at home anticipating bank closures, the imposition of capital controls, and the blocking of savings accounts. Such actions appear inevitable if Draghi cuts off funds to Greece. On Friday Tsipras robustly rejected the creditors‚Äô terms for extending the bailout until the end of November, bitterly accusing the Europeans and the International Monetary Fund of deliberately seeking to humiliate Greece. On Saturday he refused to back down. He spoke by phone to Merkel and the French president, Fran√ßois Hollande, insisting that his referendum would happen. ‚ÄúIt will take place regardless of the eurogroup decision,‚Äù he was reported to have told Merkel and Hollande. Athens also has to repay ‚Ç¨1.6bn to the IMF on Tuesday. Without a rescue package in place, it is not clear where the money is coming from.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-27T19:40:23Z,world,World news,British travellers condemn ‚Äòrudeness‚Äô of Foreign Office in wake of Tunisia attack,"Survivors of the Tunisian massacre have criticised the initial Foreign Office response to the tragedy, with one describing its approach as ‚Äúrude and ignorant‚Äù. Witnesses described being left for hours in the aftermath of the shootings without information, while others said consular officials were slow to reach the scene of the slaughter, claiming that journalists had arrived at the site before them. Conor Fulford, from Tamworth, Staffordshire, said that in the chaos of the shootings, as he tried to find news of his mother, Sue Davey, the Foreign Office was so dismissive it left him dumbfounded. Fulford said: ‚ÄúThey just said if they find any leads then they will let us know. I‚Äôm at a loss for words at the minute. It just comes across as rude and ignorant. They just don‚Äôt want to talk to anyone. It‚Äôs unbelievable.‚Äù Journalists arriving from the capital Tunis at the hotel in mid-afternoon on Friday ‚Äì the shootings unfolded shortly before midday ‚Äì found survivors milling around, uncertain what to do, and asking reporters for information. Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood said he had spent much of Saturday on the phone with victims and families caught up in the ‚Äúappalling attack‚Äù, adding that the Foreign Office was currently reviewing travel advice to the north African country. A second team of Foreign Office officials has flown out to help survivors. Other residents criticised tour operator Thomson‚Äôs response to the tragedy, saying that its office, close to the main entrance to the hotel Riu Imperial Maharba, one of the hotels involved in the shootings, had its door open but was deserted. Witnesses also described survivors sitting in groups at tables in the atrium, some crying and asking people about the fate of missing loved ones. On the terrace, tourists ‚Äì some still in their swimsuits ‚Äì sat around being served drinks by equally distressed staff. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve not seen anyone from Thomson: I don‚Äôt know where they are,‚Äù said one Scottish tourist, who asked not to be named, on Friday night. As journalists arrived, some asked if there was any information on what they should do, or whether they could leave the hotel Concerns among survivors mounted when a team from the Belgian embassy, clad in day-glo jackets bearing their national flag, showed up. The Belgian officials fanned around around the foyer checking the welfare of their few nationals and briefing them on evacuation plans as British tourists waited for their consular officials to arrive. Survivor Glenn Whitehead had been concerned about security in Tunisia following the massacre of tourists in March at the Bardo museum in Tunis, so he contacted Thomson on the eve of his holiday and claims he was assured that security was fine. Whitehead‚Äôs concerns meant that he and and his wife Anita decided not to leave the hotel to visit Sousse town during their holiday, believing the hotel was well guarded. Anita said: ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt seen anyone from Thomson. We‚Äôve not been told anything.‚Äù She said they had stayed at the hotel the year before, and were comforted then by the sight of daily patrols by police on horseback along the beach. Yet this year, she said, she saw the patrol only once, shortly before the gunman struck. Despite being the premier location in Sousse, the Marhaba had no armed police or security staff, effectively allowing the gunman to roam the beach and the hotel shooting people at will. Security forces took more than half an hour to arrive. One Thomson official at the hotel, who did not want to be named, said: ‚ÄúThe terrorists knew exactly what they were doing. This is the top hotel here. They knew the effect it would have.‚Äù Later on Friday, Thomson officials in blue T-shirts arrived and began to take names of tourists, drafting in personnel from other hotels. A statement from Thomson said: ‚ÄúWe worked swiftly with the teams in the resort to establish the circumstances. Customer safety was our absolute priority. Staff worked incredibly hard in a very challenging environment. Ten Thomson Airways flights travelled to Tunisia to repatriate approximately 1,000 Thomson and First Choice customers; this all happened as quickly as possible.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ This article was amended on Sunday 28 June 2015.

2015-06-27T19:37:42Z,world,World news,"London Pride parade draws thousands, day after US supreme court ruling","Tens of thousands of people, many decked in the colours of the rainbow, took to London‚Äôs streets on Saturday to celebrate the annual Pride parade just a day after gay marriage was ruled to be legal across the US. To mark the historic judgment, which ensures that the 14 states with bans on same-sex marriage cannot enforce them, the United States flag joined those of Ireland and Mozambique at the front of the march in recognition of the progress recently in recognising gay rights in all three countries. More than 250 groups were represented at the parade which ended in Whitehall. There was additional security after Friday‚Äôs terrorist attacks in France, Tunisia and Kuwait, with the Met‚Äôs deputy assistant commissioner, Helen Ball, saying the force would lay on extra security ‚Äúto help protect and reassure the public‚Äù and to make sure ‚Äúthe public are encouraged to continue with their plans to attend or take part in events as normal‚Äù.
Ruth Hunt, chief executive of Stonewall, said Pride was ‚Äúa wonderful event that celebrates LGBT equality and how far we‚Äôve come‚Äù, adding: ‚ÄúHowever, we must not lose sight of how much is left to do.
‚ÄúThe number of reported LGBT hate crimes is on the rise across the UK, our government must address trans-law reform, LGBT people are still being bullied in school and isolated at work, and overseas, many Prides either take place under armed guard or not at all. In fact, it‚Äôs illegal to be gay in 75 countries and punishable by death in 10.‚Äù Organisers of the event said earlier this month that they had to ‚Äúwrestle with a difficult issue‚Äù when deciding whether or not to allow a group from Ukip‚Äôs LGBT group to enter the parade. Despite having their application rejected ‚Äúin order to protect participants and ensure the event passes off safely and in the right spirit‚Äù several reports on social media suggested that they had joined in without being challenged.
At the parade, campaigner Peter Tatchell held a sign which said: ‚ÄúNorthern Ireland! End the same-sex marriage ban. Equal Marriage.‚Äù Gay marriage is legal in Great Britain but not in Northern Ireland. Robin Windsor, former professional dancer on Strictly Come Dancing, said of the US ruling: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unbelievable that it happened the day before Pride, and it‚Äôs put everybody in such a great mood and high spirits, ready for such an amazing weekend.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-27T19:20:23Z,world,World news,Survivors reveal heroism of Sousse hotel staff as Tunisia attack unfolded,"‚ÄúI‚Äôve been doing a lot of crying,‚Äù says Christine Callaghan, pulling back the covers on her hospital bed to show a line of steel pins locked into her right leg by a red frame. She spent half an hour on Friday afternoon lying in a pool of blood, first wondering if she had lost her husband and then fearing she would lose her leg, in Tunisia‚Äôs worst ever terrorist attack. Both Callaghans survived, and are recovering a floor apart in the friendly but basic public hospital in the Tunisian city of Sousse, where doctors worked through the night to save victims mown down in the murderous noon rampage through a luxury hotel. Her husband, Tony, was preparing to limp back to his room and pack up the couple‚Äôs belongings, before returning to the hospital for an afternoon operation on a bullet wound to his leg. As the initial shock of the attack faded, tourists who survived the assault were starting to deal with the grim logistics of recovering documents and possessions from the hotel that had descended into a hell, organise medical evacuations for injured loved ones, and reassure relatives back home. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been so lucky,‚Äù said Tony Callaghan from his hospital bed, shrugging off the injuries to his arm and leg, and the afternoon‚Äôs date with a surgeon. ‚ÄúTo see what I saw, people lying dead in a corridor, two ladies in a pool of blood, a young man holding his dead fiancee‚Äôs hand.‚Äù Airports were crammed with visitors cutting short holidays because they could no longer face lying on the beach. Tour operators put on special charter flights to take home those most directly affected, but begged patience from others who might want to leave. ‚ÄúIt was surreal really, because we were running for our lives, and there were still people up in the air, over the sea, paragliding,‚Äù said Irene Craft, waiting to check in at a nearby tourist airport in the early hours of Saturday. She was two days into a fortnight break with her husband at the Bellevue hotel, which was right next to the main target of the attack. Several guests are also believed to have been killed there. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd only been there two days, but you can‚Äôt holiday when something like that happens, especially with children caught up,‚Äù she said. Tunisians were also in shock and mourning, both for the victims themselves and for the impact the attack is likely to have on a struggling country heavily dependent on tourism and already reeling from a shooting spree at a major museum earlier this year. Christine Callaghan was surrounded by flowers and clothed in a T-shirt brought by families of Tunisian patients who fussed over her, horrified by what has happened to her family in their country. ‚ÄúI have been here three years in a row, the people are so lovely. I would like to come back again,‚Äù she said, before admitting that she does not know if she can face returning. Many of the victims were repeat visitors, and rushed to praise the heroism and generosity of Tunisian staff at their hotels but, like Christine, wondered if they would be able to return. ‚ÄúThe staff were running towards the beach when we were running away. They put themselves last,‚Äù said Len, a 57-year-old plumber from Norfolk, as he waited for an evacuation flight in the early hours of Saturday with his wife. The city‚Äôs doctors also rushed to help, sending ambulances long before policemen or security forces arrived to stop the attack. Dozens of injured were taken in by clinics and hospitals across Sousse, and at least one suspended all planned surgery to throw themselves into tending the injured. ‚ÄúWe are all upset. Tunisians are not like that, we do not like violence,‚Äù said Anis Hamza, medical director of a private clinic that threw open its doors to the injured free of cost, and said they managed to save all but one of the 16 victims brought to them for treatment. ‚ÄúThis is terrible for Tunisia. We fear for our children‚Äôs future.‚Äù It was a sentiment echoed across the city, from shops and other hotel rooms to the special forces officer guarding several bodies in the aftermath of the massacre. ‚ÄúYou see what terrible things these people do?‚Äù said the despairing man, beside corpses still uncovered on sun loungers. An elderly woman had been shot in the face; an elderly man in swimming shorts who had been hit several times lay nearby. Less than 24 hours after they had been relaxing on the beach, the dead were taken to the national capital Tunis in body bags, as questions grew about why security had been so lax and why the shooting spree had gone on so long. There was at least half an hour of gunfire before security forces shot down one gunman, guests said. Another young man was arrested a few hours later some distance from the hotel; officials have not said what role he played in the attack. Tony Callaghan spent much of that time listening to his wife care for an even more severely injured friend, after patching up her shattered femur herself. ‚ÄúI knew she was OK because I could hear her comforting the lady, trying to keep her talking.‚Äù They were separated in the chaos and ended up on different sides of a barricaded office door. The pain of being just a few feet away but unable to reach her is the only thing that brings tears to his eyes in his hospital bed. The two might have escaped together and uninjured if Callaghan had not stayed to warn other guests when the first shot rang out. After 23 years in the airforce he recognised the sound of gunfire, while most tourists thought it was firecrackers laid on as part of the entertainment and milled around confused or oblivious as the gunman drew in. His delay was just one of many stories of quiet courage emerging in the wake of the attacks as survivors recounted other near-miraculous escapes, such as the tourists who put the lives of two drowning women before their own relatives‚Äô safety. They plucked 59-year-old Cheryl Ireland and her 80-year-old mother, Margaret Wolfe, from the sea, where they had fled to escape the gunmen. The two women use three sticks between them to walk and when they saw the attacker approach decided they would never make it to safety at the hotel so hobbled to the water instead. ‚ÄúHow we did it, I don‚Äôt know. Look at us, we can hardly walk,‚Äù Ireland said. But Wolfe had never learned to swim and as they sank into the waves she began to fear she might have swapped one grim fate for another, until two speed boats roared in with Tunisian captains but British tourists abroad. The men were fellow guests who had come to look for their own families, but saved the two women first, as gunshots rang out down the beach. ‚ÄúI was up to my chin in water, the boats just came up and they pulled me in,‚Äù Wolfe remembered. ‚ÄúIt was like a film.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-27T14:06:11Z,world,World news,Thousands of tourists return home after deadly Tunisia attack,"British tourists evacuated from Tunisia after a gunman killed at least 39 people at a beach resort have arrived back in the UK on special flights.
At least five Britons have been confirmed dead in the attack in Sousse. Tunisia‚Äôs prime minister, Habib Essid, told a news conference that the majority of victims were British, followed by Germans, Belgians and other nationalities. Nick Longman, the managing director of TUI UK, which owns the Thomson and First Choice travel agencies, said that some of those killed were Thomson customers. Of the 6,400 holidaymakers the company had in Tunisia, 1,000 had been flown back to the UK on Friday night and Saturday morning, and more would be returning on Saturday, he said. Peter Long, joint chief executive of TUI, said he was ‚Äúdeeply, deeply shocked‚Äù at events in Tunisia. ‚ÄúOur whole organisation is reeling with pain to see the suffering that is taking place in Tunisia with our customers. We are doing our very, very best to look after our guests who are still in Tunisia.‚Äù ABTA, which represents travel agents and tour operators, estimates there are 20,000 British holidaymakers in Tunisia, although this figure may not include those who have travelled independently.
The first six flights from Enfidha to Manchester arrived early on Saturday morning, met by a team of Thomson representatives in Terminal 2. Some travellers were clearly distressed as they were led away by airport staff. Two ambulances were parked outside the arrivals hall, which had a visible police presence, and the airport‚Äôs coordinating chaplain, the Rev George Lane, was on hand. Reporters were warned not to approach grieving tourists. Ten Thomson flights were scheduled to arrive at Manchester, Gatwick, East Midlands and Doncaster airports on Saturday morning. The holiday operator said all its trips to Tunisia for the next week would be cancelled. Thomson said its customers could change bookings to Tunisia until 24 July and advised anyone worried about friends or family to call 0800 088 5372.
Thomas Cook said it had arranged for an additional aircraft to fly to Tunisia on Saturday, to allow customers wanting to return home to do so as soon as possible. Those due to travel to Tunisia in the next week could cancel their holiday free of charge, or amend their booking if they have plans to travel up to and including 31 July. EasyJet said it would provide an additional flight from Monastir in Tunisia on Saturday afternoon for customers who wanted to return to the UK. Customers can call 0330 365 5000 to be booked on the 1745 departure. The airline said passengers due to travel to Monastir within the next 14 days could change the booking or obtain a voucher equal to the value of their unused flights. Holiday company Jet2.com, which has 1,244 passengers in Tunisia, has also started sending planes to Enfhida to collect those who want to come home. The director of Tunisia‚Äôs Enfidha-Hammamet airport, Mohamed Walid Ben Ghachem, said about 15 extra flights had been scheduled since Friday, with nine already leaving carrying 1,400 people. However, four planes had departed empty, meaning that least 1,000 people had decided to stay on despite the attack. British tourist Matthew Price, who was on his third visit to Tunisia, said he was cutting his week-long holiday short by three days: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve ever been on holiday and feared for my life. So obviously you can‚Äôt come back somewhere it‚Äôs not safe.‚Äù
Buses and vans were transporting tourists from the Imperial Marhaba hotel on Saturday. The 370-room property was 75% full before the attack took place. While the hotel would remain open, its director said tour operators had urged all guests to leave. ‚ÄúWe may have zero clients today but we will keep our staff,‚Äù Mohammed Becheur said. Downing Street said David Cameron would chair a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee on Saturday and the government ‚Äúwill do everything we can to help those affected‚Äù. The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, said the government was ready to help the victims and their families in any way possible.
‚ÄúThe murders in Tunisia and the events in France and Kuwait are a very stark reminder that we can never take our security for granted,‚Äù he told BBC Breakfast. Anyone concerned about family or friends in Tunisia can contact the Foreign Office helpline on 020 7008 0000. Many have so far been unable to contact relatives who were on holiday in Tunisia. Conor Fulford, from Tamworth, Staffordshire, used Twitter to try to locate his mother, Sue Davey, who was staying at the Imperial ‚Äì one of the hotels that was attacked. Fulford told BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Today programme: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve watched the news and my two sisters are adamant that they could see my mum on a stretcher. It looked like she had been shot in the leg, which is obviously very disturbing, but she was moving so I guess it was a positive compared to the stories that we‚Äôre hearing at the minute.‚Äù Fulford criticised the information provided by the Foreign Office. ‚ÄúThey just said if they find any leads then they will let us know,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm at a loss for words at the minute. They just don‚Äôt want to talk to anyone. It‚Äôs unbelievable.‚Äù Daniel Welch has been unable to contact his grandfather, 74-year-old John Welch, from Corsham in Wiltshire, and his partner Eileen Swannack, 70, who arrived at the Imperial hotel on Tuesday. He said that his family could ‚Äúonly expect the worst‚Äù given that they had not heard from the couple since the attack.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-27T11:48:16Z,world,World news,France attack: Fran√ßois Hollande holds second crisis summit,"The French president, Fran√ßois Hollande, has held a second emergency defence council meeting after the decapitation of a company boss in the south-east of France and the attacks in Tunisia and Kuwait. Hollande returned immediately to Paris from an official visit in Brussels on Friday and the prime minister, Manuel Valls, cut short a visit to South America for the crisis summit that followed the raising of the country‚Äôs security alert level. Valls warned that France faced more attacks after the gruesome killing on Friday which came less than six months after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo magazine and a kosher supermarket in Paris that left 17 people, including two police officers, dead. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult for a society to live for years under the threat of attack,‚Äù he told French journalists. ‚ÄúThe question is not if there will be another attack ‚Ä¶ but when.‚Äù
Police were still questioning suspected attacker Yassin Salhi and three members of his family, including his wife, who were taken into custody on Friday. In Tunisia, the death toll from the attack on tourists at a beach and luxury hotel was said to have reached 39 people, including eight Britons. Locals in the small village of Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, near where the Frenchman was decapitated, reportedly by one of his employees, held a minute‚Äôs silence as more details of the gruesome French assassination emerged. Salhi, a 35-year-old father of three, is suspected to have driven to the Air Products depot at Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, a short drive from Lyon, in a Peugeot Boxer around 9.28am local time on Friday. The suspect then allegedly rang at the gate of the depot belonging to the US-based company, which stocked liquid gas for industrial use, and showed a badge that gave him the authority to enter into the first security zone. Salhi had become known to police in 2006 after attending meetings held by a radical preacher in the Doubs area of western France where he was born, and was placed on a security watchlist classed as ‚ÄúFiche S‚Äù (for ‚Äústate security‚Äù). He was rated at 13 on a scale of 16, but his name appears to have been dropped when the list was renewed two years later. He had no criminal record. CCTV cameras show the driver suddenly accelerating into a second gate around a more protected area and ramming into gas tanks. Injured in the crash, he managed to get out of his car and ran into a covered hanger filled with bottles of liquid air, gas and acetone. He then opened the valves on the bottles before trying to set them alight, when firefighters arrived. After an explosion and the start of a fire, an emergency firefighter confronted the suspect at around 10am and attempted to stop him by grappling him to the ground and holding him until local gendarmes could arrive. As they pulled up at the depot, gendarmes were horrified to find a decapitated head attached by a chain to a gate inside the depot, covered with two large black-and-white banners covered in Arab writing that appeared to correspond to the Shahada (the Muslim profession of faith). Near the Peugeot Boxer, which had been seriously damaged by the gas explosion, lay the headless body. A knife was found nearby.
The victim was named as Herv√© Cornara, aged 54, the commercial director of ATC Transport, a delivery company where Salhi worked as a driver since March. Police said it appeared the victim had been decapitated before Salhi drove into the depot. While beheading is a trademark of Islamic State (Isis), investigators have not confirmed whether the suspect had direct links or strong sympathies with the Islamist terror group. The Air Products site was on the EU Seveso list, meaning it contained potentially risky industrial material, but that the hazard was limited. Salhi was born on 25 March, 1980 to a Moroccan-born mother and an Algerian-born father, who was a factory worker. According to Le Parisien, the family showed no signs of religious fervour until after the father died of a heart attack and the mother started wearing a headscarf and her sons allegedly grew beards. Shortly afterwards, the mother returned to Morocco. The local newspaper, L‚ÄôEst R√©publicain, reported that at the beginning of the 2000s, Salhi became close to a radical Islamic preacher at Pontarlier, in Doubs, who was nicknamed ‚ÄúGrand Ali‚Äù. Ali, an Islamic convert, was suspected of involvement in an attack in Indonesia. In 2004, Salhi came to the attention of the intelligence services, and was placed on the Fiche S for his alleged radicalisation and ‚Äúlinks to a Salafist movement‚Äù. This Fiche S was dropped in 2008. Salhi and his wife and three children moved briefly to Besan√ßon, the capital of Doubs, where he was said to continue to meet with Salafis, then to Saint Priest, near Lyon. His colleagues and neighbours said he never spoke about religion. Because of his continued connections with Salafis, his name was picked up again by the French intelligence services in 2013 and 2014. The Direction G√©n√©rale de la S√©curit√© (DGSE), France‚Äôs intelligence service, apparently wanted to put his telephone under surveillance, but could not find any line registered to him or any member of his family. There is no evidence or suggestion as yet his wife or sister knew anything about the attack at Air Products. The US-based head of the company, Seifi Ghasemi, expressed ‚Äúall his sympathy for the victim of the attack‚Äù on Saturday. ‚ÄúI am horrified and terribly saddened by this attack on one of our plants in France. I think I speak for all staff at Air Products across the world in expressing our profound sympathy for the family of the victim of this undescribable act,‚Äù Ghasemi said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-27T11:46:47Z,world,World news,Suspected driver among arrests made over Kuwait Shia mosque attack,"Kuwait has detained the driver of the vehicle that took a suicide bomber to a Shia Muslim mosque where he detonated explosives, killing 27 people, state news agency Kuna said on Sunday. In all, several people have been detained over Friday‚Äôs attack, according to a security source. The interior ministry said the driver of the Japanese-made car, who left the mosque immediately after the bombing, was an illegal resident named Abdul-Rahman Sabah Aidan, Kuna reported. The ministry said Aidan, 26, was found hiding in one a house in the al-Riqqa residential area. ‚ÄúInitial investigations showed that the owner of the house is a supporter of the deviant thinking,‚Äù it said, adding that the owner of the house is a Kuwaiti citizen. The term ‚Äúdeviant‚Äù is often used by authorities in the Gulf region to refer to al Qaeda Islamist militants. A mass funeral was held on Saturday after the Gulf country‚Äôs worst militant attack in years, which has been claimed by Islamic State. Thousands of Shias and Sunnis took part in the service at Kuwait‚Äôs Grand Mosque ‚Äì the largest place of worship for Sunni Muslims. More than 220 people were wounded in the al-Imam al-Sadiq mosque, the first attack on a Muslim place of worship in the emirate. Shias form a third of Kuwait‚Äôs 1.3 million native population, and Sunni groups have been quick to condemn the attack that Kuwait‚Äôs emir, the government, parliament and clerics have said was aimed at igniting sectarian tensions. The nation‚Äôs leader, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, visiting the site of the bombing, said that the ‚Äúcriminal attack is a desperate and evil attempt targeting Kuwait‚Äôs national unity‚Äù. Authorities said the victims would be laid to rest at the Shia cemetery, west of the capital. Saturday was declared an official day of mourning. A group in Saudi Arabia calling itself Najd Province, which said it was affiliated with Isis, named Abu Suleiman al-Muwahhid as the mosque bomber. The group said the mosque had been promoting Shia Islam, which it considers to be heresy. The statement on Twitter said the bomber had targeted a ‚Äútemple of the apostates‚Äù. The same group claimed responsibility for a pair of bombing attacks on Shia mosques in Saudi Arabia in recent weeks. The Kuwaiti justice, religious endowment and Islamic affairs minister, Yacoub al-Sanna, described the attack as a ‚Äúterrorist and cowardly action which threatens our nation and works at tearing apart the national unity‚Äù. Sanna told the official state agency Kuna that the government would take all necessary measures to ensure protection of houses of worship. ‚ÄúKuwait was, and will remain, the oasis of security and safety to all components of the Kuwaiti society and sects,‚Äù he said. Kuwait also has increased security to the highest level at state-run oil companies. Reuters contributed to this report",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-27T02:24:35Z,world,World news,"Tunisia attack: 'He looked right at me ‚Äì I thought I was dead,' says tourist","Briton Tom Richards came face-to-face with a gunman behind the attacks in Tunisia and said it was a miracle he survived. The attack on Friday in the resort of Sousse, 93 miles (150km) south of Tunis on the country‚Äôs east coast, left at least 38 people dead and 36 injured, including at least five British tourists and an Irishwoman named as Lorna Carty.
Tom, a 22-year-old graduate arrived in the hotel only the day before with his mother, Sam, and 16-year-old younger brother Calum. Tom and Sam were near the outdoor pool shortly before midday when they heard gunfire on the beach. ‚ÄúI heard the first shots, I didn‚Äôt know what it was. Then I heard it again, and I told mum let‚Äôs run.‚Äù He and his mother sprinted up the marble steps through the glass doors at the back of the hotel into the big central atrium as gunfire and screaming rang out behind them. They raced across the marble-floored lobby and turned right to the long wooden reception desk, then spied a door at the far end. Tunisian staff were by the door shouting for them to come. ‚ÄúThe hotel staff said ‚Äòthis way‚Äô,‚Äù said Tom, a civil engineering graduate from Leeds University.
‚ÄúInside, they led us up some stairs to a corridor where there were offices. People were coming out saying ‚Äòwhat are you doing up here?‚Äô ‚Äù They found about 20 people in the corridor, confused and frightened. Then a gunman came up the stairs after them and opened fire, killing two tourists standing by the stairs. ‚ÄúHe shot two people, through the head,‚Äù said Tom. Then Tom found himself face to face with the gunman, who was pointing a Kalashnikov assault rifle at him. ‚ÄúHe looked right at me ‚Äì I thought I was dead,‚Äù said Tom. ‚ÄúHe was maybe 20 or 25, he had long black hair and a beard.‚Äù
Then the gunman squeezed the trigger, and there was the shattering sound of bullets. The shots hit the marble floor, spraying Tom and his mother with shards of marble, wounding her in the ankle and catching Tom in the wrist. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why he stopped. He could have killed everybody,‚Äù said Tom, from Cheshire. His mother spied a toilet door opposite them and threw herself in, with Tom following. Inside, they rushed to a cubicle and slammed the door. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt much protection, the cubicle door wouldn‚Äôt have stopped him,‚Äù said Sam. Inside the cubicle, Tom unrolled toilet tissue to dress first his mother‚Äôs ankle wound, and then his wrist. Then they heard sobbing from the next cubicle. ‚ÄúThere was a girl in there, maybe 25, she was badly wounded. She needed help, she was crying and she was all alone,‚Äù he said. He called for her to squeeze into their cubicle and she hobbled in, bleeding heavily from a marble fragment that was embedded in her thigh.
Tom had no medical training, but decided it was vital to pull it out. ‚ÄúShe had a big chunk of the [marble] tile in her leg. I just said ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to have to pull this out.‚Äô‚Äù After removing the fragment from her leg, Tom used the remaining toilet roll to wrap around her wound. ‚ÄúI looked in the cubicle she had been in, there was just blood everywhere, she was badly wounded.‚Äù The three of them stayed in the cubicle, not daring to talk or move. ‚ÄúI was expecting him to fire through the door and spray everybody,‚Äù said Tom.
Beyond the bathroom they could hear more shooting and the screams of the wounded. Sam said: ‚ÄúPeople were out in the corridor, we could hear them, shouting ‚ÄòI‚Äôm dying‚Äô but we couldn‚Äôt step out to see.‚Äù They stayed in the toilet for an hour, before soldiers arrived, led by an officer they described as ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù for calming people down. ‚ÄúThis army guy was brilliant, he put people at their ease,‚Äù said Tom. ‚ÄúThen there were just army people everywhere.‚Äù They were taken to hospital, and then reunited with Tom‚Äôs younger brother, Calum, who had been upstairs in his room watching TV when the shooting started. He went to the window, to see a gunman rushing into the hotel, but other tourists told him to stay on the upper floors. Amid praise for the staff, many were critical of the lack of security at the hotel, which had no armed officers on duty, despite the massacre at the Bardo museum in March and a string of battles between jihadists and security forces. ‚ÄúThere was no security before,‚Äù said Sam. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been to Turkey, to Egypt, those countries have security,‚Äù she said.
For Tunisia, the impact of the attack may be devastating. Fears were voiced after the Bardo attack that tourism, which employs 470,000 people, would be hit hard, but officials had hoped the museum attack would prove an isolated incident. More than 420,000 British tourists visited Tunisia last year, and with the economy depressed, the country had been hoping that numbers would continue this year. Now many fear there will be mass cancellations. Awaiting one of the evacuation flights due to leave for Manchester in the early hours of the morning, Tom said he is amazed he and his mother are still alive. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt know why he [the gunman] stopped, he could have killed everybody.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-26T22:55:31Z,world,World news,Denmark set for Liberal-led government after rightwing coalition talks fail,"Denmark faces its weakest government in four decades after talks to form a rightwing coalition finally collapsed on Friday night and the Liberals pledged to govern alone, even though they took less than 20% at last week‚Äôs general election. The failure of the right to reach agreement presents the Liberals with a stark choice: to rely on the centre-left Social Democrats, the biggest party in parliament, to push through legislation or, more likely, to lean on the anti-immigrant Danish People‚Äôs party, the country‚Äôs second largest force, which has succeeded in the past 15 years in shifting Danish politics markedly to the right. After a meeting of the four rightwing party bosses on Friday night, Liberal leader Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen told journalists: ‚ÄúIt is my assessment after the evening‚Äôs discussion that it will be possible to form a Liberal government under my leadership, which will enjoy support in parliament.‚Äù Rasmussen, a former prime minister, has only 34 seats out of 179 in Denmark‚Äôs parliament, so will depend on winning the support of at least 56 other MPs in order to pass any legislation. ‚ÄúI am very aware that a pure Liberal government is not just a minority government, but a very small minority government,‚Äù said Rasmussen. Denmark has a history of minority coalition governments ‚Äì the defeated centre-left administration of prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt depended frequently on Liberal support over the past four years. However, itis be more than four decades since a cabinet had fewer seats,: Liberal leader Poul Hartling held office from 1973-75 with only 22 but his administration lasted just 14 months. Thorning-Schmidt‚Äôs Social Democrats won last week‚Äôs elections and took 47 seats on a higher proportion of the vote, but her coalition partners suffered badly and she quit as party leader on election night. The main election winner was the populist DPP, which became Denmark‚Äôs second largest party with more than 21% of the vote. But despite attempts by the Liberals to coax him into a coalition, DPP leader Kristian Thulesen Dahl has opted to wield the party‚Äôs influence from the sidelines and prop up the Liberals on a vote-by-vote basis.
Dahl‚Äôs calculation is that this will enable the DPP to remain untainted by unpopular decisions. The far-right Progress party in Norway has seen its popularity slump since it joined a coalition with the Conservatives in 2013. Anders Samuelsen, Liberal Alliance party leader, said he expected the Liberals had ‚Äúthe most ambitious expectations for cuts in marginal tax rates in Denmark‚Äôs history‚Äù. The Liberal Alliance has campaigned to scrap the top rate of tax while the DPP has called for rising welfare spending on the elderly and the unemployed. Rasmussen, 51, said he would inform Denmark‚Äôs queen of his decision on Saturday and present his cabinet on Sunday. Even with the support of all the rightwing parties, the Liberals will have the slimmest of majorities in parliament ‚Äì just one vote ‚Äì at a time when Denmark‚Äôs economic recovery is still tentative . The currency has come under pressure and the central bank has embarked on a radical experiment with negative interest rates. ‚ÄúThe DPP in many cases can seek cooperation with the Social Democrats and perhaps even the left,‚Äù said Jens Ringberg, a political analyst for Denmark‚Äôs national broadcaster. ‚ÄúDahl says he considers himself to be half red and half blue. It makes life difficult for Rasmussen as prime minister, but not necessarily impossible.‚Äù While the DPP has pushed to the reintroduction of strict border controls to prevent movement of migrants, Rasmussen pledged on Friday to maintain Denmark‚Äôs status as a member of the Schengen group of nations which has no internal borders. ‚ÄúIt is very likely that an election will be called before the four-year period is over,‚Äù Martin Larsen, a political commentator from Copenhagen university, told Reuters. ‚ÄúOn average, one-party governments sit for two-and-a-half years.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-26T22:41:05Z,world,World news,Tunisia attack: British man has surgery after shielding fiancee from gunman,"A British man has undergone life-saving surgery after he was shot three times while using his body to shield his fiancee during the terrorist attack in Tunisia on Friday. Saera Wilson, 26, from Pontypridd in south Wales, has described how her partner, Matthew James, 30, threw himself in front of her as the gunman opened fire in the resort of Sousse.
The attack left at least 38 people dead and 36 injured including at least five British tourists and an Irishwoman. Philip Hammond, the British foreign secretary, said the British death toll was likely to rise. James, a gas engineer from Trehafod, near Pontypridd, was hit in the shoulder, chest and hip as he put his body between Wilson and the gunman, and urged her to run for her life. ‚ÄúHe took a bullet for me ‚Ä¶ I owe him my life because he threw himself in front of me when the shooting started,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe were just on the sunbeds, messing around and having a nice time when we heard these sounds. The shooting had started and there was a man with a gun opening fire all around. It is hard to remember just exactly what was going on. I only saw the one man in dark clothing but people were being shot. ‚ÄúMatthew put himself in front of me, then he was hit. He moved and the man shot him again. Again he tried to move and he was shot again. ‚ÄúHe was shouting and blood was pouring out all over. I was screaming and it was chaos as more shots were coming out. We were down on the floor next to the sunbeds to shelter but the shots just kept on coming. He just told me to go, to look after our kids and that he loved me. ‚ÄúHe was covered in blood from the shots, but he just told me to run away. I ran back, past bodies on the beach to reach our hotel. It was chaos ‚Äì there was a body in the hotel pool and it was just full of blood.‚Äù
After fleeing to the hotel, Wilson hid in a towel cupboard until it was safe to emerge. She then hunted for James on the beach for two hours until she learned he had been taken to hospital where he had life-saving surgery. ‚ÄúI was desperate to find out what had happened to Matthew but no one was around to help. It was so badly organised with no one to help and hardly anyone speaking English. I didn‚Äôt know if he was dead or alive. I was even looking under white sheets to see if it was his body.‚Äù James was being treated at a local hospital on Friday night. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been to the hospital intensive care and I‚Äôm just staying here on a chair now,‚Äù Wilson said. ‚ÄúHis pelvis was shattered by the bullet and he also had a heart attack. But he is alive. I‚Äôm just praying we can get out of here as soon as we can. ‚ÄúThere are bodies everywhere, some covered in blankets and some not. You can‚Äôt imagine how bad it is. I know just how lucky we are to be alive because I can see all the bodies of the people who are not.‚Äù The couple, who are planning to marry in 2017, had left their two children at home with their family when they set off to Sousse on 21 June for a two-week holiday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-26T19:58:03Z,world,World news,Dozens killed as tourists recount horror of Tunisian beach massacre,"Witnesses have described the horror and chaos of the gun attack on sunbathing holidaymakers in Tunisia that left at least 39 people dead and 36 injured. At least five British tourists and an Irishwoman died in the attack. Philip Hammond, the British foreign secretary, said the British death toll was likely to rise. The assault in Tunisia took place within hours of two other suspected Islamist attacks in France and Kuwait. One man was detained near Lyon, south-eastern France, after the severed head of his former employer was hung from the gates of a gas factory. French officials said the man had been known to intelligence services. In Kuwait City, a suicide bomber attacked a Shia mosque, killing 27 worshippers. Responsibility for the bombing was later claimed by the Islamic State group. There is no evidence that the three attacks were coordinated or connected. The shootings in Tunisia took place at about midday in the resort of Sousse, 93 miles (150km) south of Tunis on the country‚Äôs east coast. Tourists fled from the beach and barricaded themselves in their hotel rooms after a gunman opened fire on the crowded beach before moving into the pool area of the five-star Imperial Marhaba hotel while firing at tourists, witnesses said. One suspected gunman was shot dead at the scene, and reports suggested another suspect was apprehended. Of the attack in Sousse, Mohamed Ali Aroui, a spokesman for the Tunisian interior ministry, said: ‚ÄúThe perpetrator of the operation was killed, but ‚Ä¶ there could have been more of them. Whether there were other elements with him, we can‚Äôt confirm or deny.‚Äù
An official from the country‚Äôs health ministry said Britons, Germans, Belgians and Tunisians were among the dead. ‚ÄúThere are still some people we have not identified yet, but we are working on it,‚Äù the official said. A foreign ministry spokesman said that at least 11 Britons, three Belgians and a German were among the wounded. The Riu Imperial Marhaba Hotel, where the shootings took place, said the majority of the 565 guests at the hotel were from the UK and central European countries. One couple from Kent told the Guardian they had been relaxing on their sunbeds when they heard what they believed at first to be fireworks, and saw a man running along the sand with what looked like a machine gun. ‚ÄúHe was shouting something, I don‚Äôt know what he was shouting,‚Äù said Glenn Whitehead, a scaffolder from Swanley, Kent. He shouted at his wife Anita to run, as bullets flew around them. A person lying next to them fell dead, he said. The couple heard bullets close to their head, and Mrs Whitehead tripped in the sand as others ran screaming beside them. Staff from the hotel‚Äôs spa beckoned them inside, where about 20 other tourists and staff were waiting. The couple said they waited for perhaps 20 minutes before they were led outside by staff, to find bodies lying by the hotel pool and in the foyer, amid pools of blood. ‚ÄúI looked around the beach and all I could see were dead people covered in towels,‚Äù said Mr Whitehead. There was also a body on the sunbed next to the ones they had been using. ‚ÄúWhere we were lying were a German mother and daughter. When I got back one of them was covered over, dead.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere was a lot of people who couldn‚Äôt get off their sunbeds,‚Äù his wife said. ‚ÄúThey were elderly.‚Äù
Witnesses told the Guardian that a British man had been killed while sunbathing on the beach as his wife packed their bags in their room ahead of their planned departure on Friday. Another British woman described how her fianc√© was shot three times as he lay next to her on a sunbed, using his own body to shield her from the bullets. Sarah Wilson, from Pontypridd in south Wales, said her partner Matthew James was shot as the gunman opened fire, throwing himself in front of her before urging her to run for her life. He survived the assault but suffered wounds to his shoulder, chest and hip. ‚ÄúWe were just on the sunbeds, messing around and having a nice time when we heard these sounds. The shooting had started and there was a man with a gun opening fire all around. It is hard to remember just exactly what was going on,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI only saw the one man in dark clothing but people were being shot. ‚ÄúMatthew put himself in front of me then he was hit, he moved and the man shot him again.

You can‚Äôt imagine how bad it is.‚Äù Ray Butler, a member of the Irish D√°il, said he had spoken by telephone to the husband of a man from County Meath whose wife was shot dead on the beach while he was in the hotel inside. ‚ÄúHe is absolutely distraught,‚Äù Butler said. Charles Flanagan, the Irish minister of foreign affairs, confirmed that an Irish citizen had been killed.
David Cameron broke off from the European council meeting in Brussels to offer his ‚Äúsympathy and condolences and solidarity‚Äù to Fran√ßois Hollande, the French president, and to Tunisia. ‚ÄúThis is a threat that faces all of us ‚Ä¶ these events can happen anywhere,‚Äù he said. Cameron pledged that Britain would do all it could to help, and insisted that the perpetrators were acting not in the name of Islam but ‚Äúin the name of a twisted and perverted ideology that we must combat with everything we have‚Äù. Speaking after he chaired a meeting of the UK government‚Äôs Cobra crisis committee in London, Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, said: ‚ÄúThe situation on the ground is still somewhat confused and we can‚Äôt be sure exactly how many [victims there are] but because of the nature of the composition of the tourist population in this part of Tunisia we have to assume that a high proportion of those killed and injured will have been British. ‚ÄúWe have had reports from families of those involved in the incident that allow us to confirm that at least five Britons have been killed in this incident, but I should warn that we must expect that there will be more reports of fatalities as we establish the detail on the ground.‚Äù The British Foreign Office said it was urgently working with travel firms in Tunisia ‚Äúto gather and confirm information on those affected by this attack‚Äù, and had despatched British embassy staff to the site of the atrocity. Speaking from the scene several hours after the attack, Tunisia‚Äôs president, B√©ji Ca√Ød Essebsi, called for a global strategy to tackle terrorism and insisted that his country could not be left to face jihadis alone. The attack ‚Äì the worst in Tunisia‚Äôs modern history ‚Äì is a devastating blow to a country whose economy relies heavily on western tourism, and comes only three months after another two gunmen murdered 21 people, including one Briton, in an assault on the Bardo National Museum, one of the country‚Äôs leading tourist attractions. There were no immediate claims of responsibility. Sousse was also the scene of a failed suicide bombing attempt in October 2013, when a man was spotted approaching a hotel in a suicide vest and chased on to the empty beach, where he blew himself up.
The country‚Äôs tourist economy had taken a major blow in the aftermath of the 2011 ‚ÄúJasmine‚Äù revolution but with new elections in late 2014, was returning to stability. Tourist receipts in 2015 are already down by 15% on 2014 following the Bardo attack. By late afternoon, the corpses, most of them in black body bags, had been gathered by a bar and pavilion. The Guardian was shown several bodies of elderly tourists in shorts and bathing suits still lying where they had been killed. Others had been evacuated by the emergency services, using sunbeds as stretchers. Dazed tourists, clearly in shock, ordered beers from the terrace bar still dressed in their swimsuits. One man from had ordered lobster and was drinking a beer while cleaners mopped up blood around his feet. He said he had seen someone killed, but did not want to be named.
Gary Pine, a product manager from Bristol who was staying at the El Mouradi Palm Marina hotel, said he heard an estimated 20 to 30 shots before tourists ran to their hotels for cover. ‚ÄúOver to our left, about 100 yards [90 metres] or so away, we saw what we thought was firecrackers going off,‚Äù he told Sky News. ‚ÄúBut you could see quite quickly the panic that was starting to ensue from the next resort along from us. ‚ÄúOnly when you could start hearing bullets whizzing around your ear do you realise it was something a lot more serious than firecrackers. ‚ÄúMy son was in the sea at the time and of course my wife and myself were shouting for him to get out of the sea quick and as we ran up the beach, he said: ‚ÄòI just saw someone get shot.‚Äô As we exited the beach there was some kind of explosion from the complex next door. So we knew that a situation was developing, if not had ended.‚Äù Elizabeth O‚ÄôBrien, an Irish woman who was holidaying with her two sons, said she had heard what she initially thought was gunfire, before realising it was actually gunfire. ‚ÄúSo I just ran to the sea to my children and grabbed our things and as I was running towards the hotel, the waiters and the security on the beach started saying ‚Äòrun, run, run!‚Äô and we just ran to our room.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-26T19:28:11Z,world,World news,Tunisia: murder of holidaymakers in Sousse could kill tourism and hope,"The slaughter of sunbathers and hotel staff on the beaches of a country that has always prided itself as a carefree, laid-back destination for package holidaymakers has dealt a huge blow to Tunisia. The small north African country lit the first spark of the Arab spring four years ago, when its popular uprising toppled a corrupt dictatorship relatively peacefully. It is often looked to as the hope of the region. Unlike its troubled neighbours, it has managed to keep its political transition on course ‚Äî crafting a new constitution, staging free presidential and parliamentary elections. But with a struggling post-revolution economy that depends in large part on its beach resorts and foreign visitors, it was already facing the serious ongoing challenges of how to tackle unemployment, social unrest and strikes, and how to address the feeling among the poorest and the young that their demands, which inspired the revolution ‚Äî the need for social justice, jobs and the fight to end corruption ‚Äî are yet to be fully achieved. In recent months, Tunisia was already grappling with a growing jihadi problem. Thousands of its young men ‚Äî more than any other Arab country ‚Äî have gone to fight in Syria, and porous borders with Libya and Algeria have raised the stakes. Yet the Sousse attack seems to cement a troubling new pattern. Before this spring, the jihadi threa was aimed mostly at Tunisian security forces. But the March terrorist attack on the Bardo National Museum in Tunis that killed 21 foreign tourists and a policeman and now the Sousse beach massacre suggest a new focus on soft targets. The negative impact on the country‚Äôs image and economy is potentially highly damaging. ‚ÄúI think the effect of this will be even more serious than the effect of the Bardo attack in March,‚Äù said Monica Marks, a North Africa analyst based in Tunis. ‚ÄúNot all tourists who come to Tunisia want to visit the Bardo museum: a lot more ‚Äî particularly the German and British ‚Äî are Vitamin D tourists who want to spend time on the beach. ‚ÄúSousse has the most package tourism of any other Tunisian resort on the coast,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúImages of tourists dead across sunloungers will have a considerable effect. Tourism accounted for around 14.5% of Tunisian GDP last year. This will have considerable repercussions for the Tunisian economy. It also will also affect investor confidence.‚Äù Marks said that the attack on this scale could spark a loss of confidence in the government and dent its authority. The government response will be crucial, particularly in a country where the balance between security measures and human rights is both delicate and important. In December, a new parliament was elected. The president Beji Caid Essebsi is an 88-year-old secularist who served as a senior official in Tunisia‚Äôs previous regimes. His ruling secular party Nidaa Tounes governs in a coalition that includes the small presence of Ennahda, the moderate Islamist movement that won the first post-uprising election and has done much to make Tunisia‚Äôs transition a relative success. After the Bardo attack, the immediate reaction of Essebsi was to spearhead new anti-terror laws and promise a crackdown. The tough new legislation has not yet been passed, politicians have argued over it and lawyers and human rights groups have raised concerns about freedom of speech and civil liberties, arbitrary arrests, detention and police harassment. The balance between security and human rights is a delicate issue in a country that, under the authoritarian Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, was a notoriously brutal police state. Tunisia‚Äôs post-revolution Truth and Dignity Commission is currently attempting to deal with the harrowing accounts that stem from the country‚Äôs recent history. The issue of torture, even after the revolution, has not yet been fully dealt with. This commitment to deal with the past is vital and Tunisia is unlikely to slide back to the days of Ben Ali‚Äôs oppressive state. But lawyers and rights groups are pushing to keep that balance between security and rights. Tunisia prides itself on its continuing resilience in the face of its post-revolution challenges, including political assassinations and the jihadi threat. The Sousse attack is one of its biggest challenges yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-26T18:58:54Z,world,World news,Racist Twitter trolls launch attacks on Canadian environmentalist,"A prominent environmental scientist in Canada has become the target of racist attacks on social media after expressing his support for a fast food chain‚Äôs decision to stop running adverts by a company involved in a controversial pipeline project. Faisal Moola, an adjunct professor at the University of Toronto, and a director of one of Canada‚Äôs largest environmental organisations, was subjected to hundreds of abusive tweets after directing a message to the Tim Hortons chain. The restaurant group recently announced it would no longer run adverts on its restaurant televisions for Enbridge Inc because of its proposed Northern Gateway pipeline that would cross British Columbia to the Pacific Coast. Moola‚Äôs 21-word tweet in support of the decision ‚Äì ‚Äú@TimHortons Thank you for decision to drop the #Enbridge Ads from Tims TV. This decision is good corporate stewardship#cndpoli@SumOfUs‚Äù ‚Äì was met with a barrage of abuse.
‚ÄúI was called a foreign-funded extremist, a terrorist, a radical and anti-Canadian,‚Äù Moola told the Guardian. ‚ÄúI was told to ‚Äògo back where I came from‚Äô, to ‚Äòstop destroying the economy‚Äô.‚Äù Moola, who is a director of the David Suzuki Foundation, was also incorrectly vilified as an ‚ÄúArab‚Äù with ‚ÄúMiddle Eastern oil connections‚Äù. The incident came after the government introduced sweeping new anti-terror legislation, which many activists had warned would conflate environmentalists with violent jihadists. Moola, whose family was originally from South Africa, was born and raised in Ontario. He said he was shocked by the intensity of the online abuse. The attacks began right after Conservative broadcaster and pro-oil pundit Ezra Levant tweeted a mobile-phone screen grab of Moola‚Äôs profile to thousands of his followers. ‚ÄúAnother U.S.-funded anti-oil troll pressured @timhortons was this lobbyist, Faisal Moola of @DavidSuzukiFDN,‚Äù Levant wrote.
Moola has since filed a ‚Äúhate incident‚Äù complaint with the National Council of Canadian Muslims. Meanwhile conservative activists have launched a campaign to boycott Tim Hortons using the hashtag #BoycottTims. Digital analysis by Ottawa and Boston universities showed that Levant was the most influential user of the hashtag, followed by a rightwing website, a Conservative party strategist and two accounts run by oil industry lobbyists. Levant told the National Observer that he did not support the racist abuse, but accused Moola of ‚Äúplaying the little lamb‚Äù. ‚ÄúI obviously don‚Äôt agree with any racial epithets thrown at him. I have never described Moola‚Äôs race or religion. To me, his central identity is that of environmental extremism, which I suspect is his most important self-identity,‚Äù he told the website. Moola said the incident showed that environmental campaigners needed to recognise that their opponents are ‚Äúaggressive and powerful‚Äù. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs ironic that I‚Äôm being attacked for being unpatriotic for championing very core Canadian values like protecting clean water, wildlife and wilderness which are threatened by the proposed Enbridge pipelines,‚Äù he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-26T18:20:51Z,world,World news,Tunisia resort gun attack: British tourists among the dead,"At least five British tourists are among 39 people who have been killed in a gun attack at a Tunisian beach resort, the UK foreign secretary Philip Hammond has said. The Irish government said an Irish woman was also killed. The slaughter took place on the beach between the Soviva and Imperial Marhaba hotels in the town of Sousse ‚Äì a popular destination for holidaymakers from the UK and Ireland. Hammond warned that the death toll could rise and said a ‚Äúhigh proportion‚Äù of the casualties were expected to be British ‚Äúbecause of the nature of the resort‚Äù. Tunisia‚Äôs health ministry said that those killed included Britons, Tunisians, Germans and Belgians. The country‚Äôs foreign ministry said that among the 36 wounded, there were 11 Britons, three Belgians and a German, with the rest being Tunisians or of unknown nationality. The survivors of the attack were being flown back to Britain early Saturday morning. They were due to land at Gatwick, Doncaster and Manchester airports early this morning. Eight of the wounded were in critical condition according to the Tunisian health minister Said Aidi. The bodies of the dead had been moved to Tunis, Aidi said. By midnight several hundred tourists had gathered in the foyer of the Riu Marhaba hotel where the attack took place under the lights of chandeliers. One woman in a red shirt sat crying on a sofa, her suitcase next to her. There were other groups hugging each other, and many sought out Tunisian staff to say goodbye. British embassy officials moved among the tourists. A foreign ministry official said it had been hard to confirm the identity and nationality of all of the dead people. Most had been on the beach and not carrying documents that could help identify them. The Imperial Marhaba hotel said 565 guests were staying at the time of the attack and that the majority of guests were ‚Äúfrom the UK and other central European countries‚Äù. It said it was not possible to confirm the nationalities or any other details of the victims. One of the dead was an Irish woman who was named as Lorna Carty, a nurse and mother of two from Co Meath. She had been in the resort with her husband Declan who had recently undergone heart surgery. It is understood the couple were given the holiday as a present from a family member to help with his recuperation. Ray Butler, a parliamentarian with the main party in the ruling Irish coalition, Fine Gael, confirmed he had spoken to the husband of the murdered woman. ‚ÄúThis was the hardest phone call I‚Äôve ever taken. My heart goes out to the family who are enduring unthinkable grief,‚Äù Butler said. ‚ÄúHe [Declan Carty] is absolutely distraught,‚Äù Butler said. Charles Flanagan, the Irish foreign minister, confirmed that an Irish citizen had been killed. A family friend said the couple were due to leave Tunisia to return to Ireland just hours after the massacre. ‚ÄúThey went out (to Sousse) last Friday and they were due home tonight,‚Äù said the friend. Tour operator Thomas Cook said: ‚ÄúThomas Cook has been advised of an incident that occurred earlier today in Sousse, Tunisia. At this time, details are not clear as to which property(ies) have been affected, with conflicting news reports. ‚ÄúWe are currently gathering information and will provide an update as soon as possible. Our teams on the ground are offering every support to our customers and their families in the area. ‚ÄúWe will continue to monitor the situation, working closely with the Foreign Office and local authorities.‚Äù
It is believed there are scores of Irish holidaymakers in Sousse. Dublin‚Äôs foreign affairs department could not immediately confirm the number of citizens in the resort. ‚ÄúOur embassy in Madrid and our honorary consul in Tunis are monitoring the situation in Sousse, Tunisia, and are providing updates,‚Äù a spokeswoman said. Sousse is a city on the east coast of Tunisia, about 87 miles (140km) south of the capital, Tunis. About 1.2 million tourists visit Sousse every year, drawn by the hotels, sandy beaches and culture. Hotel complexes with 40,000 beds span the old city to the Port El Kantaoui and the city is home to a Unesco-protected mosque, as well as a historic medina. Boujaafar beach stretches from the Gulf of Hammamet several miles north to Port El Kantaoui ‚Äì a purpose-built resort with dozens of hotels including the El Mouradi Palm Marina, El Mouradi Palace and Riu Imperial Marhaba. Elizabeth O‚ÄôBrien, an Irishwoman on holiday with her two sons in the resort, described how she grabbed her children and ran for their lives when they heard gunfire erupting from one of the hotels.
‚ÄúI thought ‚Äòoh my God, it sounds like gunfire‚Äô, so I ran to the sea to my children and grabbed our things and as I was running towards the hotel, the waiters and the security on the beach started saying ‚Äòrun, run run!‚Äô and we just ran to our room, which is like a little bungalow. So we are actually trapped in our room.‚Äù Speaking after he chaired a meeting of the UK government‚Äôs crisis committee Cobra in London, Hammond said: ‚ÄúThe situation on the ground is still somewhat confused and we can‚Äôt be sure exactly how many [victims there are], but because of the nature of the composition of the tourist population in this part of Tunisia we have to assume that a high proportion of those killed and injured will have been British. ‚ÄúWe have had reports from families of those involved in the incident that allow us to confirm that at least five Britons have been killed in this incident, but I should warn that we must expect that there will be more reports of fatalities as we establish the detail on the ground.‚Äù The Foreign Office said it was urgently working with travel firms in Tunisia ‚Äúto gather and confirm information on those affected by this attack‚Äù, and had despatched a British embassy team to the site of the atrocity. Assistant commissioner Helen Ball, the Metropolitan police‚Äôs senior national coordinator of counter-terrorism investigations, said the force would be providing trained liaison officers to support the families of those killed, and stressed that ‚Äúthe threat to the UK from international terrorism remains at severe‚Äù.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-26T18:14:36Z,world,World news,"Greeks mistrust EU, EC, ECB √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú but retain some faith in the euro","In the past 10 days, there have been two demonstrations in Athens in support of Greece‚Äôs continued membership of the euro and one to urge prime minister Alexis Tsipras and finance minister Yannis Varoufakis not to make concessions in their negotiations with its creditors. Quite a few people have been to all three. This seemingly contradictory approach echoes Syriza‚Äôs rhetoric: one of its campaign slogans was ‚ÄúWe will change Europe.‚Äù But it also reflects public opinion. The findings for Greece of the latest Eurobarometer survey are paradoxical. Asked ‚ÄúWhat does the EU mean to you personally?‚Äù the euro was the second most popular choice, behind ‚Äúfreedom to travel, study and work anywhere in the EU‚Äù ‚Äì and, tellingly, just ahead of unemployment.
Yet when asked about their attitude to the EU itself, 76% of Greeks said they mistrusted it. It was the highest level of mistrust detected in any of the EU‚Äôs 28 member states. Greece, in other words, is a country in which people are generally keen on the single currency, but in which a substantial majority has grave doubts about the economic and political partnership that gave rise to it. Not to mention the institutions charged with overseeing it. More Greeks mistrusted the European commission than in any other country ‚Äì 72% (compared with a modest 47% in Britain). And the same was true of the ECB. All this represents a drastic turnaround. ‚ÄúTwenty years ago, we didn‚Äôt ask questions about Europe,‚Äù recalls Kostas Panagopoulos of Alco Polls. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt think it was necessary.‚Äù As in the other countries of southern Europe that had experienced the trauma of dictatorship, the EU was a dream no one dared to question ‚Äì a heaven of peace and prosperity and, perhaps most importantly, an assurance that the transition to democracy could never be reversed. For Greece, the EU also offered something else: the promise of protection against Turkey. Once you were in, moreover, you would be showered with funds to ensure your economy was brought up to scratch. What on earth was there not to like? If Europe was axiomatically good, it followed that the euro had to be better, holding out the hope, not just of tighter integration with the EU core, but of the lower interest rates southern European countries had been unable to manage on their own. A heaven within heaven. ‚ÄúIn Greece, there was a problem of understanding; that staying in the euro also brought with it a series of obligations,‚Äù says Eleni Panagiotarea, author of Greece and the Euro and a research fellow of the thinktank Eliamep. ‚ÄúThat did not filter down to the people.‚Äù Panagiotarea blames the politicians for not being frank. The same could be said of their peers throughout southern Europe: they told voters they would have to make sacrifices to get into the single currency, but not that they would have to accept radical changes to their economy ‚Äì and their society ‚Äì if they were to compete effectively once inside. Now that this uncomfortable truth is dawning, there is a clear danger that Greeks will react with all the fury of a spurned lover. Panagopoulos says that between a poll his firm took a month ago and one two weeks later, support for Grexit leapt by 10 percentage points. ‚ÄúWe still have a big majority in favour of staying in the eurozone. But we now have even members of the government saying Grexit would not be a catastrophe ‚Äì and we also have a lot of reasons to be disappointed. I‚Äôm afraid that, for a lot of people in Greece, Europe is becoming the enemy.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-26T18:02:03Z,world,World news,"Friends encouraged teenager to follow brother to Syria and join Isis, court hears","Three young men helped or encouraged a teenager who followed his older brother from Cardiff to Syria to join Islamic State fighters, the Old Bailey has heard. The men, from three different UK towns and cities, were involved in arranging Aseel Muthana‚Äôs passage from the Welsh capital to Syria, kitting him out or advising about the journey, the court was told. Muthana left Cardiff aged 17, following in the footsteps of his brother Nasser Muthana, 21, who achieved notoriety when he appeared in an Isis propaganda video entitled There is No Life without Jihad, the prosecution said. Forhad Rahman, 21, from Cirencester, Gloucestershire, Adeel Ulhaq, 21, of Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, and Kristen Brekke, 19, of Cardiff, all deny preparing acts of terrorism by helping the teenager on his way to Syria. Rahman allegedly got a passport and paid for Aseel Muthana‚Äôs plane and coach tickets, helping him board a flight from Gatwick to Cyprus in February 2014. The court heard that Rahman and Aseel Muthana exchanged affectionate messages via the WhatsApp messaging system in which they called each other ‚Äúcutie‚Äù, ‚Äúhoney‚Äù and ‚Äúbabe‚Äù. In the months before going to Syria, Muthana made ‚Äúdeclarations of love‚Äù to Rahman, jurors were told. Christopher Hehir QC, prosecuting, said the pair‚Äôs WhatsApp exchanges revealed ‚Äúa profound emotional closeness‚Äù. He said there may well have been a humorous element to the nicknames but he claimed there was no doubt they became close friends. He said: ‚ÄúThe chats with Forhad Rahman make Aseel Muthana‚Äôs intentions crystal clear. They reveal a young man quite determined to follow in his elder brother‚Äôs footsteps by going to fight in Syria.‚Äù While remaining lukewarm about going himself, the prosecutor said, Rahman encouraged his friend to go to Syria despite knowing that his parents were put through great pain when his older brother left and were fearful that Aseel would follow suit. Rahman put Muthana in touch with Adeel Ulhaq who gave him valuable advice in online chats on how to get to the war-torn country, the prosecutor said. Ulhaq is additionally charged with a separate terrorism funding offence, relating to a money transfer he made to an individual in Turkey. Muslim convert Kristen Brekke, who lived near Aseel in Cardiff, befriended him when they both worked in an ice-cream shop together, the jury heard. He allegedly bought kit for Muthana, including camouflage clothes and desert boots on eBay, helped him make computer searches for information, and allowed him to store items at his house. The trial continues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-26T17:45:37Z,world,World news,France on high alert after decapitated body found at scene of factory attack,"France has raised its security alert to the highest level after police discovered a decapitated body and flags with Arabic inscriptions following an attack in which a man seemingly tried to blow up a factory belonging to a US gas company. A suspect arrested at the scene at Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, near Lyon in south-west France, was named by the French prosecutor as 35-year-old Yassin Salhi, an employee at a transport company run by the victim. The suspect was known to people at the Air Products factory because he came in regularly for deliveries, the prosecutor said.
The victim‚Äôs head was found hanging on a fence next to two inscribed flags, with the rest of his body inside the factory. ‚ÄúIt is a terror attack. There is no doubt about it,‚Äù the French president, Fran√ßois Hollande, told reporters in Brussels before leaving a European council summit to return to Paris. France‚Äôs interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said Sahli had previously faced investigation over radicalisation, although he had no police record. The prosecutor said that between 2011 and 2014, French security services had been investigating Salhi for connections to salafist groups in the Lyon area. It remained unclear whether any Islamist motivation for the attack might be mixed with personal grudges. There is no evidence it was coordinated or connected with the Tunisian beach shootings or a suicide bombing at a Kuwaiti mosque during Friday prayers.
Hollande led a security meeting at the Elys√©e palace, saying afterwards he had raised the security alert in the south-east region to maximum. A priority, he added, was to determine if the alleged attacker had accomplices. The suspect‚Äôs wife was later arrested, as was his sister and an unidentified man reportedly seen driving past the Air Products site several times before the attack. Earlier, a woman identifying herself as Sahli‚Äôs wife told Europe 1 radio that she and the couple‚Äôs three children had known nothing of the planned attack. ‚ÄúMy heart is about to give out,‚Äù she said. The suspect was believed to have hung his manager‚Äôs head on a fence before driving a vehicle into a warehouse filled with gas canisters, causing an explosion, a local newspaper, Dauphin√© Lib√©r√©, said. Two people were hurt in the blast. Security officials told Associated Press the attacker had seemingly hoped to cause a far bigger explosion with his actions, believing the canisters were more combustible than they proved. Hollande said the apparent intention of the attack had been to blow up the factory. G√©rard Larcher, the centre-right president of the French S√©nat, the upper house of parliament, arrived at the scene on Friday afternoon, saying he had spoken to the local public prosecutor and members of France‚Äôs anti-terrorist brigade in Paris. He said the attacker was known at the gas storage unit where he made deliveries. ‚ÄúThis is why he had access to the site,‚Äù Larcher said. ‚ÄúThere is a very strong sense of shock,‚Äù he added. Larcher paid tribute to a firefighter who reportedly stopped the attacker blowing up a stock of gas bottles.
Mehdi, a 23-year-old Muslim man who lives 100 metres from the depot, said he was furious that ‚Äúthese people claim to be Muslims‚Äù. ‚ÄúI am a young Muslim,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI am keeping Ramadan right now. It is Friday. To carry out this attack on a Friday during the holy month is not respectful of Islam. These people may call themselves Muslims but they are not. I say to them, you do not have the right to cut off someone‚Äôs head, you do not have the right to explode anything near our homes where our children live. ‚ÄúWe have French, Turks, Arabs, Chinese, Cambodians living around here. There is no more tension than anywhere else,‚Äù Mehdi said, adding that he feared the attack would bring reprisals against the Muslim community in France. Air Products confirmed there had been an incident at its factory and said all staff had been evacuated. ‚ÄúWe can confirm that an incident occurred at our facility in L‚ÄôIsle-d‚ÄôAbeau, France this morning,‚Äù a statement said. ‚ÄúOur priority at this stage is to take care of our employees, who have been evacuated from the site and all accounted for. Emergency services are on site and have contained the situation. The site is secure. Our crisis and emergency response teams have been activated and are working closely with all relevant authorities.‚Äù France has been on alert for possible Islamist-related attacks since gunmen killed 17 people in January in assaults on the offices of the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine and a Jewish food store. Hollande said the response to such attacks should be measured. He said: ‚ÄúWe all remember what has happened in our country, and in other countries. There is a lot of emotion, but emotion is not the only answer. We need action, deterrence, and we need to spread our values and to never give in to fear.‚Äù Air Products, based in Pennsylvania, supplies gases, chemicals and associated equipment.

2015-06-26T17:11:03Z,world,World news,"'We need co-conspirators, not allies': how white Americans can fight racism","In America, where 62% of the population identifies as Caucasian, white people are easy to find. But white people have not been as visible in the aftermath of the Charleston massacre last week, where a young white man and his white supremacist ideals entered a historically black church and shot nine churchgoers dead. ‚ÄúPeople who are not black can no longer sit on the margins. They can no longer just express their sympathy: those are shallow words,‚Äù Arielle Newton, a 23-year-old black blogger said at a rally in Harlem in New York City on Monday. ‚ÄúThey have to act intentionally, from a point of pro-blackness. To work to make sure that black people are given the equity that we deserve.‚Äù About 100 mourners and #BlackLivesMatter protesters attended the rally. Despite the protest area explicitly being defined as a ‚Äúblack-centered space‚Äù by organizers , much of the dialogue that ensued was focused on white people, white ideologies and conversations white people may ‚Äì or may not ‚Äì be having at their dinner tables. Standing towards the back of the gathering, carrying a poster that stated ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù on one side and the names of black women and girls killed by police on the other, Babbie Dunnington, a 29-year-old white teacher, was one of just a few white faces in Tuesday‚Äôs majority black crowd. She said that the change had to come from white people. ‚ÄúBlack people didn‚Äôt enslave themselves. It shouldn‚Äôt be on them to correct that. White people have the responsibility to understand that they live in a racist society, a racist society they have created.‚Äù
‚ÄúI am not interested in white allies. What we need are co-conspirators,‚Äù Feminista Jones, a 36-year-old social worker and writer shouted into a bullhorn. Her solemn audience cheered her on. ‚ÄúThe definition of ally-ship is to mutually benefit and support. Black people are not obligated to provide support to people who are dominant,‚Äù Jones said. ‚ÄúWe are not working together on a mutual goal. My goal is to live. You don‚Äôt have that same goal.‚Äù But the disparity in realities does not mean Jones wants to exclude white people from participating in rallies and civil action, quite the contrary. Jones wants more, not less. ‚ÄúWhat I need is for people to come and work with us in the trenches and be there alongside us. It‚Äôs not about being on the outside and saying ‚Äòyes, I support you!‚Äô It‚Äôs about ‚Äònot only do I support you, but I am here with you, I am rolling up my sleeves. What do I need to do?‚Äô‚Äù Annie Schoening, a 33-year-old social media manager for Million Hoodies Movement for Justice, a black- and brown-led social justice organization created to protect and empower young people of color, is white, and has been put in charge of the mission to engage white supporters. Her organization has put up a set of rules online, inviting non-black people to take the pledge for racial justice. The rules outlined in the pledge involve acknowledging the existence of racism whether or not one is a regular victim of it, to denounce new forms of it, including the use of words ‚Äúthugs‚Äù and ‚Äúriots‚Äù to define black people and their protest, to identify the exclusion of black perspectives in many forms of media and seek them out, to confront anti-black racism within closed circles (including schools, friendship circles and families), and to pledge to participate in the overall black-led fight to end racial injustice. ‚ÄúLook to black leaders, listen to what they are telling you,‚Äù she says of potential mixed messages white people might feel they are hearing as to when to step back and give space versus when to proactively intervene and help. Discomfort, or anxiety about making faux pas, may be a reason some white people are still sitting on the sidelines in terms of uprooting racism, but Dante Barry, executive director of the Million Hoodies Movement for Justice, points out the disparity is so stark, white people may just need to get over their anxiety. ‚ÄúBlack folks are readily risking their lives every day purely by existing,‚Äù he says, while the risk being taken by white communities to be in solidarity with black liberation is ‚Äúgetting over that uncomfortable feeling‚Äù.
If whiteness is the source of the problem, little time tends to actually be spent on understanding what that means, says Nell Irvin Painter, a historian and professor emeritus at Princeton University. Painter says whiteness is currently defined by what it isn‚Äôt: blackness. It, in turn, tends to be taken for granted. Beyond simply being majority white in terms of population, the US is a white-centric society: 80% of Congress is currently white, over 95% of Fortune 500 companies are headed by white CEOs. In 2011, 84% of full-time professors at American colleges and universities were white. Whiteness might be so dominant that it is, in fact, not picked up on at all. Painter says that whiteness as a concept is a constantly evolving thing, and white people need not be afraid of becoming aware of their heritage. Such a coming to terms might then lead to further transformation that can be pro-black. ‚ÄúYou can stay white and be for racial justice and against racism,‚Äù she said.
Also standing towards the back of the crowd on Tuesday was Joe Blankholm. At 6ft3in, Blankholm, a fair-haired, blue-eyed, athletic-looking white man, stood out a little, but his demeanor was discreet. He said he couldn‚Äôt find anyone to come to the vigil with him, but still wanted to attend, so he came alone. He was still figuring out how to be a white ally, or ‚Äúwhat that even meant‚Äù, he said. ‚ÄúBeing happy to leave rights and privileges on the table,‚Äù was one thing, he ventured tentatively. Another might be ‚Äúacting as a Trojan horse‚Äù in (white) spaces where he seemed to be listened to more than others, he said. Blankholm says being white and male has helped him tackle unconventional, radical topics in front of an audience, and still be well received. The 30-year-old has just finished a PhD at Columbia University and is about to take up a professor position at the University of California, Santa Barbara in September. Towards the end of April, Blankholm, who was teaching a literature and humanities class at Columbia University at the time, sent a somewhat unconventional email to his 22 undergraduate members. There was a protest happening downtown, he wrote, in solidarity with the protests in Baltimore over the death of Freddie Gray at the hands of police that coincided with his scheduled class. Blankholm found the irony of teaching that week‚Äôs scheduled book, Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison, written by an African American man in the mid-20th century, too much to bear. His email explained he would be heading to the protest instead of class, and invited his classroom to join him, making sure to add that those who did not join would not be penalized in their grades. Did any of the Columbia freshmen make it? ‚ÄúHalf of them showed up.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-26T17:06:04Z,world,World news,Global LGBT community still gripped by homophobic state-sponsored violence,"The US supreme court‚Äôs ruling that same-sex marriage is a legal right across the country marks a milestone in the march for equality. But the ever-expanding rainbow map of America, bolstered by the Friday verdict, is in stark contrast to the state of LGBT rights in the rest of the world, where as many as 80 countries are still hostile toward gay people. Despite recent progress in the US, Latin America and even Ireland ‚Äì one of the most conservative societies in Europe ‚Äì the global campaign for the rights of sexual minorities has experienced a series of setbacks in other regions including Africa and the Middle East. Fewer than 1 billion of the world‚Äôs population live in countries where same-sex marriage or civil unions are recognised, compared to almost 2.8 billion living in countries which criminalise gay people and impose severe punishments on homosexuality, such as imprisonment, lashings and even death sentences.
In around 10 countries, homosexuality is punishable by death, including Saudi Arabia, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Sudan and Brunei. Jessica Stern, the executive director of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC), welcomed the US supreme court‚Äôs ruling on Friday but said that the campainers‚Äô work is far from over. ‚ÄúToday and for weeks and months to come, Americans will celebrate today‚Äôs historic ruing ‚Äì a dream come true for tens of thousands of [people],‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe US has joined 19 other countries in recognition of the freedom to marry for same-sex couples nationwide and yet, our work is far from over ‚Äì not in the US and not around the world.‚Äù She added: ‚ÄúMarriage equality is one slice of the pie, but homophobia and transphobia morph into different shapes in law and practice. Nearly 80 countries still criminalize same-sex intimacy and countless prohibit so-called ‚Äòcross-dressing‚Äô.‚Äù Charles Radcliffe, the UN‚Äôs special adviser on LGBT rights and the head of global issues at the UN human rights office in New York, said that the global picture was not entirely bleak and stressed that there have been significant improvements worldwide. ‚ÄúThere have been some setbacks, notably in some parts of the former Soviet Union and a few African countries, but it‚Äôs important not to lose sight of the larger picture, which remains one of enormous progress affecting LGBT people in most of the world,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhether on marriage, new anti-discrimination laws or transgender inclusion, we continue to see big steps forward. Advances have not been confined to western countries, some of the most striking changes have occurred in Latin America, and positive measures have also been taken by some African and Asian countries. And almost everywhere ‚Äì even in hostile places ‚Äì you see greater visibility of LGBT communities and LGBT activism.‚Äù Recent improvements on gay rights, he said, include a new gender identity law in Argentina, a new civil union law in Chile, constitutional amendments in Malta, decriminalisation of gay relationships in Mozambique, pro-transgender assistance in India, and decriminalisation of homosexuality in Pacific countries such as Fiji and Palau. But many countries in Africa and the Middle East are extremely hostile to gay people, who remain at risk of criminalisation or homophobic violence.
According to Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, the intensifying backlash in the world is partly due to the greater visibility of the LGBT community in societies that have begun to recognise their rights. ‚ÄúLGBT people are also convenient scapegoats for embattled leaders, who are trying to rally support from more conservative sectors of their society. Whether it‚Äôs Uganda, Nigeria or Russia, the decision to scapegoat the LGBT community is an outcome of serious challenges to the regime, for widespread corruption or abusive authoritarianism,‚Äù he said, according to HRW‚Äôs website. ‚ÄúThe status of the LGBT community is a good litmus test for the status of human rights in society more broadly, precisely because it is such a vulnerable minority ‚Äì similar to the proverbial canary in the coal mine. Where the rights of LGBT people are undermined, you can be sure that the rights of other minorities and critical members of civil society will soon also be in jeopardy.‚Äù The Commonwealth remains a bastion of homophobia, with 41 out 53 member states still using British colonial-era legislation to criminalise homosexuals. A major setback for gay rights campaigners was a 2013 ruling by India‚Äôs supreme court which re-criminalised gay sex in the country, said Felicity Daly, executive director of the Kaleidoscope Trust. In Trinidad and Tobago gay people can be jailed for up to 25 years; in Malaysia the punishment for being gay is 20 years plus an additional sentence of lashing. Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Pakistan, Uganda, Bangladesh and Guyana all impose life imprisonment for homosexuality. Earlier this month in Morocco, two gay men were sentenced to four months each in jail after they were arrested for standing too close to one another as they posed for a photograph. Amid improvements, violence against gay people remain a big concern, said Joel Simkhai, the CEO of gay dating app Grindr. ‚ÄúSince 2008, activists have documented over 800 murders of transgender people,‚Äù he wrote in a column for the Huffington Post last month. ‚ÄúSometimes the perpetrators who act against us represent governments, themselves, as happened with police raids on a gay bar in Kenya last year. Other times, it is their lack of action to protect us that makes officials complicit, as when Russia ignored gun violence and gas attacks on gay clubs in Moscow. There are countless other acts of violence around the world that go unreported and ignored by local officials.‚Äù Speaking after Friday‚Äôs ruling, Stern said gay activists in the US should now turn their attention to fresh challenges. ‚ÄúFirst, we must address those who are most vulnerable within this country, including transgender people in immigration detention. Second, I hope that we will join the global movement to fight intolerance and affirm fundamental dignity. That work must truly become our own, if we hope to achieve a world free and equal for all. Today is not an end but a new beginning.‚Äù.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-26T17:01:04Z,world,World news,Legendary Englishman in row over fate of Pakistan school that bears his name,"For decades the school perched on a barren hill overlooking the lush fields of the Chitral valley has borne the name of Geoffrey Langlands, the revered former British army officer who dedicated his twilight years to running a school in one of Pakistan‚Äôs most remote communities. But 25 years after the legendary Englishman took over as principal in this far-flung corner of the Hindu Kush, many local people want nothing more to do with the 97-year-old. Parents and teachers are furious with Langlands after he came roaring out of retirement this month to try to depose his successor, a British writer called Carey Schofield, whom they credit with turning round a failing school. ‚ÄúWhatever he did for the institution is now disgraced,‚Äù said Syed Taufeeq Jan, a retired professor whose grandson attends the school, originally known as the Sayurj public school. ‚ÄúOur demand now is it should be changed back to its former name.‚Äù Expunging the major‚Äôs name from the Langlands school and college would be a sad coda to the career of a man who first came to British India in 1944 and never left the subcontinent. His well-publicised biography includes time serving in the Pakistani army, kidnap by Waziri tribesmen during a stint running a school on the lawless frontier with Afghanistan, and the education of many of the country‚Äôs future rulers at Aitchison college, a grand British-style public school in Lahore. It was some of Aitchison‚Äôs powerful old boys who helped him stage his dramatic attempt this month to oust Schofield from the job she took up just two years ago. One of them, the powerful provincial chief minister, Pervaiz Khattak, pledged to help his old teacher over a lunch meeting in the provincial capital at which Langlands said Schofield was ruining his legacy. Langlands urged another former pupil, the interior minister Chaudhry Nisar, not to renew Schofield‚Äôs visa. The minister, who is currently engaged in a crackdown on foreign aid workers, ‚Äúdid not need much encouragement‚Äù, Langlands said. Langlands then flew from his retirement home in Lahore to Chitral on 15 June and launched a power grab resembling one of the military coups that have plagued the country. Brandishing documents signed in his own name, he claimed to be the ‚Äúowner and founder‚Äù of the college with the authority to reappoint himself as principal, sack the governors, declare himself chairman of the board and lay claim to the control of the school bank account. Parents were horrified to hear he had dismissed Schofield and reappointed seven teachers she had dismissed. Bashir Hussain Azad, a parent, said: ‚ÄúMy son and daughter say that if Madame Carey is not here, they should be withdrawn and shifted to another school, and I agree with them.‚Äù
Nearly 200 parents and all of the school‚Äôs staff have signed petitions calling for the orders to be ignored and for Schofield, who is currently in London waiting for a new visa, to be allowed to return to her job. They say the elderly man was manipulated by a group of aggrieved former teachers who travelled to Lahore to lobby against Schofield earlier in the year. Abdullah, the former vice-principal who leads the group, said of Schofield: ‚ÄúShe left no stone unturned in defaming the great work of Major Langlands and treating loyal teachers who had devoted their lives to this school with contempt.‚Äù But current teachers have nothing but praise for a woman they say transformed a school that had lost its way under an increasingly frail principal who had suffered at least one stroke in his final years in Chitral. They say he was unable to control his staff, many of whom allegedly rarely bothered to take lessons. Students were said to have skipped school entirely or to have left classes to smoke hashish in a nearby gully, nicknamed ‚ÄúTora Bora‚Äù after the cave system in Afghanistan where Osama bin Laden once hid. ‚ÄúThe school was nearly on the verge of collapse,‚Äù said Sher Haider Khan, the director of studies. ‚ÄúIt was financially insecure and discipline was terrible.‚Äù Few signs remain of the school‚Äôs alleged decline, save for graffiti that completely covers the ceilings of some classrooms and a patch of wall on a nearby building that laments: ‚ÄúWe hate our life without Tora Bora.‚Äù Staff credit Schofield with stamping out truancy and repairing the school‚Äôs parlous finances. Haider said teachers were no longer going for months without their once near subsistence-level salaries and had responded well to more demanding standards.
Schofield said a clash with a man she describes as a ‚Äúderanged legend‚Äù was ‚Äúsort of inevitable‚Äù given the changes that were needed and his habit of constantly phoning up the teachers. ‚ÄúThe school he created was a scandal,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúEverybody assumed that as an army officer and an Englishman they would be getting all the things they were expecting ‚Äì discipline, order, probity. But they were never there.‚Äù She said Langlands had been unable to accept that anyone other than he could run the school and had been stung by her reports to the board of a school endowment trust on which he sits. ‚ÄúThe amazing thing is he how bloody cunning he is,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe is supposed to be desperately frail, sitting in quiet seclusion, but actually he was up to all kinds of evil and schemes to undermine me.‚Äù Schofield, the author of a book on the Pakistani army, is only the latest in a long line of adventurous Brits who have worked at a school that now educates 900 girls and boys on four separate sites. ‚ÄúWe deliberately tried to recruit British tourists to come and help us set up the school,‚Äù said Javed Majid, who founded the original primary school when he served as district commissioner in the late 1980s. Few highly qualified Pakistanis from outside Chitral were interested in moving to the former princely state that had always been somewhat removed from the rest of the country, Majid said, so he turned to buccaneering Brits attracted by the romance of the frontier region with Afghanistan. Only two small aircraft visit the town each week and heavy snowfall can make the full day‚Äôs drive to the capital, Islamabad, impossible in winter. To help raise the status of an underdeveloped part of the country, all lessons are exclusively in English, still the essential language of the professional and government elite.
‚ÄúIt used to be said Chitral was a good place only to find servants, not professionals. That was the stature of Chitral back then, but now the valley is producing engineers and doctors,‚Äù Majid said. The school greatly expanded after Langlands took over in 1988, in large part due to funds he raised through his powerful connections. Speaking by phone from his retirement home in the grounds of Aitchison college, Langlands claimed Schofield‚Äôs handling of school finances had forced him to act. ‚ÄúShe was spending a lot of money very freely,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI was an orphan and had no money in my upbringing so I have been very careful about handling money, from birth to my present age of 97.‚Äù Langlands insists he had the legal authority to seize control ‚Äúbecause the school has my name to it‚Äù, something his detractors and the board of governors say is nonsense. ‚ÄúFor a nearly 100-year-old man to come and announce he has sacked the principle at a stroke of a pen is totally extraordinary,‚Äù said Zafar Hayat, a lawyer and parent of children at the school. ‚ÄúHe is neither the founder nor owner of the school and this act has no sanctity in law.‚Äù Amin Ul Haq, the district commissioner, who assisted Langlands on his recent swoop on Chitral, has been stung by the backlash from students, who held a demonstration outside his office. He now says the school remains under the charge of Schofield but that the provincial education chief will soon visit to decide ‚Äúthe future course of action‚Äù. Siraj Ul-Mulk, a school governor and member of Chitral‚Äôs former royal family, said the major‚Äôs once-sainted reputation in the valley had been ruined. ‚ÄúThe saddest thing is he is destroying his own legacy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt blame him because he doesn‚Äôt know what he is doing.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-26T16:56:10Z,world,World news,"Terrorist attacks in Tunisia, Kuwait and France stun three continents","A volley of terror attacks has struck across three continents, leaving dozens dead in Tunisia, Kuwait and France, just days after the militant group Islamic State issued a call to arms for the holy month of Ramadan. Near-simultaneous attacks targeted tourists at a hotel resort in Tunisia and Shia worshippers in a mosque in Kuwait, and, reportedly, a delivery company boss at a factory in France. The trio of attacks marks a new low point in the global terror onslaught. In Tunisia, at least 37 people were shot dead in the country‚Äôs deadliest terrorist attack. In Kuwait, 25 were killed and more than 200 injured in a suicide bomb ‚Äì the first attack in the country since 2005. In France, the victim was decapitated, the first time that grim method had been used in the country. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Kuwait incident, but the affiliation and inspiration of the other attackers remained unclear. Isis‚Äôs chief spokesman, Abu Mohammad al-Adnani, called on jihadists earlier this week to ‚Äúmake the month of Ramadan a calamity on the apostates‚Äù by stepping up attacks and seeking ‚Äúmartyrdom‚Äù. All three attacks were launched early on Friday morning. In Tunisia, the health minister said 37 people were killed and 36 wounded ‚Äì mostly tourists ‚Äì in an attack on the Imperial Marhaba hotel at the beach resort town of Sousse, about 93 miles south of Tunis. The gunman approached the resort from the beach, opening fire on sunbathing tourists, before entering the hotel through the pool area. Many of the victims were thought to be British, German and Belgian. The gunman was killed. Suspected accomplices were arrested.
In the Gulf state of Kuwait, Isis claimed responsibility for a suicide attack at the Imam al-Sadiq Shia mosque in the capital‚Äôs centre, which killed 25 people and wounded 202, according to the emirate‚Äôs interior ministry. A militant in a suicide vest blew himself up during Friday prayers. A statement circulated on social media said the attack had targeted a ‚Äúden of polytheism‚Äù. Isis considers Shia Muslims apostates. In France, the government launched a terrorism investigation into an attack in which a man, thought to be the employer of the suspect, was decapitated and dumped at a factory belonging to an American gas company in the country‚Äôs south-east. A suspect, believed to be called Yassin Salhi, was taken into custody. The French interior minister said the suspect had at one time been under investigation for radicalisation, but had no police record. There was no evidence that the near-simultaneous attacks were coordinated, but they highlighted the growing threat of attacks by jihadists, some of them inspired by Isis rhetoric, across Europe, Africa and the Middle East. East Africa meanwhile remains prone to its own brand of Islamic extremism and, in Friday‚Äôs fourth deadly outbreak of violence, the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabaab group attacked an African Union base in Somalia. There were some deaths, although precise numbers were unconfirmed. For Isis, the Kuwait attack ‚Äì and even the suspicion of its involvement in the Tunisian and French episodes ‚Äì is another propaganda coup despite its battlefield losses in Syria. The militants recently lost territory near their Raqqa stronghold in Syria to Kurdish and opposition fighters who have come within 30 miles of the city. They also launched suicidal attacks on the Kurdish enclave of Kobane, which was saved at great cost last year from an Isis onslaught. ‚ÄúThis weekend, the story becomes Isis terror worldwide instead of Isis on the back foot,‚Äù said Michael Weiss, the co-author of Isis: Inside the Army of Terror. ‚ÄúInformation warfare is their greatest asset.

2015-06-26T16:37:46Z,world,World news,"Karenzi Karake: security chief's arrest shows west's 'contempt', says Kagame","The Rwandan president, Paul Kagame, has launched a withering attack on Britain and other western powers after the arrest of his intelligence chief in London. Kagame reminded western governments of their bloody colonial exploitation of Africa and put the arrest down to ‚Äúabsolute arrogance and contempt‚Äù, observing: ‚ÄúThey must have mistaken him for an illegal immigrant.‚Äù The country‚Äôs relations with Britain have been shaken since the head of intelligence, Karenzi Karake, was arrested at Heathrow airport last weekend on a European arrest warrant. He is among 40 people sought on the orders of a Spanish judge over the alleged murder of three Spanish aid workers and revenge massacres of Hutus in the wake of the 1994 genocide. On Thursday, the Rwandan presidency‚Äôs Twitter account ran extracts from a speech to parliament in which Kagame was unusually scathing about the conduct of the west. ‚ÄúPeople think they can take us down but they can never take us out,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are decent people who do not accept injustice. It is history repeating itself in a different form. It is a continuation of slavery, of colonialism, of violence and bigotry. ‚ÄúIt is wagging a finger at the African and telling him ‚Äòthis is where you belong‚Äô. We are no longer the African that belongs there. There are Africans who still belong there, even among us. This is the African they prefer.‚Äù The international community failed to intervene to prevent the genocide 21 years ago. Bill Clinton described it as one of the biggest regrets of his presidency. Kagame has even accused France of having a direct role in the political buildup to the mass atrocity and claimed its troops took an ‚Äúactive‚Äù part in the killings. On Thursday, the president said the ‚Äúreal untold story is they want to change the narrative of what has happened in Rwanda that they were so deeply involved in. They want to mask their responsibility by saying it‚Äôs not us, it is savages of Africa who killed each other.‚Äù Western donors have since poured millions of pounds of aid into rebuilding the east African country, which has become a development success story, despite concerns over lack of democracy and human rights. Kagame enjoys warm relations with Clinton and Tony Blair, although relations with Britain have become strained since it suspended some aid amid concerns over Rwanda‚Äôs role in the conflict in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo. Kagame, whose rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) brought an end to the genocide, asked: ‚ÄúSince when did we become killers? Who has killed more Africans than they have? They have killed millions of Africans. How do we give our lives to save our country and our people and at the end of the day we are killers? ‚ÄúPeople say we are friends and support your development. Do you support my development and take away my dignity? Do you support my development but at the same time hold me in contempt? What right does this country have to arrest him in this manner? None of them have any basis other than absolute arrogance.‚Äù He continued: ‚ÄúAbsolute arrogance and contempt is the only basis for this arrest. They must have mistaken him for an illegal immigrant. The way they treat illegal immigrants is the way they treat all of us. ‚ÄúBlack people have become targets for shooting practice. We cannot accept that people treat us this way just because they can. In the end, we must and will prevail.‚Äù Karake, 54, appeared in a London court on Thursday and was greeted by cheers and applause by supporters as he arrived in the courtroom. A full extradition hearing will take place on 29 and 30 October.

2015-06-26T15:26:31Z,world,World news,"Christine Lagarde, IMF chief with a key role in the Greek debt talks - profile","The former US treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, says she has a ‚Äúlightning-quick wit, a genuine warmth and an ability to bridge divides‚Äù. Alastair Darling, the former British chancellor, also something of a fan, describes her as a ‚Äúformidable operator‚Äù with an unorthodox approach who can ‚Äúcajole people into agreement‚Äù and exercises ‚Äúimmense influence‚Äù.
She will need all of that. Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund and ‚Äì says Forbes magazine ‚Äì the world‚Äôs sixth most powerful woman, is in a delicate position as Greece‚Äôs latest repayment deadline looms and the country seeks a last-ditch deal with its creditors to stave off bankruptcy and exit from the eurozone. The Washington-based IMF has ideological objections to Greece‚Äôs current proposals, which rely mainly on tax increases to boost revenue rather than on spending cuts, arguing that the country‚Äôs tortured economy is already too heavily taxed and further hikes will harm growth. Nor does it feel Athens‚Äô broader plans to revive the economy go nearly far enough. But the organisation is also unhappy with the reluctance of Greece‚Äôs other, European creditors ‚Äì its eurozone partners and the European Central Bank ‚Äì to come up with any concrete proposals on debt relief. The debt total now amounts to about 175% of Greek GDP and the IMF has long felt that without at least some long-term relief ‚Äì writing off a proportion of the debt ‚Äì Greece‚Äôs borrowing is unsustainable. The short-term future of Greece ‚Äì and the integrity of the eurozone ‚Äì may depend on how far Lagarde, a cool, always elegant 59-year-old Frenchwoman, manages to exercise influence, get people talking and bridge divides not only between the leftist Syriza-led Greek government of prime minister Alexis Tsipras and its creditors, but also among the lenders themselves. Lagarde has, though, another imperative. Her term comes to an end next year and whether she decides to seek re-election or return to national politics - she was French finance minister before replacing the disgraced Dominique Strauss-Kahn as IMF chief - she will not want a failed entanglement with Greece on her CV. It was Strauss-Kahn who first committed the IMF to Greece in 2010, after eurozone governments approached the organisation for help in devising a bailout. The fund‚Äôs continued European engagement ‚Äì including its decision to replace much of Greece‚Äôs private-sector borrowing with IMF money in 2012 ‚Äì has been controversial, particularly in developing countries. Lagarde is not afraid to bang heads. She observed caustically last week that the long drawn out, on-off aid-for-reforms talks would benefit from the presence of some ‚Äúadults in the room‚Äù. With Tsipras, however, determined not to backtrack on his anti-austerity election promises and eurozone governments insistent on getting their money back and averting the breakup of the single currency, she will need all the talents her former colleagues ascribe to her. Born in Paris in January 1956, Lagarde‚Äôs parents were both academics. Her father, Robert Lallouette, was a professor of English and her mother, Nicole, a Latin teacher. She famously represented France at synchronised swimming as a teenager, a sport she has said endowed her with the useful political skill of knowing how to ‚Äúgrit your teeth and smile‚Äù. After her baccalaureate and following the death of her father, she spent a year in the US aged 17, studying at a Maryland high school and spending time in Washington as a political intern on Capitol Hill. Back in France, she took degrees in English, labour law and social law at the university of Nanterre, and later a masters in political science in Aix, before returning to the US in 1981 to work for the international law firm Baker & McKenzie. Starting out as an associate specialising in labour, anti-trust and mergers and acquisitions, Lagarde moved through the ranks to become a partner after six years and eventually head of the firm in western Europe. In 1999, she was elected its first woman chairman before being summoned back to France in 2005 by then-president Jacques Chirac to take up her first government post as junior minister for foreign trade. By 2007 she was finance minister, the first woman to hold the post not just in France, but in any of the G8 countries. The Financial Times rated her Europe‚Äôs best finance minister in 2009 and a series of cool, commanding performances at forums such as the G20 raised her international profile further. She took over from Strauss-Kahn at the IMF in July 2011. A convinced vegetarian and a gym, swimming and cycling enthusiast who rarely, if ever, touches alcohol, Lagarde is divorced, with two sons now in their early 30s. Since 2006, she has lived with a Marseille businessman. Her English is as immaculate as her tailored suits (she favours Chanel). Although widely admired by her colleagues ‚Äì Kenneth Rogoff, the IMF‚Äôs former chief economist, describes her as ‚Äúenormously impressive, politically astute and a strong personality‚Äù ‚Äì she has not escaped controversy. A comment to the Guardian in 2012 appearing to confirm that she felt ‚Äúpayback time‚Äù had come for Greece sparked outrage in Athens. She also remains under the cloud of an investigation for negligence over her role as finance minister in taking a long-running damages case brought against the state by businessman Bernard Tapie out of the courts and to an arbitration panel. Tapie was subsequently awarded more than ‚Ç¨200m in damages. Her Paris apartment was searched in 2013 and she was questioned for two days over the affair, but has consistently denied any misconduct. There is no suggestion of personal profit. By turns business-like and ineffably charming, straight-talking and surprisingly funny, Lagarde‚Äôs unusual mix of Gallic charm and Anglo-Saxon effectiveness is undoubtedly better appreciated in international circles than in France.

Stricter rules proposed by the report would mean potential buyers would be judged on the degree to which democratic institutions are in place and how they work, while existing criteria on human rights would be made clearer. ‚ÄúNo other country has today a democracy criterion in its regulations,‚Äù said the commission chairman, Hans Wallmark, a member of Sweden‚Äôs Conservatives, the main opposition party. ‚ÄúThe recipient state‚Äôs democratic status is thus clearly raised as a central condition [for weapons sales],‚Äù he wrote on Friday in an article accompanying the report. The flexibility to weigh foreign policy concerns against security and defence considerations would remain, he said. ‚ÄúRespect for human rights and the receiving state‚Äôs democratic status are key conditions for the licensing process,‚Äù the report states. ‚ÄúIf there are serious and widespread violations of human rights or serious shortcomings in the democratic status of the country, this will be an obstacle to granting authorisation.‚Äù
Sweden would pay a price for higher moral and ethical requirements, said Lena Hjelm-Wall√©n, vice-chair of the investigation and a former Social Democratic foreign minister. ‚ÄúThe potential markets for defence industry will decline,‚Äù she said. Sweden‚Äôs main business daily attacked the proposals in a leader column, arguing that sales of Saab‚Äôs Erieye airborne surveillance system to Saudi Arabia meant that Sweden had maintained a world-class radar capacity enabling it to monitor the entire Baltic from a single plane. Swedish arms exports to Saudi Arabia peaked at SKr2.9bn (then about ¬£275m) in 2011 after the sale of Erieye. The Erieye was at the centre of a diplomatic dispute in March, when Sweden tore up an arms trade agreement with the Saudi government, which in turn broke off diplomatic relations and stopped Sweden‚Äôs foreign minister, Margot Wallstr√∂m, from speaking about human rights to leaders at an Arab League summit. But peace and human rights groups also criticised Friday‚Äôs proposals as too weak and full of loopholes. ‚ÄúThe wording is not sharp enough to stop arms exports to dictatorships,‚Äù Anna Ek, president of the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society, told the TT news agency. ‚ÄúIt will still be possible to sell weapons to countries that violate human rights. It is very disappointing.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf the defence policy considerations can take precedence, then it is possible to interpret them as they wish,‚Äù said Elisabeth L√∂fgren of Amnesty International. ‚ÄúWhen there is only one party to vote for, it‚Äôs not a democracy, therefore both Saudi Arabia and China are dictatorships ‚Äì but we will continue to have discussions with these new rules, and there will be much room for interpretation.‚Äù Despite a global reputation for peacemaking, Sweden has become a major world supplier of weapons, and was ranked third for arms exports per capita last year after Israel and Russia, stirring ethical concerns at home. Welcoming the report, Wallstr√∂m said it would be put out for consultation and it could be a year before it came back to parliament in the form of legislation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-26T15:14:01Z,world,World news,"Terror attacks in Kuwait, France and Tunisia echo Isis methods","Three different attacks, one overall suspect. The wave of killing on Friday will undoubtedly be attributed to Islamic State, which has already reportedly claimed responsibility for one amongst them, with strong indications of a role in the others. Each attack hit a different target in a different way, and underlines the varied nature of a constantly evolving threat. One involved Muslims killing Muslims in the Middle East itself: a bomb in a Shia mosque in Kuwait, a conservative Gulf state with a Sunni Muslim majority. This is part of the horrendous sectarian violence which has increasingly convulsed the region over the last five years and shows no sign of abating. Outright war against Shias ‚Äì seen as apostates by Islamic State ‚Äì is a core aim of the terrorist organisation which goes back to its origins in Iraq a decade or more ago. This is a reminder that the vast proportion of casualties of terrorism are Muslims killed by co-religionists. The second targeted western tourists in Tunisia. Hotels and holidaymakers have been a frequent target in recent years. Western tourists are both an obvious and vulnerable presence in the Islamic world. An attack on a hotel will attract global attention, mark a group‚Äôs influence and badly damage the local tourist industry. Historically such attacks have undermined local support but it seems unlikely Friday‚Äôs attackers would have been bothered by this. The prime suspects for the Sousse attack are militants belonging to fragmented local groups, possibly based in neighbouring Libya and loyal to Isis. Third was the attack on a US-owned gas cylinder plant in south-east France. The culprit in this strike appears to have worked for the victim‚Äôs company, but the French have nevertheless launched a terror investigation. He also appears to fit a profile that has become well established in recent years: a French male aged between 22 and 35 who was either born overseas before coming to France or whose parents migrated from Algeria or Morocco. Some of these attackers have had links to overseas groups; while others have been closer to the classic idea of ‚Äúlone wolves‚Äù. But all have been steeped in a broader environment of violent activism, extreme conservatism, homophobia and anti-semitism for many years before they acted. They are ‚Äúlone actors‚Äù only in terms of the actual organisation and execution of a terrorist attack; their world view is shared by a significant number of people. An increasing number have either been inspired by, or actually fought for, Islamic State. When propagandists of the group tell individuals their duty is to take up arms in European countries ‚Äì especially against the ‚Äúfilthy French‚Äù ‚Äì they know already how receptive some will be to their call to arms. The three strikes came almost exactly on the first anniversary of Islamic State‚Äôs declaration of its caliphate, and it is possible they were coordinated. If so, it would indicate a new level of strategic thinking and capability for Isis. If not, they nevertheless send a potent message: terrorists hope to to give the impression that they can strike at will, everywhere, anywhere. This is clearly not the case: the attack in Europe involved one man; the one in Tunis, a gunman or two. We are still far from the mass casualty attacks of 10 or 12 years ago in Europe. We are also far from the doomsday scenario of highly trained Isis militants making their way to the UK, US or wherever to execute major operations. But the sense of ubiquitous menace inevitably induced by Friday‚Äôs killings will be difficult to dispel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-26T15:05:32Z,world,World news,EU sidestep on migrants will do nothing to curb Mediterranean death toll,"To misquote the first man on the moon: the EU‚Äôs new migration agreement is one small step forwards for European bureaucrats, and one giant leap sideways for mankind. On the plus side, the decision by the majority of EU members to accept 40,000 asylum seekers currently in Italy and Greece is at least a start. With nationalism and xenophobia on the rise throughout Europe, the argument goes, the continent‚Äôs leaders were still brave enough to share at least a fraction of the Italian and Greek burden.
The agreement to welcome 20,000 Syrians and Eritreans who still lie beyond Europe‚Äôs borders is also seen as an important gesture. Resettlement has not hitherto been seen as a major role of the EU. But this move, amid the biggest global refugee crisis since the second world war, is a tiny admission that it might have to become one. But beyond the world of EU tokenism, the two decisions are next to meaningless. The redistribution scheme is voluntary ‚Äì the UK has already said it will not take part ‚Äì and therefore it is unclear how it would function in practice. ‚ÄúIt could work if there is goodwill behind it, but you have to wonder whether it will work,‚Äù said Cathryn Costello, an expert on refugee law at Oxford University‚Äôs Refugee Studies Centre. There are already comparable systems that don‚Äôt work even though they are legally binding, she said. More worryingly still, the 40,000 asylum seekers due to be shared throughout Europe form only a small proportion of the 250,000 migrants likely to land in Greece and Italy this year. Thousands more will continue to arrive in Bulgaria and Hungary, two other EU states that are on the frontline of the migration crisis but which will not be covered by the scheme. So even if all 40,000 asylum seekers are successfully redistributed, the four countries at the EU‚Äôs border will continue to bear the brunt of what is essentially a European crisis. Most significantly, the tiny number of refugees due to be resettled from outside the EU ‚Äì 20,000 ‚Äì will do nothing to curb the death toll in the Mediterranean. Time and again, refugees planning to make the voyage across the sea argue that despite the risks the Mediterranean is a more likely route to safety than the legal routes available to them. So few places are on offer to the four million Syrian refugees eligible for asylum from outside Europe (the UK has taken 187 so far) that the sea seems a more logical option. ‚ÄúOf course I‚Äôm scared, but I don‚Äôt have any choice but this one,‚Äù said Houthayfa, a 21-year-old Syrian cook who plans to go by sea from Egypt in the coming months. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like everything is closed in your face, so there‚Äôs nothing else but the sea. There‚Äôs nothing but the sea as a way to get out.‚Äù The UN gave a cautious welcome to the EU initiative but also stressed that the numbers were a drop in the ocean compared with what was required. ‚ÄúThese are baby steps,‚Äù said Fran√ßois Cr√©peau, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants. ‚ÄúOne has to understand that 20,000 refugees taken by 28 countries is only one-tenth of the number of asylum seekers who arrived in Italy last year. This is a very, very small step forward. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very small number. As the special representative of the secretary general of the UN Peter Sutherland said, I trust that the numbers will go up.‚Äù Crepeau has argued that in order to quell demand for migrant smuggling by sea, western countries need to make a credible commitment to welcoming as many as one million Syrian refugees, rather than a paltry 20,000. To many, the size of this figure sounds fanciful. But spread among Europe‚Äôs total population of 740 million, it does not seem so large. And it seems tiny when compared with the burden the refugee crisis has already placed on Middle Eastern countries such as Lebanon and Jordan. According to UN figures, the former houses a record 232 refugees per 1,000 residents, while the latter, in second place, has 87 per 1,000. Sweden, the most refugee-heavy country in Europe, has 15 per 1,000. Such a grand resettlement programme has been achieved before. After the Vietnam war, more than 1.3 million refugees from Indochina were resettled in Europe, north America and other parts of the northern hemisphere. To begin to match those numbers would be a giant step forward, but it would not be an unprecedented one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-26T14:25:15Z,world,World news,"Never mind the hadedas: ex-diplomat plays silent 4'33"" in Johannesburg","An American sits at a piano before a South African audience, leaves the keys untouched and concentrates fantastically hard on not making a sound for more than four a half minutes. He is one sneeze away from disaster. This will be the scene on Sunday when Brooks Spector delivers composer John Cage‚Äôs avant-garde classic 4‚Äô33‚Äù, which does not contain a single note, in what is believed to be its first public performance in Africa outside a university campus. The experimental ‚Äúsilent composition‚Äù in three movements has been described both as a modernist masterpiece and as a pretentious stunt, provoking admiration, amusement, bemusement, derision and outrage since its 1952 premiere at the Maverick concert hall near Woodstock, New York. ‚ÄúYou could hear the wind stirring outside during the first movement,‚Äù Cage once recalled. ‚ÄúDuring the second, raindrops began pattering the roof, and during the third people themselves made all kinds of interesting sounds as they talked or walked out.‚Äù
There is likely to be plenty of background noise in Johannesburg, South Africa‚Äôs commercial capital. ‚ÄúNo doubt there will be a couple of burglar alarms or car alarms, as well as hadedas [a notoriously noisy bird] making a couple of cackling sounds,‚Äù Spector said. ‚ÄúThe normal tendency among audiences in South Africa is to be a little more audible. I guess the composer‚Äôs objective will be achieved if someone stands up and says: ‚ÄòThis is nonsense!‚Äô and storms out. It will become part of the legend.‚Äù Cage, who died in 1992 aged 79, was defiantly proud of the conceptual work, which has stood the test of time. BBC Radio 3 broadcast it live from London‚Äôs Barbican Centre in 2004, and an app was launched last year allowing users to hear recordings of it from all over the world. Past renditions can be viewed on YouTube. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs eerie,‚Äù said Spector, 65. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no other way to describe it. Audiences are trying to figure out what to do with a cough. How do they shuffle their feet without disturbing the profound silence? Four minutes 33 seconds is an eternity if you‚Äôre not doing anything. My wife has been coaching me how to sit absolutely still and silent for minutes on end. I now worry about catching a cold so I sneeze and disturb the equanimity of the whole thing.‚Äù According to the Cage scholar Larry Solomon, 4‚Äô33‚Äù was conceived as a response to canned music: the muzak played in department stores or lifts is typically about four and a half minutes long. Spector insists that, far from being a case of emperor‚Äôs new clothes, the sound of silence has a long and distinguished history. ‚ÄúPeople argue about whether 4‚Äô33‚Äù is a joke or incomprehensible high concept music theory or the ultimate zen piece,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúCage generally saw the importance of silence in music. It was like he was working through a closet throwing things away before he found the one piece of great clothing he really wanted. ‚ÄúIf you listen to a late Beethoven quartet, he was finding interesting things to say with silence. John Coltrane and Miles Davis became enamoured with this idea of silence as well. I‚Äôm treating 4‚Äô33‚Äù as a serious thing rather than a bad joke. You have to take on board the idea that a performance is not only the sounds a musician deliberately makes.‚Äù The work is little known in South Africa. Experts say truncated versions have been staged in Cape Town in the 1970s and more recently at a school in Johannesburg. A full performance was given by the South African pianist Jill Richards at Johannesburg‚Äôs Wits University about 20 years ago. Richards recalled: ‚ÄúPeople were seriously annoyed, mostly. They seemed affronted ‚Ä¶ like they were being taken the piss out of, and really struggled with the idea of the world as an inherently sonic musical space.‚Äù Spector‚Äôs rendition of 4‚Äô33‚Äù will be performed at a free event on Sunday at the German-backed Goethe-Institut, along with works by Cage‚Äôs fellow modernists Pierre Boulez of France and Karlheinz Stockhausen of Germany. There will be a panel debate, a ‚Äúspeakers‚Äô corner‚Äù encouraging audience feedback, and four new pieces by young Johannesburg composers. It is an unexpected musical debut for Spector, a former diplomat who settled in South Africa in 2001. He is now better known as a political commentator and journalist for the Daily Maverick. He studied the piano for five years until the age of 12, but says he ‚Äúeither convinced my parents I had no talent or they should stop wasting money‚Äù. On one occasion his attempt to sing an opera aria in the shower prompted neighbours to pound on the door out of concern that a cat was in torment. ‚ÄúBut eventually, with 4‚Äô33‚Äù, the opportunity presented itself and I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMy wife says I won‚Äôt be able to fit through a door because my head will be swollen once I‚Äôm a ‚Äòperformer‚Äô. Can‚Äôt sing, can‚Äôt dance, so this is perfect for me.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-26T13:49:50Z,world,World news,Spanish interior minister grilled over flights for his dog in government plane,"His portfolio ranges from migration to public security. But the burning question facing Spain‚Äôs interior minister this week was: how does his dog get around, and is it in the government plane? In a written question submitted to the conservative People‚Äôs party this week, the opposition Socialists asked whether Jorge Fern√°ndez D√≠az‚Äôs official car or plane had ever been used exclusively to transport Lola, his small white dog. They asked: ‚ÄúWas the official transportation of the ministry of the interior, be it aerial or terrestrial, used to exclusively transport the dog Lola, who belongs to the minister of the interior?‚Äù The question was sparked by rumours circulating in the ministry, said Antonio Trev√≠n, one of the Socialist MPs who signed off on the written question. ‚ÄúWe had information that for the past few months there had been worries about the minister using public resources, like official transportation ‚Äì both air and land ‚Äì for the exclusive use of his dog.‚Äù
On Wednesday, Pilar Grande, a Socialist, asked the minister about the issue in the lower house of parliament. Holding up a picture of her own dog, Kira, she noted that her dog travelled in a kennel in the cargo hold of planes. She said: ‚ÄúCan you guarantee that you do the same with your dog Lola?‚Äù ‚ÄúIf this is the level of control put to the minister of the interior by the Socialist party, it‚Äôs cause for concern,‚Äù Fern√°ndez D√≠az replied, just as his allotted speaking time ran out. The minister later denied the rumours. ‚ÄúMy little dog has never travelled alone on an official plane,‚Äù he told El Pa√≠s, providing the newspaper with tickets that had been recently bought for the dog to travel on Spain‚Äôs high-speed rail network. His response was insufficient for Trev√≠n, who pointed out that it was provided to the media rather than in parliament. He said: ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt officially responded to the question.‚Äù Trev√≠n vowed to publicise the answer as soon as the Socialists obtained it, and added: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not rushing to any judgments. We‚Äôre just asking for clarification.‚Äù If the rumours turned out to be unfounded, he said, then he and his colleagues would have helped clear up the issue. Trev√≠n said: ‚ÄúOur obligation as the opposition is to monitor the government and this is just another task of keeping the government in check.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-26T13:27:52Z,world,World news,Dalai Lama's Glastonbury appearance prompts security fears,"Security fears have been raised about the Dalai Lama‚Äôs appearance at Glastonbury as protesters around the UK are expected to demonstrate against the exiled spiritual leader. He is due to give a talk to festivalgoers in the Green Fields area of Glastonbury site on Sunday, before travelling to Aldershot in Hampshire, where he will open a Buddhist community centre. His four-day visit will be marked by protests by the International Shugden Community (ISC), which claims the Dalai Lama, 79, is involved in the persecution of Shugden Buddhists in Tibetan exile. Chinese officials have also expressed their disapproval and on Friday told Glastonbury organisers that inviting him to visit one of Europe‚Äôs largest music festivals was tantamount to giving him a platform to engage in anti-China activities. Lu Kang, a foreign ministry spokesman, told a daily news briefing that he was not aware of the details of what the Dalai Lama was doing at the festival. He said, however, that ‚ÄúChina resolutely opposes any country, organisation, body or individual giving any kind of platform to the 14th Dalai Lama to engage in anti-China splittist activities‚Äù. David Cameron‚Äôs spokeswoman was asked whether the prime minister was concerned about Chinese displeasure over the Dalai Lama‚Äôs appearance at Glastonbury, but he said it was an issue for the festivalgoers. Activists on social media have targeted the Glastonbury hashtag, using it to send out anti-Dalai Lama tweets. A protest will be staged at King‚Äôs Cross station in London on Saturday, and more than 500 ISC protesters are expected to turn out on Monday when the Dalai Lama visits Aldershot football club. The ISC protesters, who earlier this month demonstrated against his appearance in Sydney, claim religious intolerance and segregation, including signs above shops and medical facilities refusing service to Shugden Buddhists. One website called on the Tibetan leader to accept four points, including ‚Äúto allow anyone who wishes to practice Dorje Shugden the freedom to do so‚Äù. Shugden Buddhists say they have been mistreated in Tibetan exile communities because the Dalai Lama has banned them from worshipping the fierce spirit known as Dolgyal or Shugden. An ISC spokeswoman said the Dalai Lama had escaped media scrutiny because of his ‚Äúcult celebrity status‚Äù. She said: ‚ÄúThis humble Buddhist monk, as he likes to call himself, makes vast sums of money out of Buddha‚Äôs teachings, sports Gucci loafers and Rolex watches and stays in five-star hotels, whilst applying ruthless religious intolerance towards his own people who live in poverty, hardship and fear.‚Äù Tim Loughton, a Tory MP and part of the all-party parliamentary group on Tibet, said the Dalai Lama had been afforded no police protection and raised concerns that the spiritual leader‚Äôs free speech was being put at risk. He said he had written to the home secretary, Theresa May, to request police protection for him. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs extraordinary given his status and the fact that every other country, with the exception of Latvia, have provided security,‚Äù Loughton said. An alliance of 10 UK Buddhist organisations has formally dissociated themselves from the protests saying they were ‚Äúvery concerned about the protesters‚Äô aggressive, misleading and unethical behaviour‚Äù. In an open letter, it said that ‚Äúdifferences of opinion among Buddhists should be expressed in a peaceful, respectful, truthful and reasonable manner‚Äù. It claimed the protesters‚Äô aim was to ‚Äúdestroy the religious and moral authority of His Holiness the Dalai Lama‚Äù, adding that ‚Äúthis also suits the Chinese Communist party very well‚Äù. A spokeswoman for the UK‚Äôs Foreign Office said: ‚ÄúThe Dalai Lama is an important religious figure, and he has visited the UK on many occasions. We are aware this is a sensitive issue. It has been raised with us by a number of different groups, including representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese embassy.‚Äù China has arrested a Tibetan man for sharing a picture of the Dalai Lama and the banned Tibetan national flag on the messaging app WeChat, Tibetan-exile media reported on Friday.

2015-06-26T11:39:33Z,world,World news,Northern Ireland gay marriage ban faces judicial review,"The first two couples to become civil partners in the UK have won the right to have the same-sex marriage ban in Northern Ireland subjected to judicial review. A Belfast high court judge ruled on Friday that Grainne Close and Shannon Sickles, and Charles and Henry Flanagan-Kane, should be granted the review, which is set for the autumn. Both couples‚Äô civil partnership ceremonies were held at Belfast city hall, just a short distance from the high court, 10 years ago. The review is likely to be held in November, alongside several other legal challenges taken by gay couples in the region, and who are backed by the Rainbow Project, an LGBT rights organisation. Neither couple was in court for Friday‚Äôs ruling but their barrister and senior counsel representing the Northern Ireland regional government were present to hear Mr Justice Treacy say that he had read the case papers and had already satisfied himself that the matter should proceed to judicial review. ‚ÄúThe applicant has an arguable case,‚Äù he said. Members of the Rainbow Project and Amnesty International were also in court. Others supporting the legal challenge included the former CEO of the Marie Stopes clinic in Belfast Dawn Purvis and the actor Nuala McKeever. Outside court, solicitor Mark O‚ÄôConnor issued a statement on behalf of both couples: ‚ÄúWe are delighted that we have been able to get over the first hurdle in relation to the judicial process and that the judge today has granted leave for us to bring this judicial review. ‚ÄúWe are thankful that the judge has made that decision today. We believe that religious policy and religious views shouldn‚Äôt be affecting public policy. Thankfully today the judge appears to have accepted that there is an arguable case to answer ‚Ä¶ and hopefully we will have success in the future in relation to this matter.‚Äù Prior to the hearing Grainne Close had said: ‚ÄúThis is not a religious issue, it is a human rights issue. That is why we are going to court.‚Äù Close said she and her US partner had been inspired by Ireland‚Äôs overwhelming vote in favour of gay marriage last month and the joyous scenes that greeted the result of the referendum at Dublin castle. The Rainbow Project‚Äôs director, John O‚ÄôDoherty, welcomed Treacy‚Äôs ruling. ‚ÄúWe are pleased that this case is progressing and that it will likely be heard alongside our client‚Äôs case challenging the failure of the Northern Ireland government to recognise their lawful marriage. ‚ÄúThe current illogical patchwork of marriage laws created by the Westminster government is placing LGBT people in Northern Ireland at an inexcusable disadvantage and we hope that the courts will agree and find that there must be a harmonisation of marriage laws across the UK.‚Äù A Sinn F√©in motion on marriage equality was defeated in April, with 47 Northern Ireland assembly members voting in support, but 49 unionists against. Even if there had been a small majority in favour, the Democratic Unionist party would have exercised a special veto drawn up under devolution. The petition of concern rule allows any party to veto legislation if it can argue the law would not have sufficient cross-community or Protestant/Catholic support. Earlier this month, 20,000 trade unionists staged a rally in Belfast city centre to support gay marriage in Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK where LGBT couples cannot be married.

Officers have warned that the rhea bird, which has been missing for four days, poses a very real threat to the public. The male bird escaped from a farm in the village of Carlton-in-Lindrick between Monday evening and midday on Tuesday through an open gate. South Yorkshire police joined the search on Friday after the on-the-run rhea was spotted in Rotherham. A South Yorkshire police spokesman said: ‚ÄúPolice in Rotherham are currently searching in the Rother Valley area and surrounding land, following reports of a sighting of the aggressive rhea from Nottinghamshire. ‚ÄúThe bird has also been sighted in the Dinnington area. Officers are there to ensure that there is no risk to members of the public and the bird is located and captured as soon as possible.‚Äù Dinnington is about five miles north of the bird‚Äôs home village. The rhea, a flightless bird native to South America, can run at speeds of about 30mph. Inspector Paul Peatfield from Nottinghamshire police has said the bird ‚Äúposes a very real threat to the public due to its size, aggressive nature and the unfamiliar surroundings it could find itself in‚Äù.
Owner Alex MacDonald, 24, told Sky News that the bird had been spotted at a college in Dinnington. ‚ÄúThey have a smallholding at the college where they keep two female rhea themselves,‚Äù said MacDonald ‚ÄúThe thinking behind it is that he could be responding to hearing their call as it is mating season.‚Äù He has expressed fears that the bird may have been stolen and said the family are going through CCTV from the farm where they also keep alpacas and goats.

2015-06-26T10:30:05Z,world,World news,'Offensively tasteless' Mother Canada statue plan sparks outrage against PM,"A plan to erect a 10-storey statue in a national park on one of Canada‚Äôs most scenic shorelines has prompted outrage and sparked a growing political row as the country heads towards a general election this fall. The statue of Mother Canada ‚Äì a cloaked female figure with her arms outstretched towards the Atlantic Ocean ‚Äì is intended to honour the country‚Äôs soldiers who died overseas. But growing anger over the plan has made it a new focus of opposition to the increasingly unpopular government of Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper. The proposed monument is an awkwardly remodelled, vastly upscaled version of an earlier statue, known as Canada Bereft, which adorns the memorial to the country‚Äôs first world war dead near Vimy, France. The design has been widely lambasted both for its design and its proposed location in Cape Breton Highlands national park. In an editorial this week, the Globe and Mail newspaper described it as ‚Äúoffensively tasteless‚Äù and a ‚Äúhubristically arrogant act of arrogant unoriginality‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe bigger-is-better approach to art is best left to Stalinist tyrants, theme park entrepreneurs and insecure municipalities hoping to waylay bored drive-by tourists,‚Äù the paper wrote. The project is the brainchild of Toronto businessman Tony Trigiani, who was inspired after a chance visit to a Canadian war cemetery in Italy and set up the Never Forgotten National Memorial Foundation to realise the plan. The initiative gained early and enthusiastic support from the Harper government, which has donated the necessary public land and $100,000 from its parks budget to help erect the colossus on a rocky spit along the Cabot Trail, eastern Canada‚Äôs most popular scenic drive. The foundation hopes to raise $25m to complete the project, in part by selling corporate sponsorships that will be prominently acknowledged on the site. Growing criticism in the nation‚Äôs media has helped swing opinion against the grandiose scheme, but opponents fear the fate of rocky, windswept Green Cove is already sealed.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre pleased with the momentum,‚Äù said Sean Howard, spokesman for Friends of Green Cove. ‚ÄúWhat we don‚Äôt know is how much time we have. Our worst fear is that they‚Äôre going to send the bulldozers in before the federal election this fall.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut until Green Cove becomes concrete cove,‚Äù Howard added, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to keep fighting.‚Äù Trigiani‚Äôs Never Forgotten National Memorial Foundation and the government hope to have the colossus up by 2017, the sesquicentennial of Canadian Confederation and also the centennial of the Battle of Vimy Ridge. In addition to the statue, the monument will include such amenities as the Commemorative Ring of True Patriot Love, the True North Commemorative Square and the With Glowing Hearts National Sanctuary ‚Äì all named after the English lyrics of O Canada, the national anthem. Howard accuses the monument of a ‚Äúkitsch glorification of war‚Äù, but local opponents are also angered by the speed with which the project is to be executed. ‚ÄúYou have to have a very strange process to get through such a strange product,‚Äù Howard said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hair-raising how fast they want to do it.‚Äù ‚ÄúA significant majority of those who are engaged with the issue believe that the statue either shouldn‚Äôt be built anywhere or for sure shouldn‚Äôt be plopped down in a beautiful national park,‚Äù Howard said. A spokesman for Parks Canada declined to answer questions about the monument, describing it as ‚Äúprivately funded‚Äù and referring inquiries to the Never Forgotten Foundation. Trigiani, president of the foundation, declined a request to be interviewed. With criticism of the monument going national, the most articulate opponent remains Cape Breton resident Valerie Bird, 93, who served as an auxilliary with the royal air force in the Middle East during the second world war. ‚ÄúIt is vulgar and ostentatious,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt certainly doesn‚Äôt belong in a national park, and I don‚Äôt think its going to do a darn thing for veterans.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think the idea of this horrible thing offends veterans,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúI find it difficult to find words. This is a monstrosity.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-26T09:36:49Z,world,World news,From Deep State to Islamic State by Jean-Pierre Filiu,"‚ÄúIf you think you understand Lebanon, you haven‚Äôt been properly briefed‚Äù. Thus went the advice dispensed by the spokesman for the UN peacekeeping force in the wild south of the country in the mid-1980s. The same worldly-wise adage applies these days to the entire Arab region, wracked by collapsing states, terrorism, sectarianism, proxy wars and alliances of the strangest bedfellows. It takes patience, clarity and perspective to explain the whole grim picture and the links between its constituent parts. These qualities are on impressive display in an important new book by the French scholar Jean-Pierre Filiu. His particular skill is to describe the development, survival and resurgence of the Arab ‚Äúdeep state,‚Äù the security agencies that have kept it going and the ‚Äúmonster they helped create‚Äù - in its most extreme form the jihadis of the Islamic state (Isis). Filiu traces how autocrats in Syria, Egypt and Yemen used their experience of managing internal dissent to unleash their own thugs - different names in different countries, same vicious methods - to enforce their will when the call went up to reform or change their regimes. Anyone who experienced the heady events of 2011 will recognise the bitter truth in his admission that the excitement of the Arab spring obscured the prospects of successful counter-revolution. I thought I had seen it all from the Arab despots. Their perversity, their brutality, their voracity. But I was still underestimating their ferocity and their readiness to literally burn down their country in order to cling to absolute power. Following the departure of Hosni Mubarak, counter-revolution triumphed in Egypt with the repression of the Muslim Brotherhood. The overthrow of Mohammed Morsi, compared with the success of Rachid Ghannouchi in Tunisia, provided an instructive lesson, Filiu argues: Islamists who succeed at the ballot box, in complex and volatile circumstances, must not take their electoral victories as a ‚Äúblank cheque.‚Äù To ignore that is to invite the backlash that brought Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi to power and forged a reality even worse than under Mubarak. The guardians of the status quo were ready and waiting across the region. Fighting domestic enemies - Kurds in Turkey, armed Islamists in Algeria, Libya and Egypt, separatists in Yemen - had helped keep the operators of the ‚Äúmukhabarat state‚Äù on their toes throughout the 1990s. Opaque, oil-fuelled budgets helped line the pockets of their masters and their crony capitalist friends. The 9/11 attacks, in Filiu‚Äôs compelling analysis, were a bonanza for the Arab dictators and their ‚Äúsecurity mafias,‚Äù who cooperated willingly with George Bush‚Äôs ‚Äúglobal war on terror.‚Äù Rendition and torture were the backdrop to Tony Blair‚Äôs grubby flirtation with Muammar Gaddafi. In Yemen Ali Abdullah Saleh tightened his grip on an ever-expanding security apparatus in the battle against al-Qaida while secretly colluding with the terrorists to keep their menace usefully alive. Egypt proved its enduring worth to the US as the guardian of the peace treaty with Israel. The master, though was Bashar al-Assad. After the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, he backed the Sunni insurgency next door and used the post-Saddam chaos to justify repression at home. Ali Mamluk, one of his top security chiefs, famously met US officials and boasted of Syria‚Äôs ability in penetrating terrorist groups. In 2011 Assad first denied the existence of popular and mostly peaceful protests and then blamed them on captured ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù who ‚Äúconfessed‚Äù to their crimes on camera. He carried out what Filiu calls ‚Äúa highly selective amnesty‚Äù - releasing Islamists from prison: one went to Iraq to join al-Qaida and later founded Jabhat al-Nusra, its Syrian affiliate. Assad‚Äôs ‚Äúself-fulfilling prophecy‚Äù became true. Iraq‚Äôs Nouri al-Maliki, like Assad a close ally of Iran, helped fuel a vicious Sunni insurgency by his unbridled Shia sectarianism. The outcome, promoted by the mayhem in Syria, is a transnational jihadi movement that morphed into Isis, captured Mosul and declared its ‚Äúcaliphate‚Äù a year ago. It is unclear how it could have turned out differently given that Arab leaders were determined to hold on to power at any price. Support for their moderate opponents - in the west at least - was limited and halting. Saudi and Gulf backing recklessly promoted extremists - but so did the impunity for Assad‚Äôs chemical weapons attacks in 2013. Deep-seated suspicion of Islamists played a role too, especially in Egypt. Spring was followed by winter. Yet the answer, Filiu concludes bravely, has to be more democracy, not less, not a fatalistic acceptance that change can never come to the Middle East. ‚ÄúThe Arab people are not doomed to remain pawns, the perpetual victims of a deadly game between their dictators and the jihadis.‚Äù From Deep State to Islamic State: The Arab Counter-Revolution and its Jihadi Legacy, Jean-Pierre Filiu. www.hurstpublishers.com",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-26T08:41:36Z,world,World news,Japan joins with former foes to flex its muscles as it eyes China's rise,"It was American soldiers held captive by Japanese troops during the second world war who first dug through the thick, damp mud to build an airstrip on the Philippine island of Palawan. Now, in 2015, two spy planes, one Japanese and one American, stand side by side on that same runway. Conducting joint training activities with the US-supported Philippine Navy this month, the Japanese have finally made it back ‚Äî this time with smiles and handshakes ‚Äî to join up with their former enemies and resist a common foe: China.
All three countries contest Beijing‚Äôs land reclamation on islands in the disputed South China Sea, where it has built military installations to help bolster its claim. The Philippines argues it owns some of these islands while Tokyo and Washington fear China‚Äôs expanding influence in the region ‚Äî and the potential for it to block a key sea route for roughly ¬£3.17tn in trade. These fears have brought 21 sweating Japanese pilots and engineers in grass-green jumpsuits back to Palawan this week, where they mingled and posed for selfies on the runway with their Filipino counterparts, in darker, greyer attire at Antonio Bautista air base. It was first time the Japanese military had conducted training operations in the south-east Asian country since Imperial Japan surrendered in 1945 following a three-year occupation of the Philippines. Their troops were pushed out by Americans allied with guerrilla Filipino resistance forces. A joint-mission in a Japanese P3-C Orion surveillance plane with a smaller Philippine Navy Islander aircraft over the South China Sea on Tuesday was sold by Philippines Lieutenant Commander Lued Lincuna as practice for potential humanitarian coordination, not to resist China. But the message to Beijing is clear ‚Äî a symbolic and historic partnership against China‚Äôs role in waters 80 miles off the west coast of Palawan, an island state in the Philippines on the edge of the South China Sea. ‚ÄúWe are conducting this exercise to enhance our interoperability, which means once we are joined, we go together,‚Äù Lincuna said at the air base, surrounded by dense tropical forrest. ‚ÄúIt is the first time we fly together,‚Äù he said, adding that the exercise was conducted ‚Äúoutside territorial waters‚Äù west of Palawan. That means the South China Sea.
China is furious and the state news agency Xinhua this week ran an editorial piece calling Japan‚Äôs arrival in the Philippines as ‚Äúthe latest sequel to Tokyo‚Äôs meddling in the South China Sea.‚Äù ‚ÄúBy muddying the waters in the South China Sea, Tokyo also aims to divert increasingly intensive global attention on Japan‚Äôs lack of remorse over its atrocities during World War II, nearly 70 years after its surrender,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúJapan, which is not a party to the disputes in South China Sea, should abandon all attempts to stir waves in the area.‚Äù But in the Philippines, where the older generation remembers hiding in the jungle from passing battalions of Japanese troops and vine-covered stone plaques honour those killed in massacres, the presence of Japanese boots has, interestingly, not stirred similar outrage. ‚ÄúWe Filipinos have very short memories,‚Äù joked one woman in Puerto Princesa, the town where the air base is located. Some also have Japanese blood ‚Äî the children of Filipino women and Japanese soldiers who were based here. As the Allies retook the Philippines, isolated Japanese soldiers fled into the dense, mountainous jungle and only emerged years later. On Palawan island, locals joke there might still be some hiding, waiting for the world to move on while unaware of the the fact that it has. And with the military complaining that it is one of the weakest in Asia, the Philippines feels it needs Tokyo as a buffer against China, two months before the 70th anniversary of Japan‚Äôs surrender. In Puerto Princesa, locals wear t-shirts stating ‚ÄúThe Spratlys will never be conquered,‚Äù referring to the band of islands closest to the Philippines where Chinese warships now patrol.
Jennifer Berto, who works in a clothes and jewellery shop, says her graphic design artist made Spratly t-shirts following high demand from locals and American tourists. ‚ÄúThis is our new design,‚Äù she said at her shop in Puerto Princesa, holding a t-shirt with ‚ÄúSpratly belongs to us‚Äù written on it. ‚ÄúPeople on Palawan support the navy because the islands are in the west Philippine sea,‚Äù she said. She had not heard of the Japanese operation but was pleased they were here. ‚ÄúHow nice,‚Äù she said, smiling. The Philippine defence secretary, Voltaire Gazmin, said this week that Japan should become further involved with Manila‚Äôs military, arguing for a visiting forces agreement which would allow Japanese troops to be stationed in the Philippines, similar to a deal with Washington, which has naval ships in Filipino ports. ‚ÄúIt would be ironic if we cannot do exercises with Japanese forces when Japan is one of the only two countries ‚Äì the other one being the United States ‚Äì which are strategic partners of the Philippines,‚Äù Gazmin said on Wednesday. An end to Japanese pacifism For Japan, its militarised return to the world stage is a cautious one. After its defeat, Japan‚Äôs 1947 constitution ‚Äî which was largely written by US occupation officials ‚Äî forbade the formation of a traditional military force. The country has a self defence force which is restricted to protecting the mainland. This has been used only when conflicts abroad are considered a potential threat at home and Japan has deployed troops to Afghanistan and Iraq. The push to restart its military after so many years of pacifism is down to one man: Japan‚Äôs prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who defied public opinion a year ago to overturn the country‚Äôs defence policy and make it easier for troops to fight overseas. Abe and his supporters want to go even further, arguing for a more active military in the wake of China‚Äôs assertiveness. China and Japan have their own dispute over the Senkakus ‚Äì known in China as the Diaoyu Islands ‚Äì in the East China Sea. And although Japan does not claim any islands in the South China Sea it wants to make sure the area is not controlled by Beijing. Ian Storey, from Singapore‚Äôs Institute of South East Asian Studies, says roughly 85% to 90% of Japan‚Äôs energy supplies come through the South China Sea which Tokyo fears could be blocked by Beijing. ‚ÄúAny threat to the maritime trade through the South China Sea seems existential to the Japanese,‚Äù he said on the phone from Singapore. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see a continuation of this trend. This dispute is a long way from being resolved. Japan will continue to step up its support for the Philippines and Vietnam and maybe some other countries in south-east Asia.‚Äù
Malaysia, Brunei, Vietnam, Taiwan also claim islands in the South China Sea, while China claims most. The naval corridor is thought to have oil and gas reserves. And Tokyo has also promised patrol boats to Vietnam, which itself is looking to pump up its military hardware to deter China. ‚ÄúThe Japanese can honestly say this is not about the South China Sea, this about south-east Asian nations improving their maritime security. But of course, it‚Äôs really about improving their capacity to be able to know what‚Äôs going on,‚Äù Storey says. A New War of Bravado Japan‚Äôs return to the South China Sea, where the carcasses of world war two ships lie in its reefs, has compounded a crisis that has led to the militarisation of all countries involved. The risk of conflict is significant. Seventy Vietnamese soldiers were killed in a 1988 naval battle with China over the Johnson South Reef. And in 2001, a Chinese F-8 fighter collided with a US Navy EP-3 reconnaissance plane. In May this year, Chinese and Vietnamese ships collided as Beijing tried to set up an oil rig. Oil survey ships operating in Reed Bank, close to the Philippines, have increasingly been harassed by Chinese vessels and Manila is beefing up its military in the area, increasing the threat of conflict. At the forefront of this is Oyster Bay, a naturally protected cove with a deep harbour capable of hosting large warships. On the western side of Palawan, the bay‚Äôs biggest selling point is that it opens directly into the South China Sea. President Benigno Aquino has called the area the ‚Äúfrontline of our territorial defence operations‚Äù.
Philippine officials say the bay, which is protected from the monsoons by its high mountains, will be used to host the country‚Äôs two large warships and act as a strategic base for the United States to rotate troops and ships, who are presently stuck on the other side of the island. A new security pact signed during a visit by the US president, Barack Obama, last year should also allow a greater American military presence on Filipino soil, including on expanded bases. Oyster Bay is only accessible by sea but once a connecting road is complete, officials say the major work can be done. Fishermen who live deep in a mangrove-lined inlet took the Guardian out into Ulugan Bay, which leads to Oyster Bay. They did this in small ‚Äúpump boats‚Äù, a 15-foot canoe with two stabilising bamboo stalk, fish in the area which is full of coral reefs and protected waters. The fishermen say the navy has warned them not to approach the inlet, although several still anchor nearby to catch fish living in the cove. Two Philippine Navy patrol boats cruised in the area during the trip. Inside Oyster Bay, a concrete jetty and landing platform stretches out into the deepest waters in order for bigger ships to dock. A boathouse and a water tank are all that have been built until the road is finished and construction can begin. A snake hung from a overhanging tree and birds skimmed the calm water.
Further back in the dense jungle the Guardian found a number of workmen. Cement trucks roared down the roughly three miles of paved road, and labourers, wiping their faces with dusty t-shirts, mixed concrete while furiously pushing ahead to complete the road so Oyster Bay naval base can be built. This appears to be a race against time. A hundred miles out to sea, China is working fast, dredging thousands of tonnes of sand from the seabed to create islands. The Philippines and its allies have been showing their strength this week, flying over the South China Sea and conducting military exercises. Many hope that is remains just a show but the militarisation of the area is a tinder box. ‚ÄúIf we see more Japanese aircraft and ships operating in the area,‚Äù says Yoel Sano, Head of Political Risk at BMI Research, ‚Äúthen there will ‚Äì mainly by law of numbers ‚Äì be a greater likelihood of some sort of ‚Äòincident‚Äô or clash between them and their Chinese counterparts.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-26T07:00:01Z,world,World news,How Britain's khat ban devastated an entire Kenyan town,"In a quiet and unassuming town tucked away in a hilly part of eastern Kenya, the British home secretary Theresa May‚Äôs name is spoken with barely concealed anger. Since her role in the ban of the town‚Äôs most valuable export, she‚Äôs become a universally vilified figure. For more than two decades, Maua enjoyed booming business propelled by the growth and sale of khat, known locally as miraa, a popular herb whose leaves and stems are chewed for the mild high they offer. But last year the UK, home to one of khat‚Äôs biggest markets, declared the stimulant a class C drug and banned all imports, prompting Maua‚Äôs rapid descent into economic purgatory. Since the early 1990s, Britain has imported between 2,500 to 2,800 tonnes a year, according to the Home Affairs committee. Although in its initial findings the committee could not find a compelling health or social reason to ban khat, May‚Äôs argument ‚Äì that continuing to allow trade in the UK would spawn off an illegal export corridor to other European countries where it is banned ‚Äì won out in what became a controversial cultural debate.
Now, a year after the legislation was signed, residents in Maua have been hit hard by a shrinking local economy that has left many facing poverty. Losses Edward Muruu is one of the earliest pioneers of the khat export trade. A retired headmaster at a local primary school, he says he has experienced unprecedented losses since the ban came into effect. ‚ÄúI used to ferry miraa (khat) from Maua to Nairobi four times a week using 27 Toyota Hilux trucks, where it was repackaged for export. I used to make around ¬£2,100 a month. Now I am lucky if I bring in ¬£250 per month,‚Äù he says. With the European market gone, the only place left for Muruu to sell his stimulant is Somalia, where consumers now dictate how much they pay ‚Äì and it‚Äôs not much. ‚ÄúThe other issue with the Somali market is that the only people who can transport miraa to Mogadishu are Kenyan Somalis, meaning that the rest of us drivers have been put out of work,‚Äù says a former worker of Muruu‚Äôs, who only identified himself as Kanda. According to Kanda, if non-Somali drivers attempt the trip they are attacked along the journey. For a town of its size and location, Maua has a disproportionately large number of residents of Somali heritage, most of whom are involved in the khat trade as middlemen. They are also big consumers themselves.
‚ÄòMiraa was the heartbeat of this town‚Äô The effects of the London ban have reached everybody in the khat micro-economy, from the big name traders like Muraa to the small fish who depend on the trade for their survival. Although Muraa has made investments that have cushioned him against the blows of a deeply depleted income, those at the lower end of the food chain have not been so lucky. Miriti Ngozi, chairman of the Miraa Traders Association, says that many farmers and traders are no longer able to pay school fees or even buy enough food for their families.
‚ÄúYou have to understand that in this region, subsistence farming has long been overshadowed by the more prestigious miraa farming. Now that people are no longer making money from miraa, they do not have money to buy food and many families are sleeping hungry,‚Äù he says. Yet many remain reluctant to uproot their khat crops and plant maize instead, holding on to the hope that their fortunes might one day return. Pius Mbiti, a trader in his early 30s, is a qualified vet but says that he makes most of his income from picking and selling the stimulant. ‚ÄúOn a good day I used to make up to ¬£12 which, when supplemented with earnings from my vet practice, was enough to take care of my family. But since the ban I am lucky if I make even ¬£2 pounds,‚Äù he says. He cannot rely on animal medicine any more either because farmers no longer have the money to pay for his services. This narrative is familiar across the town, with the common refrain being that shutting down miraa imports to London is killing businesses indirectly linked to the herb. ‚ÄúThe miraa trade was the heartbeat of this town; it drove everything else. With revenue from miraa so drastically low, people no longer have the money to buy things,‚Äù says Lawrence Kobia, who owns a bookshop. He says that his sales have plummeted by more than 40% since last year. Seizures In its submissions to parliament, the Home Office committee warned that banning khat would result in the formation of a black market ‚Äì as seen in the United States and other European countries including Norway and Holland.
Although initially khat sold for between ¬£3 and ¬£4 a kilogram in Britain, the committee reported that if it was banned the price could increase to ¬£318, similar to its price in the US. Their predictions turned out to be true: there has been a proliferation of the stimulant in London since the ban. While the border police have no statistics on seizures, the London Metropolitan police says it has handled a number of khat-related offences. A spokesperson said that in the first six months after the ban came into effect, a total of 68 warnings and 14 penalty notices were issued. In addition, 36 people were arrested for possession of the herb, four of whom were later charged. In the meantime, the Kenyan government is trying hard to get the ban lifted, with president Uhuru Kenyatta even promising the farmers in Maua as recently as February that he will petition to have the market reopened for them. The farmers, however, see this as a cheap political move to whip up support, complaining that no tangible rewards have come from promises made by politicians regarding the matter in the past. But the squabbling over high-level politics in Kenya and the workings of the parliament in Britain are meaningless to the miraa farmer in Maua, whose only worry is where the next meal will come from.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-26T03:02:23Z,world,World news,Australia's population increase from migration continues to slow,"Australia‚Äôs population increase from migration continues to slow, the latest data from the Bureau of Statistics show, while people are increasingly moving to Victoria from other states and territories. Last year, the net overseas migration figure was 184,100 people, a fall of 15% from the previous year. Migration to Australia added 473,500 people to the population, 5.3% fewer than the previous year. Victoria recorded its highest interstate migration in more than 40 years, with most of the new arrivals ‚Äì 2,700 ‚Äì coming from New South Wales. This was followed by 2,100 from South Australia and 1,400 from Western Australia. In Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland, more people left the state in 2014 than arrived, but all jurisdictions increased their overall population thanks to the number of births exceeding the number of deaths. The bureau‚Äôs director of demography, Denise Carlton, said overseas migration had peaked in 2008, and that many ‚Äúpush and pull factors‚Äù influenced the rate of this movement. Carolyn Whitzman, a professor of urban planning at the University of Melbourne, said the data highlighted the need for capital cities to develop better plans for growth. Australia‚Äôs population increased by 330,200 to reach 23.6m by the end of last year, representing a growth rate of 1.4%. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think population growth is the problem per se, because cities like Melbourne have seen growth at a higher rate over much of its history,‚Äù Whitzman said. ‚ÄúThe problem is, we aren‚Äôt planning for the future. The bottom line is, whether Melbourne, Sydney and Perth grow at all, there is a need for better kinds of housing, transport and social infrastructure, like schools and healthcare.‚Äù She suspected growth in jobs in the healthcare and education sectors had contributed to the movement to Victoria. But it was important that the infrastructure built to support those industries, such as hospitals, schools and public transport, were spread equitably, she said. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, major cities see rapid urban sprawl, coupled with infrastructure not catching up,‚Äù Whitzman said. This story was amended on 26 June to correct the interpretation of the ABS figures. The overseas migration figure refers to the difference between the number of immigrants and emigrants, not the absolute number of emigrants.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-25T18:55:01Z,world,World news,South African deputy president cleared over Marikana massacre,"South Africa‚Äôs deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has been cleared of responsibility for the police massacre of 34 striking mineworkers at the Marikana mine by a judicial commission of inquiry. Other ministers do not have a case to answer either, according to the long-awaited report. But it says inquiries should be held into the fitness of the national police chief, Riah Phiyega, to hold office, and into ascertaining the criminal liability of all police involved in the tragedy. The killings at the British-owned Lonmin mine in the platinum belt on 16 August 2012 marked the bloodiest massacre by South African security forces since the end of racial apartheid. On Thursday the South African president, Jacob Zuma, read a summary of the 600-page report on television, saying: ‚ÄúThe Marikana incident was a horrendous tragedy that has no place in a democracy.‚Äù His deputy, Ramaphosa, a stalwart of the liberation struggle, was a Lonmin board member at the time and has been accused of encouraging the violent police action. But the report said: ‚ÄúThe commission has found that it cannot be said Mr Ramaphosa was the cause of the massacre, and the accusations against him are groundless.‚Äù In another finding likely to disappoint many families and campaigners, it also cleared Nathi Mthethwa, the police minister at the time. ‚ÄúThe commission found that the executive played no role in the decision of the police to implement the tactical option on 16 August 2012.‚Äù The commission was far more critical of the police, however, noting that a plan to encircle the strikers with barbed wire was abandoned and replaced with a ‚Äútactical option which was defective in a number of respects‚Äù. It said: ‚ÄúThe tactical option was implemented at about 15.40 that day, resulting in the deaths of strikers at scene 1 and scene 2. The commission found the police operation should not have taken place on 16 August because of the defects of the plan. It would have been impossible to disarm and disperse the strikers without significant bloodshed on the afternoon of 16 August. The police should have waited until the following day when the original ensettlement plan, which was substantially risk free, could have been implemented.‚Äù The report continued: ‚ÄúThe commission also found that the operation should have been stopped after the shooting at scene 1 and there was also a complete lack of command and control at scene 2.‚Äù The commission has also questioned the conduct of the police management during the inquiry. ‚ÄúThe police leadership did not initially disclose to the commission the fact the original plan was not capable of being implemented on the first date and had been abandoned,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúIn addition police leadership did not inform the commission that the decision to go ahead with the tactical option ‚Ä¶ was taken at the national management forum on 15 August. Instead they informed the commission the decision was taken on 16 August and only after the situation had escalated.‚Äù The report added: ‚ÄúThe commission has also raised serious concerns that there was a delay of about an hour in getting medical assistance to the strikers who were injured at scene 1 and accepts that at least one striker might have survived if he had been treated timeously.‚Äù Phiyega‚Äôs position as national police commissioner appears untenable after the commission recommended an inquiry into her fitness to hold office. Zuma said: ‚ÄúI have written to the national commissioner to inform her of the recommendations pertaining to her.‚Äù The massacre was captured on multiple TV cameras and shown around the world. Many were shocked to see the police of a black majority government opening fire on black mineworkers, apparently to defend the interests of London-based mining company. The tragedy also highlighted the squalid living conditions of mineworkers who had been pleading with wealthy executives for decent pay. The commission criticised the conduct of two trade unions that were engaged in a turf war at the mine but was also scathing about Lonmin saying: ‚ÄúThe commission has found that Lonmin did not use its best endeavours to resolve the disputes that arose between itself and its workers who participated in the unprotected strike on the one hand, and between the strikers and those workers who did not participate in the strike. ‚ÄúIt also did not respond appropriately to the threat of, and the outbreak of, violence. Lonmin also failed to employ sufficient safeguards and measures to ensure the safety of its employees. Lonmin also insisted that its employees who were not striking should come to work despite the fact it knew that it was not in a position to protect them from attacks by strikers.‚Äù South African news media reported a mood of profound disappointment in Marikana itself over what they saw as the commission‚Äôs failure to hold senior politicians to account. Some were critical of the abrupt timing of the report‚Äôs release at 7pm with little notice for them to prepare. James Nichol, a British lawyer who represented the families of dead mineworkers during the commission hearings, said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs outrageous really the fact we are nearly three years on and we are no closer to understanding why hundreds of police officers fired machine guns at miners that day. ‚ÄúThe report suggests it was a bungled job and they should have known better ‚Äì that‚Äôs just not good enough. Why did those police officers open fire? We don‚Äôt know that.‚Äù Nichol added: ‚ÄúIt was a whitewash for the government and ministers including Cyril Ramaphosa. Not even one of them is held responsible. ‚ÄúAs far as Lonmin is concerned, it‚Äôs ‚Äòthey should have done better‚Äô but there‚Äôs no suggestion of them paying compensation. All in all, it‚Äôs a shambles.‚Äù Rehad Desai, a member of the Marikana Support Campaign, said: ‚ÄúShockingly bad is an understatement. It‚Äôs terrible that it only recommends an inquiry into the national police commissioner‚Äôs fitness for office rather than her dismissal.‚Äù Lonmin welcomed the report but declined to tackle specific criticisms. Ben Magara, its chief executive, said: ‚ÄúLonmin gave its full support to the commission. Its findings will need our detailed consideration before we take further action and before we provide our considered responses. ‚ÄúWe as a company have already moved a long way towards building a more open, transparent and mutually trusting environment. I cannot say that we have fully achieved this yet, but I can say that we have made progress, and we will continue to do so in conjunction with other stakeholders.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúWhile the report will generate painful memories for many people, it is all of our responsibility not to lose sight of our common humanity, not to destroy the good work already done, to conduct ourselves respectfully and with due restraint and empathy, and to provide support to those who need it.‚Äù The report was fiercely attacked by an opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), which expressed ‚Äúdeep sadness, disappointment and shock‚Äù. Based on the summary, it said, ‚Äúthe report has basically declared this cold winter evening the saddest since the dawn of democracy in 1994. The party said: ‚ÄúIn essence, 34 mineworkers were massacred in full view of the world and there is no recommendation of prosecution and someone to be held accountable. ‚ÄúThe report has not put any blame on anyone; it has not called on anyone to apologise and it has not recommended reparations for any of the lives lost. One is left to wonder if the Farlam Commission was actually investigating the same Marikana Massacre we all witnessed on 16 August 2012.‚Äù The EFF said it had assembled legal experts to study the report and its leaders would soon meet to establish a way forward. ‚ÄúWe can guarantee all South Africans that EFF will never rest until those responsible, particularly the political elite that presided over the police, including Cyril Ramaphosa, are prosecuted and sent to jail.‚Äù Mmusi Maimaine, leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), said: ‚ÄúThe DA will call for nothing less than the dismissal of national police commissioner Riah Phiyega, who is clearly unfit for office. ‚ÄúThe report has plainly found that Riah Phiyega and the SAPS [police] leadership took a decision that they knew would result in bloodshed. They never stopped the operation when the shootings began, and they left miners to die in the dust for a full hour before medical help was called in. ‚ÄúWe are deeply disappointed that the then police minister, Nathi Mthethwa, was absolved from any wrongdoing whereas, as the political head of the police service, he needed to accept due responsibility as would have been the case in any normal democracy.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-25T18:15:34Z,world,World news,Mother left trail for rescuers to find her and baby after Colombian plane crash,"After four days combing through the rain-drenched jungle and swollen rivers, the rescue party was on the verge of calling off the search. They had discovered the remains of the small plane which had smashed into a remote mountainside in north-west Colombia. They had found the body of the pilot ‚Äì and a few tantalising clues suggesting that at least one person had survived the devastating impact. But there was no trace of the missing passengers, and the emergency workers were starting to discuss ending their mission. They decided to push on and a few minutes later, just 500 metres from the crash site but hidden by a dense wall of vegetation, they discovered a crude shelter. Inside was the young mother who with her baby son had walked away from the plane wreck and survived for days in the one of the most inhospitable corners of the earth. Authorities in Colombia have described the survival of 18-year-old Mar√≠a Nelly Murillo and her eight-month-old son Yudier Moreno as a miracle, after their Cessna 303 plane crashed into trees in the north-west of the country. ‚ÄúIt is a very wild area and it was a catastrophic accident,‚Äù Colonel H√©ctor Carrascal of the Colombian air force told AFP. Murillo was pictured on Thursday looking exhausted, with burns on her arms, and clinging to a rescue worker after she was lifted from a rescue helicopter. Mother and baby are now in hospital, with Murillo suffering minor burns, a fractured ankle and dehydration. Her son is in good health, the air force said in a statement. ‚ÄúHis mother‚Äôs spirit must have given him strength to survive,‚Äù Carrascal said. The body of the plane‚Äôs pilot, Captain Carlos Mario Ceballos, was found three days ago in the ruined aircraft in the Serran√≠a del Baud√≥ mountain range. The plane had been flying from the Pacific coastal town of Nuqu√≠ to Quibd√≥, the capital of Choc√≥ region in the west of the country. Just 20 minutes into the flight, the plane disappeared from the radar of civil aviation authorities. The cause of the crash is not yet known. It took rescuers two days to locate the crash site, in an area teeming with both poisonous snakes and armed groups battling for control of coca plantations, illegal gold mines and lucrative drug smuggling routes to the Pacific ocean. Threaded by rivers and drenched with rain throughout the year, the region is one of the wettest on Earth. It is also one of the poorest and least-developed parts of Colombia.
When rescuers found the plane, the doors of the plane were open, said Carrascal. There was no sign of Murillo and her baby, both of whom had been on the passenger list. ‚ÄúWe started to worry ‚Äì we had no idea what could have happened to them. They could be lost in the jungle and trying to survive or could have died already,‚Äù he told the news magazine Semana. But they also saw a reason for hope in the open door. ‚ÄúThe door had been opened from the inside, suggesting one of two things: either it had opened on impact or someone had opened it to get out,‚Äù said Carrascal. There were other clues suggesting Murillo and her baby had survived the crash, said Rafael Caviedes of the Colombian air force. ‚ÄúWe found the remains of food at the site, a few peeled coconuts as if they had been used for water and food. And we didn‚Äôt see her body anywhere or any traces of blood,‚Äù he told El Tiempo. As the formal search and rescue operation got under way, rescuers continued to find clues left behind by Murillo, from a discarded flip-flop to the baby‚Äôs birth certificate sitting next to a tree in the jungle. As coconut shells turned up and even mobile phones that someone had apparently tried to use, rescue workers began to assume Murillo was leaving a trail so that she could be located in the impenetrable jungle and tangle of rivers that make up the area. Meanwhile aviation experts studied the plane wreckage and noted that, while the pilot‚Äôs cabin had been destroyed, the rest of the plane was in decent shape. The plane‚Äôs cargo of coconuts and fish had helped cushion part of the plane from the shock of the crash. A 14-man team scoured the dense jungle for two days without finding the mother and child, before finally resorting to using loudspeakers to broadcast their presence and instruct Murillo to stay as close to the plane wreckage as possible. Meanwhile, said Caviedes, Murillo had made her way about 500 metres from the site of the crash to the banks of a creek where she fashioned a shelter for her and her son, and survived on unripe coconuts. Speaking to local media from her hospital bed in Quibd√≥, Murillo said she and her son also drank rainwater. ‚ÄúWhen it rained, I‚Äôd get up and gather water from the few leaves that had water on them and I‚Äôd drink it with the boy,‚Äù she said. Red Cross volunteer Acisclo Renter√≠a told Blu Radio that after failing to find the missing passengers, the rescue party had been debating whether to call off the search for the day. They decided to push on for a few more minutes, and a few minutes later, he spotted a swarm of flies circling above something on the ground. As he approached, he realised it was Murillo, who began shouting and trying to get to her feet, Renter√≠a told the Associated Press. She was in a state of near-starvation and apparent shock, but not seriously injured. Rescuers gave Murillo first aid, and spent the next four hours feeding her water and crackers while waiting for an airlift. Meanwhile, Renter√≠a comforted the baby. The 38-year-old rescuer, who is unemployed and displaced from his hometown by Colombia‚Äôs five-decade civil war, described the rescue as a blessing ‚ÄúI thanked my God for allowing me to save these two people,‚Äù he said. The moment he spotted Murillo, he said, he was overcome with emotion. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tremendous. It‚Äôs a feeling that can‚Äôt be explained.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-25T17:42:03Z,world,World news,Greece's rich: insulated against an EU exit,"The security guard wrinkled his brow at the sight of an unfamiliar face. But when he found the name of the Guardian‚Äôs correspondent, left at the gate by a member, his demeanour changed. ‚ÄúParakalo,‚Äù he said with a warm smile, handing over a card to open the turnstile. Either side, the walls were thick and high. The country club, on the outskirts of Athens, was laid out with an extravagance in the use of space that you seldom find outside the Americas. In the clubhouse, set amid towering pines, there were corridors as wide as rooms, and rooms the size of basketball courts. But perhaps the most striking thing about the club was that it was opened after the onset of Greece‚Äôs never-ending financial emergency. Since then, Greece has become notorious for deprivation. According to EU figures, 23% of Greeks were poor or ‚Äúat risk of poverty‚Äù in 2012, the last year for which comparative statistics were available. It was the highest proportion in the EU and has almost certainly risen since. Yet the Hellenic world has also been famed throughout history for the wealth of individuals: from Croesus, the semi-legendary king of Lydia, to the ‚ÄúGolden Greeks‚Äù, the shipping magnates Stavros Niarchos and Aristotle Onassis.
The statistics indicate that income distribution is more unequal in Greece than in any EU country except Spain. But, said Andreas Paterakis, the idea that it is packed with plutocrats is mistaken. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a myth coming from the days of Onassis and the other shipping billionaires,‚Äù said Paterakis, the regional president for south-eastern Europe of the security firm G4S. ‚ÄúThere are 10 or 15 families who control the media, banks and insurance. There are things that could improve, notably the relations of these people with the tax authorities. But I really don‚Äôt think they are a priority for the Greek government.‚Äù
Paterakis said his company provided physical and property protection for some ‚Äúhigh net worth individuals‚Äù. ‚ÄúBut,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúit is only a small part of our business.‚Äù The latest annual list of the world‚Äôs richest men and women produced by the magazine Forbes seems to bear out this view. It contains just three Greeks ‚Äì one fewer than in 2008 before the onset of the crisis. The highest placed is Philip Niarchos, Stavros‚Äôs son, and with a fortune of $2.5bn, he only ranks 737th. But earlier this year Bloomberg estimated that at least four more Greek citizens ‚Äì all shipping owners ‚Äì had assets of more than a billion. Crisis-stricken Greece still has the world‚Äôs largest merchant fleet and shipping has long been the prime source of its super-rich. What makes them especially controversial is that, under rules incorporated in the constitution, they pay no tax on international earnings brought into Greece. On Monday, several captains of industry and finance were spotted at a demonstration in Athens‚Äôs main square to call for continued membership of the euro. ‚ÄúI recognised several CEOs there,‚Äù said Vagelis Tsogkas, a corporate communications consultant. ‚ÄúThere was a mix of young, well-educated Greeks and members of the financial elite. I think that this is the first time since the start of the crisis that Greeks of all classes are really worried that it could end badly.‚Äù
But, while the CEOs who improbably rallied in Syntagma Square dread the prospect of their firms being shut out of the single currency zone if the talks fail, the ship owners could see their businesses jeopardised if the negotiations succeed. A leaked draft of the proposals tabled by Greece‚Äôs creditors includes a demand that the government ‚Äúphase out special tax treatments of the shipping industry‚Äù. At a personal level, Grexit would hit the finances of even the wealthiest. Reintroduction of the drachma could mean that overnight their property and other assets in Greece were reduced in value by as much as 50%. But they long ago took steps to ensure that those Greek-based assets were reduced to a minimum. A senior banker, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that after 2008 when the collapse of Lehman Brothers threatened to spark a global financial meltdown, large numbers of wealthy Greeks withdrew money from the private banking arms of global banks and paid it into the Greek system. But as the crisis focused increasingly on Greece, the flow reversed. And it did so long before the panic withdrawals that were last week draining the banks of around ‚Ç¨1bn a day. ‚ÄúBetween 2010 and 2012, we lost deposits to the tune of ‚Ç¨80bn,‚Äù said the banker. ‚ÄúWe estimate that, of that, ‚Ç¨20bn was high net worth individuals sending their money abroad. The smart money was the first to leave the country.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-25T16:49:15Z,world,World news,Rwandan intelligence chief refuses extradition from UK to Spain,"The British courts will hear a controversial legal battle after Rwanda‚Äôs intelligence chief said he would fight an extradition request from Spain over allegations of genocide and terrorism, charges the country‚Äôs government insists are politically motivated and insulting. Emmanuel Karenzi Karake, whose legal campaign is being led by Cherie Booth QC, was arrested at Heathrow airport on Saturday under a European arrest warrant following his six-day trip to London. He was granted conditional bail on Thursday, pending a full extradition hearing. The bail conditions include a ¬£1m surety given by Rwandan diplomats. He is a senior member of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), the movement which halted the country‚Äôs 1994 genocide by extremists from the Hutu majority that led to the deaths of an estimated 800,000 Rwandans, mainly Tutsis. The RPF is led by Rwanda‚Äôs president, Paul Kagame. Karake is among 40 people sought on the orders of a Spanish judge over the alleged murder of three Spanish aid workers in Rwanda and revenge massacres of Hutus in the wake of the genocide. Speaking on Thursday, Kagame said in a speech: ‚ÄúAny decent Rwandan, any decent African, and even any decent person from these countries cannot accept this. Absolutely not.‚Äù Karake appeared before Westminster magistrates, dressed in a green and yellow patterned jumpsuit, seemingly a prison issue garment. Dozens of Rwandan nationals, who had protested outside the court before packing into the public gallery, cheered as he greeted them with a raised hand salute. Aaron Watkins, representing the Spanish government, said Karake‚Äôs bail should be refused ahead of a full extradition hearing at the end of October, since there was a serious risk of his fleeing. ‚ÄúWe submit that in this unusual case there are strong grounds that if granted bail the defendant would refuse to surrender,‚Äù Watkins argued. While Karake‚Äôs lawyers said he was in the UK on official government business, the UK Border Agency had said this was not the case, Watkins added. But Mark Summers QC, representing Karake and verbally advised throughout the hearing by Booth, said his client, whom he referred to throughout as ‚Äúthe general‚Äù, was ‚Äúa man of impeccable character‚Äù who should never have been arrested. ‚ÄúHe is not a rogue officer,‚Äù Summers said. ‚ÄúHe is a senior member of a respected and democratic government.‚Äù Summers described the Spanish warrant as deeply flawed, politically motived and ‚Äúdriven by parties with links to the underlying genocide‚Äù in Rwanda. Interpol had sufficient doubts about the warrant to refuse to circulate it, Summers said, adding: ‚ÄúIt seeks to crimimalise the whole of the current Rwandan government.‚Äù Summers said Karake would argue for diplomatic immunity, saying his visa to the UK was granted following a request to UK diplomats for him to travel on ‚Äúan official mission‚Äù. Rwanda‚Äôs high commissioner to the UK, Williams Nkurunziza, attended the hearing, as did the country‚Äôs ambassador to Spain. The court heard Nkurunziza had written to personally guarantee Karake would not flee. Summers insisted bail could be granted safely, saying that if Karake were to flee it would bring ‚Äúshame and disrespect‚Äù on the Rwandan government. The district judge, Quentin Purdy, granted Karake bail on condition he lived at a high commission property, staying there from between the hours of 8pm and 8am, reported daily to Barnet police station in London and did not go beyond the M25. He was to remain in custody until the Rwandan officials provided the ¬£1m in surety. Booth said this was not expected to happen this Thursday. A full extradition hearing would be held on 29 and 30 October. As Karake was led away from the dock his supporters left the courtroom singing and cheering. The British high commission in Rwanda‚Äôs capital Kigali has been the focus for protests over the past two days and his arrest has been criticised by Andrew Mitchell, formerly the international development secretary. However, Karake has faced accusations of links to atrocities. When he was made deputy chief of the UN-African Union peacekeeping force in Sudan‚Äôs Darfur region, the organisation Human Rights Watch criticised the appointment. Anneke Van Wouldenberg from Human Rights Watch, who attended the hearing, said the allegations deserved to be heard in court: ‚ÄúThe Spanish arrest warrant, in our opinion, has some merit. It certainly has some political overtones and some bits of it one can question, but there‚Äôs a core that tallies very much with Human Rights Watch‚Äôs evidence.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-25T16:08:48Z,world,World news,Islamic State attacks Kobani and pro-regime troops in Syria's north,"Islamic State militants killed dozens of people in and around the Syrian border town of Kobani on Thursday after launching a counter-offensive under the cover of darkness. The militants - disguised as fighters from the Free Syrian Army - drove five vehicles into the town in the early hours of Thursday and used a suicide bomber to blow up a border crossing with Turkey. A civilian inside Kobani said: ‚ÄúNo one can go out of their home, the streets are not safe ‚Ä¶ Isis fighters are getting inside houses and killing everyone [they find].‚Äù At least 35 civilians and Kurdish fighters were killed along with eight IS militants, monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. A further 23 Syrian Kurds, among them women and children, were shot dead in the nearby village of Barkh Butan, the group said. Isis withdrew from the village after US-led coalition strikes on its outskirts of the village and the arrival of Kurdish forces, but fighting continued in Kobani through Thursday. Around the same time as the Kobani attack, the group launched an assault on the north-eastern city of Hasakah, aided by militias previously aligned with the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. Western districts were seized and the Syrian army pushed into the city centre. The surprise, two-pronged offensive came as Isis reels from several high-profile defeats near Raqqa, the capital of its self-declared caliphate and its seat of power in Syria.
The Kurdish People‚Äôs Protection Units (YPG) militia and an alliance of rebels known as the ‚ÄúEuphrates Volcano‚Äù ‚Äì backed US-led coalition air strikes ‚Äì have seized swaths of territory from Isis, including the strategic border town of Tal Abyad. In recent days they also wrested control of Brigade 93, a strategic base seized by Isis from the Syrian regime, and the town of Ain Issa, bringing them within 30 miles of Raqqa itself. ‚ÄúIslamic State‚Äôs morale has collapsed after the advance in the Raqqa countryside,‚Äù said Redur Xelil, the YPG spokesman who provided the accounts of the latest Isis offensive. ‚ÄúThey are trying to raise the morale of their fighters and supporters, and show that they still have strength and can strike out elsewhere.‚Äù He also said that another goal of the Isis offensive may be to draw Kurdish troops away from the frontline to defend other territories. Xelil said the militants who entered Kobani numbered between 30 and 40, and were holed up in buildings in the city after killing dozens of people. The YPG, backed by the Kurdish Asayish security forces, were combing the area and he was confident they would defeat the militants. ‚ÄúWe will destroy this group that entered the city,‚Äù he said.
Late last year, Isis was on the verge of conquering Kobani, an enclave on the Turkish border, but Kurdish fighters backed by the US-led coalition ultimately succeeded in reversing the militants‚Äô advance and liberating the city, killing over a thousand Isis fighters in a months-long battle that emerged as a symbol of the Kurds‚Äô defiance. Many refugees who fled the city have since returned to their homes, many of which had been levelled during the fighting. The joint Kurdish-rebel advance in recent weeks has provided a glimmer of hope in the fight against Isis. Last month, Isis seized the historic city of Palmyra in Homs province and Ramadi, the provincial capital of Anbar in Iraq, casting doubt on the entire strategy to contain the group.
The more serious threat is the Isis assault ‚Äì its fourth ‚Äì on Hasakah, a city divided between the Assad regime and the Kurds. Around midnight, Isis launched an offensive that has so far claimed the lives of 30 pro-regime troops and 20 militants, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group with a wide range of contacts inside Syria. The attack triggered the flight of civilians from the area, and the regime has responded with a series of air strikes on militant positions south of the city. Isis used suicide bombers to soften up regime positions. In a statement circulated on social media, Isis said it took control of western neighbourhoods and forced the regime‚Äôs troops to retreat to the city centre, seemingly in shock at what the militants described as a ‚Äúdaring operation‚Äù. Xelil, who said the Kurds were not yet involved in the battle for Hasakah, said Isis had succeeded in winning the allegiance of members of the pro-Assad National Defence Forces ‚Äì local militias that support the regime ‚Äì allowing them to prepare the ground for the assault on the city. The tactic is in keeping with the traditional Isis modus operandi of infiltrating areas prior to launching major assaults. In a separate, major offensive in Syria‚Äôs south on Thursday, about 51 rebel groups joined together to attack regime-held areas of Deraa city, where insurgents have dealt Assad‚Äôs forces significant blows in recent months. The southern rebels, including the al-Qaida-linked al-Nusra Front and groups that do not share its jihadi ideology, have long said they aim to expel Syrian government forces from Deraa. Syrian state TV said the army had repelled attacks against a number of military positions in the south of the country.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-25T15:52:34Z,world,World news,How Egyptian media has become a mouthpiece for the military state,"When Tahrir Square was flooded with Egyptians calling for former president Hosni Mubarak‚Äôs downfall, journalists were divided: jump ship, or defend the president? Some, like Ibrahim Eissa, joined the calls of the protesters, co-founding the daily newspaper El-Tahrir (The Liberation). Others, like then-state TV presenter Khairy Ramadan, turned on demonstrators, suggesting they were funded by foreign conspirators. But today even Eissa, among many others, is a defender of the new military government run by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Having shed any pretence of revolutionary fervour or objectivity, Egypt‚Äôs journalists are reluctant to even suggest that more than 36 people died in the 2011 uprising, when independent estimates say more than 900 were killed. A report released on Thursday by the Committee to Protect Journalists says more Egyptian journalists are in prison than ever before recorded, with authorities using the argument of ‚Äúnational security‚Äù to crack down on press freedoms. At least 18 journalists are behind bars, and the threat of jail is used to censor critical voices.
‚ÄòI would say anything the military tells me‚Äô Today, many of Egypt‚Äôs top TV presenters and journalists are remarkably candid about their willingness to act as government mouthpieces.‚ÄúI would say anything the military tells me to say out of duty and respect for the institution,‚Äù says Ahmed Moussa, one of the most popular TV presenters in Egypt. Moussa has no qualms admitting on air his relationship with the authorities ‚Äì and his vocation to serve them. He claims he would also extend the same courtesy to the police, he said but he ‚Äúmight stop and think a little first‚Äù. Sharing Moussa‚Äôs sense of duty towards the military is the veteran talk show host Mahmoud Saad, from Al-Nahar TV. ‚ÄúThe military should never, ever, ever be covered,‚Äù he says, shaking his head. ‚ÄúYou have to let them decide what to say and when to say it. You don‚Äôt know what will hurt national security.‚Äù But it‚Äôs also the power to influence people that appeals to him, he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a beautiful feeling knowing that when you swing right,‚Äù he says as he swivels his upper body right, ‚Äúthe people will swing right. ‚ÄúAnd when you swing left,‚Äù he goes on, swivelling in the opposite direction ‚Äúthe people will swing left.‚Äù
‚ÄòThe official story makes people feel better‚Äô Before 2011, there was an unspoken rule among broadcasters and newspapers: criticise everyone except the president and his immediate family. To some, this silence extended to the defence and interior ministers. El-Watan reporter Ahmed Ghoniem says owning media outlets ‚Äúcomes in handy if you get into any kind of trouble and have to pressure the government‚Äù. But no owner completely ‚Äúunleashes his journalists‚Äù on the government, he says. But after Mubarak‚Äôs fall from power, the media exploded in congratulations, apologies and promises to never return to ‚Äúthe days of humiliation‚Äù that were Mubarak‚Äôs reign, as popular TV host Amr Adeeb tearfully declared on ONtv. ‚ÄúWe [talk show hosts] were cowards... The authorities used to call all the shows to dictate content,‚Äù said Adeeb, who had once claimed that Mubarak had personally protected his freedom of expression ‚Äì and indeed that of all journalists.
Television presenters continue to be the undisputed leaders of public opinion in Egypt, where over a quarter of the population is illiterate. But where once they openly criticised the military and the government ‚Äì most notably for killing protesters during the months of revolution in early 2011 ‚Äì now their role in public debate is much less clear. Given this climate of well-known government pressure, many younger Egyptians are deeply cynical about the media, but older viewers have a softer view. ‚ÄúSo what if they paid respect to Mubarak? Everyone did,‚Äù says 63-year-old retired teacher, Amal el-Tahry. Ahmed Abdullah, who owns a shop in the capital, is also ambivalent: ‚ÄúThe media is not free, but better be controlled by Sisi and not the west,‚Äù says the 55-year-old. The government sanctioned narrative offers a sweeter pill, claims TV producer Sherief Badie el-Nour: ‚ÄúPeople believe the official story because it makes them feel better,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt requires less work from them as individuals.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat can the viewer do about it? Change the channel? He will find another host saying the same thing,‚Äù he says.
Self-censorship This pervasive pressure from government has prompted journalists to police themselves more rigorously. Dot Masr reporter Mohamed Abu Asay says in the past he could never report on the budget deficit in Egypt and the Saudi-Egyptian military operation in Yemen in the same piece. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tie the idea that the government doesn‚Äôt have money, but is abandoning its war on terror to go fight in Yemen, in the reader‚Äôs mind,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt might stir public opinion and that is not good for the regime or the funders.‚Äù Abu Asay knows that if he doesn‚Äôt self-censor, his editors simply won‚Äôt run it. At Al Masry Al Youm, reporters also say they know which topics to avoid. ‚ÄúNo one can question how [well] trained the soldiers we have thrown to face the insurgency in Sinai,‚Äù says website editor Ahmed Ragab. Even when the newspaper published a report on police abuse partly showing the authorities in positive light and showcasing their ‚Äúheroism in the war on terrorism‚Äù , its journalists were still referred to the public prosecutor after the Ministry of Interior issued a statement promising to sue the paper for what it claimed was an unprofessional report.
‚ÄúNo one has ever made me say something I didn‚Äôt want to say, but they have made me not say what I wanted to say,‚Äù says the TV presenter Mahmoud Saad. Lighting a cigarette, Saad reflects on the many phone conversations he says he had with Mubarak‚Äôs minister of information, Anas el-Fiqqi, arguing about the topics he was allowed to discuss, whom to interview, and for how long. ‚ÄúHe called me to tell me to say that the 25 January protests in 2011 were [organised by the rival] Muslim Brotherhood. I refused and I didn‚Äôt go on air,‚Äù he recalls. Saad no longer has that fighting spirit. ‚ÄúI am an old man,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI just want to spend my time here in quiet‚Äù ‚Äì of which there is plenty in his brightly lit villa in a gated community in Giza. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to ruin anyone‚Äôs day,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe viewer is tired. He doesn‚Äôt want to hear about corruption and theft.‚Äù This desire to please is clear on Saad‚Äôs show, where all he had to say on the day a court dropped charges of killing protesters against Mubarak was: ‚ÄúIs it really important that we get into details? I think not.‚Äù
‚ÄòClaims of oppression are just a trend‚Äô Despite many journalists‚Äô first hand experience of censorship and corruption in the country‚Äôs media, many stop short of holding president the government directly responsible. ‚ÄúClaims of oppression are just a trend,‚Äù CBC‚Äôs Khairy Ramadan says. ‚ÄúAnyone who says they are under pressure is a liar.‚Äù ONtv‚Äôs Youssef el-Husseiny goes further, claiming that the authorities would like the press to be balanced, but it‚Äôs journalists themselves who are the ones resisting. Sisi, el-Husseiny claims, personally asked him where his government‚Äôs opposition is: ‚ÄúWhere are the other voices? Is everyone a supporter [of mine]?‚Äù
But frustration amongst journalists is also growing, and not everyone is resigned to become beholden to the government‚Äôs narrative. Some have some have quit their jobs, but many also keep their head down to make ends meet. ‚ÄúGive me a nine to five job and I will quit tomorrow,‚Äù says young journalist Ahmed Amir. Amir works on Ahmed Moussa‚Äôs TV talk show on Sada el-Balad TV. ‚ÄúWe are tools, not journalists. The media owners use us to attack the regime when they want and support it when they want,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThis is the profession of those with no conscience.‚Äù Some names have been changed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-25T15:11:32Z,world,World news,The right way to deal with Iran's nuclear past,"Guest Blog: Dina Esfandiary and Ariane Tabatabai Secretary Kerry caused quite the stir when he stated that the US is ‚Äúnot fixated on Iran specifically accounting for what they did at one point in time or another.‚Äù Opponents of a potential deal say that this is an unacceptable concession to Iran. A deal that would not provide a full account of the Possible Military Dimensions (PMD) of Tehran‚Äôs nuclear program is not worth the paper it‚Äôs written on. But for Iran, the PMD issue presents a real catch-22: One where its sovereignty and national security are at stake. Western intelligence agencies believe Iran conducted weaponization work prior to 2003. In November 2011, the IAEA outlined 12 existing areas of concern on Iran‚Äôs nuclear program that Tehran needed to clarify. But Iran has refused to fully cooperate with the IAEA and to answer questions on its weaponization activities. Tehran faces a real dilemma: Continue on this path and not only face the ‚ÄòI-told-you-so‚Äôs of the world, but also potentially undermine the efforts to solve the nuclear crisis by reinforcing the idea that it‚Äôs untrustworthy. Over the years, Iran persistently denied weaponization work. An admission would prove it lied. Iran also risks losing face, especially given Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei‚Äôs religious decree prohibiting nuclear weapons. To address the PMD issue, Iran must provide unprecedented access to a number of its military facilities and nuclear scientists. So far, it agreed to provide a one-time, managed access to the Parchin military complex ‚Äì the subject of years of wrangling. While this could help answer a few of the IAEA‚Äôs questions, the real value in such measures is allowing Iran to start with a clean slate and provide assurance that it‚Äôs now fully committed to its international obligations. The problem is that a number of these steps are too costly for Iran. Access to Iranian nuclear scientists is a red-line fixed by Khamenei. The issue is twofold: It touches upon national sovereignty and security. After all, what country would expose individuals working on such a sensitive program? Granting access to these scientists potentially jeopardizes their security, especially after a series of assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists in 2010-12. Iranian officials are steadfast in their belief that the government must guarantee the security of their scientists and can‚Äôt disclose their identity to outsiders. Iran also legitimately wants to protect sensitive military facilities and defenses, some of which have nothing to do with its nuclear program. But the controversial ‚Äúanytime, anywhere‚Äù provision some demand wouldn‚Äôt allow it to do so. Tehran also fears that allowing any foreign access to critical facilities and individuals will set a precedent. It might lead to an upward spiral of concessions demanded. Given the history of foreign intervention in its domestic affairs, this resonates with the general population too. US officials have stated that the monitoring and verification system being developed in the deal will provide the West with unprecedented access to Iran‚Äôs nuclear program. More than would be available without a deal. But they also argue that this will give the United States and its allies invaluable information to prepare for a potential military campaign. Given Iran‚Äôs past history of the Iran-Iraq War (1980-88), repeated military threats and covert action against its nuclear infrastructure and scientists, these comments hit close to home for Tehran. Secretary Kerry‚Äôs focus on ‚Äúgoing forward‚Äù is the right approach. It‚Äôs more important to curb Iran‚Äôs program today and in the future, than to know exactly what Iran did in the past. Focusing on Iran‚Äôs past activities could reinforce the idea that the West isn‚Äôt interested in a negotiated solution. It could instead lead to the very situation we‚Äôre trying to avoid: Tehran resuming those very activities. Ultimately, a deal without an Iranian admission of guilt, but a path towards addressing PMD concerns in the future isn‚Äôt a concession to Iran. The deal would still limit and monitor Tehran‚Äôs nuclear program. In order for a comprehensive nuclear deal to be reached and effectively implemented, Iran‚Äôs security concerns must be understood and considered. By ignoring them, negotiators would shoot themselves in the foot. A final, lasting agreement can only be reached and implemented if Iran walks away feeling like its national security and dignity will remain intact.

2015-06-25T15:07:12Z,world,World news,Unsolved murders of indigenous women reflect Canada's history of silence,"Hanging on the walls of Kattie Lee Fontaine‚Äôs living room are two striking portraits of her cousin Tina, who was just 15 when she disappeared from the streets of Winnipeg, Manitoba, in August 2014. Tina and her four cousins, Kattie Lee, Rose, Jolene and Angel grew up together on the Sagkeeng First Nation, an indigenous reserve east of Lake Winnipeg with a population of 3,000 ‚Äì and six unsolved cases of missing or murdered First Nations women. In June 2014, Tina travelled to Winnipeg to rekindle her relationship with her estranged biological mother. Her family reported her missing, and five weeks later, on 8 August, Fontaine was picked up by police in a vehicle that had been pulled over for drunk driving. Despite the missing persons report, the officers let Tina go, and later the same day she was found passed out in a downtown alleyway. Paramedics took her to hospital, where she was handed over to a social worker to be taken into foster care, but she ran away. Nine days later, Tina‚Äôs body, wrapped in a plastic bag, was dragged from the Red river. ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt even open the casket because of what her murderers did to her,‚Äù said her great aunt, Thelma Favel. Nearly a year after her death, Tina‚Äôs family are beginning to lose hope that her killers will ever be caught. Meanwhile her cousins fear that they could suffer the same fate as Tina: the four girls live in the North End, an area of Winnipeg rife with violence and sexual harassment. ‚ÄúWe feel even less safe since her death. We miss her so much‚Äù, says Kattie Lee. Tina is just one victim in an decades-long epidemic of violence that has claimed the lives of thousands of indigenous women. Ever since the 1970s ‚Äì when aboriginals were encouraged to migrate to the cities ‚Äì women of all ages have been shipped back to their families in coffins, said Derek Nepinak, the Grand Chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs (AMC). ‚ÄúI lost an aunt in Winnipeg in 1978,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is not a new phenomenon by any means.‚Äù But Canadians are finally starting to pay attention. In its first attempt to gauge the scale of the problem, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) last year retrieved data from 300 police authorities across the country. The study concluded between 1980 and 2012, at least 1,017 First Nations women were murdered, while a further 108 went missing in suspicious circumstances. Last week, the RCMP released an updated report, which concluded First Nations women are four times more likely to go missing or be murdered than other Canadian women. While aboriginal women represent just 4.3% of Canada‚Äôs female population, they represent 16% of female murder victims and 11% of missing persons cases involving women, the report said. The update also said in the 12 months since the first report, 11 more indigenous women had gone missing. ‚ÄòIt isn‚Äôt really high on our radar‚Äô When the findings were first published, thousands gathered for candlelight vigils in cities across Canada, and chiefs and activists renewed their calls for a national inquiry into the country‚Äôs indigenous femicide. But those calls have repeatedly been rebuffed by the Conservative prime minister, Stephen Harper, who has argued the problem is mainly one of domestic violence and criminality on indigenous reserves. Asked about the possibility of a national inquiry by the CBC state television in December, Harper replied: ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt really high on our radar, to be honest.‚Äù First Nations leaders acknowledge that violence is a problem on the reserves ‚Äì which are beset with poverty, drug abuse and unemployment. But only 40% of the country‚Äôs indigenous people actually live on reserves, and activists and analysts say the abuse and murder visited on Canada‚Äôs indigenous women reflects a broader history of marginalization and abuse. That view is shared by the United Nations, which has repeatedly called for a national inquiry into violence against First Nations women, similar to the investigation launched into the murder of hundreds of women in Ciudad Ju√°rez in Mexico.
The UN‚Äôs Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (Cedaw) concluded last year that the Harper government‚Äôs refusal to investigate the violence was ‚Äúa grave violation‚Äù of indigenous women‚Äôs rights. ‚ÄúThe victimisation of native women is partly the legacy of colonial heritage where gender-based violence is linked to the lack of realization of their economic, social, political and cultural rights,‚Äù said the authors of the report, Niklas Bruun and Barbara Bailey in an email. Nahanni Fontaine, a special adviser to the Manitoban government on aboriginal women‚Äôs issues, argues that the violence is a form of collateral damage wrought by centuries of prejudice. ‚ÄúFrom the first moments of contact with European explorers, indigenous women were scorned and stereotyped as promiscuous because they owned their sexuality and were treated as equals by their male counterparts,‚Äù she said.
Such contempt for indigenous women was reinforced by brutal attempts to force First Nations to assimilate into mainstream Canadian society. Earlier this month the country‚Äôs Truth and Reconciliation Commission described such policies as a form of ‚Äúcultural genocide‚Äù in a report on the state-sponsored, church-run Indian Residential School system. Between 1876 and 1996, 150,000 aboriginal children were taken from their families and interned in boarding schools specially designed in the words of the system‚Äôs founder Sir John A MacDonald, to ‚Äútake the Indian out of the child‚Äù. One of those children was Sue Caribou, who in 1972 was separated from her family at the age of seven, and taken to a Catholic school where for the next five years she was physically and sexually abused by missionaries who forbade her from speaking Cree, her native language. The violence has never stopped: by the time Caribou left the school in 1979, both her parents had been murdered. Now aged 50 years old, Caribou has lost three female relatives to murder. The last was her beloved niece Tanya Nepinak, who disappeared in 2011 on her way to get pizza in Winnipeg. She was 31 years old. ‚ÄúWhen is this going to end? It‚Äôs getting worse,‚Äù Caribou said. Tanya‚Äôs body was never found, but police believe she was killed by a man called Shawn Lamb, who in 2012 admitted murdering two other indigenous women, Carolyn Sinclair, 25, and Lorna Blacksmith, 18.
Indigenous groups argue that institutional racism contributes to a culture of impunity for perpetrators of crimes against aboriginal women. Justice for the missing or murdered Canada‚Äôs worst serial killer also targeted First Nations women: pig farmer Robert Pickton tortured and killed at least 33 aboriginals before he was arrested in British Columbia in 2002. Soon after his arrest, Amnesty International concluded that perpetrators of violent crimes tend to target them because the ‚Äúpolice in Canada have often failed to provide Indigenous women with an adequate standard of protection‚Äù. Police‚Äôs failings proved fatal for Jennifer McPherson, 41, an Ojibway woman who went missing in British Columbia in May 2013. Her remains were found one week later scattered around the island where she was an off-season caretaker of a fishing resort. McPherson‚Äôs husband Traigo Andretti, later admitted to choking the 41-year-old and burning her body. Andretti confessed to murder, but investigators soon discovered evidence linking him to the disappearance of another indigenous woman seven years earlier. Myrna Letandre had been dating Andretti when she went missing from her home in Winnipeg in October 2006. Her sister, Lorna Letandre, begged Winnipeg detectives to search Andretti‚Äôs house, but he was released after being interrogated just once and was never charged. He married McPherson a couple of months later. Last year, Letandre‚Äôs remains were found buried in the house ‚Äì seven years after her sister first raised the alarm. ‚ÄúIf the Winnipeg police had properly investigated Myrna Letandre‚Äôs case, my sister would still be alive today,‚Äù said Kim McPherson, Jennifer‚Äôs sister, her voice still cracking with grief. Last year, Winnipeg police announced that it was making investigations of missing and murdered aboriginal women a ‚Äústrategic priority‚Äù; it has also established a special task force of 18 officers to solve 28 outstanding cases of murdered or missing women in the province. The force has also worked on improving relations with the community in the city‚Äôs poorest neighbourhoods ‚Äì all of which are predominantly indigenous. But better policing alone is not the answer, warned Winnipeg‚Äôs police chief, Devon Clunis. The Jamaica-born commissioner said that Canada still needed to embark on a difficult national conversation on discrimination against First Nations. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just simply a police issue. It‚Äôs not an indigenous community issue. It is an issue for every single person who calls himself a Winnipegger, a Manitoban, a Canadian,‚Äù he said. Such a reckoning seems all the more urgent in Winnipeg, the capital of Manitoba, which was named as ‚ÄúCanada‚Äôs most racist city‚Äù by the national news magazine MacLean‚Äôs. The city is home to the country‚Äôs largest urban indigenous population, but that population is relegated to relatively impoverished neighbourhoods, which are plagued by underemployment, drug abuse, substandard housing and violent crime. A dysfunctional foster care system Activists say that the city‚Äôs social services ‚Äì which should be protecting vulnerable indigenous children ‚Äì are instead exposing them to further risk by plunging them into a dysfunctional foster care system. Indigenous children make up 87% of the children in foster care in Manitoba, even though they only account for 34% of the province‚Äôs population under 18. This means that at any given time, nearly 10,000 native children are under the care of the provincial Child and Family Services department (CFS). ‚ÄúWe see a direct correlation between girls who are taken into foster care at a young age and women who go missing,‚Äù says Grand Chief Nepinak of the AMC. ‚ÄúWe have to stop traumatising our children.‚Äù Carolyn Sinclair was separated from their alcoholic mother when she was only two. She and her sister Amanda were placed in a foster home where Carolyn was sexually abused, and by the time they were teenagers, both girls were using hard drugs. Amanda, now 35, managed to turn her life around and now has a steady job as a construction worker. Carolyn Sinclair never found a way out of her chaotic lifestyle: she was murdered and dumped near a garbage bin in Winnipeg at the age of 25. In turn, Carolyn‚Äôs two small children have now been taken into foster care, and Amanda has been refused rights to see them. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt even know if they are still alive,‚Äù she said. For more than a decade, a chronic shortage of foster placements meant that children taken into care were often simply left in hotels in downtown Winnipeg. Tina Fontaine disappeared after running away from a Best Western hotel where she had been given a temporary placement. In April, a 15-year-old girl in emergency care was violently assaulted and left for dead in the same hotel. Four weeks later, the minister responsible for the CFS, Kerri Irvin-Ross, was promoted to become deputy prime minister of Manitoba. Indigenous activists such as Sue Caribou see a grim parallel between the casual neglect of the current foster care and the systematic abuse of the residential schools. ‚ÄúKids are shuffled around in abusive homes. It‚Äôs starting all over again,‚Äù she said. Tina Fontaine‚Äôs great aunt Thelma Favel said she hoped that coverage of her niece‚Äôs murder would help focus attention on the violence ‚Äì and perhaps even save a few lives. Speaking through her tears, she said: ‚ÄúMy priest has told me that like Jesus died for our sins, Tina died so that other girls could be saved.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-25T14:59:02Z,world,World news,Lawyer alleges Delhi pressure to 'go soft' in prosecution of Hindus over bombing,"A prominent Mumbai lawyer prosecuting more than a dozen Hindus accused of bombing a Muslim neighbourhood has claimed that the prime minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs Hindu nationalist government put pressure on her to ‚Äúgo soft‚Äù on the case. Four people died and 79 were injured when a bomb planted on a motorcycle exploded in the textile manufacturing town of Malegaon, Maharashtra state, in September 2008. Rohini Salian, the special public prosecutor in the case, told the Indian Express on Thursday that after Modi‚Äôs party came to power last year, an officer of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) told her ‚Äúthere is a message that I should go soft‚Äù. She said: ‚ÄúThe meaning was very clear: don‚Äôt get us [the prosecution] favourable orders.‚Äù Salian said the same officer told her this month that ‚Äúhigher-ups‚Äù did not want her to appear in the case. The NIA categorically denied that one of its officers had briefed Salian ‚Äúinappropriately‚Äù. Nor had any officer created any ‚Äúimpediments in her prosecution work‚Äù, the NIA said. A similar bomb attack in Malegaon two years earlier killed 31 people and injured 312. At that time police implicated Muslim suspects, even though the bombs had gone off at a cemetery where hundreds of Muslims had gathered to mark an Islamic festival. There were at least five similar attacks across India in 2006 and 2007, including the bombing of a Delhi-to-Lahore train in which 68 people died, that were initially blamed on either Pakistani or Indian Muslim terror groups. The investigation into the 2008 bombing ‚Äì Salian‚Äôs case ‚Äì proved to be something of a turning point, implicating a radical Hindu group, Abhinav Bharat.Even more startling was the identity of some of the accused: a serving Indian army colonel, a retired major, a saffron-robed seer and a young holy woman, whose motorcycle was used in the attack. The investigation was led by Hemant Karkare, a Mumbai police officer later killed fighting Pakistani terrorists who attacked Mumbai in November 2008. Following his death, the case was transferred to the newly formed NIA, headquartered in Delhi. Later investigations accused alleged Hindu extremists of being behind other attacks that were initially blamed on Muslims, including the Pakistan train bombing. Salian said she had taken up the Malegaon case on Karkare‚Äôs insistence. ‚ÄúI have no inclination towards any party, any politician,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI am a pukka Hindu. Hindu means what? You should be straight, not have bias against anyone ‚Äì Hindus, anyone who commits an offence is an offender.‚Äù Colin Gonsalves, a human rights lawyer, saw Salian‚Äôs predicament as part of a wider malaise. ‚ÄúThere is large-scale political interference with public prosecutors throughout the country, especially in political cases,‚Äù he claimed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-25T14:17:36Z,world,World news,The solidarity fridge: Spanish town's cool way to cut food waste,"The large white fridge sits prominently on a pavement in Galdakao, a small city on the outskirts of Bilbao. A wooden fence has been built around it, in the hope of conveying the idea that this is not an abandoned appliance, but a pioneering project aimed at tackling food wastage. For the past seven weeks, Galdakao, population 29,000, has been home to Spain‚Äôs first ‚Äúsolidarity fridge‚Äù, in which residents and restaurants can drop off leftover or unused food otherwise destined for the bin. Anything left in the fridge can be picked up by anyone who wants it. ‚ÄúI would guess we‚Äôve saved between 200 and 300kg from the rubbish bin,‚Äù said organiser √Ålvaro Saiz. A typical day might see leftover lentils, a few sandwiches and unopened milk cartons left in the fridge.
The idea came about as Saiz and other members of the city‚Äôs volunteer association were reflecting on the sheer amount of food being thrown out by supermarkets. ‚ÄúWe started to think that if even just one of their rubbish bins was replaced with a fridge, people could take advantage of these items.‚Äù After an online search revealed a network of shared fridges in Berlin, he said. ‚ÄúWe realised we could do this ‚Äì so we did.‚Äù It took about a month to wade through the paperwork needed for the project, including securing a permit from the city to use public space and obtaining the right legal documents to ensure organisers wouldn‚Äôt be held liable should anything go wrong with food taken from the fridge.
As his group pushed forward with the idea, they heard all sorts of opinions from city residents, said the 36-year-old. ‚ÄúI realised that the people who don‚Äôt support it, it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt understand what we‚Äôre doing.‚Äù The goal, according to Saiz, isn‚Äôt to feed people in need. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt charity. It‚Äôs about making use of food that would otherwise end up in the bin,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter who takes it ‚Äì Julio Iglesias could stop by and take the food ‚Äì at the end of the day it‚Äôs about recovering the value of food products and fighting against waste.‚Äù There are strict rules for anyone leaving food in the fridge: no raw fish, meat or eggs, packaged or canned goods cannot be past their use-by date and anything prepared at home must include a label detailing when it was made.
Volunteers keep an eye on the fridge to throw out anything past its use-by date or homemade dishes that are more than four days old. But that‚Äôs in theory: so far all food has been taken on a daily basis. All sorts of people have dropped by so far, said Saiz, including those in need who make a special trip to the fridge from nearby towns and a construction worker who took an ice-cream bar ‚Äì dropped off with just a few days left before its best-before date ‚Äì during his lunch break. Last week the city of Murcia, some 400 miles away in the the south of Spain, copied the idea and became the second Spanish city to host a solidarity fridge. Saiz has received calls from communities across the country ‚Äì and from as far as Bolivia ‚Äì from people interested in setting up similar operations. The fridge has also allowed local restaurants to alleviate guilt over their food wastage, said √Ålvaro Llonin of Topa restaurant. ‚ÄúBefore we used to throw away a lot of food ‚Äì and it was food that was fine to eat.‚Äù He and the staff at the busy restaurant in the centre of Galdakaonow regularly make time to drop off their leftovers in the fridge. ‚ÄúYou know someone is enjoying it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like giving our food a second chance to end up in someone‚Äôs stomach.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-25T14:12:57Z,world,World news,Dinosaur comes out of closet at South Africa university,"Palaeontologists in South Africa have discovered the fossil of a previously unknown dinosaur dating back 200m years. It was found not on a remote desert plain but in a university storeroom. The specimen had been collected in the late 1930s and for decades it remained hidden among the biggest fossil collection in the country at Wits University in Johannesburg. More recently it was considered to represent the remains of another South African dinosaur, Aardonyx. But when palaeontologists Dr Alejandro Otero and Emil Krupandan visited the university to look at early sauropodomorph dinosaurs ‚Äì mostly herbivores with long necks ‚Äì they saw the bones did not match. Observing that one of the specimen‚Äôs ankle bones is shaped like a cross, the researchers realised they had a ‚Äúnew‚Äù dinosaur on their hands. They named it Sefapanosaurus, after the word ‚Äúsefapano‚Äù, which means ‚Äúcross‚Äù in the Sesotho language indigenous to the area where it was dug up. Krupandan said: ‚ÄúThis find indicates the importance of relooking at old material that has only been cursorily studied in the past, in order to re-evaluate past preconceptions about sauropodomorph diversity in light of new data.‚Äù The announcement was made jointly by researchers from Wits University, the University of Cape Town and Argentina‚Äôs Museo de La Plata and Museo Paleontol√≥gico Egidio Feruglio. The remains of Sefapanosaurus ‚Äì which were unearthed in the Zastron area of what is now Free State province, about 20 miles from the border with Lesotho ‚Äì include limb bones, foot bones and several vertebrae. It is considered to be a medium-sized sauropodomorph dinosaur, among the early members of the group that gave rise to the long-necked giants of the Mesozoic era. Dr Jonah Choiniere, co-author and senior researcher in dinosaur palaeobiology at the Evolutionary Studies Institute (ESI) at Wits University, said the Sefapanosaurus had a relatively long neck and small tail but, unlike Brontosaurus, walked on two legs. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre discovering how diverse South Africa was 200m years ago,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen you look at the fossil record you think of one dinosaur hanging out, but it was probably an ecosystem as diverse as that of mammals today.‚Äù On a tour of the ESI this month, the Guardian observed a wealth of dinosaur remains laid out on laboratory tables while researchers worked painstakingly slowly to extract more fossils from rocks. Choiniere said one and possibly two new discoveries would be announced this year. Argentinian co-author Dr Diego Pol said Sefapanosaurus and other recent finds in the two countries revealed that the diversity of herbivorous dinosaurs in Africa and South America ‚Äì when the southern hemisphere continents were a single supercontinent known as Gondwana ‚Äì was remarkably high in the Jurassic period, about 190m years ago . Anusuya Chinsamy-Turan, co-author and professor in the biological sciences department at the University of Cape Town, said: ‚ÄúThe discovery of Sefapanosaurus shows that there were several of these transitional early sauropodomorph dinosaurs roaming around southern Africa about 200m years ago.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-25T13:32:59Z,world,World news,Berkeley balcony collapse to be investigated by US prosecutors,"US prosecutors have launched an investigation into the balcony collapse in Berkeley, California, that killed six students as the family of the final victim to be buried revealed that a postcard from him had arrived home after his death. Lorcan Miller‚Äôs father, Ken, showed the card to mourners at Rathmichael parish church in Shankill south, County Dublin, on Thursday. On its front was the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co, where the 21-year-old medical student had started work this summer. It only arrived on Tuesday, almost a week after he was killed. The postcard read: ‚ÄúAs part of my job I have to talk with customers and I always tell them about my amazing brother and sisters and how much I miss them.‚Äù Miller had signed the card with 12 kisses. During the funeral, Ken Miller broke down as he paid an emotional tribute to his ‚Äútruly remarkable‚Äù son. ‚ÄúLorcan was an extrovert who loved life and wasn‚Äôt afraid to try new things,‚Äù he told the congregation. ‚ÄúHe threw everything he had into everything he did.‚Äù Meanwhile, Conor Flynn, a 22-year-old Dublin student injured in the incident, was released from the John Muir medical centre in Walnut Creek, California. Flynn will remain in the San Francisco Bay area for a few weeks until he is able to fly home.
Sean Fahey was the first student to be discharged from hospital on Sunday and is already home in Ireland. Six young people fell 12 metres (40ft) to their deaths while seven were hurt when the balcony they were on came away from the exterior wall of an apartment block on the Berkeley campus of the University of California. Five of the dead were Irish students; one had dual US-Irish nationality. Berkeley city officials played down the prospects of criminal charges being pursued, but Alameda County‚Äôs deputy district attorney, Teresa Drenick, told Reuters that prosecutors would continue to investigate. Potential targets could include the general contractor for the apartment building or the company that applied a waterproof membrane to the balcony, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. On Wednesday, one of the survivors posted a message on Facebook saying she may never walk again. Clodagh Cogley, 21, from Dublin, said she had sustained two collapsed lungs, a broken shoulder, a broken knee, five broken ribs and a broken spinal cord. ‚ÄúLife is short and I intend to honour those who died by living the happiest and most fulfilling life possible,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúWho knows, maybe legs have been holding me back all these years and I‚Äôll realise my talent for wheelchair basketball.‚Äù The American environmental activist Erin Brockovich has offered her support and campaign advice to the families of th ose who died. In a statement released on Facebook, the campaigner ‚Äì who helped bring a case against a California utilities company in 1993 for poisoning a town‚Äôs water for more than 30 years ‚Äì said she was prepared to meet and assist the families.
Brockovich said she had linked up with Dublin law firm Phelim O‚ÄôNeill to help any family members ‚Äúas they begin their search for answers, explanations and justice‚Äù. ‚ÄúI urge immediate action on the costs for Berkeley families. The company behind the construction of the Berkeley apartment block should take action to ensure that the families of those involved in the balcony collapse disaster are not left with enormous medical bills as a result of the faulty construction,‚Äù she said. Some of those injured would need extensive care before being able to return home, and it was essential the families did not face what Brockovich called the ‚Äúadditional nightmare of mounting medical bills‚Äù. Brockovich added: ‚ÄúAs a Californian, I am devastated that these young visitors to our shores were caught up in this horrific situation. My heart goes out to their families, friends and loved ones, and along with all of the people of California, I want to extend my deepest sympathies to the people of Ireland.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-25T13:07:31Z,world,World news,Philip Hammond warns Ethiopia over treatment of Briton on death row,"The treatment of a Briton on death row in Ethiopia is threatening to undermine the country‚Äôs relationship with the UK, the foreign secretary has warned. In an unusually blunt statement, Philip Hammond has called for rapid progress in the case of Andargachew Tsige, who is being held in solitary confinement in an unknown location in Ethiopia. The foreign secretary‚Äôs comments, released a year after Tsige was abducted while transiting through Yemen, is a clear sign of official disapproval of the approach taken by the regime in Addis Abbaba. The Foreign Office is escalating the case beyond confidential diplomatic exchanges.
On Wednesday, Hammond spoke to the Ethiopian foreign minister, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, about the case on the phone. His statement said: ‚ÄúI am deeply concerned that, a year after he was first detained, British national Andargachew Tsige remains in solitary confinement in Ethiopia without a legal process to challenge his detention. ‚ÄúI am also concerned for his welfare and disappointed that our repeated requests for regular consular access have not been granted, despite promises made. ‚ÄúI spoke to foreign minister Tedros and made clear that Ethiopia‚Äôs failure to grant our repeated and basic requests is not acceptable. I informed Dr Tedros that the lack of progress risks undermining the UK‚Äôs much valued bilateral relationship with Ethiopia.
‚ÄúI asked Dr Tedros once again to permit immediate regular consular access and for our concerns regarding Mr Tsige‚Äôs welfare to be addressed. I have also asked that the Ethiopian authorities facilitate a visit by Mr Tsige‚Äôs family. Foreign Office officials will continue to provide consular support both to Mr Tsige and to his family during this difficult time.‚Äù Tsige‚Äôs partner, Yemi Hailemariam, also a British national, lives in London with their three children. She has spoken to him only once by phone since his abduction. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in prison but we have no idea where he is being held,‚Äù she told the Guardian last month. ‚ÄúHe said he was okay, but I‚Äôm sure the call was being listened to. He had been in Dubai and was flying on to Eritrea when the plane stopped over in Yemen. He hadn‚Äôt even been through immigration. We think Yemeni security took him and handed him over to the Ethiopians.
‚ÄúThey say there was an extradition agreement, but it was so quick there was no time for any semblance of a legal hearing. Yemen and Ethiopia had close relations then. The [Ethiopian] government have put him on television three times in heavily edited interviews, saying he was revealing secrets. ‚ÄúHe has been kept under artificial light 24 hours a day and no one [other than the UK ambassador] has had access to him.‚Äù Tsige, 60 ‚Äì known as Andy ‚Äì had previously been secretary general of Ginbot 7, a political opposition party that called for democracy, free elections and civil rights. He first came to the UK in 1979. The Ethiopian government has accused him of being a terrorist. In 2009, he was tried with others in his absence and sentenced to death. The latest reports suggest that his health is deteriorating. His lawyer, Ben Cooper, of Doughty Street Chambers, said: ‚ÄúWe welcome the Foreign Secretary condemning the illegality of Andy Tsige‚Äôs detention, confirming the fact of his solitary confinement and demanding consular visits. But we have a simple ask: please request Andy Tsige‚Äôs return home to his family in London. Mr Tsige was kidnapped by Ethiopia at an international airport and the only remedy for kidnap is release. Why has Mr Hammond not yet asked Ethiopia to release Andy so he can return home to England?‚Äù Juan M√©ndez, the UN special rapporteur on torture, has written to the Ethiopian and UK governments saying he is investigating Tsige‚Äôs treatment. Who is Andargachew Tsige? Andargachew, or Andy, Tsige fled Addis Abbaba in the 1970s following threats against his life from the military regime, the Derg, which then controlled Ethiopia. A student activist, he had attracted the attention of the authorities. His younger brother was killed by the security forces. Tsige escaped into the mountains to join opposition groups. In 1979, after falling out with fellow rebels, he sought asylum in the UK. He studied at the University of Greenwich and obtained full UK citizenship. Tsige returned to Ethiopia after the Derg was overthrown but moved back to the UK in the early 1990s where he became active in opposition politics. In 2005, he returned to Addis Abbaba again. He took part in that year‚Äôs election and was briefly imprisoned. after being freed, he founded a new political movement, Ginbot 7, from his exile in London. The organisation was alleged by the Ethiopian government to have launched a failed coup in 2009. Tsige was condemned to death in his absence. In June 2014, he had flown to the Gulf to give lectures. An unexpected change to his return route saw him fly back via Yemen where he changed planes. At Sana‚Äôa airport, he was arrested by guards and put on a plane to Ethiopia on the grounds that there was an extradition agreement between the two countries. Supporters say that had he been born white and in the UK, the Foreign Office would have taken a more forceful line in campaigning for his release from death row in east Africa. His partner, Yemisrach Hailemariam, and their three children live in London. She has campaigned actively for his freedom. In February a delegation of MPs, led by Jeremy Corbyn, his local member, was scheduled to visit Ethiopia in an attempt to secure his release. The trip was abandoned following a meeting with the Ethiopian ambassador.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-25T13:03:30Z,world,World news,"UK  demands for EU renegotiations are still on track, No 10 insists","Downing Street has insisted that David Cameron‚Äôs EU renegotiation demands are still on track, after a draft communique of the European council‚Äôs conclusions simply said leaders would ‚Äúrevert to the matter in December‚Äù. The draft council conclusions made no mention of any official, technical discussions that Cameron hopes will start after he has presented his plans for EU reform to his fellow leaders at dinner.
The brief line on the subject reads: ‚ÄúUK PM set out his plans for an (in/out) referendum in the UK. European council agreed to revert to the matter in December.‚Äù However, Cameron‚Äôs official spokeswoman said what mattered was getting an agreement in principle for the technical talks on reforms to start before the summer. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to get into commenting on draft communiques,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere are normally several iterations of council conclusions before they are finalised. We‚Äôve been clear what our objectives are, which is to make sure that following the summit work is kicked off on technical work on UK renegotiations ... You‚Äôll need to wait for the final version of the conclusions. ‚ÄúWhat matters for us is the substance and that technical work gets under way before the summer. What matters is that agreement.‚Äù She also pointed to the fact that the European commission has now appointed a new ‚Äútaskforce‚Äù dedicated to Britain‚Äôs demands for reform, headed by the UK‚Äôs most experienced Brussels official, Jonathan Faull. It is possible Donald Tusk, president of the council, could be tasked with running the renegotiations overall. The draft agenda for the summit gives details on the first three items, but the fourth is simply listed as ‚ÄúUK‚Äù. At the end of dinner, Tusk, the meeting‚Äôs chair, will give Cameron the floor and ask him to outline if, and on what terms, Britain wants to stay in the union, when the vote will take place, and what procedures should precede it. Asked whether the brief draft conclusions and the fact that Cameron was only getting a slot over coffee meant the matter was very low down the list of priorities, the spokeswoman said it was clear the UK‚Äôs reforms were on the agenda. Cameron has now spoken to 23 of the EU‚Äôs other 27 leaders about his hopes for reform, which include restricting benefits for new migrants for four years and exempting the UK from ‚Äúever closer union‚Äù within the EU. Pressed on whether he would bring up the need for treaty change ‚Äì a key demand of Cameron‚Äôs eurosceptic backbenchers ‚Äì his spokeswoman said: ‚ÄúWe should wait for the dinner. He has already talked to up to 23 leaders and he will have done 27 so all the leaders sat round the table will know about the issues the prime minister wants to address and as we‚Äôve also said there is quite a busy agenda. What matters is the work that follows. I‚Äôm sure leaders will return to the issue in the future.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-25T12:31:59Z,world,World news,Syrians respond to 'summer in Syria' tweet with photographic realities of war,"Pictures of colourful Damascus markets, squad photos at pool parties, or panoramas of festival crowds holding glow sticks were not what Syria√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s state news agency got when it tweeted asking for Syrians to share their summer snaps. Instead, users have been sharing photographs of the country√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s conflict in response to the tweet sent out this week as part of a social media campaign from Sana English.
Users have hijacked the hashtag to share photos of injured civilians, devastation and bombsites from the four-year-old conflict. Official Jargon, an account interested in the design and interpretation of propaganda, posted:
Others used sarcasm to highlight the contrast of the request to the realities of life in Syria:
Another user drew attention to the destruction of historical sites:
An image from Yarmouk, a Palestinian refugee camp on the edge of the capital, Damascus, demonstrating the sheer scale of the crisis was also tweeted:
But it was not just local users and activists making use of the hashtag, as the US embassy in Syria sent political tweets and shared videos showing regime-inflicted destruction:
Other tweets from the Damascus-based news agency included: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìTemperatures below average tomorrow, sunny/partly cloudy in general, chance of drizzle over the coast.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ In another, a photo is shared from a local football match in Sweida province, purporting to be √¢‚Ç¨≈ìhonouring [the] army√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ. Syria has been in turmoil after a violent crackdown on Arab spring protests against the Assad family√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s four-decade rule led to civil war. More than 210,000 people, most of them civilians, have been killed in the conflict, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, while more than half the country√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s population of 22 million have fled their homes. The conflict has also seen the rise of Islamic State (Isis), which has fought both regime forces and opposition groups and become the target of a US-led air campaign. Human rights groups such as Amnesty International have accused the Assad regime of committing numerous abuses, including crimes against humanity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-25T11:00:01Z,world,World news,US court to hear arguments that Brazil oil giant should stand trial for corruption,"A US court will hear arguments on Thursday that oil giant Petrobras should stand trial for a culture of bribery and corruption that has rocked Brazilian businesses and political elite and lowered the company‚Äôs value by $90bn. Investors, led by the UK Universities Superannuation Scheme, which manages the pension funds of British academics, claim they lost billions as a result of the huge money laundering and corruption scheme. The investors, which also include the retirement funds of state workers in Ohio, Idaho and Hawaii, claim in court filings that Petrobras was ‚Äúrotten to the core‚Äù. The scandal, which has been dubbed ‚Äúoperation carwash‚Äù because huge amounts of money were allegedly laundered through a money exchange in a nondescript gas station in the Brazilian capital, has already led to the indictment of more than 40 Brazilian executives allegedly involved in the bribery scheme dating back to 2006. Corruption allegedly spread from the boardroom to politics, with Brazilians taking to the streets earlier this year to call for the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff. She was chairwoman of Petrobras‚Äôs board between 2003 and 2010, when most of the alleged corruption took place. Rousseff has denied any knowledge of the scheme and no evidence has linked her to the corruption. The Brazilian government owns the majority of Petrobras‚Äô shares, and controls the company with seven of 10 seats on the board. The lawsuit claims that Petrobras executives accepted bribes for inflating the value of construction contracts and ‚Äúused the money to bribe politicians through intermediaries to guarantee they would vote in line with the ruling party while enriching themselves.‚Äù The investors in the US class action, which merges eight separate suits, are being represented by Pomerantz Law, which helped investors sue BP in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico disaster and some of those that lost out in the Enron scandal. Petrobras has called for the case to be thrown out because the company was also a victim of the scheme. ‚ÄúPetrobras itself was the victim in this scandal, carried out by a criminal cartel of Brazil‚Äôs largest construction and engineering companies,‚Äù the company said in papers filed at the district court in lower Manhattan. If Judge Rakoff, who is known for his tough stance on corporate wrongdoing, allows the case to go ahead, senior executives and Brazilian politicians will likely be called to appear before the New York court. Meanwhile, Brazilian prosecutors investigating the scandal have asked the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to help them build their case as its tentacles spread beyond the board. In a statement, this week, prosecutors said they had been ‚Äúinspired by the Fifa case‚Äù, in which the US brought bribery and corruption charges against several senior executives in world soccer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-25T10:10:59Z,world,World news,Mother and baby son found alive in Colombian jungle days after plane crash,"A woman and her baby son have been found alive in the thick Colombian jungle five days after a plane crash. Authorities called the survival of 18-year-old Mar√≠a Nelly Murillo and her son Yudier Moreno a miracle, after their Cessna 303 plane crashed into trees in the north-west of the country. ‚ÄúIt is a very wild area and it was a catastrophic accident,‚Äù Colombian Air Force colonel H√©ctor Carrascal told AFP. Murillo was pictured on Thursday looking exhausted, with burns on her arms, and clinging to a rescue worker after she was lifted from a rescue helicopter.
Mother and baby are now in hospital, with Murillo suffering minor burns. Her son is in good health, the air force said in a statement. ‚ÄúHis mother‚Äôs spirit must have given him strength to survive,‚Äù Carrascal said. The body of the plane‚Äôs pilot, Capt Carlos Mario Ceballos, was found three days ago in the ruined aircraft in the Serran√≠a del Baud√≥ mountain range. The plane had been flying from Quibd√≥, the capital of Choc√≥ region in the west of the country, to the Pacific coastal town of Nuqu√≠. The cause of the crash is not yet known. The doors of the plane were open when it was was found, which led authorities to suspect surviving passengers had managed to get out of the wreckage. Carasscal told local reporters that rescue workers had also found toys in the plane wreckage, but no bodies, prompting a search-and-rescue effort.
A 14-man team scoured the dense jungle for three days without finding the mother and child, then resorted to using loudspeakers to broadcast their presence. Carasscal said that tactic was more successful, telling El Colombiano that contact was established and arrangements were made to transport the survivors to El Cara√±o airport.

2015-06-25T10:09:49Z,world,World news,Isis targets vulnerable Bosnia for recruitment and attack,"Islamic State has expanded its efforts to recruit fighters in Bosnia and incite terrorist attacks there, taking advantage of the world‚Äôs highest youth unemployment rate and chronic political paralysis. The initiative, though small in scale, is causing alarm in western capitals, where diplomats fear that the mix of economic malaise and ethnic tensions represents fertile terrain for extremism, and that Europe could come to regret the failure to confront Bosnia‚Äôs profound structural problems in the two decades since the war. Isis produced a new recruitment video this month, targeting the Balkans region and Bosnia and Herzegovina in particular. The 20-minute film, entitled Honour is in Jihad, features several Bosnian Isis fighters exhorting their fellow countrymen to join the battle in Syria or carry out opportunistic attacks on perceived enemies of Islam at home. ‚ÄúIf you can, put explosives under the cars, in their houses, all over them. If you can, take poison and put it in their drink or food. Make them die, make them die of poisoning, kill them wherever you are. In Bosnia, in Serbia, in Sandzak [a region in south-west Serbia]. You can do it,‚Äù one of the Bosnians, identified by a pseudonym, Salahuddin al-Bosni, implores the audience in Bosnian.
A newly published report on jihadism found: ‚ÄúReturning foreign fighters from Syria and Iraq ‚Äì battle-hardened, skilled in handling arms and explosives, and ideologically radicalised ‚Äì pose a direct threat not only to the security of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also of the region and beyond.‚Äù The report, The Lure of the Syrian War: The Foreign Fighters‚Äô Bosnian Contingent, found that in 2013 and 2014, 156 Bosnian men and 36 women travelled to Syria, taking with them 25 children. Out of that number, 48 men and three women had returned by January of this year. The authors, Sarajevo University associate political science professor Vlado Azinoviƒá and Islamic theologian and columnist Muhamed Jusiƒá, found that Bosnia was ill-equipped to deal with the potential threat. It is a weak state, split by a 1995 peace agreement into two entities, a federation of Muslims (known as Bosniaks) and Croats, and a Serb republic. Furthermore the federation is divided into 10 cantons. Twenty-two police agencies operate in the country with overlapping jurisdictions and roles. ‚ÄúGenerally, there is a lack of coordination between local law-enforcement agencies on [foreign fighter-] related issues,‚Äù the report says, noting there is no single database on foreign fighters,and the existing data is ‚Äúmostly scattered, often incomplete or disorganised‚Äù. ‚ÄúThis results in significant gaps in understanding and monitoring of the phenomenon,‚Äù it notes, adding that government ‚Äúlacks a discernible strategy‚Äù to confront the looming problem. ‚ÄúWe are not doing anything. We are just observing,‚Äù Azinoviƒá said. Kristina Joziƒá, a spokeswoman for the Bosnian state investigation and protection agency (Sipa), responsible for internal security, said it would analyse the Isis video with a view to identifying Bosnians involved in criminal offences. ‚ÄúThe return of individuals participating in the armed conflict in Syria, fighting with Isis, is undoubtedly a security challenge and a threat, the extent of which is hard to determine at this time,‚Äù Joziƒá said. ‚ÄúSipa constantly checks allegations of terrorist activities, whether it be on trips to foreign battlefields, financing, recruitment or other terror-related activities ... and will take the necessary action.‚Äù
According to diplomatic sources, the Sarajevo government is preparing a new counter-terrorism strategy, with greater emphasis on prevention and rehabilitation of returned fighters, and presented a draft to General John Allen, the US special envoy for countering Isis, when he visited Sarajevo on 8 June. Salafist communities operating outside the official mosques have sprung up in three districts, Gornja Maoƒça, Osve and Dubnica, and ‚Äúpop-up‚Äù radical mosques, often funded from the Gulf, have appeared in Sarajevo, Zenica and Tuzla. After three years of observing Bosnian jihadis, the authors place them in two broad categories: veterans who fought alongside mujahideen volunteers from the Arab world in the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict, and young Bosnian men ‚Äúdriven mostly by adrenaline and a quest for self-validation, self-respect, group belonging, and purpose‚Äù. Almost a third of the Bosnian Isis recruits had criminal records. Chronic deadlock between the rival entities has contributed to economic stagnation and a 63% unemployment rate among young Bosnians, the highest official rate in the world. Bosnian society, which the report says ‚Äúis gradually losing the ability to manage itself‚Äù, is becoming a factor in the flow of Isis recruits. Like most Isis videos, Honour is in Jihad supplies slickly edited, emotive images married to a seductive narrative. It paints an idyllic picture of insurgent life in Syria, with Bosnian, Kosovan and Albanian fighters walking off to battle like a smiling band of brothers while enjoying time with their families on their days off, complete with complimentary cars. Isis has produced a stream of similar videos aimed at recruits from France, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and several other countries, each one tailored to local culture and history. With the use of computer graphics, the film portrays the sweep of Balkan history as a prolonged expropriation of inherently ‚ÄúMuslim lands‚Äù, first by ‚Äúcrusaders‚Äù, then atheistic communists, and finally nationalists. The current Bosniak political leadership are painted as collaborators with the enemies of Islam ‚Äúpreparing you like sheep for the next genocide‚Äù.
With a dramatic skewing of history, the film credits the mujahideen brigade with ‚Äúrepelling the Serbs‚Äù in the Bosnian war, although in reality it had a limited impact on a small section of the frontline. Meanwhile it depicts the large-scale US-led air campaign against the Bosnian Serb military as incidental and somehow designed to prevent the rise of the Muslim faithful. ‚ÄúThe massacres will be repeated if Muslims don‚Äôt return to your religion,‚Äù an elderly jihadi, Abu Safiyah al-Bosni, declares in the film. He is believed to be a Muslim from Sandzak rcalled Abid Podbiƒáanin, and was reported killed in Syria in March. Salahuddin al-Bosni, who issued the calls for murder earlier in the video and is thought to be a Bosnian called Ines Midzic, apparently died in battle at about the same time. The Bosnian authorities believe another two participants in the film are also dead; another is seriously wounded. Western government officials believe that the roughly 50 jihadis who have come back to Bosnia so far represent a manageable load for the Bosnian intelligence and security agencies, despite their many divisions and flaws. But they also worry that the scale of the problem could escalate dramatically given the parlous conditions of Bosnia‚Äôs economy and society. In the only potential terrorist incident to cause casualties in Bosnia this year, a 24-year-old Bosniak man from the area around the Serb-run town of Zvornik, drove to its police station on April 27 and opened fire, killing one officer and injuring two others before being shot dead himself. The gunman, Nerdin Ibriƒá, was found to have been a friend of a local man who had returned from Syria, but the extent to which he had come under jihadi influence is unclear. Official reports said Ibriƒá shouted ‚ÄúAllahu Akbar‚Äù as he launched his attack, but other accounts said he hurled curses at his targets. It also turned out that Ibriƒá‚Äôs father was among 750 Muslim men rounded up by Serb police and paramilitaries in June 1992, at the start of the war, and killed. The nationalist Serb authorities reacted as if the shooting had been a major offensive. ‚ÄúThis is the worst terrorism attack that could happen in the Serb Republic,‚Äù Dragan Lukaƒç, the region‚Äôs interior minister, told local television, adding that it ‚Äúcould be the start of much worse events in Bosnia and Herzegovina‚Äù. The Serb leadership used the shooting as a pretext for arresting large numbers of Bosniaks on their territory, and claimed it justified the creation of a new Serb special police squad. Western diplomats argued it was a reason for better coordination among the existing 22 police forces rather than for creating a new one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-25T07:48:23Z,world,World news,Armenia protests escalate after police turn on demonstrators,"Thousands of Armenians have taken to the streets to protest against electricity rate hikes, marching on the presidential palace and staging all-night sit-ins around the main square of the capital, leading to fears in Moscow of a Ukraine-style popular uprising. The protests in Yerevan, which began on Friday, escalated significantly after police fired water cannons to disperse seated demonstrators on Tuesday morning. By Wednesday evening thousands of people had gathered on Marshal Baghramyan Avenue near the presidential palace, chanting slogans and blocking traffic.
In the early hours of Wednesday, ruling party politicians and others formed a human shield between police and protesters, although negotiations over a potential meeting with the president, Serzh Sargsyan, fell through for the second night. Smaller-scale protests spread to the cities of Gyumri, Vanadzor and Charentsavan, Armenia Today reported. ‚ÄúA lot more people came on [Tuesday] because they understood that you can‚Äôt just drive people out like that,‚Äù Nikolai Torosyan, a journalist at the site PanArmenian.net, who has been attending the demonstrations. ‚ÄúThey came to protest not just against the electricity price hike but also against the rough way protesters were dispersed.‚Äù The sit-ins began on Friday near Yerevan‚Äôs opera house. On Monday night demonstrators marched toward the presidential residence, where they remained through the night. On Tuesday morning riot police sprayed seated protesters with water cannons, then marched forward to force them out. In video of the events, several bulky men in civilian clothes can be seen grabbing protesters and dragging them behind the police line.
According to police, 237 people were detained and seven demonstrators and 11 policemen were injured. They were later all released. Torosyan told the Guardian that although he was wearing a press badge, police knocked him down and kicked him as they confronted protesters on Tuesday. Other journalists reported having their cameras broken or confiscated by police. The protests flared up in response to a decision on 17 June by the state utilities commission to raise electricity prices by 17 to 22%, at the request of Electric Networks of Armenia, which has a monopoly on distribution. The utility company is fully owned by the Russian company Inter RAO, which is headed by Igor Sechin, a close ally of president Vladimir Putin.
The price hike, which will come into effect on 1 August, is the third in the past two years and provoked anger in the poor landlocked country of three million, where unemployment was reportedly 17% in 2014 and has been rising. Armenia‚Äôs growing economic woes are closely tied with those in Russia. The rouble lost half of its value in 2014 amid falling oil prices and western sanctions over Moscow‚Äôs role in the Ukraine crisis. As a result, remittances sent home from by Armenians working in Russia have reportedly fallen by as much as half in dollar terms.
The state utilities commission remained unwilling to back down on Wednesday, with spokeswoman Mariam Stepanyan saying it had ‚Äúnot made decisions that need to be corrected‚Äù. Although its daughter company was behind the price hikes that drew people to the streets, Inter RAO claimed that it had no role to play. ‚ÄúInter RAO believes that the events in Armenia have become political, and we‚Äôre engaged in business in Armenia, not politics, and we don‚Äôt plan to participate in these events,‚Äù spokesman Nikolai Gorelov said on Tuesday, the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets reported. Amid the standoff between Moscow and the west over the Ukraine crisis, Russian politicians have suggested the Yerevan protests could be the start of a US-orchestrated ‚Äúcolour revolution‚Äù to topple the Armenian government. Igor Morozov, a member of the foreign affairs committee in Russia‚Äôs upper house of parliament, said the unrest in Armenia was ‚Äúexactly the same‚Äù as the beginning of the Maidan protests in favour of European integration that ousted Ukraine‚Äôs president Viktor Yanukovych last year.
‚ÄúThe American embassy in Armenia is also actively participating in the current events in Yerevan,‚Äù Morozov told state news agency RIA Novosti. Liberal commentators have in turn blamed the Kremlin. Opposition activist Vsevolod Chernozub tweeted a photograph of Sechin, who heads state oil champion Rosneft as well as Inter RAO, with the caption, ‚ÄúThe State Department puppet whose company suggested raising electricity prices in Armenia by 40%.‚Äù
Speakers at the rally in Yerevan have reportedly denounced the idea that they were being influenced by foreign organisations or governments, and protesters have tweeted that they were simply opposing the price hike and that the demonstrations should not be compared to the Euromaidan protests in Kiev. Although some protestors had waved European Union flags, Torosyan said they included people from all political backgrounds. This week‚Äôs events are the first major protests since demonstrations over the presidential election in 2008, he added. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs new people who are taking part, people themselves who use these services, they are coming out on street,‚Äù Torosyan said. ‚ÄúThere are not just poor people, there are middle class, nationalists, liberals. It‚Äôs a very wide swath of society, and there are no political overtones.‚Äù Torosyan said he planned to join protestors again as they assembled on Wednesday evening. Alexei Malashenko, a Caucasus and Central Asia expert at the Carnegie Centre in Moscow, called the Yerevan demonstrations ‚Äúordinary economic protests,‚Äù but said Armenia‚Äôs economic situation would likely remain bad. ‚ÄúSargsyan only just signed documents with Putin that Russia will sell Armenia cheap gas, and everyone was happy,‚Äù Malashenko said, referring to a 2014 deal for customs-free sale of oil products that the federation council on Wednesday extended until the end of 2015. ‚ÄúThen they raise electricity prices, no one likes this, and they hold up EU flags... Will there be a Maidan in Armenia? I doubt it, but the fact they harshly dispersed protestors has grown the demonstrations.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-25T04:00:07Z,world,World news,What do Iranians really think of a nuclear deal beyond the polls and Twittersphere?,"When I first started at the company, my new co-workers warned me about delving too heavily into politics with others. Most were afraid there might be an informant lurking in the office. ‚ÄúCareful ‚Äì don‚Äôt say that in front of just anyone,‚Äù they‚Äôd say. Living in Tehran, I‚Äôm no stranger to talk of bugged rooms, ‚Äúkeywords‚Äù that alert spooky software to tap your phone, and government agents disguised as hipsters. I‚Äôve decided, however, that much of this is the same exaggerated nonsense that must have hovered over the Shah‚Äôs secret police in the 1970s. So I unabashedly spark conversations on the nuclear negotiations in the office. But when I extract myself from the Twittersphere and ignore my politically savvy journalist friends, I notice few at my workplace are engaging with the nuclear negotiations as passionately as I‚Äôm being told they are. Or as passionately as I am. Because when Iran‚Äôs nuclear negotiators struck a ‚Äúframework‚Äù agreement in early April (the Joint Plan of Action ‚Äì JPOA), I was ecstatic. Our office? Not so much. Hamed says I‚Äôm na√Øve if I think anything‚Äôs going to change. Gita tries for small talk with a ‚Äúyou think so?‚Äù and then delivers her finishing blow with a lukewarm ‚ÄúI sure hope so‚Äù. Mohsen just lays it on: ‚Äúthe mood hasn‚Äôt changed.‚Äù In the office where I spend most of my days, the nuke talks don‚Äôt always arouse heated discussion. I can‚Äôt blame my co-workers for not being fired up. Iran‚Äôs reformers have been shot down so frequently over the past few decades that JPOAs, comprehensive JPOAs and ‚Äúframework accords‚Äù seem like noise set against a backdrop of immense un- and underemployment, inflation that outpaces pay raises, and social restrictions that have no place in 2015 (let‚Äôs avoid the hijab for a second: physically playing musical instruments on state TV is still against the rules). That mood will remain unchanged, Mohsen says, until Iranians see the proof in the proverbial pudding.
‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs going to happen ‚Äì it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre waiting for the talks to end in disaster,‚Äù says Hesam, whose smartphone is clearly more grabbing than the prospect of having sanctions lifted. I probe him for more: what about the street celebrations on Vali Asr street after the framework deal ‚Äì the pictures, the tweets? He looks up as if to swat a fly. ‚ÄúPeople were happier on the first day after the agreement. But over time, they started to doubt it again.‚Äù And it‚Äôs not just at the office: we‚Äôre less than a week away from what could be a historic agreement, but it sure doesn‚Äôt feel like it in my slice of Tehran. That doesn‚Äôt mean people don‚Äôt support the deal. Everyone I know would like nothing more than to see the sanctions removed. They just aren‚Äôt excited - or optimistic - about it. Sometimes, I fantasise about the nuke deal. I see Iran on the cusp of what could be a transformation ‚Äì an end to nearly four decades of exasperating sanctions that have prevented its full and unhindered reintegration into the international community. It‚Äôs big. It could bring massive foreign investment, job creation, and cleaner air. It could pry the economy from entrenched establishment types that have abused the country‚Äôs relative isolation for their own gain. It could mean McDonald‚Äôs, Starbucks and maybe somewhere down the line, Shakira and Radiohead. Then reality smacks me square in the face and I‚Äôm back at the office. I remember dropping by my co-worker‚Äôs room a while back to follow up with a project we were both assigned to. I noticed he was gone, so I checked a few other rooms to find still more unattended desks. When this happens, I usually head to the cafeteria, which contains one of two televisions hooked up to state TV. Sure enough, the second-floor staff had huddled around the lunch table, gripped by the last few minutes of a soccer match on Channel 3.
There‚Äôs nothing unnatural about this. It was just a bizarre contrast to the complete lack of interest in the run up to the JPOA last November, when Iran and the United States ‚Äì sworn enemies for 36 years ‚Äì took the first concrete step toward d√©tente. No one rushed to the cafeteria to see if the negotiations had succeeded, even though IRINN was on, broadcasting live updates. At the time, in fact, most were busy furiously debating an upcoming faceoff between Esteghlal and Persepolis. If there has ever been passion in our office, it was then.
(Admittedly, Ali, who used to sit across from me, would occasionally ask for the latest on the nuke deal, setting off a conversation between me, him, and the guy who sat in the corner. Once he stopped me in the stairwell, saying he was worried about the supreme leader lambasting the US at a critical juncture in the talks. I responded by asking him to picture the utter regime meltdown that would ensue if the supreme leader had instead extended an olive branch to America. Our conversation thus ended). Determined to find someone beaming with as much enthusiasm as I am in the aftermath of the framework accord, I head upstairs to the third floor. Here I find Asghar, who isn‚Äôt beaming but is content with the faint scent of hope that has wafted through Iran. ‚ÄúJust the fact that there‚Äôs hope ‚Äì like when [President Hassan] Rouhani was elected ‚Äì is enough.‚Äù Iran has to change gradually, he says, because sudden changes ‚Äì like a revolution ‚Äì could end up in a full-blown civil war ‚Äúbetween the not-so-religious and the religious‚Äù. Across the table, Elnaz takes the counterpoint: the agreement only prolongs a status quo she utterly despises. ‚ÄúThis just means that these people are only going to stay around longer - for another ten to 20 years now,‚Äù she says of her country‚Äôs political leaders. The lack of excitement still confounds me. Maybe I‚Äôm cuing into the wrong signs? You would assume an agreement that could fundamentally remake Iran‚Äôs relationship with the world would be glamorous enough to trigger something beyond prosaic elevator chitchat. Then I think back to what the always-smiley Morteza had to say. Instead of looking at the formidable challenges ahead, he marvelled at the distance we had already travelled.
‚ÄúI mean just the fact that our two presidents have spoken to each other is big,‚Äù he says of President Rouhani‚Äôs historic phone call with President Barack Obama in September 2013. ‚ÄúCould you imagine that just a short while ago they tried to avoid each other? Like, if one of them learned the other was walking somewhere, he would try to distance himself so they didn‚Äôt cross paths?‚Äù Morteza is telling the story of the Islamic republic‚Äôs first reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, and the rumoured lengths to which he went to avoid a ‚Äúrun-in‚Äù with Bill Clinton in the UN bathroom in 1997 (lest he inflame Iranian hardliners). Maybe I should be paying attention to the little things, like Morteza. Maybe I need to temper my daydreams with a heavy dose of the little changes we‚Äôve already lived through. Maybe ‚Äì just maybe ‚Äì my co-workers are more willing to acknowledge that the nuke deal won‚Äôt be the be-all end-all panacea than I am. Even for Mohsen, it‚Äôs the gradual changes that might make the wait worthwhile. ‚ÄúLook, all I‚Äôm saying is that even if we regain our stature and honour in the international community - if the Iranian passport is a valid document again - that alone will make more of a difference to me than any improvement in our livelihoods,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúSo the next time somebody says ‚ÄòIran‚Äô, people don‚Äôt just turn around and look the other way.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it will have much of an impact on our lives,‚Äù says Mahnaz of a potential nuke deal a day after I interviewed Mohsen in front of her. ‚ÄúI think most of the benefit will accrue to the higher echelons of society: I mean, that‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs always been. I don‚Äôt know how this is going to be any different. She continues: ‚ÄúJust like [Mohsen] said the other day - if our country‚Äôs reputation improves in the eyes of the international community, that alone would be wonderful.‚Äù Names have been changed.

2015-06-25T01:15:49Z,world,World news,'How much?' Why bribes to people smugglers could revive a dying trade,"Business has been bad for Gandi, a fisherman who rides the waves off Indonesia‚Äôs rugged southern Java coast. The 44-year-old‚Äôs meagre catches are sometimes too small to cover the cost of the fuel he needs to power his 7.5-metre blue and white wooden boat. Added to that, a lucrative sideline in helping ferry asylum seekers for people smugglers has been all but snuffed out after a crackdown by the Indonesian authorities and their threats of arrest. But things may be about to change. ‚ÄúI could take them from here,‚Äù he says, gesturing at the dark sand beach fringed with palm trees and ramshackle, red-tiled huts used by the local fishermen.
His sudden optimism comes after hearing the allegations that Australia paid members of a smuggling crew US$5,000 each to turn a boatload of asylum seekers back to Indonesia. The boat in question had reportedly set off from the port of Pelabuhan Ratu, close to Gandi‚Äôs village, last month and was stopped in international waters by the Australian navy. ‚ÄúHow much is US$5,000 in rupiah?‚Äù Gandi asks. Told it is more than 30 times the amount he used to earn from ferrying migrants a short distance out to sea, his eyes light up.
The father of three says he was ‚Äúvery scared‚Äù when he transported asylum seekers in the past, typically loading about 20 into his small boat in the dead of night ‚Äì on one occasion nearly getting caught by the police. ‚ÄúBut I need money,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe money eclipses the fear.‚Äù The rugged coastline of southern Java, where dense jungle rolls down to the beaches and colourful wooden fishing boats dot the shore, used to be a major staging ground for people smuggling. But the Australian prime minister Tony Abbott‚Äôs hardline policy of turning back asylum boats, helped by increased policing and campaigns to educate people about people smuggling in Indonesia, has largely stemmed the flow of boats. In Pelabuhan Ratu and the surrounding area, only 15 migrants bound for Australia have been arrested so far this year and one in 2014, a huge drop from nearly 1,000 reportedly detained in 2013. Pelabuhan Ratu is a day‚Äôs journey from the Australian territory of Christmas Island. But Indonesian immigration officials fear the allegations of payments for those who are caught trying to enter Australian waters could undermine the progress of the past two years by tempting more people to get involved in the trade.
‚ÄúThis could become a headache for us,‚Äù says a senior local official, Irfan Sapari. ‚ÄúWe have been trying our best to stop boat departures.‚Äù It is not just local officials who are annoyed but also the Indonesian government in Jakarta, which has angrily hit out at Australia and demanded an explanation after Abbott repeatedly refused to deny or confirm the payment. Indonesia‚Äôs foreign ministry has said that if confirmed, the payments would mark a ‚Äúnew low‚Äù in Australia‚Äôs handling of asylum seekers. Police in eastern Indonesia, where the boat carrying 65 mostly Sri Lankan asylum seekers came ashore late in May, have displayed stacks of cash they say was paid by Australia, describing the money as a ‚Äúbribe‚Äù. The row risks becoming a serious diplomatic crisis, further straining ties between the neighbours that are already under pressure owing to the execution in April of two Australian drug smugglers. Critics fear that coastal settlements of Java could once again become targets for people smugglers, who have previously found recruits among the fishermen and villagers of the area who are fighting to survive on low incomes.
The village of Cibangban, a short journey down the coast from Pelabuhan Ratu, is typical of the area, a collection of modest houses on a jungle-covered hillside that leads down to paddy fields and a palm-fringed beach, where boats struggle through crashing waves to reach land each morning. Up until a year ago, people smuggling agents used to regularly walk the beaches, fishermen and other villagers tell the Guardian, offering locals money to take migrants out to bigger vessels. These vessels were the ones that would carry the asylum seekers towards Australia but they were too big to leave port loaded with asylum seekers without attracting attention. The asylum seekers would be dropped off at night before being ferried out to sea and the agents would pay the fishermen on their return. Locals said they would be offered between 2 million rupiah (A$193, ¬£95) and 10 million rupiah each time they took migrants out ‚Äì more than they could normally earn in several weeks. Many claim they did not know anything illegal was going on. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt know they were illegal migrants,‚Äù says Yus, a fisherman who goes by only one name and says he did not transport the asylum seekers himself. ‚ÄúThe people who offered money said these passengers had been invited by Australia. ‚ÄúWe only found out it is illegal to transport them after the authorities told us.‚Äù Asked whether he would risk taking migrants out after the alleged Australian payment, Yus hesitates then replies: ‚ÄúThe police have warned us that we will be sent to jail immediately if we are caught transporting migrants.‚Äù Others say they would not take the risk but authorities are nevertheless concerned.
A local fisheries official, Arip Gustia, tasked with educating the locals to ‚Äúbe a good fisherman‚Äù by not breaking the laws, admits he has a tough job. Catches are at their lowest level for three months and fishermen are tempted to find any way they can of earning money. Respected local figures have also been given the task of informing law enforcement agencies if they spot anything untoward. Under Indonesian laws, anyone found guilty of aiding people smuggling operations faces at least five years in jail and a fine. Even Gandi admits he found the trips harrowing on occasion, recalling how one group of women and children became hysterical as he took them through stormy waters to a waiting boat.
‚ÄúI remember until today how they cried and screamed, how frightened they were,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI helped a woman to hold her baby, only a few months old. She was so nervous.‚Äù Nevertheless he says he would be willing to transport asylum seekers again, as he earned so little as a fisherman. He returned from an overnight trip ‚Äì many of the fishermen in the area work at night ‚Äì on a recent Sunday morning and sold his catch for 75,000 rupiah (A$7, ¬£4), not even enough to cover the 135,000 rupiah he spent on fuel. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt had any money to give to my wife for three days,‚Äù he says.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-25T00:56:48Z,world,World news,New Zealand Greenpeace protesters scale parliament roof,"Four environmental protesters have breached security at New Zealand‚Äôs parliament by scaling the roof and perching themselves on a ledge above the main entrance. The Greenpeace protesters on Thursday hauled up eight solar panels and unfurled a banner to protest what they say is the government‚Äôs lack of action in promoting renewal energy and dealing with climate change. The protest began at dawn and continued throughout the morning. Police issued the four with trespass notices, but authorities say they plan to allow the protesters to come down on their own. The breach will come as an embarrassment to the parliament‚Äôs security services. David Stevenson, the general manager of Parliamentary Service, said in a statement he had ordered a full review of security procedures as a result of the breach. ‚ÄúTrespassing in or on the buildings is totally inappropriate, regardless of the motivations of those involved,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are therefore taking this incident very seriously and will be looking for any lessons we can draw from it.‚Äù
The forecourt in front of the main entrance is frequently used for sanctioned protests. Speaking from a cellphone, protester Johno Smith told the Associated Press that the four were experienced climbers and that they planned to come down on Thursday afternoon ‚Äúbefore it gets too cold.‚Äù He said he hoped the protest would inspire people to act. ‚ÄúWe need to take clean-energy action,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur society is based around fossil fuels.‚Äù About 77% of New Zealand‚Äôs electricity generation comes from renewable sources, including hydroelectric, geothermal and wind. The country‚Äôs vehicle fleet, on the other hand, primarily uses gasoline and diesel. Bunny McDiarmid, Greenpeace New Zealand‚Äôs executive director, tweeted: ‚ÄúSecurity breach at parliament security breach of the planet? You choose.‚Äù The climbers continued to publicise their protest from the roof, tweeting pictures of themselves and engaging in an ‚Äúask me anything‚Äù question-and-answer webchat on Reddit. One of the protesters, named only as Jeff, told Reddit users that police officers on the ground were a ‚Äúfriendly bunch‚Äù, adding: ‚ÄúNo signs of them comin [sic] up which is good, much safer for us. Best if we come down ourselves.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T23:56:02Z,world,World news,"Antarctic biodiversity faces increased threats despite isolation, study finds","The Antarctic and Southern oceans are teeming with life, yet protection measures are weak as the continent faces increased threats from fishing, tourism and science programs, according to a report by scientists reviewing recent studies. The lead author of the report published in the journal Nature, Professor Steven Chown of Monash University, characterised the biodiversity outlook for Antarctica and the Southern Ocean as being ‚Äúno better than that for the rest of the globe‚Äù, despite its relative isolation. The Antarctic marine system hosts more than 8,000 different species, with 50-90% of the species endemic to the region, including sea spiders, isopods and the wandering albatross. On land, there was a ‚Äúmassive diversity‚Äù of viruses living in bodies of freshwater and an ‚Äúextremely well-developed microbial community‚Äù.
‚ÄúMost people think of the continent as a vast, icy waste, and the sea as uniformly populated by whales, seals and penguins,‚Äù Chown said. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs simply not true. ‚ÄúCertainly you wouldn‚Äôt see the same level of diversity as somewhere like the Daintree rainforest in Queensland, but if I was a microbiologist I‚Äôd say the Antarctic was home to an amazing diversity of organisms.‚Äù Antarctica, roughly the size of the US and Mexico combined, was not a single, homogenous area but had 15 distinct biogeographic zones, Chown said. These included the dramatic, 4,000 metre heights of the Trans-Antarctic Mountains, home to ‚Äúreally unusual lichens and mosses‚Äù, and the geothermally heated volcanoes of the north-east Antarctic peninsula, which played an important role as refuges for wildlife from icy, glacial conditions. Increasing wind speeds, associated with the hole in the ozone layer, had also improved conditions for the wandering albatross. ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs gotten windier they‚Äôre able to travel faster, and that means their foraging trips are shorter,‚Äù Chown said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve become much heavier.‚Äù
But other forms of human interference linked to increased fishing activity, tourism and scientific programs posed a threat to biodiversity. ‚ÄúPeople have been driving ATVs [all-terrain vehicles] through moss beds, science stations have been dumping their sewage and oil spills have gone underreported,‚Äù he said. And the 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection, which states that the region should only be used for scientific and ‚Äúpeaceful purposes‚Äù, had quickly been interpreted as allowing any activity, ‚Äúas long as it‚Äôs not military or a nuclear power plant‚Äù. Only 1.5% of the land and less than 10% of the oceans around Antarctica fall under special protection. A long-running proposal to designate the Ross Sea, sometimes called ‚Äúthe last ocean‚Äù of the world because of its pristine condition, as a marine reserve has so far failed to be negotiated by the convention on the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources. Generally, good control measures had prevented the introduction of invasive alien species ‚Äì with the notable exception of annual bluegrass, which was quickly outcompeting the only two indigenous flowering plants on the continent: the Antarctic hair grass and Antarctic pearlwort.
Chown said protected areas of the Antarctic should match the global Aichi biodiversity targets of 17% of terrestrial and inland water areas and 10% of marine and coastal areas protected by 2020. Achieving this required a dedicated plan for biodiversity conservation, to be implemented by the Antarctic treaty parties. The plan would identify which areas should be protected and how they would be set aside and managed. It would also call for coordinated investigations into the drivers of biodiversity loss, including ocean acidification, extinction risk assessments and studies into genetic diversity for the region. A plan being drafted should be ready by the end of 2016, which would then be presented to all the treaty parties, Chown said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T23:46:41Z,world,World news,Qatar eyes fast track to soft power with Formula One stake,"Next month, well-heeled punters will flock to the Qatar Goodwood Festival for one of the highlights of the British horse racing calendar. Meanwhile in Paris, a once down-at-heel football club that became home to David Beckham and Zlatan Ibrahimovic is undergoing a metamorphosis into one of the top 10 sporting brands in the world. In Doha, construction work is well under way on stadiums built to host an endlessly controversial World Cup in November 2022, including the showpiece Lusail Iconic stadium that nestles in a city built from scratch on the outskirts of the Qatari capital. Now, though, the tiny gulf state could be about to add another prime target to its global trolley dash: a major stake in Formula One. A controlling stake in the sport, built over four decades by Bernie Ecclestone into a global money-spinning machine, has been the subject of rumoured interest over the years from a variety of suitors, including Rupert Murdoch. But the Guardian understands that a mooted $7bn-plus bid from Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) ‚Äì which also owns Paris St Germain (PSG) and the global sports broadcasting network beIN Sports ‚Äì and a billionaire-backed US group is the most serious yet. QSI is the sports arm of the Qatar investment fund that owns London landmarks including the Shard, Canary Wharf and the Olympic Village. Ecclestone‚Äôs 5% share in F1 would be sold alongside 35.5% owned by a venture capital firm CVC, but he would probably stay on in the short-term to run the sport. One of the most immediate motives for such a move might be to ensure that Qatar had its own F1 race in a calendar that includes events in neighbouring Abu Dhabi and nearby Bahrain. In Britain, a similar rationale has underpinned huge Qatari investment in horse racing. Sheikh Joaan Al Thani, a son of the former emir of Qatar, retains Frankie Dettori to ride his string of horses and now sponsors the festival more commonly known as Glorious Goodwood. Sheikh Fahad Al Thani, meanwhile, established Qatar Racing and Qatar Bloodstock as subsidiaries of the private investment company Qipco, in 2011. Qipco this year unveiled a ¬£50m sponsorship deal with British racing to underwrite the Champions Series, taking in the biggest flat races of the season, until 2024. As with Qatar‚Äôs other investments, from substantial stakes in Sainsbury‚Äôs and Barclays to its push into landmark London properties, the rationale is twofold. As outlined in its 2030 Vision document, the gas-rich state is attempting to prepare for a future beyond its bounteous natural resources and invest globally in industries that can provide an ongoing return. But it has also chosen some of the most eyecatching brands and properties in the world as a means of putting the country on the map, and projecting ‚Äúsoft power‚Äù in an unstable region built on constantly shifting political alliances with its neighbours and the west. While senior sources in Doha are keen to underline the differences between the investment funds and businesses that have bought into world sport on multiple levels, in a feudal monarchy with a single source of huge wealth the lines inevitably become blurred. In 2010, Qatar agreed a deal for its charitable Qatar Foundation to take over Barcelona‚Äôs sponsorship from Unicef, before a deal for Qatar Airways took effect that has since been renewed. Sport presses emotional buttons that other investments cannot reach and the strategy is far from haphazard as far as QSI is concerned. PSG were seized upon by QSI for the untapped potential of the biggest one-club city in Europe. Since then, partly through acquisitions including Beckham, Ibrahimovic, and Edinson Cavani ‚Äì plus major investment in the stadium and infrastructure ‚Äì the club has been successfully rebranded. A once down-on-its luck side has been transformed into an upmarket lifestyle choice. The beIN Sports network, formerly al-Jazeera Sport, has bought up sports rights and launched channels around the world, including the US, and would provide a ready-made outlet for F1. It is the potential prize of combining ownership of a sport with the means of distribution that has attracted interest from Murdoch and others. It is in this context of a web of complementary investments that the prospective F1 deal should be viewed. Where neighbouring countries have focused on retail or tourism, Qatar (like near neighbour Abu Dhabi, owner of Manchester City) has alighted upon sport and culture as a means of asserting its place in the world. Sport is also seen as a means of bringing together a fast changing nation that is virtually unrecognisable from a generation ago and where the indigenous population enjoys the highest per capita income in the world, but are outnumbered seven to one by migrant labourers fuelling a construction boom. Hand in hand with its global investments in sport, Qatar‚Äôs then-emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, succeeded by his son Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani in 2013, agreed to a push to bring the biggest global sporting events to the country. Bids for the 2016 and 2020 Olympics failed at the shortlisting stage. But despite the climactic challenges in a country, where summer temperatures regularly top 50 degrees, it will host the world cycling road racing championships in 2016 and the world athletics championships in 2019, following money-no-object bids. Most controversially of all, in December 2010 Qatar won the right to host the 2022 World Cup in a vote that caused shockwaves that are still reverberating. While there is now believed to be some concern at the highest levels over the scrutiny that the World Cup has brought, it has clearly not damaged Qatar‚Äôs determination to buy into world sport at the highest level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T23:01:01Z,world,World news,Pride Power list for 2015 highlights transgender Britons,"A politician, scientist, radio presenter and boxing promoter are among those honoured as the most influential transgender people in Britain in this year‚Äôs Pride Power list. The 2015 list, naming the most influential LGBT people and published to coincide with Pride weekend this week places people in categories, rather than ranking them, as before. Several of those in the transgender category had only spoken publicly about transitioning in the past year; they includethe radio presenter Stephanie Hirst and the boxing promoter Kellie Maloney. Others, including the model Jacqui Gavin, the vice-chair of the Civil Service network a:gender, and lawyer Stephen Whittle, are long-time activists for trans rights. Ayla Holdom, a decorated RAF flight lieutenant, who is Britain‚Äôs only openly transgender military pilot, has been honoured, as has Kate Stone, a scientist, who won her Press Complaints Commission fight against newspapers who featured her transgender status after a traumatic accident when she was gored by a stag. In the three years since the list began, when it was ranked, American women topped it. In 2012, the actor Jane Lynch, of the TV show Glee, was named the most powerful LGBT person in the world, followed by the talkshow host Ellen DeGeneres in 2013 and Laverne Cox, the American actor, from the drama series Orange is the New Black, in 2014, the first transgender person to do so. This year‚Äôs list, compiled by SquarePeg Media via a panel and public nominations, focuses solely on influential LGBT Britons. They have been categorised into the sections of arts, campaigners, entertainers, politics, business leaders, workplace heroes, charity and community, transgender and influencers. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt numbered the entries because we see each entry as being equally important to the LGBT+ community,‚Äù the list‚Äôs authors say in their introduction. ‚ÄúThe list serves to encompass both those fighting for equality and people who are influential role models.‚Äù Several transgender people featured are leading lights in other categories in the list. The Liberal Democrat Sarah Brown, who was the only openly transgender politician in the UK for a time, was listed in the transgender rather than politics category, but Paris Lees, a prominent trans rights activist and writer, was placed in the influencers category. The non-profit support groups Mermaids and Gender Trust, both of which deal with gender identity issues, were honoured in the charity and community section of the list.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T21:24:24Z,world,World news,Vancouver becomes first Canadian city to regulate growing marijuana market,"Vancouver has approved new rules to license and regulate illegal marijuana stores, making it the first city in Canada to attempt to control the burgeoning market ‚Äì and setting it on a collision course with the country‚Äôs federal government. After four days of public hearings, the city council approved regulations that will set zoning controls and hefty licence fees for Vancouver‚Äôs many pot shops: the city of 600,000 is thought to have more marijuana stores than its 109 Starbucks locations. Neon green cannabis leafs have sprouted in shop windows across the city, and many shops employ in-house ‚Äúnaturopaths‚Äù available for quasi-medical consultations.
The boom has come amid a haze of legal ambiguity: the supreme court has forced the Canadian government to allow access to medical marijuana for those with prescriptions, but it remains illegal to sell pot products from a retail storefront. Meanwhile, the Vancouver police department has stated that a crackdown on pot shops is not a priority for them. In an attempt to resolve the contradiction, the council launched public consultations on regulation in April. The proposal prompted a furious attack from Ottawa. Federal health minister Rona Ambrose wrote to Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson suggesting that any attempt to regulate the pot shops would mean legitimizing an illegal activity. She called on council to reject the proposal and close the stores down. Vancouver councilor Geoff Meggs said Ambrose‚Äôs comments showed that she was ‚Äúcompletely out of touch with the realities on the ground.‚Äù Addressing council before the vote, Meggs said he believes Vancouver‚Äôs approach will make a difference across the country. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs going to be a significant decision. I think it will have widespread impact.‚Äù Many Canadians ‚Äì including the federal Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau, local police departments and health authorities ‚Äì have argued that the time has come to legalize, control and tax marijuana. The sticking point remains the federal government, who are the only authority with the power to legalize pot, and who remain fervently pro-prohibition. Ambrose released a statement shortly after the Vancouver vote, restating the government‚Äôs position. ‚ÄúStorefronts selling marijuana are illegal, and under this Conservative Government will remain illegal,‚Äù the statement said. As Canada gears up for the October federal election, she also took time to take a political pot shot at Trudeau. ‚ÄúThese stores have absolutely no regard for the rule of law and have been caught selling marijuana to kids ‚Äì they represent Justin Trudeau‚Äôs vision for Canadian neighbourhoods from coast to coast to coast,‚Äù Ambrose wrote. Former British Columbia attorney-general Geoff Plant QC expressed support for regulation: ‚ÄúThe federal government is increasingly out of touch. They are stuck in a ‚Äòreefer madness‚Äô, non-evidence-based position.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe government of Canada has ‚Äì with its failure to grasp the reality of marijuana and grapple with it ‚Äì actually made things worse,‚Äù he argues. ‚ÄúThey have allowed a black market to flourish, and now a white market has taken hold, and the longer it goes on, the harder it is to bring it back to a clean slate and introduce proper policy.‚Äù In an attempt to sidestep a potential legal challenge from Ottawa, Vancouver has been careful to say they are simply regulating the businesses involved, not the products they are selling. Under the new rules, dispensaries will be banned from operating within 300 metres of a school, community centre, or rival pot shop. They will also be obliged to pay a business license fee of $30,000, compared to a regular business license of just $250. Over the period of public consultation, more than 200 people put their views forward in person or by email to council. City manager Penny Ballem said that the most striking submissions came from people working so-called ‚Äúcompassion clubs‚Äù, where medical marijuana is provided for sufferers of cancer and other illnesses. Following those presentations, the proposed business license fee for that model was dropped to $1000. ‚ÄúIt was very compelling to hear how they provide access at an affordable rate to the most severely disabled and in need,‚Äù Ballem, a physician by training, notes. ‚ÄúThey are a different category to those simply retailing marijuana.‚Äù Ballem said she believes interest in the marijuana market has boomed as a reaction to the legalization of pot in nearby Washington and Oregon states. ‚ÄúThey see a change in Canada as imminent, and they want to get in on it and get ahead of the game.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T21:00:10Z,world,World news,Nato to review nuclear weapon policy as attitude to Russia hardens,"Nato, in an echo of the cold war, is preparing to re-evaluate its nuclear weapons strategy in response to growing tension with Russia over Ukraine, sources at the organisation have said. Updating Nato‚Äôs nuclear policy would amount to an escalation in tit-for-tat exchanges with Russia since the Ukraine crisis erupted last year. Expressing concern over President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs announcement last week that Russia was to buy 40 new intercontinental ballistic missiles, Nato officials also said there was alarm over Russian rhetoric on nuclear weapons and the extent to which such weapons are involved in military exercises. A Nato diplomat said: ‚ÄúThere is very real concern about the way in which Russia publicly bandies around nuclear stuff. So there are quite a lot of deliberations in the alliance about nuclear [weapons], but it is being done very slowly and deliberately. We need to do due diligence on where we are.‚Äù The issue is being discussed on the margins of a two-day Nato ministerial meeting that began in Brussels on Wednesday. But the US is keen to get the issue on the table and a meeting of Nato‚Äôs ministerial nuclear planning group is likely to be held later this year ‚Äì earlier than planned ‚Äì to discuss refreshing the nuclear doctrine.
Among potential topics is an enhanced role for nuclear weapons in Nato military exercises. Also up for discussion would be how to better interpret Russian warnings about nuclear weapons: whether they should be taken seriously or whether these amount to no more than rhetoric. Speaking on the sidelines of the summit, British defence secretary Michael Fallon said Russia‚Äôs ‚Äúnuclear messaging is not helpful‚Äù. He added: ‚ÄúIt is important we understand its implications for the alliance‚Äù. Since the peak of the cold war, the US and Russia have slashed their nuclear arsenals but Russia still has an estimated 1,582 strategic warheads deployed on 515 missiles and bombers, while the US has 1,597 deployed on 785. There is no suggestion at Nato headquarters of a return to the days of nuclear arms races and the doctrine of mutually assured destruction, and the US has specifically ruled out returning cruise missiles to Europe. But Nato officials, military and diplomats are raising worries that the US-led alliance‚Äôs existing nuclear posture reflects the thinking of a decade ago when Russia was viewed as a potential partner. That strategy badly needed to be refreshed, they suggested. Although Nato nuclear exercises are classified, the organisation does, like Russia, conduct them. The concern at Nato is that the role of nuclear weapons in such exercises needs to be upgraded to take account of the changed relationship with Moscow. Nato‚Äôs secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, said the nuclear issue was serious and had to be treated with caution. ‚ÄúThe nuclear activities, the investments of Russia in new nuclear capabilities, and the exercise activities by Russia in the nuclear domain is part of the global picture where we see a more assertive Russia.‚Äù The American ambassador to Nato, Douglas Lute, briefing journalists in Brussels on Tuesday, said: ‚ÄúThere is a general assessment under way in Washington and a parallel assessment here in Nato to look at all the possible implications of what Russia says about nuclear weapons, its doctrine and so forth, its pronouncements, its rhetoric, and what we actually see on the ground in terms of development and deployment.‚Äù Nato, he added, had not yet reached any conclusions or decided on ‚Äúwhat are the actions that are implied in our response‚Äù.
Putin last week announced plans to purchase 40 intercontinental ballistic missiles and complained of US acts in eastern Europe as amounting to the most aggressive since the cold war. Russia argues that the expansion of Nato into eastern Europe and its courting of Ukraine has been a repeated provocation. A Nato official said: ‚ÄúDeterrence, based on an appropriate mix of nuclear, conventional and missile defence capabilities is a core element of our overall strategy. We cannot go into detail on our nuclear discussions. These are internal, sensitive and classified matters. What I can say is that Nato continuously assess all aspects of Russia‚Äôs military activities, including Russia‚Äôs nuclear rhetoric.‚Äù A second Nato official said: ‚ÄúThe Russian leadership is rhetorically lowering the threshold when it comes to nuclear weapons and this is something which should not be done. It largely wasn‚Äôt done even during the cold war. ‚ÄúThis kind of nuclear threat was something which we found quite surprising, quite negative and is something we believe should be avoided but we are closely examining it carefully as part of the overall examination of Russia‚Äôs activities in Europe and how we at least in Nato must unfortunately react.‚Äù Fallon announced on Wednesday evening that the UK is to double its spending on training Ukrainian troops from ¬£3m to ¬£6m.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T19:50:12Z,world,World news,Greece debt crisis talks end in renewed deadlock,"Gruelling negotiations between Greece and its creditors broke up without agreement as lenders warned the country that it must accept more austerity if it is to avoid defaulting on its debts. A third meeting of eurozone finance ministers in less than a week was called to a halt on Wednesday evening amid fresh deadlock over an agreement on greater spending cuts in Athens in exchange for rescue funds. The finance ministers will reassemble on Thursday in a bid to achieve an elusive breakthrough, as Greece strives to meet next Tuesday‚Äôs deadline for a ‚Ç¨1.6bn (¬£1.1bn) payment to the International Monetary Fund. A deal could not be reached at the finance minister‚Äôs gathering despite six hours of talks earlier in the day between Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, and the heads of the IMF, European Central Bank and European commission. Tsipras met the creditors again on Wednesday night. The meeting ended in the early hours of Thursday with Greece ‚Äúremaining firm on its position‚Äù according to a Greek government official.
Tsipras got a dressing down at the creditors‚Äô meeting on Wednesday morning, despite having presented new budget proposals on Monday that were generally welcomed as constructive. However, by the time he met the creditors on Wednesday he was being asked to toughen his plans. Tsipras sounded bitter and wounded after the creditors, led by Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund, raised a host of problems with the 11-page policy document he had tabled. A revised version of the Greek proposals, littered with corrections entered in red type by the creditors, was soon leaked to the media. ‚ÄúThe repeated rejection of equivalent measures by certain institutions never occurred before, neither in [bailout countries] Ireland nor Portugal,‚Äù said Tsipras. ‚ÄúThis odd stance seems to indicate that either there is no interest in an agreement or that special interests are being backed.‚Äù Both sides are in a race to cut a deal before five years of bailouts worth ‚Ç¨240bn (¬£171bn) lapse next Tuesday, the same day that Greece must repay the IMF. The Tuesday deadline is doubly pressing because the ECB, which is keeping the Greek banking system on life support, has indicated that it will not support banks if the bailout programme expires without a new agreement in place. Without the ECB‚Äôs support Greek banks are expected to buckle, which would force the Tsipras government to impose capital controls and threaten the country‚Äôs exit from the eurozone.
Earlier in the week the Europeans had been unanimous in describing Tsipras‚Äôs offer on Monday as the first serious proposal he has delivered since he was elected in January. Senior sources in Brussels had intimated that a lifeline deal was in the offing, which would involve extending Greece‚Äôs bailout by six months, doling out ‚Ç¨18bn to see it through this year and working on a follow-up package likely to include a form of debt restructuring ‚Äì Athens‚Äôs central demand. But by Wednesday the optimism was fading fast, as the IMF started picking holes in the Greek figures while also concluding that stopgap measures such as VAT hikes and increased pension contributions would not shift the Greek economy into recovery mode, and could worsen a debt burden that the IMF already views as unsustainable. Athens has proposed raising more money from VAT, making more changes to the pension system, ending early retirement and raising corporate taxes. Tsipras‚Äôs proposals would have delivered almost ‚Ç¨8bn in reduced government spending. According to Greek state television on Wednesday, the heavily revised IMF version raised that figure to ‚Ç¨11bn. Most economists have already dismissed the deal being discussed as ruinous and reckless. But all the signs were that the negotiations could go almost right down to next Tuesday‚Äôs deadline. Senior German officials warned that the talks could last beyond the full two-day summit of leaders on Thursday and Friday. The leaders instructed Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, to work non-stop if necessary in order to secure a deal that could be presented to eurozone leaders. ‚Äú[The leaders‚Äô] expectation is not to negotiate. Their expectation is to welcome an agreement in the eurogroup,‚Äù said a senior EU source. The IMF has told Tsipras and his team that the Greek plan is too reliant on tax increases, which have failed to deliver anticipated revenue streams in the past. The fund has also criticised what it sees as only half-hearted measures to reform the Greek economy by tearing down hundreds of regulatory barriers.
Greece‚Äôs creditors are also demanding faster and more sweeping reforms to the Greek pension system. Tsipras, who has vowed not to cut wages and pensions, is now under pressure to bring forward plans to raise the statutory retirement age to 67 and scale back pensioner benefits further. Pensions is one of the most fraught areas for the Greek negotiators, who are already under fire for offering more limited concessions. Tsipras told his cabinet that a rejection of the Greek plan would be unprecedented. Investors‚Äô spirits sank as Tsipras‚Äôs criticism of Greece‚Äôs creditors leaked out, prompting a fall in eurozone stock markets. Greek stocks slipped 1.8% on Wednesday, while shares in Greek banks fell by up to 10%. Austria‚Äôs finance minister, Hans J√∂rg Schelling, said a cut-and-dried solution must be found by Sunday. ‚ÄúIf there is no real solution by Sunday this week, it is not foreseeable what the next step will be,‚Äù he told Austrian radio. Antonis Samaras ‚Äì Tsipras‚Äôs centre-right predecessor ‚Äì also arrived in Brussels where he was expected to see Juncker, inevitably feeding conspiracy theories and speculation about EU interference in Greek politics. Samaras, who in his seven months in office before his defeat by Tsipras also refused to countenance many of the policies being urged on Tsipras by the troika of creditors, said Greece was being forced to choose ‚Äúbetween catastrophe and a very bad solution‚Äù. Even if a deal is finally struck in Brussels, Tsipras has to get his promises through a rebellious and recalcitrant parliament, and then the German and other eurozone parliaments also have to legitimise the package before it can be implemented, raising questions as to whether all this can be accomplished before the Tuesday deadline.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T19:13:02Z,world,World news,Greek debt crisis brings discord within Syriza as Tsipras hopes for leap of faith,"The internal faultlines in Greece‚Äôs governing Syriza party grew wider on Wednesday as its members digested the sheer scale of concessions being demanded to avert a bankruptcy and remain in the eurozone. With the battle lines now firmly drawn between Athens and its creditors, senior Syriza figures took rhetorical potshots at the tactics employed by the debt-stricken country‚Äôs lenders as prime minister Alexis Tsipras attended back-to-back talks in Brussels. ‚ÄúThe European Union‚Äôs neoliberal elite has lost touch with reality,‚Äù said the interior minister, Nikos Voutsis. ‚ÄúEvery day they argue among themselves or bring issues that supposedly had been solved, or put to one side, on the table. It is an unacceptable situation that has to stop.‚Äù Voutsis was speaking in the Greek parliament as Syriza‚Äôs secretariat met in an urgent session to discuss the reforms Tsipras has proposed to reach a deal with lenders. An agreement would unlock the bailout funds desperately needed to avoid default: Athens must pay ‚Ç¨1.6bn (¬£1.1bn) to the IMF next Tuesday.
The mood at the party‚Äôs headquarters was anything but upbeat. While Alekos Flambouraris, the minister of state and a close Tsipras ally, spoke of the need to endorse an agreement that was both necessary and honourable, insiders said it was now clear the anti-austerity movement was fighting an existential battle. The government‚Äôs proposed measures ‚Äì a combination of tax increases and budget cuts outlining ‚Ç¨8bn in savings over the next 17 months ‚Äì is so at odds with party ideas it would require a near-impossible leap of faith to get them passed. ‚ÄúAnd any agreement that is reached will have to be endorsed by Syriza‚Äôs internal organs,‚Äù the party‚Äôs secretary, Tassos Koronakis, was quoted as saying. ‚ÄúThe government is fighting a very tough battle against unbelievable tactics of blackmail and unprecedented credit strangulation.‚Äù In Brussels on Wednesday night, Greek officials described creditors‚Äô latest demands ‚Äì for more pension cuts and VAT hikes ‚Äì as ‚Äúnothing short of barbaric‚Äù. Even if lenders accept a compromise, it is clear that Tsipras will have a battle on his hands to get the deal ratified by his national parliament, as both the EU and IMF have demanded. At least 10 MPs have indicated that they will oppose a deal if it is based on the 47-page package of proposals the government has made. At least 10 more are wavering, and it remains unclear what hardliners, gathered under the Left Platform faction led by the energy minister, Panagiotis Lafazanis, will also do. The former communist, in effect the third most powerful man in Greece‚Äôs government, has remained uncharacteristically coy about the stance he will take, saying he will only decide once a deal is reached. Zoe Konstantopoulou, the 300-seat parliament‚Äôs president, who also holds sway over the party, has similarly refused to divulge which way she will go.
In the outcry over the measures, those within Syriza who openly advocate a return to the drachma have been emboldened, with several holding neighbourhood meetings to denounce the government‚Äôs retreat across its own ‚Äúred lines‚Äù on pensions and VAT. ‚ÄúThe only way to keep Syriza united is to avoid capitulation,‚Äù said Stathis Kouvelakis, a member of Syriza‚Äôs central committee. Echoing the complaints of a growing number of factions, Kouvelakis, who teaches political theory at King‚Äôs College London, said it was clear that creditors wanted to ‚Äúbreak the party politically‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhat we are seeing is a pseudo-negotiation, a relentless effort to always impose more and more concessions,‚Äù he said, speaking from London. ‚ÄúThey are never satisfied: they want everything and they want it now because they want to destroy Syriza.‚Äù If Tsipras were to go ahead with the policies, Europe‚Äôs first radical left government would pay a heavy price, Kouvelakis believes. ‚ÄúIt will be the end of breaking with austerity politics and exploring alternatives ‚Äì the whole experiment will come to an end.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T18:29:04Z,world,World news,Obama calls Hollande to promise NSA is no longer spying on French president,"Barack Obama has assured the French president, Fran√ßois Hollande, that American intelligence services are no longer tapping his phone. During a brief telephone call, the American leader was reported to have reiterated a pledge made two years ago to stop spying on his French counterpart, according to Hollande‚Äôs office. But a vaguely worded statement released shortly afterwards by the White House failed to clarify whether the National Security Agency was still bugging the conversations and emails of other French diplomats and officials. The statement said Obama had ‚Äúaffirmed our unwavering commitment to the bilateral relationship including our ongoing close cooperation in the intelligence and security fields. The president reiterated that we have abided by the commitment we made to our French counterparts in late 2013 that we are not targeting and will not target the communications of the French president.‚Äù It added that it was ‚Äúcommitted to our productive and indispensable intelligence relationship with France, which allows us to make progress against shared threats, including international terrorism and proliferation, among others‚Äù ‚Äì but left open the question of whether the US continued to spy on others in France. Earlier on Wednesday, the US ambassador to France, Jane Hartley, was summoned to the French foreign ministry in Paris to face an expected dressing-down from the foreign minister, Laurent Fabius.
The meeting came after Hollande called an emergency defence council meeting and described revelations that the US spied on three successive French presidents as unacceptable. He said Paris would not tolerate actions that threaten its security. WikiLeaks documents published late on Tuesday showed that the US had bugged French leaders‚Äô telephones. Hollande‚Äôs office said the French president had phoned Obama on Wednesday afternoon. ‚ÄúThe exchange was a change to emphasise the principles that must govern relations between allies in matters of intelligence,‚Äù the Elys√©e said. ‚ÄúPresident Obama clearly reiterated the firm pledge he made in November 2013, after the Snowden affair, and which was repeated during the state visit [by Hollande] in February 2014, to end practices that might have operated in the past but which are unacceptable between allies.‚Äù A government spokesman, St√©phane le Foll, announced that a senior French intelligence official is to visit the US in the coming days for further discussions with American counterparts. ‚ÄúWe find it hard to understand or imagine what motivates an ally to spy on allies who are often on the same strategic positions in world affairs,‚Äù Le Foll added. The revelations were first reported in French daily Lib√©ration and on news website Mediapart, which said the NSA spied on Hollande and his prececessors Nicolas Sarkozy and Jacques Chirac for 10 years up until 2012. Hollande held a second crisis meeting with parliamentary groups at his √âlys√©e Palace offices on Wednesday afternoon. Afterwards, the prime minister, Manuel Valls, told MPs that the ‚Äúsystematic and continued‚Äù spying on foreign leaders by the US was ‚Äúunacceptable and abnormal‚Äù. Valls said he could reassure MPs that France did not eavesdrop on the leaders of European and allied countries.
‚ÄúOur country is loyal and knows the historical debt it owes America, but this gratitude cannot prevent us from protecting our country and citizens,‚Äù he said. The leaked US documents, marked top secret, were based on phone taps and filed in an NSA document labelled ‚ÄúEspionnage √âlys√©e‚Äù (√âlys√©e spying), according to Lib√©ration and Mediapart. The recorded conversations were said to reveal few state secrets but show clear evidence of the extent of American spying on countries considered allies. WikiLeaks documents suggest that other US spy targets included French cabinet ministers and the French ambassador to the US. ‚ÄúThe documents contain the ‚Äòselectors‚Äô from the target list, detailing the cellphone numbers of numerous officials in the √âlys√©e up to and including the direct cellphone of the president,‚Äù a report of the taps published in the French media revealed. In an article co-authored by Julian Assange, the French newspaper Lib√©ration pointed out that in matters of spying, there are no friends. It said: ‚ÄúSpying abroad is the ultimate ‚Äògrey zone‚Äô in surveillance ‚Äì it is also, in France, the real blind spot of the planned law on surveillance, expected to be adopted this Wednesday.‚Äù Mediapart said: ‚ÄúFor almost 10 years, the United States has listened in to French presidents ‚Ä¶ it was all classed top secret or ‚Äòspecial intelligence‚Äô.‚Äù US media cited a statement from the NSA saying it was not targeting and would not target Hollande‚Äôs communications. The statement did not deny spying had taken place in the past. Le Point magazine pointed out that France spends about ‚Ç¨1bn (¬£700m) a year on its intelligence services, compared with the ‚Ç¨60bn the US spends. It said this illustrated a ‚Äúdifference of means, but not of methods‚Äù and said the WikiLeaks revelations were nothing new. ‚ÄúThe secret and intelligence services have always had the role of discovering and sending to political leaders, diplomats and military personnel information allowing them to make their decisions,‚Äù it wrote. ‚ÄúThe brutal fact is, being allies over one thing doesn‚Äôt mean we share everything or hold back on spying on our little friend.‚Äù Bernard Debr√©, a member of Sarkozy‚Äôs opposition Republican party, went further, writing on his blog: ‚ÄúPoliticians are astonished to have been spied on by the Americans! It‚Äôs a bloody hypocrisy. For years everyone has been listened in on by the NSA, the NSA has been accused by senators and governors and has drastically reduced its activity ‚Ä¶ and at the same time, France is going in the opposite direction.‚Äù Arnaud Danjean, a former member of France‚Äôs intelligence service, the DGSE, and now an MEP for the Republican party, said there was nothing new in the revelations. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all very emotional, but on a technical and geopolitical level there‚Äôs nothing new in reporting that spies are spying. Being an ally doesn‚Äôt mean that you tell each other everything,‚Äù Danjean told France Info. ‚ÄúWhen one is a diplomat, one knows one is a target. When you‚Äôre someone in the public sphere, you start from the principle that foreign countries are interested in you, you take defensive measures as a result. Wikileaks said it planned to publish more details of the US‚Äôs espionage activities against France soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T18:11:27Z,world,World news,Having a working mother works for daughters,"Negative perceptions around women who combine paid work with parenthood have been comprehensively demolished in a major study by Harvard University, which shows the daughters of working mothers enjoy better careers, higher pay and more equal relationships than those raised by stay-at-home mothers. Using data from 24 countries including the UK and US, the Harvard study says that while working mothers ‚Äúoften internalise social messages of impending doom for their children‚Äù, the reality is that their sons and daughters appear to thrive, with daughters benefiting most from the positive role model of a mother with a career. Harvard Business School professor Kathleen McGinn, lead author of the study, noted that the effect on daughters‚Äô careers of mothers working was particularly marked in the UK and US, where public attitudes to career equality could be more of a barrier than in some European countries such as Finland and Denmark. ‚ÄúWe hope the findings from our research will promote respect for the spectrum of choices women and men make at home and at work,‚Äù the researchers concluded. ‚ÄúWhether moms or dads stay at home or are employed, part-time or full-time, children benefit from exposure to role models offering a wide set of alternatives for leading rich and rewarding lives.‚Äù
The authors said that the research should reinforce calls for policies designed to help working parents. ‚ÄúOur findings suggest that policy should focus on supporting mothers who work ‚Äì part-time or full-time. Providing quality and reasonably priced childcare is an important factor but policy makers should also address workplace policies.‚Äù The researchers found that, on average, the daughters of working mothers were paid around 4% more than their peers, even adjusting for their greater levels of education and prevailing social attitudes, and were much more likely to have been promoted into managerial positions. One in three daughters of working mothers were in managerial posts, compared with only one in four of those with non-working mothers. ‚ÄúThese findings suggest that in addition to transmitting gender attitudes across generations, mothers‚Äô employment teaches daughters a set of skills that enable greater participation in the workforce and in leadership positions,‚Äù the study argues. Rebecca Allen, a working mother of two children and herself the daughter of a mother who worked, said the research suggested today‚Äôs women had benefited from their mothers‚Äô struggles against discrimination and prevailing social attitudes. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not overt discrimination against women and working mothers in the way that there had been in the previous generation,‚Äù said Allen, a senior academic at UCL‚Äôs Institute of Education and the director of an education data research thinktank. ‚ÄúIn some ways [the study‚Äôs findings are] a comfort to women who do go out to work ‚Äì and a signal to women who don‚Äôt that they have to think hard about how the role they have within the household is going to impact their children‚Äôs perceptions of what it means to be a woman and to be a mother,‚Äù she said. While earlier research has also shown no negative consequences for the children of working mothers, the new study reveals that the children of working mothers have more liberal attitudes towards women in the workplace, and that sons of working mothers take a greater share of parenting and other household care roles. ‚ÄúOur analyses find that sons raised by an employed mother are more involved at home as adults, spending more time caring for family members than men whose mothers stayed home full-time,‚Äù the study reported. ‚ÄúDaughters raised by an employed mother spend less time on housework than women whose mothers stayed home full-time, but maternal employment has no effect on adult daughters‚Äô involvement in caring for family members.‚Äù Belinda Phipps, chair of the Fawcett Society for women‚Äôs equality, said: ‚ÄúAlthough we have known for a long time that there are lots of benefits to children to have working mothers, it is great to see more research confirming this.‚Äù But Phipps said it was disappointing to see that progress on sharing domestic housework other than childcare was proving slow to change. ‚ÄúWomen are still ‚Äòdoing it all, not having it all‚Äô and we must shift cultural attitudes to achieve full gender equality,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhat is clear is that making the workplace more family-friendly, improving the availability and quality of part-time and flexible working, and investing in childcare are vital to helping individuals achieve a full work-life balance,‚Äù she said. Allen said that schools also need to adjust their demands on parents. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to stop primary schools from having a day every week where parents are expected to dress up their children in some complicated outfit, or make something, or bring something in, or turn up to help with something or have an assembly,‚Äù she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T17:52:52Z,world,World news,Calais migrants: 'We have to keep trying because this is no place to stay',"Sitting on a piece of scrubland at the edge of Calais‚Äôs ‚ÄúNew Jungle‚Äù, Teddy, from Eritrea, watched as groups of young men tried to outwit French police guarding the motorway above the makeshift camp. ‚ÄúI am too tired to try now,‚Äù the 20-year-old said quietly. ‚ÄúI got on three lorries last night but was dragged off each time by the police. It is over for me today.‚Äù But Teddy, who says he was forced to leave his homeland after his father was killed by the Eritrean regime two years ago, smiled as he revealed he had had some good news today. ‚ÄúMy friend with me last night just called and he is in the UK.‚Äù He held up his battered mobile phone. ‚ÄúHe held on to the underneath of a lorry. It was very dangerous, but he has called and he is there now and safe.‚Äù Teddy and his friend were among hundreds of migrants, many of whom have fled war and persecution in the Middle East and east Africa, who tried to take advantage of 24 hours of chaos in Calais caused by striking ferry workers. Tuesday‚Äôs industrial action closed both the ferry port and the Channel tunnel, causing miles of gridlocked traffic on the motorways around the French port. For many of the growing number of people living in desperate conditions in the camp, the queues of stationary lorries heading to the UK were an opportunity too good to miss. Riswan, who was washing his clothes in a bucket at one of the camp‚Äôs two water points, said he injured his hand on Tuesday night as he tried to get on the lorries queueing on the motorway. ‚ÄúThe police were fighting too much. I have crossed borders in Greece, Holland, Belgium, but there they talk, here they fight.‚Äù
He said many people were hurt as hundreds of migrants clashed with the police trying to stop them getting on to the lorries. ‚ÄúSo many people, girls with babies ‚Ä¶ One boy was badly injured in his chest when a wheel went over him ‚Ä¶ there was lots of blood.‚Äù An Afghan man held out an injured hand and said a police dog had bitten him as he tried to get on a lorry on Tuesday night. ‚ÄúAre there any doctors?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúMany people have been hurt but what else to do? We have to keep trying because this is no place to stay.‚Äù The situation has drawn condemnation from politicians on both sides of the Channel. The mayor of Calais, Natacha Bouchart, told French radio that Britain had ‚Äúnot offered a penny‚Äù to help, and urged it to do more to ease the pressure caused by the increasing numbers of people arriving in the camp each week.
In the UK, David Cameron called for an end to the finger-pointing over which government was to blame and described the scenes in Calais as ‚Äútotally unacceptable‚Äù. He said: ‚ÄúThere is no point in either side trying to point the finger of blame at each other. This is a strong partnership that we have in place and we should keep it that way.‚Äù Cameron said more resources would be available to assist the French in the months ahead. The home secretary, Theresa May, said British and French authorities had prevented ‚Äúsignificant numbers‚Äù of migrants in Calais from getting on to lorries and entering the UK in the last two days, and the government had put in place ‚Äútried and tested‚Äù contingency plans.
But on Wednesday morning as scores of migrants openly made their way between queueing lorries forcing doors and cutting cables, it appeared the authorities were not in control. Many told the Guardian they wanted to get to the UK because they thought they would be safe and that they would be treated more fairly there than in France. One group of men and boys ‚Äì some as young as 15 ‚Äì were chased away by a driver as they tried to break into his lorry in a queue for the Channel tunnel. ‚ÄúThis is terrible, worse than it‚Äôs ever been,‚Äù said the driver, from Poland, as the queue inched forward. ‚ÄúIt has been like this all night, it has been very difficult.‚Äù
Another migrant managed to break the cord on the back of a nearby lorry and was trying to clamber on board before he was confronted by the French driver. At the New Jungle there were ongoing skirmishes between the police and migrants throughout the day. Each time a queue of lorries formed on the motorway above the camp, people abandoned what they were doing ‚Äì washing, sleeping, eating ‚Äì and scrambled up the bank to try to get past the police. At one point officers drew their batons and hit out a group of men before spraying them with pepper spray. Watching the men back away clutching their eyes, Teddy was unmoved. He said he had left Eritrea with his girlfriend two years ago, and survived being trafficked across the Sahara and a ‚Äúterrible year‚Äù in a Libyan prison. ‚ÄúMy girlfriend is still there I think,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is not good but compared to what I have seen it is OK. I will keep trying.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T17:39:53Z,world,World news,Vatican hires tattoo remover ‚Äì to clean its sculptures,"When a senior Vatican official made a call to a tattoo removal specialist, it was not a red-faced cardinal hoping to erase an anchor on his biceps. The Vatican Museum had requested the use of tattoo removal equipment for the delicate removal of dirt particles covering some of its most priceless works. Reached through one of its Italian associates, Lyntons Lasers, the Cheshire company that supplied the tatto removers, later donated one of its machines to the museum. Mediaeval sculptures would seem to have little in common with awkward tattoos honouring past lovers, but the process to clean the former and remove the latter can be virtually identical, the company‚Äôs chairman, Andy Charlton, said. The tattoo removal machine uses minuscule pulses of near-infrared laser radiation to remove unwanted particles, breaking up encrustations of pollution, or tattoo ink on skin. Charlton, whose machines have already been used by numerous art galleries and museums, said the lasers allowed an extremely gentle method of cleaning and removing dirt from very fragile surfaces. ‚ÄúEven from a badly weathered marble surface desperately in need of consolidation,‚Äù he added. The lasers were mostly used to strip dirt from ancient sculptures rather than paintings, Charlton said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs 95% of what they can be used for. With artwork or frescoes it can be done but it‚Äôs more difficult when you‚Äôre dealing with pigment. The light heats up the dirt and blasts it off, but you want it to be self-limiting, so it doesn‚Äôt also heat up the paint underneath. It‚Äôs similar with a tattoo, apart from the ink is in the skin ‚Äì you want to blast that away without damaging the skin.‚Äù Cardinal Giuseppe Bertello, one of Pope Francis‚Äô inner circle of advisers, hosted a private ceremony in the museum‚Äôs Pinacoteca gallery in appreciation of the donated equipment, and guides took the company‚Äôs executives on private viewings of artworks and on a tour of the pope‚Äôs Castel Gondolfo farm, where vegetables and milk are produced for the pontiff‚Äôs table. Catholics may be more at ease with using equipment linked with tattooing than some other branches of the Abrahamic faiths. Judaism interprets Leviticus 19:28 as expressly forbidding tattoos, and Sunni Islam is also against the practice. But tattooing has never been expressly condemned by any Catholic thinker, according to the Catholic Herald, and can be seen, in that faith, as ‚Äúa matter of taste, not morals‚Äù. In June 2013 Pope Francis was photographed blessing heavily tattooed motorcyclists who were on a pilgrimage to St Peter‚Äôs Square, Rome, for Harley-Davidson‚Äôs 110th anniversary. This article was amended on 25 June 2015. An earlier version referred to ‚Äúbicep‚Äù where ‚Äúbiceps‚Äù was meant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T16:23:50Z,world,World news,Racism is alive in the US north too ‚Äì just without southern accents and flags,"In the summer of 2008, I crossed the Mason Dixon line ‚Äì as many other black people had done decades before me during the Great Migration ‚Äì and moved to Chicago after graduating from high school. For the first few weeks, I was euphoric. I felt like I could breathe and move in ways that had been unavailable to me in my Tennessee hometown ‚Äì a place where I was made to think about my skin tone on a daily basis. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen a Confederate flag in weeks,‚Äù I told my mother on the phone a few weeks in. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realize how used I had become to seeing them down there.‚Äù She felt pleased for me, because the weight of racism I‚Äôd faced back home seemed to already be lighter. That quickly changed after 23 August ‚Äì when Barack Obama was named the Democratic nominee for president. ‚ÄúYou Obama-nigger monkey!‚Äù a man wearing a Chicago Cubs jersey yelled at me. A few weeks after that, I heard another racial pejorative while out at a bar and another shortly after that. The idea of a black president seemed to shed many northerners of their progressive decorum. The north wasn‚Äôt the utopia I had imagined. It was instead strikingly similar in regards to racism ‚Äì just without the accents and the flags.
‚ÄúWe must caution against depicting this nation‚Äôs racist past and present as solely a localized southern phenomenon,‚Äù Jessica Barron, a sociologist at Duke University, told the Guardian. Barron, who is largely interested in segregation, racism and spatial demography, says there is no doubt that the south has a brutal history of violence towards black people ‚Äì but that we can‚Äôt just focus that history there. Brutality didn‚Äôt only begin there, nor is it currently isolated there. A striking example of the ever-present violence black Americans face are the reports that police violence leads to the death of a black man once every 28 hours in cities all across the US. ‚ÄúWe as a nation do not like to talk about slavery in the north, our 12 presidents who owned slaves, or our legal system that continues to legitimate racial disparities,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIn the American imaginary, the south is a backwards place, consumed by its bigoted ways.‚Äù According to Barron, we need to understand that racism isn‚Äôt only slavery or Jim Crow laws, but it‚Äôs more systemic than these instances. And we need to understand that the entire foundation of the US is built on a racial hierarchy that has always said that white is better than black ‚Äì not just in the south. Once we understand this, we can then begin to do the work to stop racism as a whole without trying to lay blame to an area of the country, which she thinks is just a form of complicity. However, in light of the recent mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, it‚Äôs fair to not be able to shake the idea that the south is more violent in its racism. A larger number of hate groups are also active there.
‚ÄúThe density of hate groups in the south has typically been thicker than other parts of the country,‚Äù Heidi Beirich, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) told the Guardian. ‚Äú[But] it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs just a ‚Äòsouth thing‚Äô ‚Äì there are a lot of hate groups on the coasts as well.‚Äù The SPLC is the leading organization in the US that represents victims of hate crimes. The organization also tracks all hate groups through their Hate Map, which noted 784 active groups in 2014. According to Beirich, when it comes to the most violent hate in America, there is no southern or northern divide ‚Äì rather it‚Äôs a national problem that is typically being led by what she calls ‚Äúlone wolves‚Äù. ‚ÄúFor the most part, nowadays the violent acts that have taken place ‚Äì including the shooting that took place in Charleston ‚Äì are mostly locals. Sometimes they‚Äôve been involved in hate groups, sometimes they haven‚Äôt. [But] they mostly are people getting radicalized on the internet and choosing to do this stuff on their own.‚Äù Beirich says such crimes are the result of people digging deep and being influenced by forums and websites such as StormFront.org, which has over 300,000 registered white nationalists. In other words, the internet is now the problem. While she acknowledged that people on sites like StormFront.org should have their first amendment rights supported, she also feels that it‚Äôs the responsibility of businesses to not make money off messages that could influence others like Dylan Roof, for ‚Äúhate propaganda leads to hate violence‚Äù. Roof exemplified this in his online manifesto, where he wrote: ‚ÄúWe have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the Internet. Well someone has to have bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me.‚Äù In his interview with Marc Maron, Obama said: Racism, we are not cured of it. And it‚Äôs not just a matter of it not being polite to say ‚Äònigger‚Äô in public ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not just a matter of overt discrimination. Societies don‚Äôt overnight completely erase everything that happened 200-300 years prior. As the US hopefully begins to work to realize what the president points to, and Confederate flags begin to come down in Columbia, South Carolina, and maybe Mississippi, many of us will all begin to realize, like I did in 2008, that no matter where you live in the US, racism remains ‚Äì even if the flags come down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T16:17:02Z,world,World news,French police clash with migrants as ferry strike causes chaos in Calais,"Migrants and police were engaged in an uneasy standoff on the motorways around Calais on Wednesday, as groups of young men tried to exploit the continuing disruption to climb on trucks bound for the UK. Several hundred lorries were still queueing on the main roads leading to the ferry port and Eurotunnel, following Tuesday‚Äôs strike by French ferry workers. On the motorway above the main migrant camp ‚Äì home to 3,000 people ‚Äì there were regular skirmishes in the afternoon. Each time a queue of lorries formed, the migrants ‚Äì many of whom have fled war and persecution in the Middle East and east Africa ‚Äì abandoned what they were doing and ran up the bank to try and break into them.
French police tried to stop them and at one point officers drew their batons and hit out at a group of young men before using pepper spray on them. Watching from the edge of the camp, Teddy, 20, from Eritrea said it had been a very difficult 24 hours. ‚ÄúLots and lots of people have been trying because of the lorry queues and some of them have made it, but it is very dangerous. The police have been very aggressive and many people have been injured trying to jump on the underside of lorries.‚Äù An Afghan man nearby held out his injured hand and said a police dog bit him last night. ‚ÄúAre there any doctors?‚Äù he asked. ‚Äú Many people have been hurt but what else to do? We have to keep trying because this is no place to stay.‚Äù
In the UK, the home secretary, Theresa May, said British and French authorities had stopped ‚Äúsignificant numbers‚Äù of migrants climbing aboard lorries in Calais and entering the UK in the last two days. She said the UK border force had put in place ‚Äútried and tested‚Äù contingency plans to deal with chaotic scenes that led to the Channel tunnel being closed. David Cameron moved to ease tensions with France over the migrant crisis in Calais, calling for an end to the finger pointing over who is to blame and signalling that Britain is prepared to contribute more resources if necessary. The prime minister described ‚Äútotally unacceptable scenes‚Äù in Calais.
Asked what Britain was planning to do about the crisis, Cameron said it must work more closely with the French, tackle the people-smuggling gangs in north Africa and do more to make the UK a less attractive place for migrants. The mayor of Calais, Natacha Bouchart, told French radio on Tuesday that Britain had ‚Äúnot offered a penny‚Äù to help the authorities in Calais ease the pressure caused by the increasing number of migrants arriving in the town, as they attempt to travel to Britain. But Cameron, speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, struck a conciliatory tone. ‚ÄúThis is a strong partnership that we have in place and we should keep it that way.‚Äù He said the UK would provide more security assistance to French authorities if necessary, including sending more personnel and sniffer dog teams. He also said more needed to be done with other EU countries to prevent migrants from attempting the journey to Europe in the first place. ‚ÄúThirdly, we‚Äôve got to do more to make sure Britain is a less easy place for illegal migrants to come to and work in. That‚Äôs what our immigration bill is all about.‚Äù
The heightened diplomatic tension came amid disruption caused by striking employees of the French firm MyFerryLink, whose industrial action forced the closure of the Channel tunnel and led to the cancellation of train and ferry services. Travel chaos was subsiding on Wednesday as cross-Channel services resumed but authorities in Calais continued to grapple with desperate migrants seeking to take advantage of the disruption. One group of young men ‚Äì some as young as 15 ‚Äì were chased away by a lorry driver as they tried to break into hisvehicle. ‚ÄúThis is terrible, worse than it‚Äôs ever been,‚Äù said the driver from Poland, as the queue inched forward. ‚ÄúIt has been like this all night, it has been very difficult.‚Äù Another migrant managed to break the cord on the back of a nearby truck and was trying to clamber on board before he was confronted by the French driver. Neither man wanted to talk. A 17-year-old Eritrean man sitting by the side of the motorway slip road said he and his friends had been up all night trying to get into lorries bound for the UK. ‚ÄúMany people have been trying, but it is very difficult. We are very tired now.‚Äù Emmanuel Agius, a deputy at Calais town hall, claimed that the British PM was in danger of sparking a diplomatic incident. ‚ÄúDavid Cameron says he does not want these migrants, he doesn‚Äôt want to take responsibility but the UK is part of the EU and it cannot continue to try and play two roles. ‚ÄúIt is not acceptable to say: we are insular, we are an island and we will only be part of Europe how and when we want ‚Äì you Europeans just deal with it. That is too easy. If he continues to speak in that way then he is in danger of creating a diplomatic incident.‚Äù
For there to be a lasting solution to the crisis Europe had to work together, and that included the UK, Agius added. ‚ÄúIf the UK and Mr Cameron want to leave Europe, then at least the situation would be clear and precise and in that case the British could have their border back in the UK instead of here in Calais,‚Äù he said. Agius said migrants have ‚Äúone idea in their heads and that is to cross the 30km to Dover for a better life in the UK‚Äù. He said the UK ‚Äúneeds to stop ignoring that reality and take responsibility‚Äù. Additional reporting by Kim Willsher in Paris",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T16:13:34Z,world,World news,Spanish victims of thalidomide meet Pope Francis,"As they push forward in their struggle to obtain the kind of compensation given to other victims across Europe, Spanish victims of thalidomide have a powerful new ally: Pope Francis. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really happy,‚Äù said Alejandro Romero, one of the 100 or so Spanish victims who travelled to the Vatican on Wednesday to meet the pope. ‚ÄúHe promised he would try to help. He‚Äôs the most important diplomat in the world, so maybe he can ring people that won‚Äôt speak to us on the phone.‚Äù An estimated 3,000 Spaniards are believed to have suffered severe birth defects after their mothers took thalidomide, prescribed by Spanish doctors five decades ago to combat morning sickness during pregnancy. Unlike victims in many other countries in Europe, only two dozen victims in Spain have ever received any kind of compensation. Many of them were unable to meet the stringent criteria set out by the drug‚Äôs manufacturer, Gr√ºnenthal, which asks for the bottle of medication taken by their mother decades ago and, at times, the doctor‚Äôs prescription, in order to offer compensation. And unlike other governments in Europe, successive Spanish governments have refused to create a fund for victims. The issue is further complicated by the fact that the use of thalidomide in Spain took place during the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco. It was not until 2007 that the government confirmed that the drug had been sold in the country. Campaigners point to official documents and doctors‚Äô prescriptions to argue that the drug was sold under a variety of names until the mid-1970s ‚Äì some 15 years after doctors in Germany began linking the drug to severe birth defects. It was this story that victims shared with the pope in their brief meeting on Wednesday. ‚ÄúThe pope was really surprised about the lack of protections for victims in Spain,‚Äù said Romero. ‚ÄúHe promised that he would try to intervene and speak with the Spanish government.‚Äù The victims presented him with gifts; a football kit sporting the logo of the group that represents Spanish victims of thalidomide and a copy of the book Dark Remedy, which explores the history of thalidomide. As he prepared to embark on a plane back to Spain, Romero hoped the pope‚Äôs support would mark a turning point in the decades-long struggle of Spanish thalidomide victims for recognition and compensation ‚Äì one that has taken so long, campaigners note, that a third of the victims have already died. ‚ÄúAfter nearly 50 years of near-silence on our case, I think we‚Äôre closer to achieving change.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T16:06:54Z,world,World news,Two Irish students killed in Berkeley balcony collapse buried in Dublin,"The father of an Irish student who died in the Berkeley balcony tragedy has urged the US authorities to ensure a similar tragedy could never happen again. As the burials took place on Wednesday in Dublin of two more victims, it emerged that the Californian town‚Äôs district attorney was considering a fresh investigation into the accident. The district attorney‚Äôs office in Berkeley said it ‚Äúwill begin looking at the matter‚Äù of its own inquiry but stressed that no formal investigation had been launched. Berkeley authorities confirmed that their investigation found the number of people on the balcony during the party was not a factor in its collapse. Dry rot was the only contributing factor, according to Eric Angstadt, director of the city‚Äôs planning and development department.
However, Berkeley‚Äôs mayor confirmed that the police would not be carrying out a criminal investigation into how the balcony supports collapsed, killing six students ‚Äì five from Ireland and one from the US. The families of those who died now only have the option of taking civil action in relation to the tragic incident, which took place last Tuesday during a 21st birthday party at the flat complex. At the funeral of Niccolai Schuster in Dublin‚Äôs Rathgar district on Wednesday, the 21-year-old‚Äôs coffin was flanked by friends wearing the colours of Bayern Munich, the student‚Äôs favourite football team. In a message during the requiem mass, his father, John Schuster, said: ‚ÄúWe have lost our magical son and we are devastated ... Leave no stone unturned in this investigation. This cannot happen again.‚ÄùHe also appealed to other parents not to hold back their children‚Äôs dreams of travelling. ‚ÄúLet your kids go, do not let this deter you. Let them have freedom, it will give them life experience,‚Äù he said. Schuster added that his son had planned to move from California to South America, and had he survived, Niccolai would have travelled ‚Äúon one leg‚Äù to get to that continent. The history and politics student at University College Dublin was a grand-nephew of the writer and playwright John B Keane, and his father said Niccolai loved to read the author‚Äôs stories from County Kerry.
Meanwhile, in Foxrock, South Country Dublin, Grammy-nominated Irish musician Hozier performed an acoustic version of Work Song, one of Olivia Burke‚Äôs favourite songs, at her funeral in the Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Succour on Wednesday afternoon. In his tribute to his daughter, Paul Burke mentioned her cousin, Ashley Donohoe, 22, who was also killed in the accident. ‚ÄúSeparated by over 6,000 miles, they were incredibly close,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúFrom around 18 months old, all the way to recent years when they continued to trade trips to Ireland and San Francisco, none more exciting than the surprise arrival of Ashley to Olivia‚Äôs 18th birthday party. You two guys departed this world side by side, together in God‚Äôs place and may you look down on the rest of us.‚Äù Mass-goers burst into applause when he delivered this final message to his daughter and niece. He said: ‚ÄúYou are not forgotten, loved one, nor will you ever be, as long as life and memories last, we will remember thee. We miss you now, our hearts are sore, as time goes by we miss you more. Your loving smile, your gentle face, no one can fill your vacant place. Olivia Burke, my darling, may you rest in peace.‚Äù The last of the six students killed in the accident, Lorc√°n Miller, 21, will be laid to rest on Thursday, following a funeral service at Rathmichael parish church in Shankill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T15:59:07Z,world,World news,The secret world of Isis brides: 'U dnt hav 2 pay 4 ANYTHING if u r wife of a martyr',"Karen sat in a hotel room in Istanbul, grappling with a difficult decision. She had spent about $3,500 (¬£2,220) on the round trip to Turkey from her home in the US but, when she had bought the ticket, she had had no intention of flying home. The return bookings were for appearance‚Äôs sake. Her SMS mailbox was filled with promises for the future: messages from an Islamic State fighter who had promised to marry her. But as she sat in that Istanbul hotel room, something didn‚Äôt feel quite right. Her prospective groom‚Äôs insistence on absolute secrecy had not seemed strange at first. Karen had met him through the swarm of Isis-friendly social media. They started by chatting on Twitter and Ask.fm, then moved to encrypted messaging apps such as Kik, Surespot and Telegram. Paranoia runs through most of the online interactions ‚Äì no one‚Äôs identity is clear, and anyone could be bluffing. But the hint of danger was part of the glamour and Karen thought she was being careful. She was in her late teens and had recently graduated from high school, where she had been a lonely girl interested in Star Trek and computer programming. She converted to Islam less than a year before her journey, after watching the news and deciding to learn more about the religion. She had been inspired by Isis‚Äôs apparent authenticity ‚Äì they were as far removed from the west as it seemed possible to be. Her Christian parents worried whether she would be safe walking down the street wearing a hijab. She kept her real plans well hidden from them. Online, she disguised her identity by using a kunya ‚Äì a traditional Arab title. Karen had created several of these, but mostly she went by Umm Khalid ‚Äì ‚Äúmother of Khalid‚Äù. The name derived from Khalid bin Walid, a military commander known as the ‚ÄúSword of God‚Äù in the early days of Islam. Umm Khalid was also the name of a Palestinian village that was evacuated in 1948 and swallowed up by the Israeli city of Netanya. The name has its roots in violence inflicted and violence suffered.
When she met the Isis fighter Abu Muhammad online [not his real name; all names in this article have been changed], she took the chance to bring her new identity to life.
As she planned her trip, she asked him to put her in touch with some of the women who had already joined Isis from the west. She wanted to know that she could trust him. He promised that he would, but made an excuse the next time she asked, and the time after that. This made her uneasy, but so did the prospect of delaying the trip. All the other Isis supporters she had met online said that it would only become more difficult and dangerous to get to Syria as time passed. Things weren‚Äôt easy at home: her parents ‚Äúhad a fit‚Äù when she tried to wear a niqab. And so she boarded the plane to Istanbul, hoping for the best. Later, Karen did not like to talk about all the promises Abu Muhammad had made to her: it was embarrassing to think about how naive she had been. He had told her to board the bus from Istanbul to Urfa and make the 18-hour journey alone, as many others before her had done. At the other end he, or one of his friends, would be waiting to hear from her. They would come at once, and would help her to cross into Isis territory immediately. But to her, the plan seemed risky and rushed. He had told her so little. Things came to a head on the final day, when the tone of his texts became more sexual. When she confronted him, he argued that there was nothing wrong with doing, as she later called it, ‚Äúthings‚Äù. They were, he pointed out, just 24 hours from being married. This was not, to Karen‚Äôs mind, how pious and devoted jihadis were supposed to behave. Unlike some girls, who flirted with fighters online, she never obsessed about true love. Marriage was a practical consideration ‚Äì a means to a life with Isis. But she would talk, from time to time, about wanting to be a good wife to a good husband ‚Äì one who behaved like a perfect Muslim. Sexting was not part of the picture.
I later contacted Karen in private on encrypted apps, and eventually she opened up. She had flown home to the US after two days in Turkey (‚Äúwith great photos of Istanbul‚Äù, she added, ‚Äúlol.‚Äù). One final piece of information had clinched her decision to call off the Isis marriage. She had heard about a woman similar to herself being kidnapped in Urfa by the PKK, the Kurdish nationalist group, then arrested. The PKK is listed as a terrorist organisation by the US and the EU, but is also at the forefront of the fight against Isis on the ground. She began to wonder if Abu Muhammad was really who he claimed to be. ‚ÄúTalking to him, I realised that things weren‚Äôt right,‚Äù she said. She became convinced that Abu Muhammad was not from Isis but the PKK. It was by the grace of God, she told me, that she was still alive and free. She had broken no laws, and no longer intended to do so. Others in Isis have since offered to help her to come over, but she trusted no one enough to take the risk. She issued some sharp advice. ‚ÄúBrothers lie to get a wife.‚Äù Like the three schoolgirls from Bethnal Green, Karen was from a lower-middle-class background and had a decent education. Almost all the women I came across looked and sounded not unlike myself at 16. They were conservative Muslim girls, whether they were recent converts or the daughters of Muslims, who took their faith seriously. Although their interpretation of Islam rarely agreed with mine, the women I spoke to were driven in part by religious ideals. But few of these women were willing to engage thoughtfully with a variety of Islamic religious texts, traditions and interpretations. They hated disorder and ambiguity; the clear-cut doctrines issued by jihadist ideologues appealed to their political sensibilities. Opposing the west was their measure of religious authenticity.
‚ÄòIt‚Äôs time for action‚Äô ‚ÄúThe sickest thing I‚Äôve ever done in my life is cross that Turkish border,‚Äù said Umm Umar on Twitter. She was using ‚Äúsick‚Äù to mean ‚Äúgood‚Äù. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never forget that night.‚Äù She was already in Syria and was the widow of an Isis fighter. In our private conversations, she tried to influence me with her single-minded energy. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for action,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúYour EemƒÅn [faith] will get sooo high during the border crossing,‚Äù she promised. ‚ÄúBig adrenaline rush.‚Äù After some thought, she added: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sinful for u to be staying in UK whilst there is a khilƒÅfah [a caliphate].‚Äù Umm Umar was just 16 when we started talking. She was born in Britain but her parents were Bangladeshi. She walked out of her parents‚Äô home in the middle of the night, leaving a letter on her bed explaining her actions. She seemed pleased to be able to share her experiences. ‚ÄúCreep out,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúIf u can take out a student loan pls do so.‚Äù What about our religious duty to repay loans? ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said, without missing a beat. ‚ÄúThe kuffar [non-Muslim] wealth is halƒÅl [permitted] for us.‚Äù
Umm Umar did not enjoy her childhood in Britain. ‚ÄúMan I hated UK so much,‚Äù she told me the first time we spoke. She grew up in a part of the country where there were few migrants, and even fewer Muslims. Other kids often beat her up at school when she was small, she said, and spat at her on the bus when she was older. She was desperately lonely and alienated. Her strongest bond was with her mother. ‚ÄúGive my mother happiness,‚Äù read a prayer she retweeted. ‚ÄúIf sadness still lingers in her eyes, give her whatever happiness is left of mine.‚Äù But Umm Umar‚Äôs sentimentality was shadowed by a violent streak. When I asked her about hurting her parents, she reassured me that it was ‚ÄúhalƒÅl‚Äù. ‚ÄúI did it and I‚Äôm sure everyone else did it,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúRight now we are in a state of war.‚Äù Like most of the girls I spoke to, Umm Umar‚Äôs marriage to an Isis fighter in Syria had largely been a pragmatic affair. ‚ÄúLife without a mahram [close male relative] here can get quite difficult,‚Äù she told me. She had been matched with a fighter who was British Bangladeshi, just like her. His family were even from the same village in Bangladesh, she told me, relishing the coincidence of fate that had brought them together. He had been ‚Äúso so sweet and caring‚Äù, but had been killed just a couple of months earlier. She was now the wife of a shaheed [martyr] and was being honoured. She seemed proud of her husband‚Äôs success, and never spoke a word of grief or sadness. Another western woman in Syria I spoke to ‚Äì Umm Zahra ‚Äì was almost envious when she discussed Umm Umar‚Äôs status. ‚ÄúU dnt hav 2 pay 4 ANYTHING if u r wife of a shaheed,‚Äù she told me. But she was careful not to seem discontented. All women, she promised me, were looked after. ‚ÄúU will still get money each month.‚Äù
Umm Umar had travelled to Syria because she wanted to join a perfect Islamic state. Like the other women, she painted a picture of an Islamic utopia. This was for the sake of propaganda and, I suspected, to reassure themselves that they had made the right decision in going over. To all these women, Isis was simply dawla [state], as if no other country existed or mattered. ‚ÄúU can come here and study btw,‚Äù Umm Umar wrote to me once. ‚ÄúStudy fiqh [Islamic legal interpretations], hadeeth [sayings of the Prophet], medicine, etc.‚Äù I once asked Umm Umar about al-Khansaa ‚Äì the rumoured women‚Äôs brigade that enforces Isis‚Äôs harsh interpretation of sharia law on the women living there. ‚ÄúYes u can do hisbah [join the religious police],‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut if ur married your husband will want u to stay at home lol.‚Äù She added: ‚Äúlots of ajar [reward for good deeds].‚Äù She had taken part in the hisbah patrols after being married, while her husband was away fighting. After he was killed, she had entered the traditional three-month mourning period. She had just a few days remaining when we last spoke, and planned to ‚Äúresume my job inshaAllƒÅh [God willing]‚Äù at the end of it. I asked her, that last time, if she had a happier life in Syria than she had in the UK. ‚ÄúYep I do,‚Äù she answered, adding a smiley face. Karen, the American, also reflected from time to time about a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù Islamic state ‚Äì although she had become more jaded since her decision to return to the US. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an 18-year-old cynic who still dreams of an Islamic utopia,‚Äù she wrote once, ‚Äúwhich won‚Äôt ever exist on this planet.‚Äù She argued that no ‚Äúgovernment with humans in charge‚Äù could ever avoid corruption and ‚Äútruly implement shari‚Äôah‚Äù. Karen‚Äôs newfound cynicism was rare among the women I talked to, most of whom really believed that they were going to help create an Islamic utopia. ‚ÄúShariah is a perfect system who protects all,‚Äù wrote one female supporter on Twitter, ‚Äúnot just about cutting hands and stoning fornicators ‚Ä¶ like Saudi.‚Äù Dr Katherine Brown of King‚Äôs College London compares the women who have travelled to Syria to join Isis to ‚Äúindividuals who went out to join the Soviet Union in the 1950s and 60s, who weren‚Äôt looking to fight, but were looking to become new citizens of the Soviet state. What‚Äôs interesting is that they believe it‚Äôs possible ‚Ä¶ Islamic State is saying: ‚ÄòYou can have this perfect world ‚Äì you just need to try a little bit harder.‚Äô‚Äù There is a totalitarian impulse behind this. By joining the state, these women think they will become, in Brown‚Äôs words, ‚Äúperfect people‚Äù. Melanie Smith of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue calls the ‚Äúcaliphate utopian ideal‚Äù one of the common ‚Äúkey pull factors‚Äù that draw women over. They imagine a world in which there is little poverty and inequality, governed with perfect fairness under clear-cut, divine laws that work to the advantage of all. It is a vision that makes no allowances for the ambiguity and variety of traditional Islamic legal interpretations, or for the disorder of real life. But there are also ‚Äúpush factors‚Äù, says Smith, that drive women away from their homes in the west: often loneliness and alienation. Isis propaganda is designed to appeal to people who feel like outsiders in their own homes. ‚ÄúIslam began as something strange and it will revert to being strange,‚Äù reads a hadith [teaching] that is popular among Isis supporters online, ‚Äúso give glad tidings to the strangers.‚Äù ‚ÄòI miss my mum‚Äô Umm Abbas came to my attention when she retweeted some popular advice: ‚ÄúFeeling alone and alienated? Stop sinning.‚Äù When I asked her how she had found life in the UK, her answer was terse: ‚ÄúStress depression‚Äù. She was a British woman in her 20s with Pakistani parents. Where Umm Umar was open and easy to talk to, Umm Abbas was brisk and wary. On Twitter, she talked enthusiastically about her journey to Isis. ‚ÄúThe most amazing ‚Ä¶ experience of my life,‚Äù she wrote, ‚Äúwas crossing with a family of over 10 members who had a newborn baby with them! :)‚Äù Like Umm Umar, Umm Abbas was relentlessly positive about life with Isis. I asked her what happened to girls who found themselves with abusive husbands: ‚ÄúDawla has the best of men,‚Äù she promised, ‚Äúand the shariah court here protects you from all types of violence.‚Äù There was a process, she and Umm Umar explained, for unmarried women to be matched with a husband. After being placed in a maqar [a shared house for ‚Äúsisters‚Äù], a woman writes down what sort of ‚Äúbrother‚Äù she wants to marry. The emir of the area matches her with someone and sets up a brief meeting, after which, if both parties are agreeable, the marriage quickly takes place. ‚ÄúThey will still contact ur dad,‚Äù Umm Abbas told me. But if the woman‚Äôs father refused, the emir would go ahead and marry them anyway.
Chinks of unhappiness sometimes appeared. Umm Abbas‚Äôs marriage was much more difficult than Umm Umar‚Äôs had been. ‚ÄúLife throws all types of trials,‚Äù she wrote to me. ‚ÄúThe biggest is listening n obeying to your husband.‚Äù She wouldn‚Äôt say anything more except that her marriage was ‚Äúsometimes tough‚Äù. She saw this as a test, requiring sabr [patience] on her part. She wasn‚Äôt alone in her unhappiness. Umm Umar would occasionally issue quiet pleas for comfort and reassurance. ‚ÄúI miss my mum ‚Ä¶‚Äù she tweeted once. Umm Zahra shared her jealousy of a possible co-wife, and even of hooris [the famous ‚Äú72 virgins‚Äù that martyrs are said, in jihadist propaganda, to receive in heaven]. I pointed out that the Qur‚Äôan does not actually specify the gender of hooris or of those who receive them, nor restrict them to martyrs. She stopped answering my messages. Complaints about difficulties in daily life were often couched in positivity. ‚ÄúCandlelight dinner with the akhawƒÅt [sisters],‚Äù tweeted Umm Umar, ‚Äú#CozTheElectricityWent #ItsAllPartOfTheStruggle.‚Äù Sometimes complaints were hidden in advice. ‚ÄúNo good makeup,‚Äù Umm Abbas told me, ‚Äún clothes too. I brought 2 suitcases.‚Äù A recent issue of Dabiq, the Isis magazine, addressed itself specifically to the concerns of western women within Isis. The article urged those who had lost their husbands to ‚Äúbe patient‚Äù, and to ‚Äúbe wary of thinking of going back‚Äù. Dawla is not without its doubters, and utopian dreams are not easy to sustain, but few will be able to return home any time soon. ‚ÄúPeople risk their lives to bring you in,‚Äù Karen said to me once. She was still suffering from guilt at being a ‚Äúcoward‚Äù for not going through with her journey to Syria. But she knew that, once there, no Isis fighter would risk his life to get her out again. ‚ÄòDo we not have the right to defend ourselves?‚Äô For each of the estimated more than 500 western women who have travelled to Syria to join Isis, there are more sitting at their computers at home, voicing their support online. Most won‚Äôt make the journey, but they will go about their lives with the quiet fantasy of one day being citizens of dawla. There is a code that Isis supporters use to communicate online. Going to Syria is ‚Äútaking a holiday‚Äù; ‚Äúgreen birds‚Äù and ‚Äúdusty feet‚Äù are references to hadiths about martyrs. A single finger pointing upwards represents the Isis brand of monotheism and a commitment to death and victory. But Umm Kulthum disapproved of all this. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve turned [jihad] into a kind of fad,‚Äù complained a post she shared on Tumblr, warning against ‚Äútrivilising‚Äù violent jihad. ‚ÄúWe hold up our index fingers ‚Ä¶ like we‚Äôre all part of some √ºber-cool club.‚Äù She had other things in common with the various women I spoke to. Many spoke of being constrained by everyday life, and of longing to be part of something bigger. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just live life waiting for the next weekend to come,‚Äù Umm Kulthum wrote once. ‚ÄúYour aspiration should be greater than that.‚Äù She shared one important trait with the bulk of online Isis supporters: a belief that a global war between ‚Äútrue Islam‚Äù and ‚Äúthe kuffar‚Äù was taking place, and that Muslims had to choose a side. Umm Kulthum knew that Isis was associated with brutality. Some of the women I spoke to argued that the violence was exaggerated by the western media. Others defended it by arguing that the kuffar did worse, while a few, including Umm Kulthum, actively relished it. She shared pictures of Isis fighters with guns. In private, she was remarkably sweet and tender. She called me her ‚Äúbeloved sister‚Äù.
She was Libyan but had spent much of her life in England, and received her secondary education in a state school. She had been lonely there, and spent some time on antidepressants. By the time we spoke, she was back in Libya with her parents and siblings, hoping to have the chance to travel to Syria herself. But Britain still loomed large in her mind. It was there that she had been converted from the ‚Äújaahiliyyah‚Äù [ignorance] that she saw in her Muslim parents to ‚Äútrue Islam‚Äù. Umm Kulthum was fixated on stories of Muslim oppression. Her social media accounts were a montage of Muslim suffering ‚Äì Syrian children killed by Bashar al-Assad; Palestinian youths burned alive by Israelis. For Umm Kulthum, this justified almost any brutality in return. She felt all Muslims had a duty to ‚Äúprotect their siblings in Islam‚Äù; she was convinced that only violent jihadists took this seriously. ‚ÄúJihad is our right even as just human beings, not Muslims,‚Äù she said once. ‚ÄúDo we not have the right to defend ourselves?‚Äù For all her hostility to the west, her western education had helped to shape her. Like the other women, she used the language of ‚Äúhuman rights‚Äù and ‚Äúgirl power‚Äù. She shared stories of women in niqabs, with weapons, charging into battle. Special contempt was reserved for Muslims who she thought were colluding with the west by failing to support violent jihad. Such people are known in Isis circles as ‚Äúcoconuts‚Äù ‚Äì brown on the outside, white on the inside. The word has its roots in the anti-colonial movements of the 20th century. When I mentioned I had non-Muslim friends, Umm Kulthum was stern. ‚ÄúHabibti,‚Äù she wrote, ‚Äúdo not take kafir as your friend.‚Äù Umm Umar was pitying: ‚ÄúU have to understand that these kuffar are our enemies,‚Äù she wrote to me. ‚ÄúAnd they will never stop fighting us until we follow their ‚Ä¶ way.‚Äù Others were harsher. After the shootings of three Muslim students in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, Umm Abbas retweeted: ‚Äúand muslims think that the west cares about them. you are a joke by Allah.‚Äù For these women, there is no room for an ambiguous multicultural identity. No Muslim, a recent issue of Dabiq argued, has ‚Äúany excuse to be independent‚Äù of Isis, which is waging ‚Äúwar on their behalf‚Äù. All Muslims in the west must make their choice to either live as ‚Äúinauthentic‚Äù coconuts or to redeem themselves in death. ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre a muslim and love democracy???‚Äô Theological ambiguity was also difficult for these women. They believed that Islam was defined more by opposition to today‚Äôs western world than by any religious ideal. After the Chapel Hill shootings, one female Isis supporter argued that candlelight vigils for the victims were un-Islamic because they involved ‚Äúimitating the kuffar‚Äù. All believed that ‚Äúpure Islam‚Äù lay in whatever was as anti-western as possible. Umm Kulthum presented democracy as the binary opposite of a utopian caliphate. ‚ÄúThe law of AllƒÅh should not be voted over,‚Äù she said, quoting Anwar al-Awlaki, the jihadist propagandist who was killed in 2011. I tried, occasionally, to argue that there are many different interpretations of sharia law, and that Islam has contained some democratic ideas ‚Äì the first four Sunni caliphs did not inherit their positions, and the idea of community consensus in legal interpretation has a long tradition. The response was usually confused or hostile. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a muslim and love democracy???‚Äù one of Karen‚Äôs online friends said, ‚Äúhmm.‚Äù What troubled me most was not that these women didn‚Äôt agree with my interpretation of Islam. It was that none of them seemed willing to form independent religious opinions at all. Brown of King‚Äôs College pointed out that few of the women seemed ‚Äúempowered to find faith on their own terms‚Äù. When I asked each of the women about their beliefs, they told me to read Anwar al-Awlaki, or to watch popular jihadist ideologues on YouTube. Whenever I tried to ask Karen why, on religious grounds, she supported Isis‚Äôs interpretation of sharia law, she avoided answering the question. She was busy, or had a headache. ‚ÄúIt hurts to think right now so I won‚Äôt,‚Äù she wrote.
Each of these women struggled with ambiguity or disorder ‚Äì in theology, in identity and in life. Each was convinced that there could be only one valid interpretation of Islam and of sharia law, and that it lay in whatever appeared to be as anti-western as possible. To find it, they had to erase their western identities. Joining Isis offered them an opportunity to do so. ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt fit in here or there‚Äô For some women, erasing the western part of them was a struggle. Converts ‚Äúhave different battles to born Muslims‚Äù, Umm Raeesa said once. ‚ÄúMuslims thinking u r a fake Muslim.‚Äù She was one of Karen‚Äôs closest online friends. They had bonded over their shared difficulties: both women had been accused by other online Isis supporters of being spies. Their only recourse was to emphasise their religiosity on social media. Umm Raeesa was vicious towards critics of Isis, affectionate towards her online friends and professional in her daily life. She was 25 and worked in finance in Australia. She had converted to Islam two years earlier, but she wore just a headscarf and left her face uncovered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd prefer to wear niqab at work,‚Äù she told me once, ‚Äúbut would have zero chance of a job lol.‚Äù She had been raised a Catholic, but didn‚Äôt connect with the faith. She supported Isis vehemently online, but had no imminent plans to make the journey. ‚ÄúThis area is unstable,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúI think it needs to settle down.‚Äù For the time being, she was content to fight for Isis online without having to give up her life in Australia. More than anything else, Umm Raeesa craved human connection. She had a deep yearning to belong. I woke up to fresh messages from her almost every morning. ‚ÄúAsalaam Alaikum dear sister,‚Äù she always wrote. ‚ÄúHow r u?‚Äù Sometimes she wanted to talk about Isis or about Islamophobia; sometimes she just wanted to chat about her day or to ask me about mine. Many of the women I contacted sought affection and praise in the arms of the Isis sisterhood. Smith and Brown describe this as another ‚Äúpull factor‚Äù that can draw women away from their homes and towards a greater sense of belonging. To Umm Kulthum, I was always ‚Äúhabibti‚Äù. Karen often tweeted about the ‚Äúbaqiyah sisterhood‚Äù: ‚ÄúMuslimah‚Äôs of the Ummah make sure you got each other‚Äôs backs!‚Äù All these women knew what to expect of life under Isis. They warned me that their days would revolve around being a wife and a mother, and would be spent largely indoors. One of Karen‚Äôs online friends was once asked, on Twitter, why she didn‚Äôt just go back to her home country if she didn‚Äôt like the west. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt fit in here nor there lol,‚Äù she replied. When I last spoke to Karen, she had decided to remain at home, in the US, for the time being. But she worries that she is being a ‚Äúcoward‚Äù, and still considers a possible future with Isis. ‚ÄúSometimes I wish I could just leave this place,‚Äù she tweeted once. She still might. All names have been changed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T15:17:43Z,world,World news,Saudi comedian laughs off threats over Isis satire,"A Saudi comedian threatened with beheading by Islamic State sympathisers and accused of apostasy by a preacher says he is not deterred and will continue to laugh off his opponents√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ rage. Nasser al-Qasabi, 53, has caused a stir with his satirical sketch series Selfie, which is being aired by MBC, a pan-Arab broadcaster, during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month.
Islamic State is caricatured in an episode in which Qasabi plays a father who travels to Syria in search of his son who has joined the group. In one scene, a group of fighters at a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìgirl market√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ pick concubines from a line of chained women abducted from the battlefield. A fighter picks a slave √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwife√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ who is actually a mustachioed man in a woman√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s black robe, only for a comrade point out the apparent mistake. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo problem!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ the first fighter says. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIf he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s an infidel, he deserves this.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ
One tweet sent to Qasabi since the show went out said: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe holy warriors will not rest until they cut your head from your body, in just a few days hopefully.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Qasabi responded to the threats: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìMy Twitter is overflowing with people cursing at me, threatening me and hating on me. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d like for them to calm down a little. Come on, Ramadan is just beginning!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Fahd Deghaither, a writer at al-Hayat newspaper, tweeted in Arabic: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìTwo episodes have shaken Daesh [Isis] feelings. What would have happened if we had a whole production city with complete cinematic events? Who will stand against that?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ
Qasabi has received supportive tweets gathering around the hashtag #√ò¬≥√ô≈†√ô‚Äû√ôÔøΩ√ô≈† (#selfie). Clips from the episode that mocked Isis were shared online:
Users tweeted their solidarity with the phrase √ò¬ß√ô‚Ä†√ò¬ß √ô‚Ä¶√ò¬π √ô‚Ä†√ò¬ß√ò¬µ√ò¬± √ò¬ß√ô‚Äû√ô‚Äö√ò¬µ√ò¬®√ô≈† (I am with Nasser al-Qasabi).
In remarks posted on MBC√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s website, Qasabi said: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAllah will protect us. It is the job of the artist to say the truth, even if that is at his own expense. This is the price we have to pay.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ He said in an interview with al-Arabiya: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWarning the people about Isis is the true jihad [struggle], because we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re fighting them with art not war.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ In his first episode of Selfie, Qasabi mocks ultra-conservatives in Saudi Arabia by playing the role of a musician who repents and smashes a lute on stage. Shortly after its broadcast, Saeed al-Farwa, a Saudi preacher, accused al-Qasabi of apostasy. The preacher has since apologised after criticism from the Saudi Islamic affairs ministry.
Qasabi, who has been a popular TV personality and comedian across the Middle East for a number of years, is a judge on Arabs Got Talent. His previous best-known programme, Tash ma Tash, satirised a number of taboos in Saudi Arabia and wider Arab society.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T15:12:45Z,world,World news,Greek bailout deal hangs by thread as Tsipras rails at creditors,"A deal to stop Greece from going bankrupt is hanging by a thread after the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, hit out at his country‚Äôs creditors. Tsipras is in Brussels for emergency talks with Greece‚Äôs creditors, but the two sides remain far apart over a compromise plan tabled by Athens that would allow Greece to unlock desperately needed financial aid.
Before departing for Brussels, Tsipras criticised the ‚Äústrange stance‚Äù of the creditors over their response to his plan to raise nearly ‚Ç¨8bn (¬£5.6bn) by taxing businesses, consumers and pensioners. ‚ÄúEither they don‚Äôt want an agreement or they are serving specific interests in Greece,‚Äù he told his cabinet colleagues. The Greek leader was summoned to Brussels to thrash out a compromise, as it emerged that Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund thought Athens‚Äôs plan was ineffective. Lagarde was meeting senior officials at the European commission ahead of the talks with Tsipras. Eurozone finance ministers, who are due to hold their third meeting on the Greek crisis in less than a week, could be working through the night to hammer out a compromise. European leaders, who are gathering in Brussels on Thursday for a regular summit, have instructed Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs the ‚Äúeurogroup‚Äù of eurozone finance ministers, to work all night if necessary. ‚Äú[The leaders‚Äô] expectation is not to negotiate: their expectation is to welcome an agreement in the eurogroup,‚Äù said a senior EU source, sticking to the script that broad outlines of a deal would be agreed on Wednesday night.
Dijsselbloem said work remained to be done, as the two sides struggle to close the gap on whether the Greeks should be more focused on increasing taxes or cutting spending. The IMF thinks the Greek plan is too reliant on tax increases, which have failed to deliver anticipated revenue streams in the past. The fund has also criticised what it sees as only half-hearted measures to reform the Greek economy by tearing down hundreds of regulatory barriers. Greece‚Äôs creditors are also demanding faster and more sweeping reforms to the Greek pension system, according to a leaked version of the creditors‚Äô counter-proposals covered in red ink. Tsipras, who has vowed not to cut wages and pensions, is now under pressure to bring forward plans to raise the statutory retirement age to 67 and scale back pensioner benefits further. Pensions is one of the most fraught areas for the Greek negotiators who are already under fire for offering more limited concessions. Tsipras told his cabinet that a rejection of the Greek plan would be unprecedented. Investors‚Äô spirits sank as Tsipras‚Äôs criticism of Greece‚Äôs creditors leaked out, prompting a fall in eurozone stock markets. Greek stocks lost 2.5% on opening, while shares in Greek banks slipped 5% after rising earlier in the week.
Time is running out fast, with Greece‚Äôs eurozone bailout set to expire next Tuesday, when it is also due to repay ‚Ç¨1.6bn to the IMF. Austria‚Äôs finance minister, Hans J√∂rg Schelling, said a cut-and-dried solution must be found by Sunday. ‚ÄúIf there is no real solution by Sunday this week, it is not foreseeable what the next step will be,‚Äù he told Austrian radio. A former Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras, who is also on his way to Brussels, said Greece was being forced to choose ‚Äúbetween catastrophe and a very bad solution‚Äù. The opposition centre-right New Democracy party said five months of drawn-out negotiations and putting up a robust defence had been a fiasco. Criticism of Tsipras‚Äôs finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, is also gaining ground. Yannis Vroutsis, a former minister of labour, accused the academic-turned-politician of ‚Äúgetting a certificate in inaccuracy and lies‚Äù. ‚ÄúIs there any Greek who now believes Mr Varoufakis?‚Äù he said on Wednesday morning. Varoufakis remained upbeat, telling reporters: ‚ÄúWe are entering the final stage of the negotiation which we hope, we strive, to be the last.‚Äù The Greek economy is being kept afloat by emergency funds from the European Central Bank, although no further cash injections were made on Wednesday as Greek banks remained calm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T14:43:49Z,world,World news,'Abortion drone' to fly pills across border into Poland,"Women‚Äôs rights groups are planning to deliver abortion pills by drone from Germany to Poland in an attempt to help women in the country terminate their pregnancies safely. The ‚Äúabortion drone‚Äù will carry World Health Organisation-approved drugs from Frankfurt an der Oder to the Polish border town of Slubice on Saturday, where it will be met by women‚Äôs groups who will hand on the pills to those who need them. The mission being planned by Women on Waves, a non-profit group of doctors and activists from the Netherlands. Poland, a strictly Roman Catholic country, is one of the few places in Europe where women can get a legal abortion only if there is proof of rape or incest, the mother‚Äôs life is endangered or the foetus is severely malformed. The group said it had chosen the unusual method of delivery in order to highlight Poland‚Äôs restrictive abortion laws. Other European countries such as Portugal, Spain and the UK ‚Äì except for Northern Ireland ‚Äì offer abortions on request as long as certain conditions are met. Rebecca Gomperts, a doctor and founder of Women on Waves, said: ‚ÄúWe want to create awareness about women‚Äôs right to a safe abortion. The drone is another way to use the different laws in different countries in order to draw attention to the social injustice that women who are living in places where abortion is illegal are subject to. ‚ÄúIn Poland, even women who could have an abortion under Polish law are often denied it because Catholic hospitals don‚Äôt help them, even if their life is in danger. Rich people can go to Germany or the UK to have abortions, but it‚Äôs the women who don‚Äôt have the means or access to information who are suffering.‚Äù Gomperts said the abortion drone did not require authorisation from the Polish or German government as it would not be flying through controlled airspace, was not for commercial purposes and weighed less than 5kg. The pills ‚Äì mifepristone and misoprostol ‚Äì can be taken up to nine weeks into a pregnancy. Women on Waves provides medical abortion pills around the world, usually by post after women place orders online. It is estimated that at least 50,000 underground abortions take place in Poland each year. Doctors who perform them illegally often use outdated tools and procedures, and charge up to ‚Ç¨4,000 (¬£2,850). ‚ÄúWoman who have abortions in Poland are not criminalised, it‚Äôs the people who provide the abortions who are acting illegally,‚Äù Gomperts said. ‚ÄúWe want to create awareness among Polish women that there is medicine that is safe to use. So that whenever they look for abortions they will make sure it is safe.‚Äù The exact location of the drone dropoff will be announced on Friday. Pro-life groups have reportedly vowed to shoot it down. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not easy to shoot down a drone and fortunately guns are not that easy to get in Europe,‚Äù Gomperts said. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs problematic because it‚Äôs a very aggressive strategy that‚Äôs intended to make people afraid. And it‚Äôs nonsense because it will not stop women from needing an abortion.‚Äù If the mission is successful, Women on Waves hopes to send drones to other countries in Europe that criminalise abortion, such as Ireland and Malta. ‚ÄúWe would definitely be able to extend this programme,‚Äù Gompert said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T14:39:36Z,world,World news,France summons US ambassador over 'unacceptable' spying,"The French president, Fran√ßois Hollande, has described revelations that the US spied on three successive French presidents as unacceptable and said Paris would not tolerate actions that threaten its security. The US ambassador was summoned to the foreign ministry for an explanation after WikiLeaks documents published late on Tuesday showed that the US had bugged French leaders‚Äô telephones.
But Hollande‚Äôs government faces accusations of hypocrisy, with MPs due to vote through a law later on Wednesday that would give intelligence agencies sweeping new powers to snoop on French people. The bill allows phone and email intercepts without the approval of a judge, seen by critics as a serious threat to individual freedom and privacy. The French authorities argue the measures are necessary following the attacks on the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine and a Kosher supermarket in January. It was not clear whether the timing of the WikiLeaks release was deliberate. The revelation that the US National Security Agency (NSA) had spied on three presidents ‚Äì Jacques Chirac, Nicolas Sarkozy and Hollande ‚Äì caused outrage and indignation in France and prompted Hollande to call an emergency defence council meeting on Wednesday morning. A statement after the crisis summit, described by France‚Äôs prime minister, Manuel Valls, as being ‚Äúfull of emotion and anger‚Äù, blasted US snooping as unacceptable and demanded it stop. ‚ÄúFrance will not tolerate actions that threaten its security and the protection of its interests,‚Äù the French president‚Äôs office said, adding that US spying allegations had surfaced in the past. ‚ÄúThese are unacceptable facts that have already been the subject of clarification between the US and France, notably at the end of 2013 when the first revelations were made and during a state visit by the president of the republic to the United States in February 2014. Commitments were made by the US authorities. They need to be recalled and strictly respected.‚Äù
Hollande‚Äôs office said the French president had phoned Obama on Wednesday afternoon. ‚ÄúThe exchange was a chance to emphasise the principles that must govern relations between allies in matters of intelligence,‚Äù said Hollande‚Äôs office. ‚ÄúPresident Obama clearly reiterated the firm pledge he made in November 2013, after the Snowden affair, and which was repeated during the state visit [by Hollande] in February 2014, to end practices that might have operated in the past but which are unacceptable between allies. ‚ÄúFrench intelligence officials will very soon travel to Washington to increase cooperation.‚Äù The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, summoned the US ambassador, Jane Hartley, to the foreign office. And government spokesman St√©phane Le Foll announced a senior French intelligence official would visit the US in the coming days for further discussions with American counterparts. ‚ÄúWe find it hard to understand or imagine what motivates an ally to spy on allies who are often on the same strategic positions in world affairs,‚Äù Le Foll added. The revelations were first reported in French daily Lib√©ration and on news website Mediapart, which said the NSA spied on Chirac, Sarkozy and Hollande from at least 2006 until May 2012. Hollande held a second crisis meeting with parliamentary groups at his √âlys√©e Palace offices on Wednesday afternoon. Afterwards, Valls told MPs the ‚Äúsystematic and continued‚Äù spying on foreign leaders by America was ‚Äúunacceptable and abnormal‚Äù. Valls said he could reassure MPs that France did not eavesdrop on the leaders of European and allied countries. ‚ÄúOur country is loyal and knows the historical debt it owes America, but this gratitude cannot prevent us from protecting our country and citizens,‚Äù he said. The leaked US documents, marked top secret, were based on phone taps and filed in an NSA document labelled ‚ÄúEspionnage √âlys√©e‚Äù (√âlys√©e spy), according to Lib√©ration and Mediapart.
The recorded conversations, which were handled by the summary services unit at the NSA, were said to reveal few state secrets but show clear evidence of the extent of American spying on countries considered allies. WikiLeaks documents suggest that other US spy targets included French cabinet ministers and the French ambassador to the US. ‚ÄúThe documents contain the ‚Äòselectors‚Äô from the target list, detailing the cell phone numbers of numerous officials in the √âlys√©e up to and including the direct cell phone of the president,‚Äù a report of the taps published in the French media revealed. In an article co-authored by Julian Assange, the French newspaper Lib√©ration pointed out that in matters of spying, there are no friends. It said: ‚ÄúSpying abroad is the ultimate ‚Äògrey zone‚Äô in surveillance ‚Äì it is also, in France, the real blind spot of the planned law on surveillance, expected to be adopted this Wednesday.‚Äù Mediapart said: ‚ÄúFor almost 10 years, the United States has listened in to French presidents ‚Ä¶ it was all classed top secret or ‚Äòspecial intelligence‚Äô. US media cited a statement from the NSA saying it was not targeting and would not target Hollande‚Äôs communications. The statement did not deny spying had taken place in the past. Le Point magazine pointed out that France spends about ‚Ç¨1bn (¬£700m) a year on its secret and intelligence services, compared with ‚Ç¨60bn the US spends. It said this illustrated a ‚Äúdifference of means, but not of methods‚Äù and said the WikiLeaks revelations were nothing new.
‚ÄúThe secret and intelligence services have always had the role of discovering and sending to political leaders, diplomats and military personnel information allowing them to make their decisions,‚Äù it wrote. ‚ÄúThe brutal fact is, being allies over one thing doesn‚Äôt mean we share everything or hold back on spying on our little friend.‚Äù Bernard Debr√©, a member of Sarkozy‚Äôs opposition Republican party, went further, writing on his blog: ‚ÄúPoliticians are astonished to have been spied on by the Americans! It‚Äôs a bloody hypocrisy. For years everyone has been listened in on by the NSA, the NSA has been accused by senators and governors and has drastically reduced its activity ‚Ä¶ and at the same time, France is going in the opposite direction.‚Äù Arnaud Danjean, a former member of France‚Äôs intelligence service, the DGSE, and now a Euro MP for the Republican party, said there was nothing new in the revelations. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all very emotional, but on a technical and geopolitical level there‚Äôs nothing new in reporting that spies are spying. Being an ally doesn‚Äôt mean that you tell each other everything,‚Äù Danjean told France Info. ‚ÄúWhen one is a diplomat, one knows one is a target. When you‚Äôre someone in the public sphere, you start from the principle that foreign countries are interested in you, you take defensive measures as a result.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T14:15:17Z,world,World news,Ruining Rhodes: Greece's VAT proposal leaves islanders feeling deserted,"Just outside the medieval walled splendour of Rhodes‚Äôs old town, tourists and locals sip iced coffees at the pavement tables of the Gran Caffe restaurant and bar. Its owner, islander Seltsouk Atakli, is laughing and joking with customers. ‚ÄúKeep smiling is what I always say,‚Äù he shrugs. ‚ÄúBut sometimes a smile is not enough.‚Äù As the latest proposed deal to avoid Greece‚Äôs bankruptcy threatens to unravel, a row is raging on Rhodes and several other Greek islands over fears that they are being unfairly targeted. To the surprise of locals, one of the government‚Äôs proposals to its creditors is to get rid of the special lower VAT rate that applies to a number of Greece‚Äôs far-flung islands ‚Äì not just the famous tourist destinations of Mykonos and Santorini, but scores of little-known smaller islands with ageing and depleting populations.
Greece has thousands of islands scattered over a vast area, fewer than 250 of which are populated. Some of those furthest from the mainland have long depended on a special VAT rate 30% lower than elsewhere, which offsets the high cost of having to ship basic everyday goods long distances. Rhodes, Greece‚Äôs fourth largest island, is a case in point, along with all the other Dodecanese islands scattered at the country‚Äôs furthest south-eastern point between Crete and Turkey. Sunbathers on Rhodes can contemplate the nearby Turkish coast from their loungers, while Athens is more than 230 nautical miles away. Everything from milk to medicines has to be transported here. Many other countries have similar reduced VAT schemes to support isolated territories, such as Spain‚Äôs concessions to the Canary Islands. Indeed, for years the special rate for far-flung Greek islands was considered untouchable. In January‚Äôs Greek election, the radical left party Syriza topped the poll in Rhodes, where islanders believed the special lower VAT rate was protected. A Syriza spokesman this week acknowledged that scrapping the special VAT rate would have a repercussion on island residents. Syriza‚Äôs coalition partner, the rightwing Independent Greeks party ‚Äì keen to court voters on islands ‚Äì has vowed this week to oppose any abolition of the special island rate ‚Äúeven if the government falls‚Äù. In his restaurant, Atakli says: ‚ÄúAt least 90% of my supplies have to be brought in from the mainland. Vegetables are grown here but all milk, cheese ‚Äì even olive oil ‚Äì has to be shipped very far, it‚Äôs expensive. I‚Äôll have no choice but to absorb this VAT rise myself. I‚Äôm not going to put up prices in the restaurant. It‚Äôs more important for me to keep my customers. I‚Äôll take a cut on profits.‚Äù
But his profits are already down after years of crisis. He has cut staff, negotiated staggered payments for his many unpaid bills and is spending less on his family, clothes and supermarket shop. His restaurant, which has been going for 25 years, once flourished. ‚ÄúThat seems like a fairy tale now,‚Äù he said. The VAT issue is about more than economics; it‚Äôs about keeping Greece‚Äôs islands populated. Atakli, a proud islander from a Muslim family going back generations on Rhodes, is a symbol of its centuries-old multiculturalism. Islanders across Greece are crucial to the country‚Äôs rich cultural identity. With many of the poorer and smaller islands losing services, jobs and seeing their younger generations leave for the mainland, there are fears that their populations will gradually decline, leaving ghost villages and tourist ghettos. Politically, Greece has always seen it as important to keep up the population of the Aegean islands that face Turkey. Rhodes, which has a healthy population of 100,000 and welcomes around 2 million visitors a year, is at the richer end of the island spectrum. It has always been famous for a range of tourism, from world heritage sites to drunken teenage bar crawls. But tinier islands face harder challenges and could be far worse hit by the VAT proposals. Beyond Rhodes is the small remote island of Halki, with an ageing population of only a few hundred that swells slightly with tourists in the summer months. It relies on all products coming in by boat, even drinking water, which arrives by tanker every week. Many islands in Greece are particularly difficult to reach, most do not have airports, and sea connections can be cut off by bad weather in winter.
In her Rhodes hardware store, Maria Kantarzoglou wears a T-shirt saying: ‚ÄúAll is fair in love and war.‚Äù But there is no fairness being applied when it comes to taxation for islanders, she says. ‚ÄúPeople here feel forgotten by Athens. Everyone will be affected by this, and life here is already more expensive than on the mainland. It costs me more to travel to Athens than it costs a tourist to come from Amsterdam to Rhodes for a week with everything included. ‚ÄúI love my island and I‚Äôd never leave,‚Äù she adds, but her brother, feeling the economic squeeze at the start of the crisis, has already moved to the Netherlands and found work in a spare-parts company. Tourism is Greece‚Äôs biggest industry and Rhodes is one of the country‚Äôs largest tourist destinations. If VAT goes up, it could have repercussions on the holiday trade. Already, amid uncertainty over a bailout deal, tourist numbers to Rhodes have slightly declined. Holidaymakers also generally spend less than they used to. In the warren of shops and tavernas of Rhodes‚Äôs old town, cheap prices are a key draw. ‚ÄúNot expensive!‚Äù shout waiters outside restaurants. Bars proudly display their ‚Äúcheap drinks‚Äù list. The tanks lined up for fish pedicures and the shops selling novelty T-shirts with slogans such as ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need Google ‚Äì my wife knows everything‚Äù also claim to give tourists a better deal than elsewhere. Islanders point out that other countries competing with Greece for tourism, including Italy, Spain and France, already have special lower tourism VAT rates, and nearby Turkey and Cyprus have an even lower sales tax. Rhodes business leaders warn of a ‚Äútriple blow‚Äù to the island because the bailout proposals also include other potential VAT rises on the restaurant sector and hotels. At a vast hotel and spa along the coast from Rhodes town, the manager, who does not want to be named, says: ‚ÄúThe situation is still vague and we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen. It‚Äôs frustrating because this is the time of year we carry out our tendering for next season ‚Äì we‚Äôre unable to prepare our price lists for next year because we don‚Äôt know how VAT will change. It‚Äôs difficult. Most people won‚Äôt have any choice but to put their prices up. We‚Äôll have to find a way to survive.‚Äù
Pappou Ioannis, president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Dodecanese, tells the Guardian that the special lower VAT rate in the Aegean islands is ‚Äúnot a privilege but a necessity‚Äù. Abolishing that rate, he says, will prove to be ‚Äúthe tombstone of any productive activity in our islands‚Äù. Ioannis warns of sabotage against the tourist industry and says entrepreneurship on the island ‚Äúwill be the equivalent to a crime‚Äù. Crucially, he says, a VAT change will have a massive and ‚Äútragic‚Äù effect on the lives of islanders themselves. ‚ÄúLife for the islanders is very difficult due to the particularities of island territory,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúEven islands that are considered rich have huge gaps in key areas such as health, education and infrastructure. The increase in VAT rates will further complicate islanders‚Äô lives. The increase in cost for crucial items and services will be a heavy blow, especially for the vulnerable social groups ‚Äì the people with lower income, pensioners and the unemployed. ‚ÄúThe damage to the economy and to Rhodes society will be tragic, as none of the industry sectors will remain unaffected. Unfortunately, recent years have proven that this is a road that can only lead to even greater recession.‚Äù
Without businesses absorbing the costs themselves, a VAT rise on far-flung Greek islands could see the price of holiday packages rise by approximately 10%, according to Michael Arghyrou, reader in economics at Cardiff University. ‚ÄúThat is not a negligible amount of money, particularly since there is strong competition from tourism in countries such as Spain, Portugal or Turkey,‚Äù he says. Arghyrou would rather see reform of the most bloated non-essential areas of Greece‚Äôs public sector than VAT rises that push up prices for everyone, regardless of wealth. Wandering through Rhodes old town, Liina Tiiter, an engineer on holiday from Estonia, says she is drawn to the island by the sunshine and the historic sites. Looking up towards the medieval fortifications as they catch the evening sun, she adds: ‚ÄúEven if prices did go up, I‚Äôd still make the journey to see this.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T13:58:34Z,world,World news,"Calais: Britain willing to send more security assistance, says Cameron","David Cameron has moved to ease tensions with France over the migrant crisis in Calais, calling for an end to the finger-pointing over who is to blame and signalling that Britain is prepared to contribute more resources if necessary. The UK prime minister described the ‚Äútotally unacceptable scenes‚Äù after migrants took the opportunity of a strike by French ferry workers to try to board lorries bound for the UK. Asked what the UK was planning to do about the crisis, Cameron said Britain must work more closely with the French, tackle the people-smuggling gangs in north Africa and do more to make Britain a less attractive place for migrants. The mayor of Calais, Natacha Bouchart, told French radio on Tuesday that Britain had ‚Äúnot offered a penny‚Äù to help the authorities in Calais ease the pressure caused by the increasing number of migrants arriving in the town as they attempt to travel to Britain.
But Cameron, speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, struck a conciliatory tone. ‚ÄúThere is no point in either side trying to point the finger of blame at each other. This is a strong partnership that we have in place and we should keep it that way,‚Äù he said. He said the UK would provide more security assistance to French authorities if necessary, including sending more personnel and sniffer-dog teams. He also said more needed to be done with other EU countries to prevent migrants from attempting the journey to Europe in the first place. ‚ÄúThirdly, we‚Äôve got to do more to make sure Britain is a less easy place for illegal migrants to come to and work in. That‚Äôs what our immigration bill is all about,‚Äù he added. James Brokenshire, the immigration minister, had earlier been more defensive about the UK‚Äôs role, saying it was ultimately up to the French to police their own soil. The home secretary, Theresa May, said British and French authorities had stopped ‚Äúsignificant numbers‚Äù of migrants climbing aboard lorries in Calais and entering the UK in the last two days. She said the UK border force had put in place ‚Äútried and tested‚Äù contingency plans to deal with chaotic scenes that led to the Channel tunnel being closed.
Sir Peter Ricketts, the British ambassador to France, said the UK had already offered more assistance. ‚ÄúWe have put ‚Ç¨15m (¬£10.6m) on the table to improve security and movement at the port, with the installing of barriers, he told La Voix du Nord newspaper. ‚ÄúIn response to a request by the French authorities, there is now direct communication between our officials and migrants to explain to them that there is no El Dorado there [in the UK]. We have made it hard to get benefits and there‚Äôs a planned law against illegal work, which will allow for the salary of a worker in this situation to be seized.‚Äù The heightened diplomatic tension came amid disruption caused by striking employees of French firm MyFerryLink, whose industrial action forced the closure of the Channel tunnel and led to the cancellation of train and ferry services. Travel chaos was subsiding on Wednesday as cross-Channel services resumed, but authorities in Calais continued to grapple with desperate migrants seeking to take advantage of the disruption. One group of young men ‚Äì some as young as 15 ‚Äì were chased away by a lorry driver as they tried to break into his truck. ‚ÄúThis is terrible, worse than it‚Äôs ever been,‚Äù said the driver from Poland as the queue inched forward. ‚ÄúIt has been like this all night, it has been very difficult.‚Äù Another migrant managed to break the cord on the back of a nearby truck and was trying to clamber on board before he was confronted by the French driver. Neither man wanted to talk.
A 17-year-old Eritrean man sitting by the side of the motorway slip road said he and his friends had been up all night trying to get into lorries bound for the UK. ‚ÄúMany people have been trying, but it is very difficult. We are very tired now.‚Äù Emmanuel Agius, a deputy at Calais town hall, claimed that the British PM was in danger of sparking a diplomatic incident. ‚ÄúDavid Cameron says he does not want these migrants, he doesn‚Äôt want to take responsibility but the UK is part of the EU and it cannot continue to try and play two roles,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt is not acceptable to say: ‚ÄòWe are insular, we are an island and we will only be part of Europe how and when we want ‚Äì you Europeans just deal with it.‚Äô That is too easy. If he continues to speak in that way then he is in danger of creating a diplomatic incident.‚Äù For there to be a lasting solution to the crisis Europe had to work together, and that included the UK, Agius added. ‚ÄúIf the UK and Mr Cameron want to leave Europe, then at least the situation would be clear and precise and in that case the British could have their border back in the UK instead of here in Calais,‚Äù he said. Agius said migrants have ‚Äúone idea in their heads and that is to cross the 30km to Dover for a better life in the UK‚Äù. He said the UK ‚Äúneeds to stop ignoring that reality and take responsibility‚Äù. More resources will be put into screening arrivals at Dover, Brokenshire said, adding that extra French police officers were being deployed in Calais to deal with the problem. He said: ‚ÄúWe are putting additional resourcing into the port of Dover to enhance screenings and detections there so that we‚Äôre looking at this on both sides of the Channel.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúWe have been advised that the French authorities are sending further policing to deal with law and order issues, and we will be keeping in close contact with them in the hours ahead.‚Äù Additional reporting by Kim Willsher in Paris",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T13:30:45Z,world,World news,Did the Supreme Leader just torpedo the nuclear talks?,"Iran‚Äôs Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, made a speech last night to mark Ramadan, and to make a stand a few days before the June 30 deadline for completing a final, comprehensive deal with world powers on his country‚Äôs nuclear programme. As is his wont, Khamenei framed the issue in terms of Iranian defiance in the face of an American-led campaign to destroy the country‚Äôs nuclear programme and thereby hobble Iran as a regional power. But he also went into detail, setting down apparent red lines on what Iran would accept. What has drawn attention is that his remarks seem to contradict parts of the provisional outline deal clinched in Lausanne at the beginning of April, as a waystation to a comprehensive agreement due to be finalised on Tuesday. In particular, he said this (according to a Press TV translation): The lifting of sanctions must not be contingent on the implementation of Iran‚Äôs undertakings. They should not say that you (Iran) should fulfill your commitments and the [International Atomic Energy] Agency (IAEA) should then verify it in order for the sanctions to be lifted. We do not accept this issue at all. In his speech addressed to senior figures from government and parliament, Khamenei stipulated that economic and banking sanctions imposed on Iran by the UN and the US must be lifted on the day the agreement is signed. This appears to cut against the whole underlying ethos of the agreement under negotiation - sanctions relief in return for verified cuts in the Iranian programme. Certainly, it is a reading of a deal that is at odds with Lausanne parameters as portrayed by the US state department, which talks about the centrality of IAEA verification. Similarly, the Supreme Leader said that Iran would not accept restrictions of its research and development work ‚Äúfor ten or twelve years‚Äù. On the face of it, this could represent a rejection of the part of the Lausanne deal that would prevent the use of new model centrifuges for enriching uranium for a decade. Mark Fitzpatrick, the director of the non-proliferation and disarmament department at the Institute for International Strategic Studies described the speech as ‚Äúvery unhelpful‚Äù with ‚Äúmore and more unacceptable red lines, walking back the Lausanne accord‚Äù. I have seen shades of pink in previous statements, but they seem to be more clearly red this time. If he is serious there can be no deal. However, Iran experts have since been quick to stress that the Supreme Leader‚Äôs previous interventions have appeared similarly obdurate on the surface yet did not impede the conclusion of the preliminary Lausanne deal. They argue these speeches reflect Khamenei‚Äôs need to bring along conservative constituencies in Iran to ensure they are on board for any deal. Ariane Tabatabai, a visiting assistant professor at Georgetown University said: It‚Äôs important not to read between the lines of what the Supreme Leader says too much. He‚Äôs trying to balance several audiences...So far, what many interpreted as clear and strict red lines have been neither clear nor strict Ellie Geranmayeh, at the European Council on Foreign Relations, argued that if the Supreme Leader really wanted to sink the negotiations, we would have known about it before now. The stakes are too high for Khamenei to risk losing the blame-game at this stage - if he really wanted to derail the talks, the best exit strategy would have been after the GOP Letter before the Lausanne agreement. Had he intervened at that stage, he could have broken the consensus amongst the P5+1 on sanctions. If Iran gets blamed for failure at this stage it gets nothing by way of economic relief after having frozen its nuclear programme for 18 months - and the leadership knows that. She added that the Supreme Leader‚Äôs speech also repeated his support for the Iranian negotiators headed by foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. Khamenei called the Iranian diplomats at the talks ‚Äúbrave and faithful‚Äù, though he did add that they ‚Äúmay possibly make some mistakes‚Äù. No doubt those are words echoing in Zarif‚Äôs mind as he heads for Vienna this weekend for the last stretch of an almighty diplomatic marathon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T13:12:36Z,world,World news,"Grand Cafe, favoured haunt of Oslo artists, to close after 140 years","For Henrik Ibsen it was a second home, a place where he could always be found from precisely 1.20pm-2pm and 6pm-7.30pm each day, and for a generation of Norwegian artists it was the favoured watering hole in the capital. Edvard Munch painted Ibsen sitting by the window with a newspaper. Now Oslo‚Äôs Grand Cafe, founded in 1874, has announced it will close on 1 September, delivering a shock to the city and raising fears that this venue steeped in cultural history could become a Starbucks, McDonald‚Äôs or H&M. ‚ÄúWe have turned over every stone to find a sustainable solution for continued operations, but the deficits are so large that we cannot count on a return to profitability,‚Äù the cafe‚Äôs operator, Pandox, said in a statement. Forty staff will lose their jobs.
The cafe lost 8m krone (¬£650,000) last year, Pandox said ‚Äì almost half the losses made by the Grand Hotel, of which it is part. The company wants to invest 150m krone in an upgrade of the hotel, and efforts to turn the cafe around have all failed. The Grand, on Karl Johans Street, has faced tough competition from new upmarket venues in Oslo‚Äôs fashionable Aker Brygge district on the waterfront. ‚ÄúTime has sadly run out for the Grand Cafe,‚Äù Pandox‚Äôs vice-president, Helge Krogsb√∏l, told Norwegian media. ‚ÄúThere are certainly many who would argue that what we are doing is absolutely horrible. For there are many who have a strong emotional relationship to the cafe ‚Ä¶ But we have not been able to find a profitable solution. We must call a spade a spade and close down. It is very sad.‚Äù Ibsen, whose major works include Hedda Gabler and A Doll‚Äôs House, fell into a routine of visiting the Grand Cafe when he returned home to Norway‚Äôs capital, then known as Kristiania, in 1891 after making a reputation abroad as a brilliant observer of the 19th-century society. His usual order was an open sandwich, a beer and a schnapps. He was sometimes joined by Munch, best known for his Scream paintings.
On one wall of the Grand is a 1920s mural portraying the two men among the Kristiania Bohemians, a group of artists who patronised the cafe in the late 1800s, by Per Krogh, the Norwegian painter known for the mural he created for the UN security council chamber in New York. Fabian Stang, Oslo‚Äôs major, was sanguine about the closure. ‚ÄúWe must realise that things come and go, and for every restaurant Oslo loses we get 10 new ones, so we cannot exactly complain,‚Äù he told Dagbladet newspaper. But Lars Hansen, director of Oslo‚Äôs city museum, which has Ibsen‚Äôs chair that was reserved for him at the cafe, said it would be a big loss. The Grand was one of Oslo‚Äôs first modern cafes in the international style, with mirrors, marble tables and carved furniture, he said. The city‚Äôs heritage committee said it would look into the possibility of preserving the cafe in its original form.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T13:00:51Z,world,World news,"Majority of illegal migrants enter UK via Heathrow on a visa, not on a lorry","The shocking television footage of desperate asylum seekers and others trying to jump on the slow-moving, queueing lorries on the approach roads at Calais were a sharp reminder of the scenes 15 years ago when the tabloids, daily in the grip of invasion panic, complained of ‚Äúillegals flooding Calais‚Äù in their efforts to come to ‚Äúsoft-touch Britain‚Äù. In fact, the migrants are just one element in the chaos created by striking French port workers that will fade once Calais gets back to normal. The home secretary reassured MPs that contingency plans had kicked in to ensure that there had been no mass break-in to Britain. The numbers of those trying to cross the Channel from Calais fluctuate according to the international situation, and with the largest refugee crisis since the second world war currently playing itself out across the Mediterranean, in north Africa and in the Middle East, it is not surprising that more than a few thousand have gathered in the port. Millions have already been spent on building bigger fences at Calais to ensure that the port does not become a back door, or indeed a front door, for illegal entrants into Britain. But the truth is that the vast majority of illegal migrants in Britain are not smuggled across the Channel in the back of a lorry, but enter Britain perfectly legally through the front door on a plane through Heathrow on a visa. If you want to tackle the problem of illegal immigration, then better to tackle those overstayers than the few thousand who might make it across the Channel each year.
Anyway many of those in Calais are asylum seekers who have fled from countries such as Syria, Eritrea and Afghanistan. Some will have come direct from Italy or Greece having made it across the Mediterranean. Theresa May is right that the root cause lies in the Mediterranean migrant crisis. This week‚Äôs EU summit will see the European Union agreeing a programme to share responsibility for just 60,000 migrants and refugees over the next two years. There are already more than 1.7 million Syrian refugees in Turkey alone. The United Nations has said in the face of this crisis, the European Union could easily take one million refugees. All 28 EU countries will agree to take some refugees under this scheme, but the numbers fall far short of the numbers in need of international protection. Britain last Friday dropped its reluctance to take any at all and said it would resettle a few hundred more Syrians. The replacement of the former flagship, HMS Bulwark, by the small survey ship, HMS Enterprise, this week means that Britain has also scaled back to almost next to nothing its contribution to the EU humanitarian effort to save the lives of those trying to cross the Mediterranean. The home secretary says she wants to break the linkbetween getting into the boats and reaching Europe. HMS Enterprise is to take part in an eight-strong EU naval fleet to target the smugglers‚Äô boats. This will be backed by a new taskforce of intelligence, policing and asylum experts to smash the people smuggling networks. The EU summit this week will agree a timetable for the new force to seize their boats with a possible military operation to destroy them in time if the Libyans‚Äô consent is ever obtained. Events are moving rapidly in the face of this refugee crisis, and the British and European response is equally rapidly moving from humanitarian solutions, based on international protection, to declaring a war on traffickers based on military solutions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T10:00:08Z,world,World news,Brazilian indigenous leader to address UN council in effort to stop dam,"The Brazilian government has violated its own constitution and international law by developing hydroelectric power plants in the Amazon, according to an indigenous leader due to address the 29th United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva on Wednesday afternoon.
Ademir Kaba Munduruku will argue that the Brazilian government failed to consult affected communities ahead of its construction of the Belo Monte dam, and that it is repeating this failure over its plans for another dam across the river Tapaj√≥s. The right to free, prior and informed consultation is enshrined in Brazil‚Äôs constitution. It is also an integral part of the International Labour Organization Convention 169, and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, to which Brazil is a signatory. Speaking to the Guardian ahead of his speech, Ademir Kaba said the Munduruku people had handed the government a protocol establishing the terms of a consultation process in January, but it had yet to receive a response. ‚ÄúOnly after consulting all 126 villages that run the length of the Tapaj√≥s should the government make a decision about whether to go ahead,‚Äù he said. The Munduruku are the largest indigenous group in the Tapaj√≥s basin, with around 13,000 living alongside the river. Ademir Kaba accused the government of a disproportionate use of force ‚Äì including a police raid on the village of Teles Pires in 2012 during which the indigenous leader Adenilson Kirixi Munduruku was shot dead ‚Äì and he warned that if necessary, the Munduruku were prepared to use force to resist the government‚Äôs plans.
‚ÄúIf the government does not engage in dialogue with us, if it does not use the tools of democracy, we are prepared to die to stop the building of this dam,‚Äù he said. Originally, the auction to develop the 8,040MW S√£o Luiz do Tapaj√≥s plant, the largest of three dams planned for the river, was scheduled for December 2014. Under pressure from campaigners, the government reversed its decision. But in April this year, Eduardo Braga, the minister of mines and energy, said it could now take place in November or December. While in Europe, Ademir Kaba will also hold talks with representatives of European companies who are involved in the Brazilian government‚Äôs development of the Amazon basin, including EDF, GDF Suez and Alstrom.
The Munduruku leader is being accompanied by Fel√≠cio Pontes, a public prosecutor from the state of Par√° who has filed numerous lawsuits over the government‚Äôs violation of human rights and environmental legislation in its development of the Amazon basin. Pontes aims to draw attention to the government‚Äôs frequent use of a legal device dating from the country‚Äôs military dictatorship, the suspens√£o de seguran√ßa (security suspension), which overturns any legal ruling which could potentially ‚Äúharm public order, health, security or the economy‚Äù. Throughout the construction of the Belo Monte dam, the law was repeatedly invoked to overrule legal decisions which challenged the project. Belo Monte, set to be the world‚Äôs fourth-largest hydroelectric plant, is now 77% complete and should start to generate electricity in November. When finished it will be capable of producing 11,000MW of power, enough to fulfil the needs of 60 million people, according to Norte Energia, the consortium building the dam. In 2013, the latest year for which figures were available, around 70% of Brazil‚Äôs electricity was generated from hydroelectric plants. The government plans to build 60 large dams in the Amazon basin over the next 20 years. Brazil‚Äôs secretary general of the presidency, the government body responsible for the consultation process, said: ‚ÄúThe federal government will guarantee the right to prior consultation with the Munduruku people, as set out in ILO Convention 169, for the realisation of the Tapaj√≥s hydroelectric project.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T08:18:33Z,world,World news,UK  taskforce will 'smash' Mediterranean people-smuggling operations,"The government has announced further details of a British law enforcement taskforce it says will tackle the people-smuggling gangs blamed for the migration crisis in the Mediterranean. The 90-strong team, involving officers from the National Crime Agency, UK Border Force, immigration enforcement staff and the Crown Prosecution Service, will be responsible for pursuing and disrupting the operations of people smugglers paid by desperate migrants hoping to reach Europe. Some of the officers will be based with Europol in Sicily and The Hague, with the rest on standby in the UK ready to deploy to the region when required, Downing Street said. The team is expected to work with countries in the Horn of Africa and along the smugglers‚Äô route to strengthen the capabilities of the authorities there to deal with the problem. A Number 10 spokesman said: ‚ÄúWe have got to do more to break the link between getting on a boat in the Med and getting settlement in Europe. Otherwise these vast numbers will just keep on coming. That‚Äôs why the government is setting up a dedicated law enforcement team to tackle organised immigration crime in the Med region. ‚ÄúAround 90 officers will be deployed in the UK, the Mediterranean and Africa to pursue and disrupt these organised crime groups profiting from the people-smuggling trade. They will exploit every opportunity at source, in transit countries and in Europe to smash the gangs‚Äô criminal operations and better protect the UK from this threat.‚Äù Details of the taskforce were announced as it emerged that the job of HMS Enterprise, the Royal Navy‚Äôs replacement for HMS Bulwark on duty in the Mediterranean, will not be to rescue migrants but a military mission to ‚Äúgo after the human smugglers and traffickers‚Äù. Defence sources said Enterprise, a oceanographic survey ship a fifth the size of Bulwark, would not be part of Operation Triton, the EU search and rescue effort that has plucked thousands of migrants out of the sea from boats trying to make the crossing from Libya. The ship will come under the command of a separate EU naval force and charged with a mission to identify, capture and dispose of boats used or suspected of being used by smugglers. It will be one of eight vessels, including two submarines, in the force led by the Italian aircraft carrier Cavour. The EU summit later this week will be asked to approve a timetable for the move from the first, intelligence-gathering, phase of the operation to the second phase of search and seizure of smugglers‚Äô boats. The chancellor, George Osborne, told MPs last Wednesday that Britain would continue to ‚Äúplay its full part in the search and rescue operation in the Mediterranean‚Äù when Labour challenged him over Bulwark‚Äôs replacement. The deployment of Enterprise was announced quietly over the weekend. Bulwark, which has saved more than 3,000 lives since it joined the search and rescue operation at the beginning of May, is a 19,500-tonne assault ship and landing dock with a crew of 325. Enterprise is a 3,700-ton vessel with a crew of 60 to 70 and capable of carrying only 120 people. The MoD anticipates that she will be involved in the EU operation against the smugglers until the autumn. Defence sources say that the new EU naval force will have ‚Äúa certain remit‚Äù to respond to Italian requests to take part in search and rescue operations, but that Enterprise would not take part in ‚Äúproactive‚Äù searches and would be involved in rescue only if she was the best placed vessel in the area. The ship will also be under the general maritime duty to respond to any vessel in distress. A British Merlin helicopter will still be part of Operation Triton, and two small Border Force or HMRC cutters will take part in the operations of the EU‚Äôs border agency, Frontex. ‚ÄúHMS Enterprise is well suited to the next stage of the EU‚Äôs operation, which aims to go after the criminal gangs and smugglers,‚Äù said an MoD spokesman. ‚ÄúThe ship will contribute to the broad maritime capabilities desired by the Italian operational commander and will assist in the understanding and picture-building of how the operation will go on to seize and disrupt the assets of smugglers.‚Äù The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, said that as a multi-role survey ship, Enterprise was well placed to ‚Äúprovide important assistance as we now move into this next stage‚Äù. The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, called for an urgent clarification of the new British role in the Mediterranean. ‚ÄúLast week George Osborne said that taking people out of the sea and preventing them from drowning was essential for a humanitarian nation. Those words seem to ring hollow when the UK government is now pulling back from full participation in search and rescue,‚Äù she said. She said David Cameron should ‚Äúurgently clarify the UK‚Äôs new role and ensure capability in search and rescue isn‚Äôt being hindered by the decisions of our government‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe should be doing more, not less to stop people drowning in the Mediterranean,‚Äù she added.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T06:51:34Z,world,World news,Tsipras summoned to Brussels for emergency talks over Greek bailout deal,"Greece‚Äôs prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, arrives in Brussels on Wednesday for critical talks with the country‚Äôs creditors as the outlines of the latest proposed deal to avoid bankruptcy threatens to unravel, worsening the crisis. In advance of the third meeting of eurozone finance ministers in less than a week, Tsipras was summoned to the office of Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, to try to thrash out remaining differences.
Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, and Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who runs the Eurogroup committee of finance ministers, are to confront Tsipras about the tax rises and spending cuts he tabled on Monday in the hope of securing more bailout funds for Greece and avoiding a default next week. The Eurogroup meeting on Wednesday is aimed at preparing an agreement that would be rubber-stamped by an EU summit on Thursday, averting the eurozone‚Äôs first default and keeping the currency bloc intact. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs always assuming it even gets as far as being implemented in its current format, which at this point looks unlikely.‚Äù Greek insiders described the Tsipras summons to Brussels as ‚Äúa very critical meeting‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt is not a good sign,‚Äù said veteran political commentator Pavlos Tzimas. As doubts deepened among the creditors, the Greek government is coming under intense domestic political pressure over its concessions. Tsipras faced criticism from within his coalition government over compromise proposals that would raise ‚Ç¨8bn by increasing pension contributions, phasing out early retirement, hiking corporation tax and raising some rates of VAT.
‚ÄúMany MPs, be they on the left or not, are very sceptical about accepting such a programme,‚Äù said Costas Lapavitsas, an economics professor at the University of London who is now an MP for Tsipras‚Äôs leftwing Syriza party. ‚ÄúHow will they explain it to their voters? How will they return to their electoral constituencies and explain this agreement to them?‚Äù The government‚Äôs junior coalition partner, the small, rightwing Independent Greeks party (Anel), added to the complications for Tsipras by warning it would only support an agreement that included some form of debt write-off. Greece‚Äôs creditors are not expected to make such a commitment this week. Panos Kammenos, Anel‚Äôs leader, added that his party would oppose a VAT increase for Greek islands ‚Äúeven if the government falls‚Äù. It is unclear whether Tsipras will be able to contain the dissent or even pass an agreement through parliament, regardless of whether a deal is reached in Brussels.
Any deal would have to be endorsed by a working majority in parliament, with a close Tsipras ally also suggesting that fresh elections or a referendum may be needed if an agreement is not voted through. Alekos Flambouraris, a senior government minister, said: ‚ÄúFor the government to forge ahead in difficult conditions after the agreement and to restart the economy and kickstart the country‚Äôs productive reconstruction, it has to have a unanimous parliamentary group which will put the programme into effect.‚Äù On Tuesday, the ECB agreed to inject nearly ‚Ç¨1bn into the Greek banking system, the third consecutive working day that Greece has received emergency help from the emergency liquidity assistance programme in order to stave off bankruptcy as depositors take billions of euros out of accounts. https://membership.theguardian.com/preview-event/17456530954# The Irish finance minister, Michael Noonan, whose country has successfully completed its bailout programme and returned to growth, warned that emergency funding for Greece‚Äôs banks could be cut off unless a deal is reached soon. The European commission is also dangling the prospect of ‚Ç¨35bn in financial aid for Greece if a deal is made. ‚ÄúI want ordinary Greeks to know we are offering ‚Ç¨35bn to help the economy,‚Äù said Juncker. Join us",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T06:00:04Z,world,World news,The man who sleeps in Hitler‚Äôs bed | Alex Preston,"When he was five years old, Kevin Wheatcroft received an unusual birthday present from his parents: a bullet-pocked SS stormtrooper‚Äôs helmet, lightning bolts on the ear-flaps. He had requested it especially. The next year, at a car auction in Monte Carlo, he asked his multimillionaire father for a Mercedes: the G4 that Hitler rode into the Sudetenland in 1938. Tom Wheatcroft refused to buy it and his son cried all the way home. When Wheatcroft was 15, he spent birthday money from his grandmother on three second world war Jeeps recovered from the Shetlands, which he restored himself and sold for a tidy profit. He invested the proceeds in four more vehicles, then a tank. After Wheatcroft left school at 16, he went to work for a Leicestershire engineering firm, and then for his father‚Äôs construction company. He spent his spare time touring wind-blasted battle sites in Europe and North Africa, searching for tank parts and recovering military vehicles that he would ship home to restore. Wheatcroft is now 55, and according to the Sunday Times Rich List, worth ¬£120m. He lives in Leicestershire, where he looks after the property portfolio of his late father and oversees the management of Donington Park Racetrack and motor museum (which he also owns). The ruling passion of his life, though, is what he calls the Wheatcroft Collection ‚Äì widely regarded as the world‚Äôs largest accumulation of German military vehicles and Nazi memorabilia. The collection has largely been kept in private, under heavy guard, either in the warren of industrial buildings Wheatcroft owns near Market Harborough, or at his homes in Leicestershire, the Charente in south-west France and the Mosel Valley in south-west Germany. There is no official record of the value of Wheatcroft‚Äôs collection, but some estimates place it at over ¬£100m. Wheatcroft is a large, quiet man and a legend in the blokey, Clarksonish world of online military history obsessives. Among the internet tribes of second world war enthusiasts, the Wheatcroft Collection is spoken about in hushed, reverential tones ‚Äì a near-mythical trove of military treasures. Now Wheatcroft, who has long been reluctant to publicise his vast archive of Nazi artefacts, is guardedly opening up his hoard to a wider audience, launching a rather creaky website and putting a handful of vehicles on display at his motor museum. Since that initial stormtrooper‚Äôs helmet, Wheatcroft‚Äôs life has been shaped by his obsession for German military memorabilia. He has travelled the world tracking down items to add to his collection, flying into remote airfields, following up unlikely leads, throwing himself into hair-raising adventures in the pursuit of historic objets. He readily admits that his urge to accumulate has been monomaniacal, elbowing out the demands of friends and family. The French theorist Jean Baudrillard once noted that collecting mania is found most often in ‚Äúpre-pubescent boys and males over the age of 40‚Äù; the things we hoard, he wrote, tend to reveal deeper truths. Wheatcroft‚Äôs father, Tom, a building site worker from Castle Donington, came back from the second world war a hero. He also came back with a wife, Wheatcroft‚Äôs mother, Lenchen, whom he had first seen from the turret of a tank as he pulled into her village in the Harz mountains of Lower Saxony. He made hundreds of millions in the post-war building boom, then spent the rest of his life indulging his zeal for motor cars. He ran Donington Park racetrack and counted Ayrton Senna and Jean Manuel Fangio among his drinking buddies. He had his own race team ‚Äì Wheatcroft Racing ‚Äì and built up the world‚Äôs largest collection of racing cars. In his autobiography, Thunder in the Park, Tom Wheatcroft comes across as a tricky character, a cut-throat haggler and difficult husband. During the 1970s, Lenchen moved out of the family home for eight years after a period when Tom, in the bantery brogue of his memoir, ‚Äúhad not been quite so single-minded as far as my own family life was concerned‚Äù. Lenchen took Kevin and two of his sisters to live in nearby Market Harborough. While there was, eventually, a reconciliation, Kevin spent the majority of his adolescence apart from his war-hero father. Tom supported his son in his early years of collecting; Wheatcroft speaks of his late father as ‚Äúnot just my dad, but also my best friend‚Äù. Tom died in 2009. Despite being one of seven children, Wheatcroft was the sole beneficiary of his father‚Äôs will. He no longer speaks to his siblings. It is hard to say how much the echoes of atrocity that resonate from Nazi artefacts compel the enthusiasts who haggle for and hawk them. The trade in Third Reich antiquities is either banned or strictly regulated in Germany, France, Austria, Israel and Hungary. None of the major auction houses will handle Nazi memorabilia and eBay recently prohibited sales on its site. Still, the business flourishes, with burgeoning online sales and increasing interest from buyers in Russia, America and the Middle East; Wheatcroft‚Äôs biggest rival is a mysterious, unnamed Russian buyer. Naturally, exact figures are hard to come by, but the market‚Äôs annual global turnover is estimated to be in excess of ¬£30m. One of the most-visited websites is run by Holocaust denier David Irving, who in 2009 sold Hitler‚Äôs walking stick (which had previously belonged to Friedrich Nietzsche) for $5,750. Irving has offered strands of Hitler‚Äôs hair for ¬£130,000, and says he is currently verifying the authenticity of charred bones said to be those of Hitler and Eva Braun. There is also a roaring trade in the automobiles of the Third Reich ‚Äì in 2009, one of Hitler‚Äôs Mercedes sold for almost ¬£5m. A signed copy of Mein Kampf will set you back ¬£20,000, while in 2011 an unnamed investor purchased Joseph Mengele‚Äôs South American journals for ¬£300,000.
As the crimes of the Nazi regime retreat further into the past, there seems to be an increasing desperation in the race to get hold of mementos of the darkest chapter of the 20th century. In the market for Nazi memorabilia, two out of the three principal ideologies of the era ‚Äì fascism and capitalism ‚Äì collide, with the mere financial value of these objects used to justify their acquisition, the spiralling prices trapping collectors in a frantic race for the rare and the covetable. In Walden, Henry David Thoreau observed that ‚Äúthe things we own can own us too‚Äù; this is the sense I get with Wheatcroft ‚Äì that he started off building a collection, but that very quickly the collection began building him. * * * When I went to Leicestershire near the end of last year to see the collection, a visibly tired Wheatcroft met me off the train at Market Harborough. ‚ÄúI want people to see this stuff,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no better way to understand history. But I‚Äôm only one man and there‚Äôs just so much of it.‚Äù We drove in his VW truck across flat countryside under a quivering winter sun. He was dressed in a fleece and hiking boots, a fine bushy head of hair streaming from beneath a flat cap, and had a shy, handsome face. Wheatcroft spoke to me in a rolling Midlands accent interrupted every so often by a yawn. He was knackered, he said. He had been trying to set his collection in order, cataloguing late into the night, and making frequent trips to Cornwall, where, at huge expense, he was restoring the only remaining Kriegsmarine S-Boat in existence. He felt he was being pulled in too many directions ‚Äì there were the demands of his restoration projects, the racetrack at Donington Park, his property portfolio, and always, for the collector, a lead to be followed up, another gem to be uncovered. Wheatcroft had recently purchased two more barns and a dozen shipping containers to house his collection. The complex of industrial buildings, stretching across several flat Leicestershire acres, seemed like a manifestation of his obsession ‚Äì just as haphazard, as cluttered and as dark. As we made our way into the first of his warehouses, Wheatcroft stood back for a moment, as if shocked by the scale of what he had accumulated. Many of the tanks before us were little more than rusting husks, ravaged by the years they had spent abandoned in the deserts of North Africa or on the Russian steppes. They jostled each other in the warehouses, spewing out to sit in glum convoys around the complex‚Äôs courtyard. ‚ÄúEvery object in the collection has a story,‚Äù Wheatcroft told me as we made our way under the turrets of tanks, stepping over V2 rockets and U-boat torpedoes. ‚ÄúThe story of the war, then subsequent wars, and finally the story of the recovery and restoration. All that history is there in the machine today.‚Äù We stood beside the muscular bulk of a Panzer IV tank, patched with rust and freckled with bullet holes, its tracks trailing barbed wire. Wheatcroft scratched at the palimpsest of paintwork to reveal layers of colour beneath: its current livery, the duck-egg blue of the Christian Phalangists from the Lebanese civil war, flaking away to the green of the Czech army who used the vehicles in the 1960s and 70s, and finally the original German taupe. The tank was abandoned in the Sinai desert until Wheatcroft arrived on one of his regular shopping trips to the region and shipped it home to Leicestershire. Wheatcroft owns a fleet of 88 tanks ‚Äì more than the Danish and Belgian armies combined. The majority of the tanks are German, and Wheatcroft recently acted as an adviser to David Ayer, the director of Fury (in which Brad Pitt played the commander of a German-based US Sherman tank in the final days of the war). ‚ÄúThey still got a lot of things wrong,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúI was sitting in the cinema with my daughter saying, ‚ÄòThat wouldn‚Äôt have happened‚Äô and ‚ÄòThat isn‚Äôt right.‚Äô Good film, though.‚Äù
Around the tanks sat a number of strange hybrid vehicles with caterpillar tracks at the back, lorry wheels at the front. Wheatcroft explained to me that these were half-tracks, deliberately designed by the Nazis so as not to flout the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which stipulated that the Germans could not build tanks. Wheatcroft owns more of these than anyone else in the world, as well as having the largest collection of Kettenkrads, which are half-motorbike, half-tank, and were built to be dropped out of gliders. ‚ÄúThey just look very cool,‚Äù he said with a grin. Alongside the machines‚Äô stories of wartime escapades and the sometimes dangerous lengths that Wheatcroft had gone to in order to secure them were the dazzling facts of their value. ‚ÄúThe Panzer IV cost me $25,000. I‚Äôve been offered two and a half million for it now. It‚Äôs the same with the half-tracks. They regularly go for over a million each. Even the Kettenkrads, which I‚Äôve picked up for as little as ¬£1,000, go for ¬£150,000.‚Äù I tried to work out the total value of the machines around me, and gave up somewhere north of ¬£50m. Wheatcroft had made himself a fortune, almost without realising it. ‚ÄúEveryone just assumes that I‚Äôve inherited a race track and I‚Äôm a spoilt rich kid who wants to indulge in these toys,‚Äù he told me, a defensive edge to his voice. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like that at all. My dad supported me, but only when I could prove that the collection would work financially. And as a collector, you never have any spare money lying around. Everything is tied up in the collection.‚Äù
Leaning against the wall of one of the warehouses, I spotted a dark wooden door, heavy iron bolts on one side and a Judas window in the centre. Wheatcroft saw me looking at it. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the door to Hitler‚Äôs cell in Landsberg. Where he wrote Mein Kampf. I was in the area.‚Äù A lot of Wheatcroft‚Äôs stories start like this ‚Äì he seems to have a genius for proximity. ‚ÄúI found out that the prison was being pulled down. I drove there, parked up and watched the demolition. At lunch I followed the builders to the pub and bought them a round. I did it three days in a row and by the end of it, I drove off with the door, some bricks and the iron bars from his cell.‚Äù It was the first time he had mentioned Hitler by name. We paused for a moment by the dark door with its black bars, then moved on. Sometimes the stories of search and recovery were far more interesting than the objects themselves. Near the door sat a trio of rusty wine racks. ‚ÄúThey were Hitler‚Äôs,‚Äù he said, laying a proprietary hand upon the nearest one. ‚ÄúWe pulled them out of the ruins of the Berghof [Hitler‚Äôs home in Berchtesgaden] in May 1989. The whole place was dynamited in ‚Äô52, but my friend Adrian and I climbed through the ruins of the garage and down through air vents to get in. You can still walk through all of the underground levels. We made our way by torchlight through laundry rooms, central heating service areas. Then a bowling alley with big signs for Coke all over it. Hitler loved to drink Coke. We brought back these wine racks.‚Äù
Later, among engine parts and ironwork, I came across a massive bust of Hitler, sitting on the floor next to a condom vending machine (‚ÄúI collect pub memorabilia, too,‚Äù Wheatcroft explained). ‚ÄúI have the largest collection of Hitler heads in the world,‚Äù he said, a refrain that returned again and again. ‚ÄúThis one came from a ruined castle in Austria. I bought it from the town council.‚Äù ‚ÄúThings have the longest memories of all,‚Äù says the introduction to a recent essay by Teju Cole, ‚Äúbeneath their stillness, they are alive with the terrors they have witnessed.‚Äù This is what you feel in the presence of the Wheatcroft Collection ‚Äì a sense of great proximity to history, to horror, an uncanny feeling that the objects know more than they are letting on. * * * Wheatcroft‚Äôs home sits behind high walls and heavy gates. There is a pond, its surface stirred by the fingers of a willow tree. A spiky black mine bobs along one edge. The house is huge and modern and somehow without logic, as if wings and extensions have been appended to the main structure willy-nilly. When I visited, it was late afternoon, a winter moon climbing the sky. Behind the house, apple trees hung heavy with fruit. A Krupp submarine cannon stood sentry outside the back door. One of the outer walls was set with wide maroon half-moons of iron work, inlaid with obscure runic symbols. ‚ÄúThey were from the top of the officers‚Äô gates to Buchenwald,‚Äù Wheatcroft told me in an offhand manner. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got replica gates to Auschwitz ‚Äì Arbeit Macht Frei ‚Äì over there.‚Äù He gestured into the gloaming. I had first heard about Wheatcroft from my aunt Gay, who, as a rather half-hearted expat estate agent, sold him a rambling chateau near Limoges. They subsequently enjoyed (or endured) a brief, doomed love affair. Despite the inevitable break-up, my father kept in touch with Wheatcroft and, several years ago, was invited to his home. After a drink in the pub-cum-officers‚Äô mess that Wheatcroft has built adjacent to his dining room, my dad was shown to the guest apartment. It was remarkable, he said, mostly for the furniture. That night, my dad slept in Hermann G√∂ring‚Äôs favourite bed, from Carinhall hunting lodge, made of walnut wood and carved with a constellation of swastikas. There were glassy eyed deer heads and tusky boars on the walls, wolf-skin rugs on the floor. My father was a little spooked, but mostly intrigued. In an email soon after, he described Wheatcroft to me as ‚Äúabsurdly decent, almost unnaturally friendly‚Äù. Darkness had fallen as we stepped into the immense, two-storey barn conversion behind his home. It was the largest of the network of buildings surrounding the house, and wore a fresh coat of paint and shiny new locks on the doors. As we walked inside, Wheatcroft turned to me with a thin smile, and I could tell that he was excited. ‚ÄúI have to have strict rules in my life,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt show many people the collection, because not many people can understand the motives behind it, people don‚Äôt understand my values.‚Äù He kept making these tentative passes at the stigma attached to his obsession, as if at once baffled by those who might find his collection distasteful, and desperately keen to defend himself, and it.
The lower level of the building contained a now-familiar range of tanks and cars, including the Mercedes G4 Wheatcroft saw as a child in Monaco. ‚ÄúI cried and cried because my dad wouldn‚Äôt buy me this car. Now, almost 50 years later, I‚Äôve finally got it.‚Äù On the walls huge iron swastikas hung, street-signs for Adolf Hitler Strasse and Adolf Hitler Platz, posters of Hitler with ‚ÄúEin Volk, Ein Reich, Ein F√ºhrer‚Äù written beneath. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs from Wagner‚Äôs family home,‚Äù he told me, pointing to a massive iron eagle spreading its wings over a swastika. It was studded with bullet holes. ‚ÄúI was in a scrap yard in Germany when a feller came in who‚Äôd been clearing out the Wagner estate and had come upon this. Bought it straight from him.‚Äù We climbed a narrow flight of stairs to an airy upper level, and I felt that I had moved deeper into the labyrinth of Wheatcroft‚Äôs obsession. In the long, gabled hall were dozens of mannequins, all in Nazi uniform. Some were dressed as Hitler Youth, some as SS officers, others as Wehrmacht soldiers. It was bubble still, the mannequins perched as if frozen in flight, a sleeping Nazi Caerleon. One wall was taken up with machine guns, rifles and rocket launchers in serried rows. The walls were plastered with sketches by Hitler, Albert Speer and some rather good nudes by G√∂ring‚Äôs chauffeur. On cluttered display tables sat a scale model of Hitler‚Äôs mountain eyrie the Kehlsteinhaus, a twisted machine gun from Hess‚Äôs crashed plane, the commandant‚Äôs phone from Buchenwald, hundreds of helmets, mortars and shells, wirelesses, Enigma machines, and searchlights, all jostling for attention. Rail after rail of uniforms marched into the distance. ‚ÄúI brought David Ayer in here when he was researching Fury,‚Äù Wheatcroft told me. ‚ÄúHe offered to buy the whole lot there and then. When I said no he offered me 30 grand for this.‚Äù He showed me a fairly ordinary-looking camouflage tunic. ‚ÄúHe knows his stuff.‚Äù We were standing in front of signed photographs of Hitler and G√∂ring. ‚ÄúI think I could give up everything else,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthe cars, the tanks, the guns, as long as I could still have Adolf and Hermann. They‚Äôre my real love.‚Äù I asked Wheatcroft whether he was worried about what people might read into his fascination with Nazism. Other notable collectors, I pointed out, were the bankrupt and discredited David Irving and Lemmy from Mot√∂rhead. ‚ÄúI try not to answer when people accuse me of being a Nazi,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI tend to turn my back and leave them looking silly. I think Hitler and G√∂ring were such fascinating characters in so many ways. Hitler‚Äôs eye for quality was just extraordinary.‚Äù He swept his arm across the army of motionless Nazis surrounding us, taking in the uniforms and the bayonets, the dimly glimmering guns and medals. ‚ÄúMore than that, though,‚Äù he continued, ‚ÄúI want to preserve things. I want to show the next generation how it actually was. And this collection is a memento for those who didn‚Äôt come back. It‚Äôs the sense of history you get from these objects, the conversations that went on around them, the way they give you a link to the past. It‚Äôs a very special feeling.‚Äù We walked around the rest of the exhibition, stopping for a moment by a nondescript green backpack. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a story behind this,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI found a roll of undeveloped film in it. I‚Äôd only bought the backpack to hang on a mannequin, but inside was this film. I had it developed and there were five unpublished pictures of Bergen-Belsen on it. It must have been very soon after the liberation, because there were bulldozers moving piles of bodies.‚Äù * * *
The most treasured pieces of Wheatcroft‚Äôs collection are kept in his house, a maze-like place, low-ceilinged and full of staircases, corridors that turn back on themselves, hidden doorways and secret rooms. As soon as we entered through the back door, he began to apologise for the state of the place. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been trying to get it all in order, but there just aren‚Äôt the hours in the day.‚Äù In the drawing room there was a handsome walnut case in which sat Eva Braun‚Äôs gramophone and record collection. We walked through to the snooker room, which housed a selection of Hitler‚Äôs furniture, as well as two motorbikes. The room was so cluttered that we could not move further than the doorway. ‚ÄúI picked up all of Hitler‚Äôs furniture at a guesthouse in Linz,‚Äù Wheatcroft told me. ‚ÄúThe owner‚Äôs father‚Äôs dying wish had been that a certain room should be kept locked. I knew Hitler had lived there and so finally persuaded him to open it and it was exactly as it had been when Hitler slept in the room. On the desk there was a blotter covered in Hitler‚Äôs signatures in reverse, the drawers were full of signed copies of Mein Kampf. I bought it all. I sleep in the bed, although I‚Äôve changed the mattress.‚Äù A shy, conspiratorial smile. We made our way through to the galleried dining room, where a wax figure of Hitler stood on the balcony, surveying us coldly. There was a rustic, beer-hall feel to the place. On the table sat flugelhorns and euphoniums, trumpets and drums. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got the largest collection of Third Reich military instruments in the world,‚Äù Wheatcroft told me. Of course he did. There was Mengele‚Äôs grandfather clock, topped with a depressed-looking bear. ‚ÄúI had trouble getting that out of Argentina. I finally had it smuggled out as tractor parts to the Massey-Ferguson factory in Coventry.‚Äù Wheatcroft briefly opened a door to show the pub he had built for himself. Even here there was a Third Reich theme ‚Äì the cellar door was originally from the Berghof. The electricity was off in one wing of the house, and we made our way in dim light through a conservatory where rows of Hitler heads stared blindly across at each other. Every wall bore a portrait of the F√ºhrer, or of G√∂ring, until the two men felt so present and ubiquitous that they were almost alive. In a well at the bottom of a spiral staircase, Wheatcroft paused beneath a full-length portrait of Hitler. ‚ÄúThis was his favourite painting of himself, the one used for stamps and official reproductions.‚Äù The F√ºhrer looked peacockish and preening, a snooty tilt to his head. We climbed the stairs to find more pictures of Hitler on the walls, swastikas and iron crosses, a faintly Egyptian statuette given by Hitler to Peron, an oil portrait of Eva Braun signed by Hitler. Paintings were stacked against walls, bubble wrap was everywhere. We picked our way between the artefacts, stepping over statuary and half-unpacked boxes. I found myself imagining the house in a decade‚Äôs time, when no doors would open, no light come in through the windows, when the collection would have swallowed every last corner, and I could picture Wheatcroft, quite happy, living in a caravan in the garden. We passed along more shadowy corridors, through a door hidden in a bookshelf and up another winding staircase, until we found ourselves in an unexceptional bedroom, a single unshaded light in the ceiling illuminating piles of uniforms. On the walls of the room were a host of gaudy naif paintings and objects in display cases. ‚ÄúThey all belonged to the Krays,‚Äù Wheatcroft said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my other great love, the Kray twins.‚Äù There was a chill in the air in this room, under the swinging white light of the lamp. Somehow this collection of gangland trinkets and their casual brutality seemed to undermine the lofty aspirations of the rest of the collection. There was Ronnie‚Äôs death certificate on the wall, his framed false teeth, the gun he used for one of his first murders. On the mantelpiece in the corner of the room there was a small library of books about the twins. Further inspection of the walls revealed the Krays‚Äô cufflinks and rings, spoons from Broadmoor, some early mugshots. Wheatcroft reached into a cupboard and pulled out Hitler‚Äôs white dress suit with careful, supplicatory hands. ‚ÄúI was in Munich with a dealer,‚Äù he said, showing me the tailor‚Äôs label, which read Reichsf√ºhrer Adolf Hitler in looping cursive. ‚ÄúWe had a call to go and visit a lawyer, who had some connection to Eva Braun. In 1944, Eva Braun had deposited a suitcase in a fireproof safe. He quoted me a price, contents unseen. The case was locked with no key. We drove to Hamburg and had a locksmith open it. Inside were two full sets of Hitler‚Äôs suits, including this one, two Sam Browne belts, two pairs of his shoes, two bundles of love letters written by Hitler to Eva, two sketches of Eva naked, sunbathing, two self-propelling pencils. A pair of AH-monogrammed eyeglasses. A pair of monogrammed champagne flutes. A painting of a Vienna cityscape by Hitler that he must have given to Eva. I was in a dream world. The greatest find of my collecting career.‚Äù
Wheatcroft drove me to the station under a wide, star-filled night. ‚ÄúWhen David Ayer offered to buy the collection, I almost said yes,‚Äù he told me, his eyes on the road. ‚ÄúJust so it wouldn‚Äôt be my problem any more. I tried to buy the house in which Hitler was born in Braunau, I thought I could move the collection there, turn it into a museum of the Third Reich. The Austrian government must have Googled my name. They said no immediately. They didn‚Äôt want it to become a shrine. It‚Äôs so hard to know what to do with all the stuff. I really do feel like I‚Äôm just a caretaker until the next person comes along, but I must display it, I must get it out into the public ‚Äì I understand that.‚Äù We pulled into the station car park and, with a wave, he drove off into the night. * * * On the way home I read Wheatcroft‚Äôs father‚Äôs autobiography and then stared out of the train window, feeling the events of the day working themselves upon me. The strange thing was not the weirdness of it all, but the normality. I really don‚Äôt believe that Wheatcroft is anything other than what he seems ‚Äì a fanatical collector. I had expected a closet Nazi, a wild-eyed goosestepper, and instead I had met a man wrestling with a hobby that had become an obsession and was now a millstone. Collecting was like a disease for him, the prospect of completion tantalisingly near but always just out of reach. If he was mad, it wasn‚Äôt the madness of the fulminating antisemite, rather the mania of the collector.
Many would question whether artefacts such as those in the Wheatcroft Collection ought to be preserved at all, let alone exhibited in public. Should we really be queueing up to marvel at these emblems of what Primo Levi called the Nazis‚Äô ‚Äúhistrionic arts‚Äù? It is, perhaps, the very darkness of these objects, their proximity to real evil, that attracts collectors (and that keeps novelists and filmmakers returning to the years 1939-45 for material). In the conflicting narratives and counter-narratives of history, there is something satisfyingly simple about the evil of the Nazis, the schoolboy Manichaeism of the second world war. Later, Wheatcroft would tell me that his earliest memory was of lining up Tonka tanks on his bedroom floor, watching the ranks of Shermans and Panzers and Crusaders facing off against each other, a childish battle of good and evil. After I sent him a copy of Laurent Binet‚Äôs 2010 novel HHhH, a brilliant retelling of the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, one of the principal architects of the Holocaust, Wheatcroft emailed me with news of an astonishing new find in the house of a retired diplomat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd fully intended to ease up on the collecting,‚Äù he told me, ‚Äúto concentrate on cataloguing, on getting the collection out there, but actually some of the things I‚Äôve discovered since I saw you last, I‚Äôve just had to buy. Big-value items, but you just have to forget about that because of the sheer rarity value. It‚Äôs compounded the problem really, because they were all massive things.‚Äù His latest find, he said, was a collection of Nazi artefacts brought to his attention by someone he had met at an auction a few years back. The story is classic Wheatcroft ‚Äì a mixture of luck and happenstance and chutzpah that appears to have turned up objects of genuine historical interest. ‚ÄúThis chap told me that his best friend was a plumber and was working on a big house in Cornwall. The widow was trying to sort things out. The plumber had seen that in the garden there were all sorts of Nazi statues. He sent me a picture of one of the statues, which was a massive 5 ¬Ω foot stone eagle that came from Berchtesgaden. I did a deal and bought it, and after that sale my contact was shown a whole range of other objects by the widow. It turned out that this house was a treasure trove. There‚Äôs an enormous amount I‚Äôm trying to get hold of now. I can‚Äôt say an awful lot, but it‚Äôs one of the most important finds of recent times.‚Äù The owner of the house had just passed away; he was apparently a senior British diplomat who, in his regular trips to Germany in the lead-up to the war, amassed a sizable collection of Nazi memorabilia. He continued to collect after the war had finished, the most interesting items hidden in a safe room behind a secret panel. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs stunning,‚Äù Wheatcroft told me, by telephone, his voice fizzing with excitement. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a series of handwritten letters between Hitler and Churchill. They were writing to each other about the route the war was taking. Discussions of a non-aggression pact. This man had copied things and removed them on a day-to-day basis over the course of the war. A complete breach of the Official Secrets Act, but mindblowing.‚Äù The authenticity of the papers, of course, has not yet been confirmed ‚Äì but if they are real, they could secure Wheatcroft a place in the history books. ‚ÄúAlthough it‚Äôs never been about me,‚Äù he insisted. It seems our meeting in the winter stirred something in Wheatcroft, a realisation that there were duties that came with owning the objects in his collection, obligations to the past and present that had become burdensome to him. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the objects,‚Äù he told me repeatedly, ‚Äúthe history.‚Äù It also seemed as if Wheatcroft‚Äôs halfhearted attempts to bring his collection to a wider public had been given a much-needed fillip. ‚ÄúAn awful lot has changed since I saw you,‚Äù he told me when we spoke in late spring. ‚ÄúIt refocused me, talking to you about it. It made me think about how much time has gone by. I‚Äôve spent, I suppose, 50 years as a collector just plodding along, and I‚Äôve suddenly realised that there‚Äôs more time behind than ahead, and I need to do something about it. I‚Äôve pressed several expensive buttons in order to get some of my more valuable pieces restored. Because you did just make me think what‚Äôs the point of owning these things if no one‚Äôs ever going to see them?‚Äù ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Follow the Long Read on Twitter: @gdnlongread.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T04:34:39Z,world,World news,Colombia acts on massacres ‚Äì punishing whistleblower and promoting officers,"Sergeant Carlos Mora started to suspect there was something fishy about his brigade‚Äôs combat kills when he was posted to an intelligence unit in the region of Norte de Santander in north-east Colombia in 2006. After a sudden spike in the number of ‚Äúpositive‚Äù results, he noticed that the corpses of supposed leftwing guerrillas killed in skirmishes with troops seemed oddly placed, and that weapons found next to the bodies often matched those previously confiscated from common criminals. Mora reported his suspicions to his superior officers, but was met with insults and harassment, and found himself sent on increasingly dangerous assignments. When he took what he knew to the high command in Bogot√° in 2007, the information eventually led to the dismissal of a score of top officials in the US-backed military and helped expose one of the darkest episodes in Colombia‚Äôs half-century civil war. Prosecutors are currently investigating 3,000 cases in which civilians across the country were allegedly murdered by soldiers and presented as combatants to boost body counts, in practice that has come to be known as ‚Äúfalse positives‚Äù. But according to a new report from Human Rights Watch, commanding officers in charge of troops implicated in the scandal have continued to rise through the military ranks without ever being held responsible, while those who denounced the murders have been left in fear for their lives. The cases under investigation were allegedly committed between 2002 and 2008 by soldiers in more than 180 units attached to every army division, pointing to a widespread and systematic practice. However, to date only a few senior officers have been held to account for the crimes, according to the report, released on Wednesday. ‚ÄúFalse positive killings amount to one of the worst episodes of mass atrocity in the western hemisphere in recent years, and there is mounting evidence that many senior army officers bear responsibility,‚Äù said Jos√© Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. ‚ÄúThe army officials in charge at the time of the killings have escaped justice and even ascended to the top of the military command, including the current heads of the army and armed forces,‚Äù Vivanco said. The current armed forces commander, General Juan Pablo Rodr√≠guez, was the head of the army‚Äôs 4th brigade when at least 28 alleged extrajudicial killings were committed by troops. And troops under the command of General Jaime Lasprilla ‚Äì now the top army chief ‚Äì committed at least 48 alleged extrajudicial killings when he led the 9th brigade. Retired General Mario Montoya ‚Äì who led the 4th Brigade when 44 civilians were killed and presented as combat deaths ‚Äì was made chief of the Caribbean Command, and then army commander. During the three years that he was army chief from 2006 to 2008, extrajudicial executions by soldiers peaked, with more than 1,100 alleged false positive killings in 2007 alone, according to prosecution figures cited by Human Rights Watch. On Tuesday, one day before the report was published, the prosecutor‚Äôs office announced it was calling Montoya and two other generals in for questions with respect to false positive killings. Colombia‚Äôs military has maintained that the cases of false positives were regrettable but has denied that they were part of a systematic practice. In a 2009 interview with a small group of foreign journalists General Freddy Padilla, then commander of the armed forces, lamented the damage that false positives had caused to the army‚Äôs image, but considered it a closed episode. ‚ÄúWe are not going to continue to cry over spilt milk,‚Äù he said. Retired general Jaime Ru√≠z, head of the retired officers association, Acore, said there is no evidence that orders or instigation for false positive killings came from commanders. ‚ÄúIt was an organization of subordinates in league with criminals that arranged to pick up people and kill them and present them as combat deaths,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe idea of trying to blame the generals is a strategy that is being skilfully used by the extreme left and some NGOs in a legal war against the military,‚Äù he said. Ruiz claimed that the allegations were a ploy of the leftist Farc guerrillas ‚Äì who have been negotiating a peace deal with the government of President Juan Manuel Santos since 2012. Human rights activists are concerned that a constitutional amendment that aimed to clear the path for a post-conflict period of transitional justice for former combatants could end up benefiting military officers responsible for false positive killings. ‚ÄúColombia needs to ensure that any transitional justice measures enacted as part of a future peace agreement don‚Äôt deny victims‚Äô families justice in false positive cases,‚Äù Vivanco said. In reviewing witness testimonies and criminal case files, Human Rights Watch found indications that generals and other commanders knew or should have known what was going on with their troops, since allegations of false positives were made public since 2004. ‚ÄúCommanders should have been on notice to scrutinise the combat kills more closely,‚Äù says Max Schoening, Human Rights Watch‚Äôs researcher for Colombia and the author of the report. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to believe that so many commanders were being tricked by so many subordinates for so long,‚Äù he says. Retired Lieutenant Colonel Robinson Gonz√°lez del R√≠o, who has publicly admitted responsibility for at least 27 false positive killings, told prosecutors that several generals ‚Äì including current armed forces chief, Juan Pablo Rodr√≠guez ‚Äì knew of and covered up such crimes by his troops, according to Human Rights Watch. Barrag√°n is now the subject of an investigation by prosecutors but has not been charged. Gonz√°lez del R√≠o and another senior officer also told prosecutors that as army chief Montoya ‚Äúpressured subordinate commanders to increase body counts, punished them for failing to do so, and was the principal ‚Äòmotivator‚Äô for false positives‚Äù, the report says. The Colombian military has received billions of dollars in American aid, training and equipment, making it one of the top 10 recipients of US assistance worldwide. US law, however, prohibits aid to foreign military units that violate human rights with impunity. Human Rights Watch called on the US government to suspend the part of military aid to Colombia subject to human rights conditions. ‚ÄúThe safeguard mechanisms have evidently failed,‚Äù said Vivanco. Senator Patrick Leahy, who sponsored the law conditioning aid, said he was troubled by the report. ‚ÄúAs we provided billions of dollars in aid to the Colombian army over many years, its troops systematically executed civilians. Worse yet, the officers who were in charge have escaped justice, and some remain in senior positions of authority,‚Äù he said in emailed comments. ‚ÄúUnless Colombia‚Äôs military leaders are people of integrity, it will be difficult to continue to support an institution that engaged with impunity in a pattern of gross violations of human rights,‚Äù Leahy said. For Sgt Mora, integrity meant not agreeing to kill innocent civilians and not covering it up. After denouncing the murders, Mora ‚Äì an intelligence specialist ‚Äì was relegated to managing the paintball field at an army social club. A month ago he was informed that he faces disciplinary sanctions for not upholding international human rights agreements. He believes the punishment was retaliation for speaking to the media. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the one defending human rights and trying to clear the reputation of the army and they accuse me,‚Äù Mora says. ‚ÄúWho can understand that?‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-24T04:00:01Z,world,World news,Palestine prepares to submit file that could see Israeli officials indicted,"Between 10 and 11 o‚Äôclock on Thursday morning ‚Äì if all goes according to schedule ‚Äì the Palestinian foreign minister, Riyad al-Maliki, will arrive with a delegation at the office of the prosecutor of the international criminal court in The Hague. In an unassuming modern suite of offices in the ICC‚Äôs white tower block, he will hand over a file running to hundreds of pages. Those documents describe to prosecutors for the first time in detail the Palestinian complaint against Israel for alleged breaches of international law, including serious war crimes. In doing so al-Maliki will set in motion a chain of events that could eventually see senior Israeli military and political officials indicted for breaches of international law. The presentation of the Palestinian submission to the ICC will be given added impetus as it follows hard on the heels of the UN Human Rights Council‚Äôs report on last summer‚Äôs war in Gaza on Monday, which accused both Israel and Hamas of potential war crimes and called for those responsible to be ‚Äúbrought to justice‚Äù. Previewing the contents of the submission last week, Palestinian official Ammar Hijazi said it would detail alleged violations of international law by Israel and the Israel Defence Forces. Hijazi stated that the file ‚Äúdraws a grim picture of what Israel is doing and why we think that there are reasonable grounds ‚Ä¶ for the prosecutor to start investigations.‚Äù The ICC chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda must decide based on the complaint whether to order a preliminary examination and then a full criminal investigation. And as states themselves cannot be indicted, only individuals, she will also have to determine which Israelis can potentially be held culpable. Palestinian officials have made clear that even if Bensouda herself decides not to move to the next stage, they reserve the right to make their own formal criminal complaint as they are entitled as members of the ICC. Broken down into three main categories of complaint, the whole file is introduced by a short narrative running to about 30 pages. One section of the complaint will focus on issues relating to illegal Israeli settlement activity; another the treatment of Palestinian prisoners. A final section deals with last summer‚Äôs war in Gaza. According to Palestinian sources familiar with the submission, which covers the period from 13 June 2014 to 31 May 2015, high profile cases that will be highlighted include the Israeli decision to develop a new settlement of 2,600 housing units at Givat Hamatos in east Jerusalem, Israeli settlement building in the Jordan Valley and the killing of four boys on Gaza beach during the war, an incident in which Israel recently cleared itself of criminal culpability. The submission is the Palestinian response to a request for information from Bensouda, not a Palestinian-initiated complaint per se. Handing over the submission would appear to set Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian Authority on a potential collision course with Israel, which imposed punitive measures on the Palestinians when they joined the ICC. For its part Israel both has declined to provide information requested by Bensouda while arguing the ICC has no authority to investigate a Palestinian complaint because, it argues, Palestine is not a state. The report was prepared by a 45-member committee under the chairmanship of chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and including Palestinian ministers, heads of NGOs, members of the security forces and, representing Hamas in Gaza, senior Hamas figure Ghazi Hamid. A team led by five senior international lawyers commissioned by the Palestinian Authority guided the drafting. The submission is exhaustive in detail alleging dozens of violations of international law in everything from Israeli expropriation of Palestinian land, to house demolitions, conditions of detention, to serious breaches of the laws of war. While large sections have been compiled from easily accessible open sources including press reports, reports compiled by both Palestinian and Israeli NGOs and by material published by UN and other organisations, some more sensitive sections were provided by the Palestinian security services. One unpublished source to be submitted along with the main report has been prepared by the Applied Research Institute NGO in Jerusalem and runs to 485 pages alone, dealing largely with settlement issues. Sources told the Guardian its contents of this would largely be echoed in the main submission. The Guardian understands that the main force of the complaint on settlement is based on Article 8 of the ICC‚Äôs Rome statute, in particular section 2, which deals with: ‚ÄúThe transfer, directly or indirectly, by the Occupying Power of parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies, or the deportation or transfer of all or parts of the population of the occupied territory within or outside this territory.‚Äù To that end it includes individual sections on settlement expansion, land confiscation, house demolitions, the destruction of Palestinian olive trees by settlers and Israeli military, as well as settler violence against Palestinians and attacks on religious sites. The submission includes maps and aerial photographs, Israeli government documents and press releases, and ‚Äúevacuation orders‚Äù issued by the Israeli military. The section on settler violence alone details every known alleged settler violation documented during the period running to hundreds of incidents. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt focus in detail on individual cases,‚Äù said one Palestinian official who has been involved in preparing the submission. ‚ÄúThe object is to prove to the court the gravity of the crime. It is about showing a process in the time period covered. If the ICC decides to proceed with an investigation on any of the cases contained we will then provide more detail. This is the first submission but we do not anticipate it being the only one. ‚ÄúWhere it relates to settlement building and colonisation we are not in a position to show everything that has happened going back to 1967, only since 13 June last year, so we need to demonstrate how what is happening is a continuation of a longstanding Israeli policy. Colonisation is a huge issue but it will be the first time that the ICC has been asked to consider colonisation as an issue under international law rather than war crimes and that will be difficult.‚Äù Mustafa Barghouti, one of the members of the committee that drew up the submission told the Guardian he believed the handing over of the file had been supplied added significance following Monday‚Äôs UN Human Rights Council inquiry accusing Israel of potential war crimes in last summer‚Äôs war, not least as the events the UN documented would be included with the file. ‚ÄúWe are dealing with everything. So many different types of crimes. When you look at the Rome statutes there are a very wide range of possibilities for a criminal investigation. What was important for us in the first place was to show that it is systematic. ‚ÄúOne of the questions that people ask is why ‚Äì since it could take a long time to come to a conclusion. My answer is that it will have a long term and an immediate effect. In the long term it is necessary because those who commit war crimes should be brought to justice. In the short term it is about ending Israeli impunity.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-23T19:03:52Z,world,World news,Up to 100 Britons reportedly jailed in France for attempted people smuggling,"As many as 100 Britons are believed to have been jailed in France during the past year for attempting to smuggle migrants across the Channel into the UK. Most of those convicted were motorists who hid migrants in their vehicles in Calais, believing they were unlikely to be caught, it was claimed on Tuesday. Julie Colaert, the deputy public prosecutor for the French port town, told the BBC that smuggling gangs were increasingly recruiting car and van drivers to take migrants to Britain. She said a quarter of those brought to local courts on charges of people smuggling were from the UK, second only to eastern Europe.
Colaert told the BBC‚Äôs File on 4 programme: ‚ÄúIn the past two years we have seen more and more English smugglers. ‚ÄúTrafficking gangs are employing them to take people across in their cars. The migrants pay a lot of money because it‚Äôs sold as guaranteed passage to the UK.‚Äù Smugglers can make up to ‚Ç¨4,000 (¬£2,840) a trip, she said, but face between six months and two years in prison if convicted. Colaert was unable to give exact figures, because it is illegal in France to compile statistics based on nationality, race or religion. However, she estimated that between five and ten UK smugglers were being prosecuted in France a month and up to 100 people from the UK had been convicted and given jail terms by French courts for people smuggling over the previous year. In a recent case highlighted by the BBC, Basir Haji, from Preston, Lancashire, was sentenced to 12 months in prison after being caught at the Calais ferry terminal with two Iraqi men hidden in the boot of his car. He told the court he had agreed to smuggle them across the Channel for ¬£500. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in debt, that‚Äôs why I did it. I‚Äôve been playing a lot of money in the casino,‚Äù Haji told File on 4 before being taken to prison. Haji admitted he was part of a smuggling network and said there were three people above him in the organisation. He claimed the head of the gang was based in England. Colaert said the number of Britons charged with smuggling migrants had leapt in the past two years. Smuggling gangs were shunning lorries, which are closely monitored by police, and choosing cars and vans which they thought were less likely to be stopped and searched, she said. Europol, the EU law enforcement agency, confirmed that organised criminal gangs and opportunistic individuals based in the UK were involved in people smuggling.
French lawyers said local people hit by the continuing economic crisis are also being tempted into the lucrative business, with about 80 individuals having been arrested in the past 12 months. Earlier this year, Emmanuelle Osmont, a lawyer in Boulogne-sur-Mer who has represented several French people accused of helping traffickers, told France 2 television the gangs were targeting students and local traders in ‚Äúfinancial difficulties‚Äù. She said: ‚ÄúUltimately, the mafia networks have infiltrated the local economy.‚Äù Calais, home to the so-called Jungle 2 migrant camp ‚Äì which replaced a previous camp dismantled by French police in 2009 ‚Äì has seen a spike in the number of migrants arriving to try to cross to the UK from about 1,000 in April to more than 3,000 in recent weeks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-23T18:39:58Z,world,World news,Why has Greece only now included defence cuts in its Brussels proposals?,"Among the measures Alexis Tsipras‚Äôs government has used to swell the package it tabled in Brussels on Monday is a ‚Ç¨200m (¬£142m) cut in next year‚Äôs defence budget. Estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) for 2014 suggest that would equate to a reduction of around 5% in Greece‚Äôs military spending. The proposal raises an intriguing question: why did Tsipras‚Äôs Syriza party not offer more swingeing cuts in defence spending at an earlier stage in its tortuous negotiations with Greece‚Äôs creditors? It would seem the obvious course of action for a leftwing ‚Äì arguably far left ‚Äì movement. It might also have obviated the need to inflict yet more pain on Greece‚Äôs long-suffering consumers and workers in the form of the higher VAT and increased social security contributions that also form part of the package. Until now, however, the Tsipras government‚Äôs only move in the direction of more modest defence spending has been to put the brakes on a ‚Ç¨500m programme for the modernisation of naval support jets. The case for deeper cuts in the defence budget would seem to be all the more persuasive given that Greece‚Äôs military expenditure is high. Ironically, the EU‚Äôs most leftwing government spends proportionately more on defence than any other. Greece‚Äôs military spending amounted to 2.2% of GDP last year, according to Sipri. Among Nato countries, only the US spent more in proportion to the size of its economy. Thanos Dokos, a defence analyst and director general of the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy, noted that the latest figures nevertheless reflected a sharp drop since the start of the Greek crisis. ‚ÄúThe defence budget has come down by around 40% in the last four years,‚Äù he said. If it is still high, that is because of ‚Äúa consensus in the country that there is a threat from Turkey and that we need to be able to defend ourselves against it. This is not Belgium or Portugal,‚Äù Dokos said. Deeper cuts than those outlined in the Tsipras plan might also be difficult to implement for both political and practical reasons. Tsipras‚Äôs government is a left-right coalition. Its parliamentary majority depends on support from the rightwing ANEL nationalist party whose leader, Panos Kammenos, holds the defence portfolio. With no new procurement initiative on the horizon, future defence budgets will consist largely of the cost of earlier arms purchases, military pay and pensions and the armed forces‚Äô operating expenses. Only the last can be reduced. Which is where a rich irony enters the picture, because Greece‚Äôs biggest European arms supplier over the years has been Germany. According to Sipri, more than a quarter of Greece‚Äôs weapons imports between 2000 and 2011 were from the country that has become its main creditor. There is also strong evidence to indicate that some of the contracts under which the arms were supplied were obtained by bribery, a practice for which Greece has been widely criticised in creditor nations. The Tsipras government may not have been in a hurry to put military spending cuts onto the table in its talks with its creditors, but then nor has the other side. Greece‚Äôs plentiful defence budget has proved a nice little earner for its eurozone partners over the years. ‚ÄúNo one put a gun to our head and made us buy those weapons,‚Äù said Dokos. ‚ÄúBut, although I cannot prove it, I don‚Äôt think [other European countries] were too keen to make it an issue. I don‚Äôt think they were too displeased with Greece buying their weapons.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-23T18:04:44Z,world,World news,Qatar delays vote on pledge to reform 'abusive' worker sponsorship system,"Qatar‚Äôs pledge to reform a sponsorship system which has been blamed for the abuse of foreign workers by the end of this year is in doubt after its advisory legislative council delayed a vote on the proposals. Human rights campaigners criticised the move, the latest blow to efforts to end the kafala system that ties workers to their employers and prevents them from changing jobs or leaving the country without the permission of their sponsor. Many have gone months without pay or had their passports confiscated. Even modest reforms promised by the Qatari government in the wake of a Guardian investigation and in-depth reports from rights organisations have become mired in holdups. The official state news agency, QNA, said on Tuesday that the shura council, Doha‚Äôs main consultative body, had postponed a vote on the reforms and referred them back to the internal and foreign affairs committee ‚Äúfor further study‚Äù. The legislation is expected to regulate the entry and exit of foreign workers and their residency status in the country, and will be referred to the state‚Äôs leadership if approved by the council. There are more than 1.6 million foreign workers in Qatar, a number that has risen due to a boom in infrastructure spurred by the emirate‚Äôs plans to host the World Cup in 2022. In May, Amnesty International accused Qatar of failing migrant workers and ‚Äúpromising little and delivering less‚Äù in terms of meaningful reform of its labour laws ahead of the World Cup.
An investigation by the Guardian last year revealed that Nepalese migrants building the infrastructure to host the World Cup have died at a rate of one every two days in 2014 ‚Äì despite Qatar‚Äôs promises to improve their working conditions. Mustafa Qadri, Gulf migrants researcher with Amnesty International, said the council‚Äôs action, if true, ‚Äúwould represent a significant backward step in the long, slow and up until now, largely unsuccessful bid to improve migrant labour rights protections in Qatar.‚Äù ‚ÄúI hope this report is a misrepresentation, otherwise it would suggest the shura is in denial about the scale of migrant labour abuse,‚Äù he told the Guardian. ‚ÄúIt would also fly totally in the face of commitments made by senior Qatari officials like the minister of labour in recent months promising to implement limited reforms aimed at making it easier for migrant workers to change jobs, leave the country, among other things.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-23T17:34:21Z,world,World news,Isis destroys Palmyra shrines in Syria,"Islamic State militants have blown up two ancient shrines they consider sacrilegious in Palmyra, the jihadi group said on Tuesday. The report was the first of any damage being done by the militants to buildings in Palmyra, a 2,000 Unesco world heritage site in central Syria, since they seized control of the city in May. Syrian forces have bombed the city, and the militants camped within it, since then.
Before and after pictures showed several militants carrying explosives and the shrines, which are not among the city‚Äôs monumental Roman-era buildings, reduced to rubble. News of the destruction in Palmyra emerged as the chief spokesman of Isis issued a call for increased violence during the holy month of Ramadan, and called upon Sunnis in Iraq to rise up against what he described as Shia oppression intended to end the Sunni presence in the country. Isis also released a video apparently showing the brutal killing of men alleged to be spies. In the recording, the men are drowned in a cage submerged in a swimming pool. The video is similarly brutal to another released earlier this year showing the immolation of the Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kasasbeh who was taken prisoner after ejecting from his plane, which he was flying on a mission with the US-led anti-Isis coalition. In a recording released on Tuesday, Isis spokesman Abu Mohammad al-Adnani called for intensified jihadist attacks during Ramadan. He also called on Sunnis in Iraq to rise up against what he described as Shia oppression and discrimination, saying Sunnis were no longer allowed to practise their religion openly in government strongholds like Baghdad and were subject to violence and collective punishment. He urged Sunnis to place their lot with Islamic State, saying the Shia-dominated government had betrayed those who stood by it, including those who joined the US-backed Anbar Awakening campaign and rebelled against the jihadists. He also said that the government-backed popular militia, the Hashd al-Shaabi, which is Shia-dominated, had abused Sunnis and destroyed their homes in villages and towns liberated from Isis and barred the displaced from returning to their homes. ‚ÄúThe Crusaders have decided to empty Iraq of its Sunnis,‚Äù said al-Adnani. ‚ÄúWake up, Sunnis everywhere.‚Äù
The Isis spokesman also urged rebel groups in Syria not to fight Islamic State. The Hashd al-Shaabi has taken the lead in the battle against Isis in Iraq, playing a crucial role with direct Iranian support in ousting Isis from Saddam Hussein‚Äôs hometown of Tikrit earlier this year. But the militias have been accused of an array of human rights abuses and the alleged inflicting of collective punishment on villages taken from Isis. While the terror group has scored important victories in recent months, wresting control of the historic city of Palmyra from Bashar al-Assad‚Äôs regime and Anbar‚Äôs provincial capital of Ramadi in Iraq within a week in May, it has also suffered setbacks. The militants lost Tal Abyad, a crucial border crossing with Turkey, last week to an assault by Kurdish militiamen backed by coalition air strikes, abandoning the city and retreating to Raqqa, the self-proclaimed caliphate‚Äôs seat of power in Syria.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-23T16:40:23Z,world,World news,UK 'pulling back' from migrant rescue with HMS Enterprise deployment,"The primary role of the Royal Navy vessel replacing HMS Bulwark on duty in the Mediterranean will not be to rescue of migrants but a military mission to ‚Äúgo after the human smugglers and traffickers‚Äù. Defence sources said HMS Enterprise, a oceanographic survey ship a fifth the size of HMS Bulwark, will not be part of Operation Triton, the EU search and rescue effort that has plucked thousands of migrants out of the sea from boats trying to make the crossing from Libya. The ship will come under the command of a separate EU naval force announced on Monday and charged with a mission to identify, capture and dispose of boats used or suspected of being used by smugglers. It will be one of eight vessels, including two submarines, in the force led by the Italian aircraft carrier Cavour. The EU summit later this week will be asked to approve a timetable for the move from the first, intelligence gathering phase of the operation to the second phase of search and seizure of smugglers‚Äô boats. The chancellor, George Osborne, told MPs last Wednesday that Britain would continue to ‚Äúplay its full part in the search and rescue operation in the Mediterranean‚Äù when Labour challenged him over HMS Bulwark‚Äôs replacement.
The deployment of HMS Enterprisewas announced quietly over the weekend. HMS Bulwark, which has saved more than 3,000 lives since it joined the search and rescue operation at the beginning of May, is a 19,500-tonne assault ship and landing dock with a crew of 325. HMS Enterprise is a 3,700-tonne vessel with a crew of 60 to 70 and capable of carrying only 120 people. The MoD anticipates that she will be involved in the EU operation against the smugglers until the autumn. Defence sources say that the new EU naval force will have ‚Äúa certain remit‚Äù to respond to Italian requests to take part in search and rescue operations, but that HMS Enterprise would not take part in ‚Äúproactive‚Äù searches and would only be involved in rescue if she was the best placed vessel in the area. The ship will also be under the general maritime duty to respond to any vessel in distress. A British Merlin helicopter will still be part of Operation Triton, and two small Border Force or HMRC cutters will take part in the operations of the EU‚Äôs border agency, Frontex. ‚ÄúHMS Enterprise is well suited to the next stage of the EU‚Äôs operation, which aims to go after the criminal gangs and smugglers,‚Äù said an MoD spokesman. ‚ÄúThe ship will contribute to the broad maritime capabilities desired by the Italian operational commander and will assist in the understanding and picture-building of how the operation will go on to seize and disrupt the assets of smugglers.‚Äù The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, said that as a multi-role survey ship, HMS Enterprise was well placed to ‚Äúprovide important assistance as we now move into this next stage.‚Äù Downing Street has already announced that GCHQ and National Crime Agency staff are to be seconded to an intelligence cell based in Italy aimed at targeting the smugglers. Labour‚Äôs shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, called for an urgent clarification of the new British role in the Mediterranean. ‚ÄúLast week George Osborne said that taking people out of the sea and preventing them from drowning was essential for a humanitarian nation. Those words seem to ring hollow when the UK government is now pulling back from full participation in search and rescue,‚Äù she said. She said the prime minister, David Cameron, should ‚Äúurgently clarify the UK‚Äôs new role and ensure capability in search and rescue isn‚Äôt being hindered by the decisions of our government,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe should be doing more, not less to stop people drowning in the Mediterranean.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-23T16:33:51Z,world,World news,EU to create new quarantine system for Mediterranean migrants,"EU leaders have decided to create a new system of quarantining migrants in southern Italy and Greece to enable the forcible and swift registration, fingerprinting, expulsion, and, if necessary, detention for up to 18 months of those deemed to be illegal immigrants crossing the Mediterranean from Libya. A summit of EU leaders on Thursday is to grapple with the Mediterranean refugee crisis and is likely to give EU police and border control agencies beefed up powers to use coercion in dealing with the influx in an attempt to increase the numbers of those sent back whence they came. Draft documents prepared for the summit, obtained by the Guardian and unlikely to be changed, say that the government leaders have decided to establish ‚Äústructured border zones and facilities in the frontline member states [Italy, Greece, Malta], with the active support of member states‚Äô experts to ensure the swift identification, registration and fingerprinting of migrants.‚Äù Under proposals from the European commission for the summit, the EU‚Äôs borders agency, Frontex, is to be granted new powers to initiate and carry out forced deportations. At the moment such action and decisions can only be taken by national authorities. The proposals were spelled out earlier this month in a letter to EU interior ministers from Dimitris Avramopoulos, the commissioner for migration. ‚ÄúThe EU‚Äôs system to return irregular migrants is not sufficiently fast and effective,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe effectiveness of the system must be enhanced. I am open to exploring all options.‚Äù Italy is particularly aggrieved that it is being left alone to cope with the crisis. For weeks EU governments have been embroiled in a battle over commission demands to ease Italy‚Äôs burden by creating a new quotas system sharing asylum-seekers across the union.
In an article for the Guardian on Tuesday, Italy‚Äôs prime minister, Matteo Renzi, accuses the EU of betraying its basic values and decency in the handling of the crisis. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Europe that needs to demonstrate the values it believes in and stands for. Europe isn‚Äôt a bundle of economic ties, it‚Äôs a community of people, a shared destiny, and ideals. ‚ÄúA European response is needed by Europe far more than it is needed by Italy,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúItaly could go it alone in the Mediterranean. But it‚Äôs Europe that cannot afford to let this happen. That‚Äôs the political point ... If we ignore these values now, while the Mediterranean burns, and children drown, it is Europe itself that we lose.‚Äù The summit is to offer Renzi mild relief by agreeing to take 40,000 asylum-seekers from Italy and Greece over two years and share them out. The leaders say the issue will be settled by next month although it is not clear whether that will be merely a coalition of the willing or whether there will be mandatory quotas. Given the fierce resistance in eastern Europe to the idea of being forced by Brussels to take in refugees, the sharing is likely to be on a voluntary basis. Far from opening borders, Europe is closing down. In the past 10 days France and Austria have closed borders with Italy and turned hundreds back. The anti-immigrant rightwing Danish People‚Äôs party soared into second place as the real victor of last week‚Äôs general election in Denmark and is demanding the re-erection of border controls as the price for propping up a minority centre-right government. The anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant Freedom party in Austria has just chalked up significant regional electoral gains.
Hungary has told Brussels to mind its own business and started building a four-metre-high wire curtain along its border with Serbia this week to keep migrants out. ‚ÄúFor my generation, Europe‚Äôs identity begins with the fall of the Berlin Wall. I was 14 at the time,‚Äù writes Renzi. ‚ÄúToday, my son is 14 and I don‚Äôt want the symbol of European identity to be a wall between Hungary and Serbia, nor a wall of distrust between the countries of Europe.‚Äù In Strasbourg on Tuesday, Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, said Europe was facing a test it could not afford to fail. ‚ÄúGlobally, nearly 60 million people are forcibly displaced. This is an all-time high that needs a record response. Other regions with many more refugees are closely watching this continent,‚Äù he told the Council of Europe, the human rights watchdog that is quite separate from the EU. ‚ÄúEurope needs safer, regular, and orderly channels for migration and mobility.‚Äù The summit document, however, focuses on keeping migrants out and quickly deporting those who do not qualify for asylum. ‚ÄúThe commission will set out by July 2015 how Frontex will bring immediate support to frontline states on return. The commission has announced its intention to propose to amend the Frontex regulation to strengthen the role of Frontex in return, notably so that it can initiate return missions.‚Äù The Avramopoulos letter laying out the policy goes further, complaining that fewer than 40% of failed asylum applicants are expelled from the EU. ‚ÄúTo make sure that irregular migrants are effectively returned, detention should be applied, as a legitimate measure of last resort, where it is necessary to avoid that irregular migrants might abscond.‚Äù They may be detained for six months, but also up to 18 months ‚Äúin cases of non-cooperation‚Äù, while in emergency situations of large influxes as currently in Italy, the rules governing detention may be waived, meaning there is no need for ‚Äúseparate accommodation guaranteeing family privacy‚Äù, that venues other than prisons and detention facilities can be used to hold people, and the need for quick judicial review of the cases can be dropped. ‚ÄúWhere is the EU going?‚Äù asked Tony Bunyan, director of Statewatch, a watchdog monitoring civil liberties in the EU. ‚ÄúMigrants, including pregnant women and minors, who have fled from war, persecution and poverty are to be forcibly fingerprinted or held in detention until they acquiesce or are expelled and banned from re-entry.‚Äù On the eve of Thursday‚Äôs summit, M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res blamed the Mediterranean crisis squarely on the EU. ‚ÄúThis is an orchestrated humanitarian crisis, created by the failure of the EU to put in place adequate and humane policies and practices to deal with this issue,‚Äù said Aur√©lie Ponthieu, MSF migration adviser. ‚ÄúThe deteriorating situation is not due to unmanageable numbers of migrants and refugees. It is a direct result of chronic shortcomings in the EU‚Äôs policies in handling the new arrivals. Member states spend their time talking about closing borders, building fences, and issuing threatening ultimatums to each other.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-23T15:39:41Z,world,World news,"Doctor Mads Gilbert on working under siege in Gaza‚Äôs Shifa hospital: ‚ÄòMy camera is my Kalashnikov‚Äô
","Amid a dense jumble of chaotic streets and overcrowded apartment buildings not far from the seafront, the Shifa hospital is in many ways the beating heart of Gaza. Like any hospital, it is a place of life and death, relief and agony, hope and despair. But the Shifa is more remarkable than most. Over the past 10 years, it has dealt with four intense conflicts, and since 2007 has endured a blockade that has led to shortages of drugs and equipment, regular power crises and the near-impossibility of medical staff leaving Gaza to train, widen their experience or attend conferences. The Shifa is a hospital under siege. During last summer‚Äôs war in Gaza, as on previous occasions, the dead and injured were brought to the Shifa day and night during seven weeks of bombardment by Israeli forces. Palestinian medics often worked for 30 hours at a stretch, snatching short breaks then returning to duty. Among them was Dr Mads Gilbert, a Norwegian anaesthetist and trauma expert ‚Äì and a veteran of wars in Gaza. Gilbert ‚Äì who describes himself as a ‚Äúpolitical doctor‚Äù and a practitioner of ‚Äúsolidarity medicine‚Äù ‚Äì has written a book, Night in Gaza, which describes his time at the Shifa last summer. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a place of human greatness, suffering and endurance ‚Äì and an almost incomprehensible mastering of a situation that seems overwhelming, impossible to deal with. Yet they [the medical staff] stand tall, don‚Äôt reject a single patient, do phenomenal, very complicated surgery with a high level of professionalism,‚Äù he said. When mass casualties were brought in, the first job of the medics was to take difficult decisions. ‚ÄúTriage is extremely efficient, but it‚Äôs brutal,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou have to let the dying die.‚Äù It was a marked contrast to hospitals in Norway, where medical resources would be thrown at patients with limited expectation of survival. Despite the harsh conditions at the Shifa, and the constant fear among the medics that they could find themselves treating their own relatives, they performed ‚Äúworld-class war surgery under world-class leadership‚Äù. Gilbert is something of a hero to Palestinian sympathisers. Close to 1,000 tickets to a talk he gave last week in London sold out in four hours. But, inevitably, in the binary world of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he is feted by one side and abhorred by the other. Like many of his generation ‚Äì he is 68 ‚Äì he was a late convert to the Palestinian cause. ‚ÄúI was brought up with the Zionist narrative. My mother was quite radical; she was a nurse, and she told me so much about Israel, how they made the desert bloom, about the kibbutz system, which was a semi-socialist experiment.‚Äù During the 1967 six-day war between Israel and its Arab neighbours, Gilbert responded to an appeal for young foreigners to go to work on kibbutzim to replace Israelis fighting in the conflict. The day he was accepted, he had a shocking conversation that changed his view. ‚ÄúIt was the first time I had even heard about the Palestinians.‚Äù He cancelled his trip to Israel.
Fifteen years later, he volunteered as a medic in Lebanon, which Israel had invaded. ‚ÄúI had my first war victims, and the totally shocking experience of the mercilessness of the Israeli war machine.‚Äù Although he has since worked as a medical volunteer in many places, including Cambodia, Burma, Afghanistan and Angola, ‚ÄúPalestine has always been at the core.‚Äù A self-confessed ‚Äúsocialist, Marxist ‚Äì and human being‚Äù, Gilbert draws a clear distinction between anti-Zionism and antisemitism. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a strong anti-racist, there is not a milligram of antisemitism in me. But I oppose apartheid and colonialism.‚Äù This is ‚Äúnot a difficult conflict, it is an illegal occupation ‚Äì it continues, it expands and it costs thousands of innocent Palestinian lives. These people have the right to defend themselves, the right to resist. The right to resist implies also the right to resist with arms, if you‚Äôre occupied.‚Äù In Night in Gaza, Gilbert repeatedly refers to the might and brutality of the Israeli military, but does not mention rockets fired by Hamas and other militant groups. Asked about this, Gilbert quotes from the book‚Äôs preface, in which he states he does not support Hamas or Fatah (the two main Palestinian factions), but the Palestinian people: ‚ÄúI want to be crystal-clear about this ‚Äì I condemn any Palestinian attack on any civilian target, period. If one Israeli child is killed, it is one too many. But nor should more than 550 Palestinian children be killed.‚Äù He also rejects claims by the Israeli government that the Shifa was used as a base by Hamas officials and militants in the knowledge that Israel would not attack the hospital. Gilbert points out that a number of hospitals and medical facilities were in fact shelled by Israel during last summer‚Äôs war, and that Hamas won free and fair elections in 2006: ‚ÄúI have never seen any activities in the Shifa that would violate the Geneva conventions. But I didn‚Äôt explore every corner of the large hospital compound. If I saw anything inside the Shifa that in my opinion violated the Geneva conventions and, should I say, the ‚Äòholiness‚Äô of a hospital, I would have left.‚Äù The book contains dozens of harrowing photographs, many of badly injured children, taken by Gilbert during his stay in Gaza last summer, although the most graphic were excluded. He describes his camera as ‚Äúmy Kalashnikov‚Äù, saying that this kind of medical documentation of war is a powerful weapon ‚Äì and one that is feared by Israel. This, he believes, contributed to Israel‚Äôs ‚ÄúKafkaesque‚Äù decision to ban him indefinitely from Gaza last October for unspecified security reasons. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt even explain why. It is non-appealable, totally irrespective of international opinion and totally against international law. It is a tiny taste of what it means to be under brutal Israeli rule.‚Äù Nevertheless, after 15 years of visiting Gaza, he intends to go back. His experiences in Gaza ‚Äúhave totally changed me as a human being‚Äù, he says. ‚ÄúThe more I see and know, the more I become skinless, sensitive. The human condition affects me more and more.‚Äù He has been forced to develop coping mechanisms ‚Äì what he calls ‚Äúperceptual focus to shield out the worst stuff‚Äù ‚Äì for dealing with so much physical and emotional trauma. ‚ÄúYou have to be very well prepared; this is not a place for disaster tourism. We didn‚Äôt sleep much, we didn‚Äôt eat or drink [the war began during Ramadan, the month of fasting for Muslims] ‚Äì it was extreme endurance.‚Äù But, he adds, he witnessed an extraordinary ‚Äúconsolidated unity. Medics, cleaners, ambulance crews, patients, families ‚Äì they were all part of the resistance.‚Äù For Gilbert, showing solidarity is his duty as a doctor. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not neutral. My obligation as a doctor is to take the side of my patient ‚Äì be it a single patient, a family, a village, a community, a nation. In Gaza, if we only give them bandages, we become part of the problem. If you want to be neutral, you end up being part of the problem. We are all complicit, whether we shut up or stand up.‚Äù ‚ÄòThe unbearable sound of children shrieking‚Äô
The mood is tense. Everybody is ready to run and meet the next load of casualties. The entrance to the emergency department soon fills with stretchers and running ambulance crews. The area begins to swarm with civilians, with and without visible injuries, policemen in blue camouflage uniforms pushing journalists and cameramen out of the way, while medical workers flock around the newly arrived patients. The air is a cacophony of shouts, screams and sharp commands from the senior surgeon in charge of sorting the casualties. Loudest and most piercing is the unbearable sound of children shrieking. Two young boys, one aged two or three and the other maybe seven, are lying on a stretcher. They have visible burn injuries and a large number of small, black wounds on their faces and necks, some of them bloody, like traces of shrapnel. Dr Atta al-Mzainy looks at me sharply. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to take them to the intensive burn care unit. Straight away,‚Äù he shouts. ‚ÄúWe can take one each. You take the younger one.‚Äù ‚ÄúOK,‚Äù I answer, my heart pounding. Everything is collapsing around us now, I think to myself. The bombing throughout the night, the number of casualties; it all feels like a tidal wave of blood and screams. Insurmountable ‚Ä¶ As I run, I look down at the little boy. His hair is singed on large areas of his head. The skin is loose on his forehead and across the root of his nose. His eyelids are thick and swollen, but his eyes are open, staring out at the world with a wild expression. He has a deep cut above his left eye, and blood is coming from his ear on the same side. Does he have shrapnel inside his skull, or is it a flesh wound? His consciousness is not impaired; quite the opposite. I notice that his arms and legs are constantly moving as I run behind my colleague, terrified of tripping and dropping the boy on the tarmac. The Israeli drones buzz above us.

2015-06-23T15:36:52Z,world,World news,Nato plans re-engagement with Iraq four years after departure,"Four years after its departure from Iraq, Nato is planning to re-engage with the country by training officers to help in the fight against Islamic State. In response to a request for help earlier this year by the Iraqi government, the US-led alliance is also working on several proposals as well as the training, which comes despite the failure of Nato‚Äôs previous attempt to create a professional officer force in Iraq. Nato started training in Iraq in 2004, a year after the invasion, with the declared aim of creating an ‚Äúeffective force‚Äù, and left in 2011. Despite training 5,000 officers, running at least 2,000 courses and spending millions on teaching officers both in the country and in Nato countries, the Iraqi army collapsed when confronted by Isis in Mosul last year and Ramadi this year.
There is frustration in the US and in the UK over repeated delays in mounting attacks to reclaim the two cities, although Iraqi forces ‚Äì aided by Shia militias and air strikes by the US, Britain and others ‚Äì have managed to retake Tikrit. Defence ministers are scheduled to meet at Nato headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday and Thursday, mainly to discuss progress on a new rapid-reaction force that can be deployed on the alliance‚Äôs eastern front against Russia or in the south and south-east in conflicts such as Libya, Syria or Iraq. Stepping up pressure on Russia, the US defence secretary, Ash Carter, announced on Tuesday the locations for 250 US tanks, armoured vehicles and artillery by the end of the year: Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The equipment will remain in place for use by troops sent for exercises to these countries on a rotational basis. The US ambassador to Nato, Douglas Lute, described it as being like ‚Äúa rental car-type agreement for training equipment‚Äù.
The positioning of permanent equipment right up against the Russian border could act as a further irritant to President Vladimir Putin. Nato officials are still in discussion with Iraq and with member nations about what help it would provide in the fight against Isis. Sixty-two countries, including all 28 Nato states, are at present engaged in an international coalition against Islamic State. Lute said: ‚ÄúNato is working on defence capacity-building effort where Nato as an institution would, on demand of the government of Iraq, offer particular capacity-building assistance. For example, helping them write their national security programme, helping them work with security sector reform, helping them with logistics, and command and control, certain niche capabilities which Nato has expertise in doing. That programme is not yet complete but it is nearly complete. I would say in the coming weeks we would expect an announcement that Nato has finalised with the government of Iraq this defence capacity-building.‚Äù Lute said no decision had yet been taken on whether to hold the training inside or outside of Iraq. Asked by the Guardian why Nato training of Iraqi forces would be any more effective this time round, Lute said: ‚ÄúThe hope for a different outcome has to do with the character of the Iraqi government. My government is quite clear that we won‚Äôt accomplish something on the ground that isn‚Äôt reflected in a different character ‚Äì inclusive cross-sectarian character ‚Äì of the Iraqi government. That is the key.‚Äù Nato‚Äôs return to Iraq, although modest at this stage, would be hugely symbolic, another example of it working beyond its traditional cold war remit and adopting a wider interpretation of its role. A senior Nato official said there was no plan at present for involvement in either Libya or Syria. The official said the deadline for completion of the first part of an Iraq package was the end of July. ‚ÄúAt this stage, what we are not talking about is putting a big Nato operation into Iraq. Let‚Äôs be clear about that. The coalition is there, it is developing its training effort and so what Nato would wish to do would be complementary to that as a first phase. We are looking at short-, medium- and long-term measures.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúIraq came to us with a list of, I think, 11 specific areas where they wanted support. We figured that within that, there were seven that made sense for Nato.‚Äù The move back to Iraq comes after former Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen insisted last year that he saw no role for the alliance in Iraq. He said Nato‚Äôs role was the defence of allies and it had no mandate or request for Iraq.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-23T15:08:22Z,world,World news,The Greek debt crisis ‚Äì digested read,"How long can something remain on the the brink before it becomes the status quo? The Greek economy has been on the brink of collapse for so long now that no one can quite remember a time when it wasn‚Äôt. Even before Greece joined the euro in 2001, the more hard-nosed economists from northern Europe regarded the drachma as a second-class currency as Greece was suffering from high unemployment and low growth. Following the introduction of the euro, the Greek government attracted a large amount of money from overseas investors confident their loans would be underwritten by the European Central Bank. Up until 2007, these were happy days for Greece: public spending soared, the economy grew and the government could continue to ignore the widespread corruption and tax avoidance that had been endemic in the country for decades. In the meantime, Greece continued to run some of the highest structural deficits and debt-to-GDP ratios as the world continued to delude itself that economic boom times were here to stay. After the global financial collapse of 2008, many countries became twitchy about their Greek investments ‚Äì partly because the Greeks were understandably reluctant to supply any information which might reveal that the situation was even worse than anyone imagined, but mainly because the traditional escape route of currency devaluation was off the cards within the eurozone. Come 2010, the scale of the Greek crisis became unavoidable when credit agencies downgraded Greek government debt to junk-bond status and the prospect of Greece defaulting on its loans became a possibility. To help stave this off, the eurozone countries, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund ‚Äì thereafter christened the troika ‚Äì bunged the Greeks a ‚Ç¨110bn (¬£78bn) loan to tide them over for three years. The money did come with some strings attached ‚Äì the Greeks were obliged to implement structural reforms and austerity measures ‚Äì but the driving concern was to stop the Greeks from going bankrupt and leaving the eurozone. The ‚Ç¨110bn loan was swallowed up in just over a year, leaving the troika little option but to hand out a further ‚Ç¨130bn to avoid Greece defaulting on its sovereign debt. In compensation, the troika demanded even further concessions from the Greeks. Think payday loan shark demanding an extortionate APR interest rate from someone whose legs they are already threatening to break. The Greeks took the money because it was there and also as they were desperate. Though not desperate enough to do anything about corruption and tax avoidance by the rich, so the burden of the austerity measures fell on those least able to afford them. By 2015, unemployment was running at 25% and the country was still, to all intents and purposes, just as broke as it always had been. In their January general election, the Greeks reckoned enough was enough and voted in the leftwing Syriza party, who had run for office on an anti-austerity campaign. As far as Syriza was concerned, if the troika wanted their money back they could whistle for it. Working on the principle that if you owe the troika ‚Ç¨10m they own you, but if you owe then ‚Ç¨240bn then you own them, the new Greek government chose to call the troika‚Äôs bluff. Which is why the Greek debt crisis is now left permanently on the brink. The troika is now in so deep it can‚Äôt afford a Greek default; nor can it risk a Greek exit (Grexit) from the euro in case other countries ‚Äì Portugal and Italy are prime suspects ‚Äì follow suit leaving the eurozone to collapse in a pile of worthless dominoes. But the Greeks are also in too deep to risk a default: were they to leave the euro and return to the drachma then the economy would become one of a third world nation. So we‚Äôve reached a total impasse. Syriza will have to agree to more austerity measures than they would like ‚Äì a cap on state pensions and an increase in VAT ‚Äì and the troika will continue to bail out the Greeks on an ad hoc basis. It‚Äôs set up for a lose-lose situation, as no sooner does the troika pump in more cash, than the Greek people withdraw it. Better to have your cash under the mattress in euros, than leaving it in the bank where it could be turned into worthless drachmas at any moment. No matter who blinks first, everyone loses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-23T14:00:44Z,world,World news,"Iranians optimistic about end to isolation, says new poll","While a majority of Iranians support a nuclear agreement with the US and the other P5+1 powers, high hopes for the immediate lifting of international sanctions may mitigate support for Hassan Rouhani‚Äôs government ahead of next year‚Äôs parliamentary election, a new public opinion poll indicates.
Based on a telephone poll of 1,009 Iranians conducted 12-28 May for the University of Maryland‚Äôs Center for International and Security Studies by IranPoll.com and University of Tehran, a majority of Iranians supports a nuclear deal requiring their country to limit its centrifuges and nuclear stockpile for a number of years. They also accept more extensive inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency in return for the P5+1 accepting Iran to enrich uranium, lift economic sanctions, and expand nuclear cooperation with Iran. Some 57% of respondents agree with the current framework while only 15% were opposed and another 28% were undecided, but that support is tempered by expectations of speedy sanctions relief and economic recovery. Of those polled, 63% of respondents believe the current understanding would lead the United States to lift all its sanctions on Iran, while 38% believe the P5+1 has already agreed to lift the sanctions immediately. At least 53% say the nuclear deal would lower the unemployment rate and tangibly improve people‚Äôs standard of living in under a year. During the last round of nuclear talks in Lausanne, at which all negotiating sides announced a framework agreement, United States and Iran officials issued contradicting statements indicating the two sides were still at odds over the scope and mechanisms of sanctions-lifting. As Iran‚Äôs scheduled February 2016 parliamentary election draws near, any snags over this aspect of the agreement could dampen public support for President Hassan Rouhani at a critical moment in domestic politics. Widespread support ‚Äì but a threat of lethargy Poll results indicate that 50% of Iranian voters would prefer the new Majles, or lower house, to comprise Rouhani supporters, while 24% said they would prefer Rouhani‚Äôs critics. But responses to related questions about the current government‚Äôs policies indicate that the president stands to lose support for the nuclear negotiations the longer the sanctions lethargy drags on.
Some 81% of polled Iranians said the Majles should have the right to kill the negotiations. (Interestingly, Iranian MPs voluntarily curtailed their own right to do so in a 20 June vote.) A majority - 51% ‚Äì also say Iran should not agree to a deal unless the United States agrees to remove all of its sanctions. Also, while 53% said they would re-elect Rouhani as president in 2017, another 27% of respondents to this question said they would vote for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the former president whom the domestic press has blamed for the nation‚Äôs economic mismanagement. While most respondents gave Rouhani high marks for improving security and the country‚Äôs economic prospects, 53% said he was unsuccessful at reducing unemployment. ‚ÄúOn security and foreign policy Rouhani has high approval. Those who see Iran‚Äôs military power as an achievement have increased substantially ‚Äì about four times during just few months,‚Äù says Amir Farmanesh of IranPoll.com, who co-authored the study. He adds that regional instability and the rise of the Islamic State west of Iran‚Äôs borders has contributed to this trend. ‚ÄúNaturally what is happening all around Iran should have made some people value the stability Iran has and count its military power as an achievement.‚Äù Because of errors contained in the document provided, the article was amended to reflect a smaller percentage of respondents in favor of Rouhani and his critics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-23T13:49:54Z,world,World news,Catholic bishop: arson attack on Israel church work of Jewish zealots,"A Catholic bishop in Britain has issued an unusually strong condemnation of last week‚Äôs arson attack on the biblically symbolic Church of the Multiplication of Loaves and Fish in Israel, referring to ‚ÄúJewish zealots‚Äù and demanding the Israeli authorities act against religious bigotry.
Declan Lang, bishop of Clifton, said he had learned of the attack on the church in Tabgha with ‚Äúgreat sadness and deep regret‚Äù, adding that ‚Äúthe common consensus seems to be that Jewish zealots were responsible‚Äù. He demanded the arrest of the perpetrators, adding that Israel must ensure that ‚Äúsuch attacks that take religious bigotry to a new level ... do not continue unchecked‚Äù. Lang‚Äôs comments follow a report from the official Vatican news service describing the attack on the church as ‚Äúyet another episode in the long series of desecrations and acts of intimidation committed by groups of extremist Jewish settlers to the detriment of monasteries, churches and Christian cemeteries since February 2012‚Äù. The report also referred to attacks on mosques by ‚Äúmilitant extremist groups close to the settler movement‚Äù. A fire was started in the church in the early hours of Thursday morning, causing extensive damage to the roof, a souvenir shop, offices and meeting rooms, and destroying Bibles and prayer books. The bill for repairs is expected to run to millions of dollars. Graffiti in Hebrew was sprayed on the walls of the church, reading: ‚ÄúFalse idols will be cast out.‚Äù Father Gregory Collins, head of the Order of Saint Benedict in Israel, which maintains the site, described the attack as ‚Äúabsolutely deplorable‚Äù and ‚Äúan attack on freedom of speech, democracy and the right to live here‚Äù. Thousands of people gathered at the church on Sunday to take part in a protest over the attack.
The church, which receives 5,000 visitors a day, was built in the 1980s on the site believed to be where Jesus performed the miracle of feeding 5,000 people with five loaves of bread and two fish, on the north-western shore of the Sea of Galilee. It incorporates an ancient mosaic floor, part of a fifth-century church, which survived the attack. In a statement, Richard Verber of the Board of Deputies of British Jews condemned ‚Äúthe heinous arson attack‚Äù. He said: ‚ÄúSuch hatred and disrespect of faith should have no place in Israel, the holy land to the three Abrahamic faiths. The board welcomes the Israeli government‚Äôs pledge to apprehend the perpetrators and they should meet the full force of the law.‚Äù Following the attack, 16 people from Jewish settlements who were staying in the area were questioned for six hours before being released. ‚ÄúThere is an ongoing investigation. We‚Äôre still searching for suspects,‚Äù said Israel police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld. There have been dozens of attacks on Christian sites in the Holy Land in recent years. Targets have included Dormition Abbey in Jerusalem‚Äôs Old City, a Trappist monastery in Latroun, and the Convent of St Francis on Mount Zion. A surge of anti-Christian graffiti ‚Äì such as ‚ÄúDeath to Christians‚Äù, ‚ÄúWe will crucify you‚Äù and ‚ÄúJesus is a monkey‚Äù ‚Äì preceded Pope Francis‚Äôs visit to the Holy Land last year. The Church of the Multiplication was also attacked in April, when perpetrators destroyed crosses in an outdoor prayer area and threw stones at worshippers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-23T13:00:57Z,world,World news,The making of an Iran nuclear deal: ‚Äòpatience and a thick skin‚Äô,"There is an old view that Iranians are formidable diplomats. Perhaps it is in the genes, or perhaps it results from centuries of practice conducting the foreign relations of great dynasties. Sir Thomas Herbert, a writer who accompanied British diplomats to Iran in the 17th century, noted that visiting foreigners were encouraged to wear their own dress ‚Äúso that the greater the variety‚Äù the more the Shah would feel ‚Äúhis court and country [were] honoured at home and [held] in estimation abroad‚Äù. Among the best-sellers at last month‚Äôs Tehran international book fair was a biography of foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. In its sixth printing since its release in 2013, ‚ÄúMr Ambassador‚Äù collects interviews telling the life story of the diplomat set to deliver a nuclear agreement with world powers. Does the work of Zarif and president Hassan Rouhani show that hard-headed, practical diplomacy has been wedded to the ideological zeal of the 1979 Islamic Revolution? Complex, detailed and long-running talks with world powers over the nuclear programme are now concentrating on how any agreement might be verified, and how sanctions might come back into play if Iran violated any of the terms. ‚ÄúThis is simultaneously political and technical,‚Äù a European diplomat involved in talks in Vienna told me. ‚ÄúThe technical and the political people are having to work very closely together‚Äù. This illustrates a central difficulty in the talks ‚Äì maintaining unity among world powers. The United States wants sanctions that ‚Äúsnap back‚Äù automatically, and Russia wants any re-imposition referred to the UN security council. At the same time, United States secretary of state John Kerry has to deal with the hostility towards the talks from Washington‚Äôs two main Middle Eastern allies, Saudi Arabia and Israel. Richard LeBaron, Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council and former US ambassador to Kuwait as well as deputy chief of mission in Israel, told me that fears among the Sunni-led Arab states and Israel over Iran are for different reasons, but real enough. ‚ÄúThe Arabs fear Iranian revolutionary zeal, their dedication to spreading their influence in the Arab region, and they believe that the US intends to use Iran to create some sort of balance against their interests,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNuclear proliferation has never been high on their list of concerns. But any step out of isolation by Iran is considered a step backward for the Saudis. Israel fears a somewhat unpredictable nuclear power in the Middle East, which ideologically opposes it: they don‚Äôt much care about Iran‚Äôs regional meddling other than its support for Hezbollah and its minor support for Hamas.‚Äù Those who negotiate with Iran express a mixture of respect and frustration. Two former European diplomats who dealt with Iran during the European Union‚Äôs 2003-05 nuclear negotiations told me of serious challenges. Sir Richard Dalton, British ambassador to Iran 2002-06, recalls Iranian diplomats being ‚Äúdogged and determined‚Äù while frequently changing position. ‚ÄúThey often think in terms of conspiracies,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTheir convoluted analysis of plots has to be slowly and carefully deconstructed to locate the common ground on whatever is the issue of the day.‚Äù There is also domestic Iranian politics. ‚ÄúA revolutionary country, its diplomats and negotiators, can be outflanked by radicals claiming to be the true exponents of national values,‚Äù Sir Richard said. ‚ÄúThey [Iranian politicians or diplomats] often speak of external enemies as a way of fostering internal unity. There is usually lively argument [in Tehran] among the factions and the personalities in the leadership and it takes time to resolve them - hence the need for [anyone negotiating with Iran to have] patience and a thick skin.‚Äù Paul von Maltzahn, Germany‚Äôs ambassador in Tehran from 2003 to 2006, also warned of the dangers of Iranian domestic politics, particularly if talks go beyond the deadline of June 30. ‚ÄúThey should not stick too much to timetables. If 30 June does not work, then go on. This is important enough. [But] I am speaking of one week, two weeks, not a long time, because then of course the process unravels.‚Äù
Von Maltzahn remembers the particular problem of knowing exactly when Iran‚Äôs negotiators were speaking with authority. Back in 2003 Rouhani, then Iran‚Äôs leading nuclear negotiator as secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, took time out at delicate points during talks at the Sadabad palace, north Tehran to telephone Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, seeking approval. But von Maltzahn also recalls a senior Iranian negotiator floating proposals without making clear if they were hypothetical, much less if they had the backing of the leader. Hossein Mousavian, effectively Rouhani‚Äôs deputy, came to the German residence ‚Äúa few times‚Äù when he ‚Äúflew kites, trying out ideas‚Äù. Some European diplomats saw such ‚Äúkite-flying‚Äù as a deliberate means to confuse, and were especially suspicious that Iranian negotiators were seeking tactical advantage when they warned time was running out for a deal because they were under growing pressure from their own ‚Äúhardliners‚Äù. This was never an easy judgement. Indeed, just as the Iranians had warned, the talks‚Äô failure and the 2005 election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president did lead to the removal of both Rouhani and Mousavian as negotiators and even, briefly, to Mousavian‚Äôs arrest in 2007. The Europeans then spent several years listening to lectures from Saeed Jalili as the Iranian nuclear programme expanded. But ‚Äì despite, or perhaps because of their experience in Tehran ‚Äì both von Maltzahn and Dalton express cautious optimism over the current talks. In contrast to 2003-05, the United States is not only directly involved but has agreed to accept in principle that Iran can continue some uranium enrichment. It is France that now takes the toughest approach, especially in demanding access for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to military sites and that Iran give more thorough explanations of alleged past research.
But while Iran‚Äôs official line ‚Äì strongly expressed by Khamenei ‚Äì is that allowing access to military sites would cross its ‚Äúred lines‚Äù, von Maltzahn believes Rouhani in 2003-05 indicated the issue was not entirely closed. ‚ÄúRouhani regarded this as a playing card, something that might be played at some stage,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe big thing for Iran is really ‚Äúnon-discrimination‚Äù, so they are not treated differently to anyone else.‚Äù For von Maltzahn, Tehran‚Äôs thinking points towards an agreement. ‚ÄúIran has come to conclude that the nuclear option is not necessary for them to have more power projected in the area. With the decline or disappearance of Iraq, and with Egypt‚Äôs lack of a regional role, de facto Iran is the most powerful nation in the area. They don‚Äôt need nuclear parity with Israel, and in any case it‚Äôs far too costly. So why go that way?‚Äù Other regional powers have long been assessing the consequences of a nuclear agreement. Is it a precedent for other efforts to solve problems through diplomacy? Saudi Arabia portrays its bombing strikes against the Houthis in Yemen as a means to resist Iran‚Äôs attempt to back regional allies, but can the Saudis deploy negotiators as well as F-16s? Von Maltzahn looked sceptical when asked why Riyadh in 2013 rejected the chance to sit on the UN security council and present its case to the world. ‚ÄúWhat case?‚Äù he quipped. By contrast, the former German ambassador to Tehran expressed professional regard for Iran‚Äôs diplomatic team, describing Zarif as ‚Äúcourageous‚Äù. His highest praise was for Abbas Aragchi, who has done much of the work on the Iranian side. ‚ÄúHe comes from a family of carpet dealers. He‚Äôs very honest and straightforward ‚Äì for an Isfahani.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-23T12:57:35Z,world,World news,"Is Iraq worth the fight? After years of war and chaos, its people no longer know","For years, Hamid Menhel has trudged through a graveyard in central Baghdad almost every day to tend to one of its few well-maintained tombs. Surrounded by shrubs and a small metal fence, it is the burial site of Gertrude Bell, the British diplomat and explorer whose role in the region a century ago helped enshrine Iraq‚Äôs modern state. The cemetery is hemmed between churches, mosques, government buildings and roads choked with cars on the south bank of the Tigris river, which has been Baghdad‚Äôs lifeblood for 3,000 years, but has more recently become a dividing line. The fortified government district known as the Green Zone stands on its northern banks. Here the business of navigating Iraq through its latest crisis, the battle against Islamic State (Isis), is directed from a safe, insular enclave of Saddam-era palaces and embassies. The rest of the city gets by on its wits.
Iraq‚Äôs officials claim that the war is existential and that to win it will preserve the very boundaries that Bell advocated in 1921 after the demise of the Ottoman empire. From his vantage point across the river though, Hamid, 37, believes that much of what has happened in Iraq since ‚Äì and particularly the current tumult ‚Äì suggeststhe country Bell envisaged doesn‚Äôt exist any more. And if it does, it may no longer be worth fighting for. ‚ÄúWe can blame empire, occupation, the Americans, Miss Bell, Iran, anyone we want,‚Äù Hamid said, standing on a thin crust of dirt surrounded by tombstones that teeter into collapsed graves. ‚ÄúBut the reality is that people here don‚Äôt want to live together. Why else would we all behave like animals? ‚ÄúLook around. No electricity, no security, no future. If I want water for the ground here, I have to beg the British embassy for it. The country is finished.‚Äù A year into the war against Isis, and more than 12 years since the toppling of Saddam Hussein, other Iraqis are facing personal reckonings about their place within a nation in a perpetual search for identity. Across the country, apparently endless dysfunction has led many to retreat to groupings that they feel more confident in ‚Äì tribes, clan and sects.
‚ÄúIt was OK when there was security,‚Äù said Khalil al-Khater, a refugee from the northern town of Tal Afar, who has spent more than a year in a shack near the Shia city of Najaf. ‚ÄúAs long as we were safe, we could forget about the rest of the country not working. Now the army has scattered like leaves on the wind, and Iraq has split into three parts.‚Äù Since the time of Bell and her colleague TE Lawrence, who also played a defining role in shaping contemporary Arabia, Iraq has lived through colonialism, monarchy, totalitarianism, war, occupation and chaos. Throughout all its modern eras, ancient Mesopotamia‚Äôs role as a cradle of civilisation has loomed large, but many of its people say its latest incarnation, from the end of the first world war until now, has produced next to nothing in the way of nation-building that can unify its disparate groups.
‚ÄúIf all we have are winged horses from the Sumerian period to say we are Iraqis, then that is not a foundation for a state,‚Äù said Ahmed Rubaie, a guard at the Iraqi National Museum, which houses most of the country‚Äôs surviving priceless antiquities. ‚ÄúOutside these walls, you‚Äôll find nothing that has been built since British rule that commemorates the country like all of the things within these walls.‚Äù
Not far from the museum, Muhammed Amin Izzat has conducted Iraq‚Äôs national orchestra since Baghdad fell in 2003. It was one of the main institutions under Saddam, and has endured since while other citadels of state have withered. ‚ÄúWe are an institution which represents all Iraqis and we have never been a trumpet for anyone,‚Äù Izzat said. In 2012, a year of relative calm, he decided to assemble the orchestra in a public square in Baghdad. The symphony it played attracted expatriates from all over the world and was hailed as a moment when culture and unity transcended Iraq‚Äôs woes. ‚ÄúPeople wanted to come to us and enjoy the music and forget about what is happening in the street,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe Iraqis are people who love to live and want peace but our problems are caused by politicians who want to create division in order to rule.‚Äù Izzat said he too rued the lack of other symbols of Baghdad‚Äôs recent past. Occasionally he makes his way to the Shahbander cafe near the river‚Äôs edge, which has been a sanctuary for writers, poets, singers and painters for at least 70 years. For 51 of them, Haj Mohammed has run the cafe, which stands next to the site of a book fair that has been held most Fridays for all that time. The cafe‚Äôs walls are covered with photographs chronicling Iraq‚Äôs modern history ‚Äì a faded shot of Bell alongside an image of the coronation of Iraq‚Äôs last monarch, King Faisal. There are politicians at sports carnivals, tribesmen from the southern marshes and proud graduate classes.
Next to the entrance are five more contemporary photographs, of Haj Mohammed‚Äôs sons who were killed by a huge car bomb that targeted the book market eight years ago. ‚ÄúThis is all we have left. All around us is history,‚Äù he said, pointing at the framed memories as customers queue to pay for their tea. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just about our [family] history. This is about society. ‚ÄúAll that we knew has been overwhelmed since we were occupied by the Americans. We have felt like we were undressed. We don‚Äôt see people buying books or even textiles anymore. We no longer know what is coming for us, or when. Back in the 50s, we weren‚Äôt just living, we were competing with the rest of the world.‚Äù The book fair on Montanabe Street is not as popular as it was. Once a place where all manner of fiction classics could be picked up for small change, religious texts and comic books now seem more prolific, especially mid-week in summer on the eve of Ramadan. ‚ÄúBut you still won‚Äôt find anything else like it,‚Äù Haj Mohammed said. ‚ÄúIt needs to be protected.‚Äù In a palace on the edge of the Green Zone, General Abdul Amir al-Sammari, the man in charge of protecting Baghdad, was upbeat. There had been no major explosions in the capital for 10 days and the battle over the horizon had been going better lately. State security forces had played a role in the improvement, the general said, but the main contributors had been militia that work alongside the military and often take primacy over it.
Iraq‚Äôs security tsars largely endorse the role of the militias, known as the Popular Mobilisation Forces or locally as Hashd al-Shaabi. They are thought to number as many as 200,000 fighters, and nominally come under the authority of the prime minister‚Äôs office. Most of the groups are Shia. They are directly supported by Iran, and their authority is rooted in a call to arms from Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq‚Äôs top Shia cleric, last June. ‚ÄúFrom January to June last year, we were isolated and alone,‚Äù Sammari said of army units in Baghdad, which at the time were besieged by increasingly muscular Isis forces on Baghdad‚Äôs western outskirts. ‚ÄúThen came the fatwa of the marja [Iraq‚Äôs highest Shia religious authority]. As soon as that happened, the street was with us.‚Äù Last month, when Iraq‚Äôs military withdrew from Ramadi and allowed Isis to take full control of the city, the militias were sent to surround it. The pattern had already been set in smaller battles elsewhere in the country earlier this year. When the state fails, a parallel force steps into the fray. Sammari acknowledged that Iraq‚Äôs military has rarely had the upper hand against Isis, but claim ed cooperation was improving. ‚ÄúIt is true that lots of splits have happened that have weakened the morale of the military. We are trying to avoid the forces working as separate units and to unify. It is starting to happen.‚Äù The tussle for power between the ailing state forces and the ascendant irregulars clearly rankles security chiefs, as it does many of Iraq‚Äôs politicians.
‚ÄúAny nationalist must believe that the military is the strongest part of the state‚Äôs security,‚Äù said Sammari. ‚ÄúAnyone who says otherwise is delusional.‚Äù Asked about regular complaints from Iraq‚Äôs Sunnis, who lost power when Saddam was ousted, that the militias have consolidated the hold of their rival sect on the country, Sammari responded: ‚ÄúWhen will they accept that they lost?‚Äù On the other side of Baghdad in the district of Ghazaliya, the leader of the country‚Äôs largest Sunni institution has regularly warned of the dangers of the state being subjugated. Kutaiba al-Falahi, a spokesman for the Sunni waqf, said a failing political process was keeping Iraq‚Äôs disenfranchised Sunnis on the sidelines, allowing Isis to claim a role as their de facto representatives.
‚ÄúAnbar is outside state control and the Kurds aren‚Äôt interested in Iraq as it was drawn a century ago,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAlmost everyone we speak to wants a form of federalism. They want their basic needs met. The solution lies in real autonomy and authority for the provinces.‚Äù In Falluja , 20 miles west of Baghdad and the closest city to the capital held by the jihadis , a local doctor who uses the name Abu Saleh said hope of the state resuming control had evaporated. ‚ÄúI have no faith in the government, Sunni or Shia,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey are the ones who put us in the situation we are in now. The majority of people in Falluja aren‚Äôt with Isis, but some are tired and scared of the army. At least they have their homes now and their kids can go to school. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt want to be begging in the streets or begging the government to let them into Baghdad. If we had Sunni tribes who will come inside the city and fight Isis, we would feel safer.‚Äù Al-Falahi said the plight of refugees from Anbar showed the standing of the broader Sunni community in the eyes of the state. ‚ÄúWe are all being labelled [as Isis supporters ]. We need the government to look at us like humans. There are refugees [from Ramadi ] sitting at the gates of Baghdad and they are not allowed in - the old the young and the sick living in tents in this heat because they don‚Äôt trust us. It would be better if the Americans came back. We can‚Äôt run the country ourselves.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-23T11:04:15Z,world,World news,Lamb with jellyfish gene 'may have been deliberately sent to abattoir',"A lamb born with a jellyfish gene was mistakenly sold for human consumption and probably ended up on someone‚Äôs plate, French authorities have said. A dispute between researchers at a highly respected national institute may have been the cause of the animal being deliberately sent to the abattoir last year. Police have now been called in and an inquiry launched into how the lamb could have been passed as fit for human consumption. Le Parisien newspaper reported that the animal‚Äôs mother was a sheep called Emeraude whose DNA had been modified to include a jellyfish gene called Green Fluorescent Protein by researchers at the National Institute for Agronomic Research (INRA) in Paris. Her lamb, Rubis, was born with the gene in the spring of 2014. Although produced for research purposes, Rubis was allegedly deliberately mixed with several other lambs that had not been genetically modified and sent to an abattoir. The president of the INRA, Beno√Æt Malpaux, described the apparently ‚Äúmalicious act‚Äù as unacceptable, but was quick to reassure the public that there was no risk to humans. ‚ÄúThe consumption of this meat presents no risk for the health for the consumer,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are sure that individual acts that are unacceptable were committed ‚Ä¶ followed by a chain of errors and responsibilities within the hierarchy.‚Äù In what could have been the plot of a science fiction film, Emeraude and Rubis were reportedly part of a programme called Green Sheep launched in 2009, aimed at carrying out experiments on mammals for ‚Äútherapeutic research‚Äù. The jellyfish protein was reportedly introduced into the sheep to make their skin transparent and enable researchers to ‚Äúvisualise and study heart transplants‚Äù. Investigators suspect a researcher may have tricked his superior into signing a document sending the animal to the abattoir where it was sold to an unknown individual in November 2014. When the the team leader discovered the deception, he failed to report the missing animal to his bosses. Working relations between the two men were said to have been tense. Malpaux said a laboratory technician had been provisionally suspended and will face a disciplinary hearing in July. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know his motive or aim precisely, but the atmosphere within the team could be behind this behaviour,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe facts are unacceptable and call for the greatest severity. We are a world-renowned institute and we cannot tolerate such actions.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-23T10:57:56Z,world,World news,Japan's PM Shinzo Abe heckled at Okinawa battle anniversary event,"Japan‚Äôs prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has been heckled at an event marking the anniversary of the end of the bloodiest battle of the Pacific during the second world war, as criticism mounts over his attempts to allow Japanese troops to fight overseas for the first time in seven decades. Shouts of ‚ÄúGo home!‚Äù and ‚ÄúWarmonger!‚Äù could be heard as Abe, a nationalist whose attempts to reinterpret Japan‚Äôs pacifist constitution have sent his approval ratings to record lows, arrived at a ceremony on Tuesday to mark the end of the battle of Okinawa in which more than 200,000 civilians and soldiers died. On a day when 5,000 people, including the US ambassador to Japan, Caroline Kennedy, gathered in the town of Itoman on Okinawa‚Äôs southern tip to remember those who died in the 82-day battle, a poll revealed strong public opposition to Abe‚Äôs plans to strengthen the role of the country‚Äôs military. Criticism of Abe in Okinawa is running high over his support for the construction of a new US marine corps airbase on a pristine stretch of Okinawa‚Äôs coastline to replace an existing base located in the middle of a densely populated city. Okinawa‚Äôs governor, Takeshi Onaga, has vowed to block the plan, which would also involve the relocation of about 8,000 US troops and their families from the island to Guam and other US Pacific territories.
Abe, who appeared shaken by the rare display of public anger, acknowledged Okinawa‚Äôs role in maintaining Japan‚Äôs security since the end of the second world war. The island, located about 1,000 miles south of Tokyo, hosts more than half the 47,000 US troops in Japan and three-quarters of US bases, despite accounting for just 0.6% of Japan‚Äôs territory. ‚ÄúPeople in Okinawa have long been asked to carry a big burden for our security,‚Äù Abe said. ‚ÄúWe will continue to do our best to reduce it.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúWe must take pride in the path of peace we have single-mindedly walked in the last 70 years and make ceaseless efforts to establish world peace.‚Äù Abe was speaking near the spot where Japanese troops who had been ordered never to surrender forced terrified local people to throw themselves off cliffs rather than risk being captured by the Americans who, they were told, would rape and kill them. Survivors said that Japanese troops gave civilians two grenades each: the first was to be hurled at the invading enemy, and the second to be detonated in group suicides. The island is still littered with human remains and unexploded ordnance, said Naeko Teruya, a representative of the bereaved families. ‚ÄúSeventy years since the war has ended, we still feel that the war hasn‚Äôt truly ended,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe continue to find the scars of war in Okinawa today.‚Äù By the time the fighting ended, about 100,000 Okinawan civilians were dead, as well as 80,000 Japanese troops. At least 12,000 US soldiers also died in a battle that many believed offered a bloody foretaste of what could happen if the US attempted an invasion of the Japanese mainland.
Japan surrendered almost two months later, days after the US dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Onaga received a warmer welcome when he referred to the unfair military burden he and many islanders believe they have shouldered since Okinawa was handed back to Japanese control in 1972. He urged Abe to reconsider a 20-year-old agreement between Tokyo and Washington to build a new offshore runway on the island, saying his election as governor last year demonstrated the strength of public feeling against the move. ‚ÄúWe strongly demand that the government cancel construction ‚Ä¶ and review its policies of reducing Okinawa‚Äôs base burden once again,‚Äù he said. Okinawa‚Äôs strategically important role as a host to US military bases has taken on renewed importance amid anxiety over increasingly assertive Chinese claims to islands in the South and East China Seas. Some local people fear their island could once again be dragged into war if Abe pushes ahead with plans to reinterpret the US-authored pacifist constitution and allow Japanese troops to engage in collective self-defence ‚Äì or coming to the aid of an ally under attack.
Article 9 of the constitution prohibits Japan from threatening or using force as a means of settling international disputes. Successive administrations in Tokyo have interpreted that to mean that troops can only go into battle in defence of direct threats to Japanese territory. Abe‚Äôs quest to end that strictly defensive posture recently suffered a setback after three respected scholars said the changes were unconstitutional. Voters also appear to doubt Abe‚Äôs reassurances that the change would not increase the likelihood of Japanese troops becoming embroiled in US-led conflicts. A poll by the liberal Asahi Shimbun released on Tuesday showed support for the Abe cabinet at 39%, the lowest since he took office in late 2012. The newspaper attributed the slump to growing public opposition to Abe‚Äôs security bills. According to the poll, 53% of respondents oppose the new legislation, while 29% support it. The end of the Okinawan battle was marked as South Korean women who were forced to work as sex slaves for the Japanese army before and during the war said they would file a $20m (¬£12.7m) lawsuit next month at a US court to seek financial compensation from Tokyo. Ten surviving ‚Äúcomfort women‚Äù, led by 89-year-old Kim Bok-dong, will lodge the suit at a California district court on 1 July, according to their attorney. ‚ÄúThe Japanese government should offer an official and sincere apology for wrongdoings by their ancestors and restore our honour,‚Äù Kim told reporters outside the Japanese embassy in Seoul. Mainstream historians say up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, were forced into sexual slavery during the war. Japan insists all compensation claims were settled when the two countries normalised bilateral ties in 1965.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-23T10:36:55Z,world,World news,Queen's choice of Germany for state visit seen as diplomatic coup,"For several days, Germans have been fed a daily stream of instructions on what to do should they happen to meet the Queen. ‚ÄúIn the first instance, she is to be addressed as ‚ÄòYour Majesty‚Äô,‚Äù wrote the liberal daily the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, ‚Äúand thereafter with ‚ÄòMa‚Äôam‚Äô, to rhyme with ‚Äògram‚Äô.‚Äù And ‚Äúum Gottes willen, keine Selfies!‚Äù [for God‚Äôs sake, no selfies]. If such newspaper guides are anything to go by, Germany is taking Queen Elizabeth‚Äôs seventh official visit to Germany, which begins on Tuesday, extremely seriously. ‚ÄúLilac is a safe colour to wear if you meet her,‚Äù was another more specific crumb of advice in the tabloid Bild, which pointed out that it is also, appropriately, the tone that ‚Äúresults from mixing together the colours of the union jack‚Äù. Angela Merkel welcomed news of Her Majesty‚Äôs visit. ‚ÄúQueen Elizabeth is witness to the development of the relationship between Germany and Britain which is very friendly today,‚Äù the German chancellor said this week. And when she visits, ‚Äúit‚Äôs always a big event‚Äù. But as this is expected to be one of the 89-year-old monarch‚Äôs last state visits, the interest is more heightened than usual. That their country should be the choice of her final foreign port of call is seen as immensely flattering to the majority of Germans.
There has been much speculation in Germany as to the reasons, including her husband the Duke of Edinburgh‚Äôs German roots ‚Äì he was born into the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg and went to school in southern Germany ‚Äì and not least, her own strong German ancestry. Only during the first world war was the family name changed by her grandfather, George V, from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor.
But as the German socialite and most prominent royal watcher, Alexander, Count of Sch√∂nburg-Glauchau, pointed out to readers of Bild in a five-part series, Die Queen und die Deutschen: ‚ÄúIt is not the Queen who decides when and where she travels, but the British government ‚Ä¶ and Downing Street has very concrete reasons why it should want to send the Queen ‚Äì the secret weapon of British diplomacy ‚Äì to Germany.‚Äù Historians have been wheeled out in their droves to explain how her first, 11-day, 18-city visit in 1965 was seen as a major contribution to healing the wounds caused by the second world war. In Britain some critical voices called it an insult to Britain‚Äôs war dead. ‚ÄúIt was highly symbolic ‚Ä¶ a sign that Germany was once again being viewed as a normal country,‚Äù said historian Simone Derix, who has researched the topic in depth. At the same time there were fears among officials ‚Äúthat some Germans in their enthusiasm to see her would let slip a ‚Äòheil‚Äô,‚Äù she said. In the end, they shouted: ‚ÄúE-li-sa-beth!‚Äù In the following years, the cold war made her visits just as necessary, not least after prime minister Margaret Thatcher was quoted in 1987, two years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, as saying: ‚ÄúI love Germany so much, that I‚Äôm glad there are two of them.‚Äù Those wars may be over, and Germany long since reunited, but nowadays, said Sch√∂nburg, ‚Äúthe anxieties are quite similar‚Äù, namely ‚ÄúLondon‚Äôs fear of ‚Ä¶ an EU which fuses into a super-state, in which the individual states lose their independence.‚Äù
David Cameron‚Äôs decision to ‚Äúpiggy-back‚Äù on the visit, when he attends a state banquet with the Queen and the German president, Joachim Gauck, on Wednesday evening, has certainly raised eyebrows. Downing Street insists his trip follows an invitation from the German government. But observers in London and Berlin view it as a deliberate exercise to reinforce the countries‚Äô commonalities ahead of crucial EU talks Cameron is due to hold with Merkel over Britain‚Äôs future relationship with Brussels, before an in/out referendum on the UK‚Äôs membership in the EU.
Certainly, when the Queen is greeted by Merkel on the steps of her cuboid chancellery on Wednesday morning, the pictures will, hope diplomats on both sides, speak volumes about the British-German relationship. Merkel has said she will do all she can to try to keep Britain in the EU. Sch√∂nburg said: ‚ÄúThe Queen, simply through her very presence, is supposed to remind us Germans just how poor Europe would be without Britain.‚Äù One commentator from the leftwing paper Taz suggested that another effect of the encounter might be to finally put Merkel, often referred to as the ‚ÄúQueen of Europe‚Äù, in her place, because ‚Äúafter all, when Elizabeth became Queen, Merkel was not even born yet‚Äù. The packed schedule of the three-day visit will on Wednesday see the Queen and Prince Philip greeted with military honours by Gauck at his residence, Schloss Bellevue, before they take a boat up the river Spree to the chancellery, where the Queen will hold talks with Merkel, before laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. At the Technical University she will listen to the annual Queen‚Äôs lecture, this year delivered by the outgoing director of the British Museum, Neil MacGregor ‚Äì one of the most popular Britons in Germany since his curation last year of an exhibition on 600 years of German history, and the recent announcement that he will take over as a chief adviser on the contents of the new cultural palace in Berlin, the Humboldt Forum.
On Thursday, she will travel to Frankfurt, the country‚Äôs financial centre, where the underlying message will be the strong business ties between Britain and Germany, which many say would be threatened by a Brexit. But the most poignant item on the Queen‚Äôs schedule will undoubtedly be her first ever visit to a former concentration camp when she goes to Bergen-Belsen on Friday. The camp was liberated by British troops in April 1945.
The visit ‚Äì taking place at the Queen‚Äôs request, according to the British embassy ‚Äì will see her meet survivors and liberators of the camp. It is being kept deliberately low-key but again will usefully serve to reinforce the bond. Details of everything ‚Äì from what she and Philip will eat (guinea fowl and venison), where she‚Äôll sleep (the fact that his room is reportedly at the other end of the corridor from hers in Hotel Adlon), to the colour of her Bentley, which was transported to Berlin at the weekend ‚Äì are being pored over. One celebrity magazine claims to have seen the protocol note that says the Queen did not respond to the German query as to whether she preferred to take the lift rather than using the stairs. And her personal cook in the Adlon said, on being asked if there was any food she wished to avoid: ‚ÄúI was told anything goes, which I think is quite charming.‚Äù Everyone, from porcelain manufacturers to toy makers, is exploiting the event for all its worth. The Berlin branch of Lego has even produced a limited edition Queen figure. The fascination is easily explained, say German royal watchers, by the fact that the country does not have its own royal family to admire. From the butler who will serve her tea on her arrival at the Adlon, where the royal entourage will move into 70 rooms on two floors, to the organ grinders outside on Pariser Platz, everyone has their own memories of her last visit in 2004. And few have forgotten how she briefly fell asleep during a lecture on medicine and magnets in D√ºsseldorf, an incident which did nothing to lessen the love.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-23T10:31:11Z,world,World news,Rwanda complains after spy chief is held in London over alleged war crimes,"Rwanda has angrily condemned the arrest of the country‚Äôs intelligence chief, Karenzi Karake, by British authorities acting on a Spanish indictment. Louise Mushikiwabo, the Rwandan foreign minister, tweeted: ‚ÄúWestern solidarity in demeaning Africans is unacceptable!!‚Äù She suggested the arrest was a conspiracy by those who deny the 1994 genocide. ‚ÄúIt is an outrage to arrest Rwandan official based on pro-genocidaires lunacy!‚Äù Mushikiwabo also described the arrest warrant as preposterous. Karake, 54, known as ‚ÄúKK‚Äù, has for two decades been a senior intelligence and military officer in the Rwandan Patriotic Front. The RPF brought an end to the genocide by Hutu extremists that left an estimated 800,000 Tutsis dead. Karake and 39 others are accused of ordering revenge massacres of Hutus and the murder of three Spanish aid workers, according to a European arrest warrant issued by Spain in 2008, understood to be the basis for his detention by the Metropolitan police at Heathrow on Saturday. Johnston Busingye, Rwanda‚Äôs justice minister, told the country‚Äôs New Times newspaper: ‚ÄúWe are handling the matter with the UK government. They have better details on this evolving situation.‚Äù Karake had been on official duty in London for a week, the report added. Busingye dismissed the Spanish indictment as politically motivated. ‚ÄúI would be surprised if it is one the UK is acting on. We will contest in the courts. We have sought explanation from the UK on this matter as well.‚Äù
Williams Nkurunziza, the Rwandan high commissioner to the UK, told the BBC World Service: ‚ÄúWe take strong exception to the suggestion that he‚Äôs being arrested on war crimes. Any suggestion that any of our 40 leaders are guilty of crimes against humanity is an insult to our collective conscience.‚Äù Jordi Palou-Loverdos, however, a lawyer representing the Spanish victims, told the BBC‚Äôs Newsnight on Monday: ‚ÄúWe hope in the name of the victims that this time justice will be provided and Karenzi Karake will soon be delivered to the Spanish court to have a fair trial, where he can defend himself. ‚ÄúWe hope that political or other interests will not neutralise the place for justice, truth and reparation.‚Äù The arrest was also welcomed by Rwanda‚Äôs opposition FDU-Inkingi party. Its vice-president, Boniface Twagirimana, said: ‚ÄúIt is a sign of equal justice for those who have killed innocent people. If someone has been involved in crimes against humanity, it is good if he is brought before the law to explain himself. ‚ÄúIt is very difficult for us to have reconciliation without this ‚Ä¶ We cannot confirm if people are guilty or innocent. That is the job of the judge to confirm.‚Äù Andrew Mitchell, who worked closely with the Rwandan government while serving as Britain‚Äôs international development secretary, said the European arrest warrant system was being abused. He told BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Today programme: ‚ÄúThese are politically motivated. They are not about justice, they are about politics.
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be very clear, they are being pursued by supporters of the genocidal regime which murdered up to one million people in Rwanda. It is one of the great tragedies and disgraces of our time, only 21 years ago. ‚ÄúI think it is reprehensible that the European arrest warrant system should be abused in this way by a junior Spanish judge.‚Äù A 2008 diplomatic cable sent from the US embassy in Kigali and released by WikiLeaks dismissed the Spanish indictments as ‚Äúoutrageous and inaccurate‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe Spanish indictment of 40 Rwandan military officers offers an unrecognisable version of some of the most painful and violent episodes in Rwanda‚Äôs history,‚Äù said the cable, which described the allegations as ‚Äúa bloated political tract, sloppily organised and endlessly repetitive‚Äù. Karake is a former deputy chief of the UN-African Union peacekeeping force in Sudan‚Äôs Darfur region. Human Rights Watch criticised his appointment to the peacekeeping mission, alleging that he was responsible for the killing of civilians in the town of Kisangan in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in June 2000.
Karake has had mixed fortunes under president Paul Kagame‚Äôs rule. In 2010 he was placed under house arrest for misconduct, but was later released. He was a close friend of Patrick Karegeya, a former spy chief who became a dissident and was murdered in a South African hotel in late 2013. Karake, the director-general of Rwanda‚Äôs national intelligence and security services, appeared at Westminster magistrates court in London and was remanded in custody until Thursday. Madrid‚Äôs ability to prosecute him may be hampered by a law passed last year that severely limits judges‚Äô ability to prosecute crimes that occur outside Spain. Carina Tertsakian, Rwanda researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: ‚ÄúHis arrest is significant because he‚Äôs been a key senior member of Rwanda‚Äôs intelligence and military for the past 20 years. Victims of human rights violations in Rwanda have often cited his name. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to follow it closely. It could be a really important in terms of accountability. Many senior officials in Rwanda have never been held to account.‚Äù The Spanish link Karake stands accused of ordering the killing of three Spaniards ‚Äì Flors Sirera, Manuel Madrazo and Luis Valtue√±a ‚Äì in 1997. All three were members of the NGO M√©dicos del Mundo, and were allegedly murdered by four Tutsi soldiers after they had been taken to see the mass graves of murdered Hutus. A former member of Karake‚Äôs intelligence unit testified to the Spanish judge Fernando Andreu that Karake had ordered the killings because ‚Äúthese whites had sensitive information about the Rwandan Patriotic Front‚Äôs recent massacres‚Äù. In 2008 Andreu brought a case against Karake and 39 other military officials. Madrid‚Äôs ability to pursue Karake may be impeded by a law passed by the country‚Äôs conservative government last year that severely limits judges‚Äô ability to prosecute crimes that occur outside Spain under a system known as universal justice. The concept is rooted in the 1949 Geneva conventions and compels any signatory to provide effective sanctions against those accused of breaching the convention. Spain took the lead in applying universal justice after the concept was integrated into the Spanish judicial system in 1985, most famously with the arrest and attempted extradition of the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet from London in 1988. The government introduced reforms to the system last year, apparently to avoid conflict with China, which had been indicted over human rights abuses in Tibet. A government spokesman said universal jurisdiction had to be abolished because ‚Äúit only causes conflict‚Äù. A spokesman for Amnesty International in Spain described the reform as ‚Äúa backward step‚Äù for human rights. Not long after the new law was introduced, a number of international drug barons jailed in Spain successfully sued for their release, claiming that Spain had broken its own laws by acting outside its jurisdiction. The chances of prosecuting Karake would be much greater were he extradited and made to stand trial on Spanish soil, legal experts say. Four other Spaniards ‚Äì Joaquim Valmaj√≥, Servando Garc√≠a, Fernando de la Fuente and Isidro Uzkudun, all priests ‚Äì were also tortured and murdered by RPF members. The dismembered bodies of Valmaj√≥ and Garc√≠a were thrown into a well. Stephen Burgen in Barcelona",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-23T09:51:38Z,world,World news,Muslim human rights group accuses Kenyan government of harassment,"A Kenyan human rights group has accused the government of using anti-terror measures to crack down on its work, suggesting it has been targeted for exposing abuses by the security services. Muslim Human Rights (Muhuri) is to apply to the courts to unfreeze its bank accounts as part of an ongoing legal battle after it was placed it on a state list of ‚Äúterror suspects‚Äù in the wake of the recent al-Shabaab attack at Garissa university. The government lost the first round when a high court ruled earlier this month that Muhuri and another human rights group, Haki Africa, should be removed from the list. The two groups have criticised the country‚Äôs anti-terror policies, accusing the government of making arbitrary arrests and conducting extra-judicial killings. ‚ÄúWe are currently working with the Independent Policing Oversight Authority to follow up cases of extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances, and we think that has triggered the government‚Äôs heavy handed response,‚Äù a spokeswoman said. Following the death of 147 people in the attack on Garissa in April, 86 organisations and individuals were listed as terrorist organisations. The government says their finances are to be investigated. The list included Al Qaida, Boko Haram and Islamic state - alongside the NGOs and several money transfer organisations, Hawalas, which predominantly serve the Somali community. Thirteen of the hawalas are set to be reopened after Kenya‚Äôs president, Uhuru Kenyatta, ordered the Central Bank to lift their suspension because an investigation had cleared them of involvement in terror. However the bank accounts belonging to Muhuri and Haki Africa, both based in Mombasa, remain frozen. The judge who ordered that they be taken off the terror list dismissed an application to unfreeze them because the Central Bank of Kenya, which regulates banks, was not part of the case. In response, Muhuri will this week file an amended petition suing the Central Bank of Kenya and the Kenya Financial Reporting Centre for freezing its accounts. The spokeswoman said not being able to access its bank accounts had put Muhuri in dire financial straits. ‚ÄúWe have not paid salaries since April and we have had to negotiate with our suppliers to give us a grace period considering the unique circumstances and most have obliged. However, if our accounts remain frozen longer than this month, we will not be able to keep the lights on or the phones connected,‚Äù she saidd. ‚ÄúAll our donors have been very supportive although we haven‚Äôt been able to receive any funding from them due to the fact that the accounts are frozen. We expect everything to go back to normal once we are allowed access to our accounts,‚Äù she added. Human Rights Watch condemned the ‚Äúharassment and intimidation‚Äù of the ngos. ‚ÄúHaki Africa and Muhuri are working to protect human rights in Kenya under difficult circumstances,‚Äù said Leslie Lefkow, Human Rights Watch‚Äôs deputy Africa director, in a statement. ‚ÄúHaki Africa and Muhuri should be supported for their human rights work, not harassed and intimidated.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-23T08:46:23Z,world,World news,China finds an eager South American stablemate in Suriname,"It would be hard to imagine a more striking contrast. On the one hand, there is the massive Suriname Aluminium works, a subsidiary of the US giant Alcoa. It employs some 5,000 people. On the other hand, less than a kilometre down a tarmacked road in the industrial suburbs of Paramaribo, the capital of Suriname, Broad, a Chinese construction company housed in a corrugated iron shed, specialises in turnkey homes and offices. Two different worlds, almost face-to-face but travelling in opposite directions. On 1 July, after almost a century of operations, the management of the Suralco plant will be handing over the reins to a group of state-appointed managers. Broad started trading five months ago and Suriname‚Äôs President Desi Bouterse attended the official opening. His National Democratic party triumphed in the general election on 25 May, winning a comfortable majority. These entirely separate events are emblematic of the scale of the changes at work in this former Dutch colony, once seen as Uncle Sam‚Äôs backyard.
In less than 10 years the Chinese have set up hundreds of companies, shops, casinos and restaurants in this small South American state, which reaches deep into the Amazon jungle. They have widened and asphalted roads, and built social housing. A television channel, with staff of about 20, now broadcasts in Mandarin Chinese on Suriname networks. In 2011 the Southern Commercial Bank opened in Paramaribo. A group of Chinese businessmen has just bought out another one, the Fina Bank. Chinese nationals are now estimated to control around 90% of the country‚Äôs supermarkets, small grocery stores and food shops. All the main parties in the recent election fielded a prominently placed candidate of Chinese heritage. As in Africa, Beijing has unobtrusively but methodically established a foothold in this country of barely half a million people. Immigration has substantially increased since the late-1990s, adding (according to official sources) about 10,000 people to the existing Chinese community. Some observers see this presence as a rear base or testbed for Chinese ambitions in South America. ‚ÄúSuriname is a lucky country, such [a] small population, so much land,‚Äù the New York Times quoted Yuan Nansheng, a former Chinese ambassador to Suriname, as saying in 2011. The close ties his country enjoys with Bouterse, who 16 years ago was sentenced by a Dutch court in absentia to 11 years in prison for drug trafficking, were sealed with an official visit to Beijing in 2013. In the meantime China has gifted dozens of coaches to the Suriname military. A group of Chinese contractors clubbed together to build a magnificent office block, about 500 metres from the president‚Äôs palace. It now houses the foreign ministry. ‚ÄúThe Dutch government‚Äôs relationship with the Bouterse clan was turbulent, particularly when it suspended development aid. This prompted the regime‚Äôs top brass to look for other solutions,‚Äù says Winston Ramautarsing, a lecturer in economics at Anton de Kom University of Suriname. ‚ÄúCloser links with China, which is keen to find its place in the Amazon basin for obvious reasons, came about almost naturally. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs much the same trend everywhere, but given the size of our country and the way the authorities here have welcomed them with open arms, the Chinese presence is more visible,‚Äù he adds. Heading out of Paramaribo and into the country, you soon see the scale of this presence. On either side of the road are dozens of small timber-processing plants, factories producing roofing or sheet aluminium, with signs sporting Chinese ideograms or the owner‚Äôs name. In some places this influx of cheap labour has caused resentment, a cause taken up by Ronnie Brunswijk, leader of the General Liberation and Development party ABOP, now allied with Bouterse. ‚Äú[Chinese migrants] buy up all the street corners, help grow our economy, offering a range of competitively priced products, with a variety and quality of service we‚Äôve not seen before,‚Äù Ramautarsing explains. ‚ÄúBut their very low salaries and their visible or supposed success sometimes upset people.‚Äù In the centre of the capital, small food shops are mostly operated by families who have recently arrived from China. ‚ÄúThey call us ‚Äòsaltwater Chinese‚Äô, unlike the others who arrived here in the 19th century and have settled on farms further inland, close to freshwater rivers,‚Äù says one such shop worker named Lia. Sitting at her till, behind an array of iron bars, ‚Äúbecause attacks are frequent‚Äù, this young student helps her parents keep the shop open ‚Äúas long as possible‚Äù. ‚ÄúLife isn‚Äôt easy here,‚Äù she adds. ‚ÄúWe had to learn Dutch and Sranan Tongo [Suriname creole], cope with the violence, the climate too. But we‚Äôd never leave now.‚Äù This article appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-23T07:16:08Z,world,World news,Germany frees Al-Jazeera journalist Ahmed Mansour,"German authorities have released al-Jazeera journalist Ahmed Mansour without charge, after he was detained on Saturday by police at Berlin‚Äôs Tegel airport on an Egyptian arrest warrant. A spokesman for the state prosecutor said there were ‚Äúpolitical and diplomatic concerns that could not be ignored‚Äù in addition to the legal aspects of the case. These concerns, he said, were discussed with the Berlin state justice minister and the appropriate federal authorities. A lawyer for Mansour, who has dual Egyptian and British citizenship, told al-Jazeera that while his client was happy about the court‚Äôs decision, he was also sad that he had been detained. Questions remain as to why the German authorities arrested Mansour at the behest of Egypt‚Äôs military regime in the first place, and why they waited until he was at the point of leaving Germany to do so. There was considerable confusion over the warrant, which a German government spokesman said on Monday came via Interpol‚Äôs ‚Äúred notice‚Äù system, though both Mansour and Interpol said no such red notice exists against his name.
According to police spokesman Meik Gauer, the arresting officers at Tegel airport were answerable only to the federal police headquarters, not to Interpol. There also remains a question mark over why the police officers felt obliged to detain Mansour, given that Germany does not have an extradition agreement with Egypt. Cologne-based lawyer Nikolaos Gazeas told Zeit Online: ‚ÄúGermany is not under a legal obligation to extradite to Egypt. That is ultimately a political decision.‚Äù For that reason, legal commentators have suggested the warrant could not have been executed without consultation with the government. Last year, an Egyptian court convicted Mansour in absentia of torturing a lawyer in Tahrir Square in 2011 and sentenced him to 15 years in prison. Mansour rejected the charges, calling them ‚Äúa flimsy attempt at character assassination‚Äù. On Monday morning, a group calling itself the German-Egyptian Union for Democracy gathered about 100 protesters outside the Berlin jail where Mansour was being detained. They held signs that read: ‚ÄúFreedom for Ahmed Mansour. Freedom for Egypt. Freedom for journalists.‚Äù MPs across Germany‚Äôs main political parties had voiced concern over his detention. Among the most outspoken was the opposition Green party‚Äôs Franziska Brantner, who said in a statement on her website: ‚ÄúThe Berlin judiciary should under no circumstances allow itself to become a willing tool of the capricious regime in Cairo.‚Äù Egypt accuses both Qatar and al-Jazeera of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, which was branded a terrorist organisation after the military deposed Mohamed Morsi as president in 2013. Three journalists with al-Jazeera English spent more than 400 days in prison following their arrest in Cairo in late 2013. Their trial was regarded internationally as a farce. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, was criticised by opposition parties and rights groups for hosting the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, on a state visit this month. During the visit, the German industrial group Siemens signed an ‚Ç¨8bn deal with Egypt to supply gas and wind power plants. Since Sisi took power in 2013 and won a presidential election the following year, courts in Egypt have issued scores of death sentences against Muslim Brotherhood members including the group‚Äôs leadership.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-23T06:30:08Z,world,World news,Up for adventure: the ascent of rock climbing in the West Bank,"Rubaa Bledi, 16, is being lowered to the ground having completed her first rock climb. ‚ÄúI was trembling!‚Äù the Palestinian schoolgirl says breathlessly as she rests her head on her knees. Her face is hidden for a moment by her headscarf and helmet. ‚ÄúI wanted to know if I could do something risky,‚Äù she says when she recovers. ‚ÄúI wanted to know if I was up to the adventure.‚Äù It is Saturday and we‚Äôre on the cliffs of Ein Qiniya, a band of bulging orange limestone that fringes a valley full of thorn scrub and olive groves outside Ramallah, the de facto Palestinian capital of the West Bank. Rubaa is one of a group of about 20 Palestinians, including students and telecoms workers, attending a course run by Wadi Climbing, an initiative set up by two young Americans.
The participants have travelled from across the West Bank ‚Äì from nearby Ramallah, Jenin and Nablus ‚Äì to attempt a sport in its infancy in the occupied territories. Rubaa says her parents were anxious about her new pastime. ‚ÄúMy father didn‚Äôt want me to come,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúHe told me: ‚ÄòNext year you‚Äôll be in the 12th grade. It‚Äôs too important to be injured.‚Äô‚Äù But Rubaa was determined. ‚ÄúI kept asking and told him: ‚ÄòDaddy, I really want to come.‚Äô‚Äù In almost a year, about 500 people have attended Wadi Climbing‚Äôs courses, most Palestinian and 40% of them women. ‚ÄúSummer‚Äù Rushdi is older and more experienced. ‚ÄúA friend of my sister posted a link on Facebook and I knew I wanted to try it. And this is something people do in the rest of the world. That‚Äôs another reason why it is inviting,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAnd we are so involved with the reality of the [Israeli] occupation. It is all about the struggle. And it becomes part of our mentality. It is good to do what other people are doing elsewhere in the world, where people have the time and the opportunity to do different activities. That is why it is so good that this is also available to us now.‚Äù Most of those on the Wadi Climbing course are well-educated and speak fluent English. But later in the afternoon three Bedouin youths arrive. They are not part of the course, which costs about ¬£12 for a weekend of instruction, but borrow harnesses and shoes and get on to the rock.
One of the two founders of Wadi Climbing, Will Harris, explains its genesis. ‚ÄúMy partner Tim and I were living in Amman in Jordan and studying Arabic.‚Äù He says during a visit to the occupied Palestinian territories the pair were struck by the lack of recreational facilities. Much of the equipment provided on the course, including climbing shoes and harnesses, was sourced from the lost-and-found cupboards at two climbing walls in Colorado, where Wadi Climbing‚Äôs founders went to college. ‚ÄúWe came last July ‚Äì we had done a feasibility trip last January. People were overwhelmingly positive in their response so we moved here.‚Äù Wadi Climbing has developed two cliffs close to Ramallah and plans for the city‚Äôs first climbing wall are in the pipeline. The reality of the occupation is difficult to avoid, even in this quiet and pretty corner of the West Bank. In the distance a settlement and Israeli military tower are visible ‚Äì both factors have limited the development of climbing.
‚ÄúMost of climbing on the West Bank has been developed by Israeli climbers,‚Äù says Harris. ‚ÄúWhen we first came we only met one Palestinian climber. In comparison with the Palestinian territories, Israeli climbing is very active. The Israeli climbing club alone has some 3000 members. Most of that climbing on the West Bank is in Area C [ie under Israeli security control and administration]. And it is close to settlements. ‚ÄúIf you go to Ein Fara [a major climbing area for Israelis in an Israeli-controlled nature reserve in the occupied Palestinian territories between Jerusalem and Jericho] you either have to go through the neighbouring settlement and pay or you have a 40-minute walk. ‚ÄúWe recently took our first group of Palestinians into that Wadi by the walk-in access Palestinians are allowed to use. While we were on the trail two [Israeli] security guards approached us to ask where we had come from. We told them we were going to climb and they said it was OK.‚Äù They have received support from high-profile climbers, including Nina Caprez, from Switzerland, who was visiting on a sponsored trip and had inquired about the possibility of climbing in the Palestinian territories.
Harris tells the story of the young Bedouins who come to climb when he is running his courses. ‚ÄúFriday is their only day off and all they want to do is climb. Some of them work in construction in Rehan [a new Palestinian town being built on the ridge opposite the Ein Qiniya cliffs],‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThey can look over towards the cliff and if they see us they run across the valley to come climbing. These guys will be the future of Palestinian climbing.‚Äù Fifteen minutes after her first climb Rubaa is ready to try another. She asks if she can use the Guardian‚Äôs rope. This time she runs up the climb. When she returns to the ground all nervousness has gone. ‚ÄúThis is so much fun,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI want to come again.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-23T03:11:04Z,world,World news,"Killing Season: Labor's collapse was the worst I've ever seen, says British adviser","Former British cabinet minister Alan Milburn, who advised Australian Labor in the 2010 and 2013 election campaigns, delivers the final blunt verdict on Labor‚Äôs term in office in the ABC‚Äôs documentary series The Killing Season. ‚ÄúThe hard question that the Australian Labor party has to ask itself is this: how is it possible that you win an election in November 2007, on the scale that you do, with the goodwill that you have, with the permission that you are gifted by the public, and you manage to lose all that goodwill, to trash the permission and to find yourself out of office within just six years. ‚ÄúI have never seen anything quite like it in any country, anywhere, anytime in any part of the world. No one can escape blame for that in my view,‚Äù he said. But in a new chapter for her autobiography My Story, Julia Gillard rejects the idea that Labor‚Äôs constant leadership turmoil during its six years in office was particularly about her and Kevin Rudd, although she argues Australia‚Äôs concentrated media ownership might exacerbate Australia‚Äôs apparent preoccupation with leadership change.
She claims the fact Tony Abbott faced a leadership spill motion last February, at a time when he was under political pressure ‚Äúas near to zero as you can get‚Äù showed instability was caused by a range of new pressures on governments of all political persuasions in modern democracies. ‚ÄúUp until that point, those who are paid for their political commentary and expertise had largely concluded that the leadership changes between Kevin Rudd and me were best explained as being something to do with the nature of the Labor party and its factions and something to do with the characters of two individuals,‚Äù she writes. ‚ÄúI have sought to explain how this kind of analysis was always simplistic and slipshod. How it deliberately ignored internal turmoil in conservative governments, including the replacement of Ted Baillieu as premier of Victoria. The changing pattern of political incumbency had also been underscored by Queensland‚Äôs hugely dramatic repudiation of its one-term conservative government led by Campbell Newman and Victoria‚Äôs return to Labor, also after just one term. ‚ÄúNow, after the events of 9 February 2015, whatever one concludes about my story, the theory that this was all about Kevin, me and the Labor party cannot stand. This view has passed its use-by date. Contemporary reality has rendered it absurd.‚Äù She points to the changing nature of the media and the difficulties it poses for politicians, and Australia‚Äôs history of leadership rivalry. ‚ÄúLooking nationally, the dominant media narrative about leadership is that now we tend to instability, whereas earlier we did not. Yet history seems to be telling us otherwise. In reality, a metanarrative of Australian national politics for more than 30 years has been leadership tensions: Hawke and Keating; Howard and Abbott and his undeclared contenders. ‚ÄúWhat seems to be changing is not the underlying cycle but the speed at which it goes around. While we share so much in media and political culture with other democracies, it seems that in this area, we are at the head of the pack. Neither the United Kingdom nor Canada, despite having the Westminster system, has seen leadership become such a dominant narrative, prime minister after prime minister, government after government. No easy explanation presents itself as to why we should be so fixated. But the nature of our media market may offer some clues. Put simply, we live in one of the most concentrated media markets in the world.‚Äù At the conclusion of the third episode of The Killing season, Rudd suggests things could have been different. Asked whether he and Gillard were better as a team, he replies: ‚ÄúOf course we were, and we were a very effective team and I wanted her to succeed me, I really did.‚Äù But Gillard disagrees. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see what alternative reality was possible other than the ones we lived through. I think people are really wistfully hoping for something that was never going to be.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-23T02:01:58Z,world,World news,Julia Gillard exclusive interview: the timid ABC is rewarding Tony Abbott,"Julia Gillard has delivered a biting critique of the modern media for shallow, policy-light reporting, bias, inaccuracy and succumbing to ‚Äúbullying‚Äù, accusing the Daily Telegraph of ‚Äúintegrated bias‚Äù and the ABC of ‚Äúpulling its punches‚Äù for fear of more attacks by the Abbott government.
In a new chapter of her autobiography, My Story, and an exclusive interview with Guardian Australia, the former Labor prime minister contends that the media and Australia‚Äôs preoccupation with leadership destabilisation contribute to politicians‚Äô difficulties in arguing for increasingly necessary policy changes. The leader who in 2010 vowed to start showing Australian voters ‚Äúthe real Julia‚Äù describes what she calls a ‚Äúvicious cycle‚Äù of media preoccupation with gaffes or peripheral stumbles, leading to ever more tightly staged public appearances and even deeper voter disillusion. ‚ÄúThe very thing the public would most like to see ‚Äì spontaneity, deep ideas, a focus on the longer term ‚Äì is often the stuff least easy to portray in modern politics due to the nature of the media cycle,‚Äù she told Guardian Australia.
‚ÄúSo the public ends up feeling deprived, the media chides the politician for spin and hollowness, but the media is very rarely self-reflective about how its own practice may well be drawing out the spin and hollowness as opposed to the alternatives.‚Äù The new media cycle also rewards political negativity, she claims, benefiting Tony Abbott‚Äôs calculation in opposition to ‚Äúgo hard negative‚Äù. ‚ÄúThat kind of political calibration could have been easily made in an earlier age, but the political rewards for going simple and negative are greater in an accelerated media age that likes schlock and horror ... I think Tony Abbott‚Äôs style profits more easily in this time.‚Äù Freed from concerns about the ‚Äúindignant harrumphing‚Äù of her media targets, Gillard is also open in her opinions about different media outlets.
She writes that the Coalition‚Äôs ‚Äúbullying‚Äù of the ABC has ‚Äúpaid off‚Äù and the broadcaster frequently ‚Äúpussyfoots around potential criticism of the government‚Äù. In an interview from London, she told Guardian Australia she believed the Coalition‚Äôs early fierce attacks on the ABC‚Äôs news gathering had changed its approach. ‚ÄúI think there is such a sensitivity at the ABC to becoming the subject of more hard-hitting criticism from the government that there is a pulling of punches and I do think you can see that on the news ‚Ä¶ I watch it from time to time and I think there are clear occasions where there is not the sort of hard-hitting analysis that would have happened in different circumstances,‚Äù she says. Without passing judgment on the facts behind reports that asylum seekers had been burned while on a boat being turned back to Indonesia in 2014, Gillard says ‚Äúthe way in which the government hit hard at the ABC at that point, the way in which the ABC felt cowed enough to apologise effectively to the government, I thought that was telling you a story about the psychology in the ABC‚Äù. The former prime minister was also scathing about how quickly the radio broadcaster Alan Jones had been able to recover from the widespread condemnation of his remark that her father had ‚Äúdied of shame‚Äù ‚Äì for which Jones was forced to apologise ‚Äì saying it sent a message to young journalists that there were no limits to what could be said. ‚ÄúAlan Jones‚Äô comments did get a huge reaction, as they should, and it created a crisis for him and his show and the radio network, as it should, but here we are precious few years later and he is still on the radio, still earning considerable money to be on the radio, and the most senior politicians in the country regularly appear on his radio program, so it‚Äôs telling you there really is no line that you can‚Äôt cross and still be there in the media. ‚ÄúAnd so for any young cub reporter looking at that, what‚Äôs the lesson to be learned ‚Äì you might get a sharp reaction in the first instance but it will all be all right in the long term.‚Äù
She cites the Daily Telegraph‚Äôs front-page headline on the first day of the 2013 election campaign, ‚ÄúKick This Mob Out‚Äù, and the paper‚Äôs subsequent reporting, as an example of ‚Äúthe preparedness to integrate bias so fully into a newspaper that it ceases to play in any meaningful way the role of objectively bringing facts and balanced coverage to the attention of voters. Rather the paper is a vehicle for pushing a pre-established view.‚Äù And she writes that in Australia‚Äôs heavily concentrated media market, ‚Äúbias matters more, simply because there is less capacity to contest arguments and less diversity of commentary‚Äù. Gillard applauds comedy and the ‚Äúlarrikinism‚Äù that allows Australians to laugh at themselves, but questions whether constant ridicule invites voters not to take politicians seriously and asks why some types of ridicule appeared reserved for her ‚Äì like the ABC comedy series At Home with Julia in which actors playing her and her partner, Tim Mathieson, were portrayed having sex under an Australian flag. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve said I think the ABC crossed the line with that comedy series about me. I tried to take that as one that should be laughed through, but I thought where it got itself to was gratuitous and disrespectful and interestingly there has been no suggestion that the ABC would be producing such a comedy about the current prime minister so people might want to muse on that, why it was a Labor prime minister and the first woman and why it‚Äôs not the current prime minister.‚Äù Gillard also warned that the Abbott government‚Äôs pattern of holding royal commissions to inquire into their political opponents ‚Äì the royal commission into trade unions that called her to give evidence and has now called the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, and the royal commission into the pink batts program before which Kevin Rudd appeared ‚Äì set a dangerous precedent that could be used against the Coalition in the future.
‚ÄúThis is a shift in our political culture that‚Äôs been brought by the Abbott government, it‚Äôs an Americanisation ‚Äì intertwining judicial processes and political processes ‚Äì and, as is the way of politics, new weaponry does end up being adopted by all sides, so I suspect these won‚Äôt be the only royal commissions we see that look back at past government policy.‚Äù She says the development could deter people from becoming political advisers, given the cost of buying legal defence. ‚ÄúI think it would be a very bad circumstance in our politics if going to serve as a political staffer meant you were at risk of getting ensnared in various royal commissions and other processes and come out bankrupt. The government would say there is some legal aid support for people who are required to go before these commissions, but I know from my own experience that it is insufficient. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt complain for myself, I am a person of means. But I am concerned what it might mean for others.‚Äù Gillard cites the former Victorian premier Ted Baillieu as a ‚Äúreal-world example‚Äù of a politician who tried to ignore the demands of the media cycle. ‚ÄúHe deliberately decided to try to slow it down and ended up being chastised for not doing anything ... ultimately what happened to Premier Baillieu had a set of other explanations. It wasn‚Äôt solely a result of that, but I think the fact he ended up with a reputation as a do-nothing premier because he deliberately tried to slow down the cycle fed into issues about his leadership.‚Äù In her new chapter, 2015: Reflections on reform, she also: Points to a global loss of faith in democracy, citing the pace of economic change as one of the reasons, the ‚Äúshrieking‚Äù nature of the media and a tendency for readers to ‚Äúturn inward‚Äù in response.
Attacks journalists for criticising politicians‚Äô inability to mount a case for policy reform without assessing their own role in the process. ‚ÄúAmid all this bellowing comes the unedifying spectacle of newspaper columnists pontificating on the opinion page about the flaws of visionless, reform-shy politicians while the front page splashes gory headlines and drama-filled articles that degrade the ability of governments to reform. The ultimate irony presents when the same person, a reporter who also writes opinion pieces, smashes a reform conversation in a news piece and then, in their column, smashes politicians for not reforming. Overall it seems columnists are obsessed by the speck in a politician‚Äôs eye, ignoring the log in their own.‚Äù Criticises conservative commentators for ‚Äúcynically‚Äù misrepresenting the legacy of the Hawke and Keating governments to justify their own ideological preferences about future change, especially the deregulation of labour laws and ‚Äúto sneer at contemporary Labor being the enemy of reform‚Äù. Yearns for the day when ‚Äúa publication only extends the benefits of off-the-record quotes or views appearing in print to sources that genuinely would otherwise face some persecution or payback, not people who are using a cloak of anonymity for their own reasons‚Äù, for example backbenchers trying to stir leadership tensions. ‚ÄúOne ill-tempered comment from an anonymous backbencher is the easiest and quickest of content,‚Äù she says.
But despite all her criticism, Gillard said in her interview she was ‚Äúlong-term positive‚Äù about the capacity of the political system to achieve policy change, because of the ‚Äúpent up‚Äù need for reform and because she believes media consumers will emerge from the current era of ‚Äúclick freneticism ‚Ä¶ and say, ‚ÄòI am over the quick click now. I might do that for reports on Kim Kardashian or celebrity culture but, for things that really matter in the political culture I am going to look for more authoritative news sources.‚Äô ‚Äù ‚ÄúI think there will be a demand build up for deeper analysis, I think it will take some time for the market to sort itself out that way, but that will help us to bust out and find places to have deeper debate.‚Äù Gillard claims not to have watched the ABC‚Äôs The Killing Season series, which has included claims she could have done more to dissuade those plotting against Kevin Rudd and in favour of her before the leadership coup in 2010. She says she agreed to be interviewed for the series because she believed it would have been made with or without her participation. ‚ÄúI think for everyone who took part it was a difficult decision. I didn‚Äôt want the issues about leadership in the last Labor government to distract from my current colleagues‚Äô efforts ‚Ä¶ I thought about that very deeply, but the ABC was crystal clear that it would be made whether I participated or not. ‚ÄúOnce it‚Äôs crystal clear there is going to be that kind of show on air it becomes a question of whether you have your voice in it or not, on balance and in some ways with a bit of a heavy heart because I knew it would cause a distraction to the current colleagues, I thought it was better to have my voice in it than not, but it was a very difficult judgment.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-22T22:56:00Z,world,World news,Rwandan military general arrested in London in connection with war crimes,"One of Rwanda‚Äôs top military figures has been arrested in London in relation to alleged war crimes against civilians, police have said. Karenzi Karake, director general of Rwanda‚Äôs national intelligence and security services, was prevented from leaving the country on Saturday morning by the Metropolitan police extradition unit on behalf of authorities in Spain. ‚ÄúKarenzi Karake, 54, a Rwandan national appeared before Westminster magistrates‚Äô court on Saturday 20 June after being arrested on a European arrest warrant on behalf of the authorities in Spain, where he is wanted in connection with war crimes against civilians,‚Äù a Met spokesman said. Karake was remanded in custody and will reappear in court on Thursday. A Spanish judge indicted Karake in 2008 for alleged retributory war crimes in the years after the 1994 Rwandan genocide. He is accused of ordering massacres while head of Rwanda‚Äôs military intelligence between 1994 and 1997, and ordering the killing of three Spanish nationals working for the NGO M√©dicos del Mundo, the BBC reports. He is one of 40 current or former Rwandan military officials named on the indictment. Karake is a leading member of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the current ruling party of Rwanda, and fought in the civil war that preceded the genocide in which 800,000 Tutsi and politically moderate Hutus were killed. He was previously the deputy commander of the UN peacekeeping mission in Darfur, Sudan, a role which he left in 2009. Humanitarian campaigners Human Rights Watch had protested against his appointment, accusing him of orchestrating deadly attacks against civilians when Rwandan forces were fighting Uganda in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2000. It is thought Gen Karake had travelled to the UK on business earlier this month, and is said to have visited the country on previous occasions. Jordi Palou-Loverdos, a lawyer representing nine Spanish massacre victims, told BBC‚Äôs Newsnight: ‚ÄúWe hope in the name of the victims that this time justice will be provided and Karenzi Karake will soon be delivered to the Spanish court to have a fair trial, where he can defend himself. And we hope that political or other interests will not neutralise the place for justice, truth and reparation.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-22T20:34:09Z,world,World news,Former ambassador's bizarre attack on Obama lays bare strains in US-Israeli ties,"It‚Äôs a peculiar feature of American relations with Israel that more than a few senior diplomats posted from Jerusalem to Washington were once US citizens. The present Israeli ambassador, Ron Dermer, was born in Miami Beach and carried an American passport until he renounced it in 2005 in order to serve as the Jewish state‚Äôs economic envoy in DC. When Dermer lived in the US, before moving to Israel two decades ago, he was a Republican party operative. There is a view in the White House that he remains one as ambassador after Dermer colluded with Republican leaders to embarrass Barack Obama, most notably by engineering an extraordinary foreign intervention in American politics with the Israeli prime minister‚Äôs controversial speech to Congress to denounce the president‚Äôs Iran policy. Dermer‚Äôs predecessor as envoy in Washington, Michael Oren, has now created his own diplomatic uproar with a remarkable attack on Obama that appears at least partly rooted in his disillusionment with the president as leader of the land of Oren‚Äôs birth.
Oren, a New Yorker and US citizen until 2009 when he became ambassador, has stirred outrage by suggesting that the president is not a loyal American. He has also drawn accusations of ‚Äúpsychobabble‚Äù for arguing that Obama‚Äôs alleged hostility to Israel is because abandonment by his Muslim father has driven a craving to be accepted by his father‚Äôs ‚Äúco-religionists‚Äù. In extracts from a book to be published on Tuesday, Ally: My Journey Across the American-Israeli Divide, Oren accuses the president of policies that ‚Äúimperilled Israel‚Äù not least over Iran. He told an audience in New York on Sunday that the book is intended to mobilise American opinion ahead of the deadline next week for an ‚Äúemphatically bad‚Äù US nuclear deal with Iran reached over the objections of Israel. Oren wrote in the book of how disturbed he was that Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúclosest ally had entreated with our deadliest enemy on an existential issue without so much as informing us‚Äù. Oren, who is now a member of Israel‚Äôs parliament, writes that Obama is soft on terrorism, a claim open to challenge from those on the end of US drone attacks. He also paints the president‚Äôs advisers as infected with ‚Äúneo-Marxist ideas‚Äù from studies at American universities. Oren, who was ambassador to the US until 2013, has promoted the book with a blitz of opinion pieces and interviews, including one in the Wall Street Journal under the headline, How Obama Abandoned Israel. He describes relations between the US and Israel as ‚Äúin tatters‚Äù in part after the president dared to demand Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu halt the inexorable expansion of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories which has done so much to undermine the prospects of peace and a Palestinian state. Tellingly, Oren says in an interview about the book with the Times of Israel that the creation of a Palestinian state is ‚Äúunrealistic‚Äù but that Israel should keep up the diplomatic pretence of supporting one. That is widely considered to be the true position of Netanyahu who promised voters before this year‚Äôs Israeli election that he would not permit the creation of a Palestinian state but, under US criticism, claimed to have altered his position after he was re-elected. Oren writes that he has tried to understand why the president acts as he does and came to the conclusion that it is because Obama does not believe in American exceptionalism. That leads the former Israeli ambassador to perhaps his most incendiary charge, that the president is somehow disloyal to the US. ‚ÄúMore alarming for me still were Obama‚Äôs attitudes towards America. Vainly, I scoured Dreams from My Father (Obama‚Äôs first book) for some expression of reverence, even respect, for the country its author would someday lead. Instead, the book criticizes Americans for their capitalism and consumer culture, for despoiling their environment and maintaining antiquated power structures. Traveling abroad, they exhibited ‚Äòignorance and arrogance‚Äô‚Äì the very shortcomings the president‚Äôs critics assigned to him,‚Äù writes Oren, according to an excerpt released to the rightwing Breitbart.
Oren drew more fire over an article in Foreign Policy on Friday which said that Obama has been hard on Israel and more sympathetic to the Arab world in part because his father and stepfather were Muslim. ‚ÄúI could imagine how a child raised by a Christian mother might see himself as a natural bridge between her two Muslim husbands. I could also speculate how that child‚Äôs abandonment by those men could lead him, many years later, to seek acceptance by their co-religionists,‚Äù he wrote. Yair Lapid, former finance minister and leader of the Yesh Atid party, told Israel radio that Oren‚Äôs claim of Muslim influence on the US president was ‚Äúutter nonsense‚Äù and ‚Äúpseudo-psychological analysis not based on anything‚Äù. The head of the strongly pro-Israel Anti Defamation League, Abe Foxman, accused Oren of veering ‚Äúinto the realm of conspiracy theories‚Äù. ‚ÄúWith an element of amateur psychoanalysis he links US policies in the Middle East to the president‚Äôs personal history of having a Muslim father. Then, taking it a step further by suggesting this ‚Äúworldview‚Äù of Muslims and Islam has driven the president to embrace the Muslim world at the expense of both Israel and US national security interests. This results in borderline stereotyping and insensitivity,‚Äù said Foxman. Oren offers an insight into how deep the tensions between Obama and Netanyahu were, and also how powerless the White House was to influence the Israeli leader. The former ambassador reveals an incident in which the then US ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, threatened to withdraw Washington‚Äôs unswerving support for Israel in the security council unless Netanyahu stopped the relentless construction of Jewish settlements which is a major factor in preventing a peace agreement. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt appreciate the fact that we defend you night and day, tell us,‚Äù admonished Rice. The Israeli government has sought to distance itself from Oren even though there is little doubt that his book reflects the betrayal some of its leaders feel toward Obama. It has said that the former ambassador largely played a ‚Äúpublic diplomacy‚Äù role in Washington and was out of the loop on many of the more important negotiations with the US. The deputy foreign minister, Tzipi Hotovely, said that Oren only represents himself, not the government. ‚ÄúThe United States is a true friend of Israel and every attempt to harm the relationship between the two countries by resorting to personal attacks will not succeed,‚Äù she told the Israeli website Walla News. Haaretz reported that the US ambassador in Tel Aviv, Dan Shapiro, took him to task over the book and subsequent articles. The newspaper said Shapiro appealed to Netanyahu to issue a public statement repudiating Oren‚Äôs claims but that the Israeli prime minister refused. Oren defended the book to the Times of Israel as ‚Äúa cri de coeur ‚Ä¶ for an alliance that should be in a much better place than it is‚Äù. Perhaps hoping to avoid giving more publicity to Oren‚Äôs book, the White House has so far declined to comment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-22T18:45:58Z,world,World news,"UK police need 24/7 counter-terror 'hotline' with Turkey, says Keith Vaz","British police must urgently set up round-the-clock communications with their counterparts in Turkey to stop Britons crossing into territory controlled by Islamic State, a prominent MP has said. Keith Vaz, chair of the home affairs select committee, made the demands after meeting the husbands of two of three sisters who are feared to have travelled to Syria with their children to join the terror group. Bradford-born sisters Khadija Dawood, 30, Sugra Dawood, 34, and Zohra Dawood, 33, and their nine children, aged between three and 15, are feared to have travelled via Istanbul after visiting Saudi Arabia for a religious pilgrimage.
Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, met Sugra‚Äôs husband, Akhtar Iqbal, and Mohammad Shoaib, husband of Khadija, to discuss the situation on Monday. A lawyer acting for the men wrote to Vaz over the weekend accusing UK police of beingcomplicit in the alleged ‚Äúgrooming and radicalising‚Äù of the three Bradford sisters, saying the husbands were ‚Äúextremely disappointed with the manner in which this matter is being investigated by West Yorkshire police‚Äù. Following the meeting on Monday Vaz said in a statement: ‚ÄúI met today with the fathers and their legal representatives for one and a quarter hours. They were clearly heartbroken, and want to be reunited with their wives and children as soon as possible. ‚ÄúThey expressed serious concerns about how the police have dealt with their wives over a number of months. I will be meeting with the Counter Terror Unit from the region tomorrow.‚Äù Vaz said there were a number of urgent measures that should be put in place.
‚ÄúFirstly, we need a hotline between the UK and Istanbul. Isis work on a 24/7 basis and our Consulate in Istanbul must also work continuously. We cannot continue to rely on emails. Rather like the Bethnal Green case, the system needs to cope better with these urgent cases,‚Äù he said, referring to the Bethnal Green teenagers who ran away together to Turkey and are believed to have joined Isis. ‚ÄúSecondly,‚Äù wrote Vaz, ‚Äúthe police need to meet with the fathers at a senior level urgently to clear the lines of communication. ‚ÄúThirdly, the prime minister is right that we must bring an end to the ‚Äòfinger pointing‚Äô. This is a fight for hearts and minds of British citizens being groomed by Isis. Our efforts need to be led by the families and communities.‚Äù Last week the men‚Äôs lawyer told the Guardian that the Met police had just one counter-terror officer in Turkey. In response, Scotland Yard said the officer in Turkey had extremely limited scope and acted only in cooperation with the local authorities, inferring that families may have unrealistic expectations about what police could do once their relatives had left the UK. ‚ÄúWe have no powers in that jurisdiction, we can‚Äôt go over to other countries and start setting up offices,‚Äù a spokesperson said. ‚ÄúThe officer‚Äôs job is to liaise with the Turkish authorities once he is given information and has built up good contacts with the relevant people in order to gain information for investigations here. ‚ÄúWe rely on the Turkish police and we have a good relationship with them which has had good results in a number of cases in recent weeks. But beyond that is not realistic.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-22T18:01:57Z,world,World news,Cabinet Office and FCO divided over flying rainbow flag,"The rainbow flag will fly over the Cabinet Office to mark this week‚Äôs gay pride celebrations, Matthew Hancock has announced, putting him at odds with his colleague, foreign secretary Philip Hammond, who refused to do the same. The Cabinet Office minister announced the decision on Twitter, posting a picture of the rainbow flag flying over the building adjacent to Downing Street on Whitehall in central London.
Hancock, the MP for West Suffolk, said in a statement that civil servants across the country would be joining in the celebrations this week and that ‚Äúflying the flag shows that pride in our LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] community is shared at the most senior levels of Whitehall‚Äù. The announcement comes a week after Hammond was widely criticised for refusing to fly the flag over the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and forbidding British embassies abroad from flying the flag, saying it was a ‚Äúlongstanding policy‚Äù to fly only the union jack, national flags and the flags of overseas territories. ‚ÄúThe union flag always takes priority and is flown from the FCO‚Äôs main flag pole at all times,‚Äù said a spokesperson for the FCO. ‚ÄúIt is never substituted for another flag.‚Äù The FCO said on Monday that the Cabinet Office‚Äôs decision would not affect their own. Hammond‚Äôs position was a departure from that of the former foreign secretary William Hague, who agreed to the fly the flag during last year‚Äôs gay pride celebrations ‚Äì which take place every year to campaign for the freedoms of LGBT people. British embassies in Paris, Oslo, Tel Aviv and Santiago are among those to have previously flown the rainbow flag to mark their local gay pride celebrations. Hammond is one of four cabinet ministers not to have voted in favour of equal marriage, arguing that there was no demand for it and that there was ‚Äúa real sense of anger among many people who are married that any government thinks it has the ability to change the definition of an institution like marriage‚Äù. Oliver Letwin, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said of the Cabinet Office‚Äôs decision: ‚ÄúWe are delighted to join with the LGBT community in celebrating Pride this weekend, and will be flying our flag at the heart of Whitehall. We have committed to governing one nation, bringing people together and flying the flag this week shows our pride in and solidarity with the LGBT community.‚Äù The rainbow flag symbolises lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender pride. Its red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet horizontal stripes represent the diversity of the LGBT community. Thousands of people are expected to congregate in central London on Saturday for the capital‚Äôs annual gay rights parade, Pride in London. Hancock‚Äôs announcement on Twitter prompted a swift reaction from a number of Labour figures. Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant responded by asking why Hammond had forbidden embassies from raising the flag. Wes Streeting, the new MP for Ilford North and a rising star in the Labour party, said: ‚ÄúIt would be peculiar enough for different departments to take a different approach to flying a rainbow flag, but what‚Äôs bizarre about this decision is that it reverses the position adopted by William Hague.‚Äù Streeting, who used to be head of education at Stonewall, a leading gay rights organisation, said the inconsistency of approach sent ‚Äúa worrying message to those who worried that a majority Tory government would turn the clock back on equality‚Äù. A Stonewall spokesperson welcomed the Cabinet Office‚Äôs decision to show ‚Äúits support for Pride in London and the LGBT community‚Äù. ‚ÄúFlying the rainbow flag is really important for people to see ‚Äì especially young people,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúMore than 75,000 young LGBT people will be bullied this year just for being who they are, so having such prominent displays of support for the LGBT community is important and very welcome.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-22T17:57:27Z,world,World news,Crisis is the new normal for weary Greeks,"As the ‚Äúlast-chance‚Äù talks rolled on towards another ‚Äúlast-ditch‚Äù summit possibly at the end of this week, weary Greeks have deadline fatigue. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, we‚Äôve become hardened and accustomed to all this, including the never-ending talks,‚Äù said Christos Griogoriades, a physics and IT teacher in Greece‚Äôs northern second city of Thessaloniki. Panic about so-called ‚Äúknife-edge‚Äù, ‚Äúlife-or-death‚Äù negotiations has become so commonplace that it is almost meaningless to a population whose major concerns are still making ends meet and scrimping for enough to eat. Griogoriades, 42, has friends who have lost good jobs and are now living back in their parents‚Äô rural northern villages, supporting their young children on ‚Ç¨40 a month and homegrown vegetables. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to the point where people here look at others, saying: ‚ÄòOK, I think I‚Äôve got it bad but that man over there is eating from a garbage can.‚Äô This is going to be our reality for many years, and I think the worst is yet to come.‚Äù His parents had lived through extreme post-war poverty and knew how to live very frugally. He felt the younger generation now felt condemned to live through an economic crisis that could stretch on for decades.
With the Greek crisis now dragging on longer than the first world war, there have been at least a dozen emergency summits since 2009. The nation has so often been described as perched ‚Äúon the edge of a cliff‚Äù and ‚Äústaring into the abyss‚Äù that it has become part of the depressing new normality, just like cash-strapped hospitals, rocketing unemployment or the families with children living in flats with no running water or electricity because they cannot pay the bills. Thessaloniki, which has long had the country‚Äôs highest jobless rates, now has 65% youth unemployment and around a third of the general workforce out of work. But unemployment is only part of the picture. Greece has around 1.5 million jobless, but a further one million people get up every day to go to work in jobs where bosses fail to pay them promptly. Salaries can trickle in three months late or even take a year to arrive in bank accounts. This means half the Greek workforce has no income.
Meanwhile, whole families can depend for survival on grandparents‚Äô shrinking pensions. While the emergency talks focus on immediate debt and repayments, many Greeks feel that little will help their daily struggle in the grim economic landscape. The uncertainty of the recent months, with people still unsure whether there could be capital controls, have left businesses in limbo, worried about payments to suppliers, and a general mood of exhaustion. ‚ÄúThe problem is that all these solutions being offered are not long-term solutions, and in the long term there seems to be no way out of the mess of a constantly shrinking economy,‚Äù said Eleanna Ioannidou, an environmental lawyer and Green councillor in Thessaloniki. ‚ÄúAll the solutions are based on how to get more money not how are we going to create money and create our own growth in the Greek economy.‚Äù She said she felt that in a sense, despite round after round of crisis talks, the country was still stuck in its old ways. She said she found it disappointing that the radical left Syriza, for example, had not increased taxes on the church. With four children and a husband who is unemployed, Ioannidou has had her electricity cut off twice because she couldn‚Äôt pay the bill. She used to work mostly in environmental law, but said clients now couldn‚Äôt afford to pay or to fight big corporations, and she was handling an increasing number of divorce cases, particularly couples with young children whose breakups were rooted in financial trouble and the economic crisis.
Her husband used to run a small hotel catering to Greek tourists on the island of Evia, but after a drop in internal tourism by Greeks it had made no profit for the last three years and now only opens two months a year. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how much longer Greeks can hang on,‚Äù she said. Panos Gramatikopoulous, 19, a politics student from Lefkas, shrugged at the thought of another few days of summit wrangling. ‚ÄúThis crisis has gone on for years and, for my generation, it feels like it‚Äôs going to go on forever. I can‚Äôt see an end to it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe economic crisis is present everywhere, every day in anything I do ‚Äì from shopping to studying. I do follow the talks but we‚Äôve been here so many times before and no solution seems to be an improvement on the last.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-22T17:41:09Z,world,World news,UN report on Gaza war likely to bolster international criminal court inquiry,"The UN‚Äôs inquiry into the 2014 Gaza war issues a rallying call for suspected war criminals ‚Äúat all levels of the political and military establishments‚Äù to be brought to justice, but as the report itself wearily concedes, that is unlikely to happen soon. However, the report is likely to bolster the international criminal court‚Äôs preliminary examination of last summer‚Äôs conflict, increasing the likelihood that a full investigation will eventually follow.
The UN commission identifies a culture of impunity surrounding Palestinian militant groups and the Israeli military alike, and the immediate reaction from both camps suggests this culture will remain highly resistant to change. Hamas welcomed the report but noted only how it applied to the Israeli occupation, ignoring its finding on potential Palestinian abuses. Binyamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials rejected the report as inherently biased on the grounds that it had been commissioned by the UN human rights council. ‚ÄúYou can see the reactions of the prime minister [Netanyahu] and other ministers, dismissing the implications of this report because it came from the human rights council,‚Äù said Yael Stein, research director of B‚ÄôTselem, an Israeli human rights organisation. ‚ÄúAnd there are problems with the council. But nobody is looking at what is actually written in this report. They just close the discussion.‚Äù While there is little prospect of any greater procedural restraint being imposed on the operations of militant groups in Gaza, Israel is evaluating the findings of an earlier inquiry on the use of military force, known as the Turkel commission. However, those recommendations principally refer to the workings of the Military Advocate General office inside the Israeli military, and rights groups say none of the reforms would give it jurisdiction over senior officers or politicians. ‚ÄúEven if all the Turkel recommendations were implemented, we think it would have no effect on the ground,‚Äù Stein said. ‚ÄúThe bottom line is that the whole system is not built for accountability.‚Äù In the absence of meaningful internal change, the UN report looks to potential legal intervention from outside. It calls on the international community to ‚Äúexercise universal jurisdiction to try international crimes in national courts‚Äù. This is a reference to the capability of prosecutors in some European countries to issue arrest warrants based on allegations of war crimes or crimes against humanity committed elsewhere. It was the principle behind the detention of the Chilean ex-dictator, Augusto Pinochet, in London in 1998, acting on a Spanish request, and it was the reason Israeli ministers were wary of travelling to Britain five years ago. But since then, universal jurisdiction guidelines have been tightened in the UK and several other European countries in a way that makes them less potentially threatening to Israeli ministers. The main impact of the new UN report is likely to be felt indirectly through the momentum it gives the ICC preliminary examination into the Gaza conflict, started earlier this year. A spokeswoman for the court in The Hague said prosecutors there were studying the commission‚Äôs findings.
‚ÄúThe preliminary examination is still ongoing. It is an independent and impartial process; and the office [of the prosecutor] continues to gather information from multiple reliable sources, which will assist it in arriving at a fully informed decision at the end of the process,‚Äù the spokeswoman said in an email. Unconfirmed reports in Israel said ICC investigators were expected to travel to Gaza next month. Fred Abrahams, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: ‚ÄúThe report‚Äôs conclusions on the failures of Israel and Hamas to seriously investigate alleged war crimes will likely get the ICC‚Äôs immediate attention.‚Äù However, David Bosco, the author of a book on the ICC, predicted it could be a long time until the ICC examination became a fully fledged investigation. ‚ÄúA five- or six-month preliminary examination is not all that unusual. but in the end I would expect that this preliminary examination would last much longer than many others, in part because of the political and institutional backdrop,‚Äù said Bosco, who is an assistant professor at American University in Washington. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs worth noting that Palestine itself has still not formally referred its situation to the court, although the court has jurisdiction. The prosecutor may take that as a sign that Palestinian leaders are uncertain about whether they actually want a full investigation. And that may increase the prosecutor‚Äôs hesitation.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-22T17:38:38Z,world,World news,Moroccan gay men to serve four months for posing close together for photograph,"Two Moroccan gay men have been sentenced to four months each in jail after they were arrested for standing too close to one another as they posed for a photograph in front of a historic site in Rabat. Lahcen, 38, and Mohsine, 25, whose surnames the Guardian is not publishing in order to protect their identities, were found guilty on Friday of homosexuality and obscenity, in a trial described by activists as grossly unfair. Under Morocco‚Äôs anti-gay laws, they were also condemned to pay a fine of 500 dirhams (¬£33). The pair were jailed earlier this month after holding each other for a photograph near Hassan tower, Rabat‚Äôs famous minaret, and a popular tourist spot. The men were sightseeing and taking pictures as Lahcen, who is from Rabat, showed the capital to Mohsine, who was on his first visit to the city from his hometown of Marrakech in the west of the country. ‚ÄúThese men will be spending the next months behind bars for one, and only one, reason: being gay,‚Äù said Aswat Collective, a prominent LGBT group in Morocco, which has campaigned for their release. ‚ÄúWe are outraged by this injustice.‚Äù Their arrest coincided with heightened sensitivities in Morocco about pro-LGBT activities. In last week‚Äôs issue of Maroc Hebdo magazine, it asked on its cover: ‚ÄúShould we burn gays?‚Äù The gay rights debate has polarised Moroccan society, which is still heavily rooted in conservative attitudes. Mohsine and Lahcen‚Äôs case has been linked to a separate incident that took place at Hassan tower a day before their arrest. Two topless French activists, from the feminist group Femen, were arrested and immediately deported from Morocco after kissing each other in the same place in Rabat. The authorities suspect that Mohsine and Lahcen were copying the French activists, something that the men have since denied. Femen‚Äôs protest act has caused outrage among conservative Moroccans, prompting protests in front of the French embassy in Rabat. ‚ÄúThis is Rabat, not Paris,‚Äù demonstrators shouted. Mohsine and Lahcen have allegedly been subject to physical and mental abuse while in jail, said Aswat. A number of journalists were denied access to the trial. Aswat has also condemned the Moroccan ministry of interior for revealing the identities of the two men on national television, which has led to demonstrations in front of their families‚Äô houses. Lahcen‚Äôs mother has expressed fear for her son‚Äôs ability to survive in Morocco after his release from prison, now that his identity has been made public, Aswat said. ‚ÄúThe sentencing of Lahcen and Mohsine to four months in jail is a tragic reminder that discriminatory laws have real consequences,‚Äù said Andre Banks, executive director of All Out, a global movement for equality, referring to article 489 of Morocco‚Äôs penal code which requires six months‚Äô to three years‚Äô imprisonment for homosexuality. ‚ÄúWe will continue to work with our partners in Morocco until both innocent men are free ‚Äì and until being gay is no longer a crime. No country should imprison its citizens because of who they love,‚Äù said Banks. More than 55,000 have signed All Out‚Äôs online petition, urging the Moroccan authorities to release Mohsine and Lahcen. The human rights campaigner, Peter Tatchell, said their detention fit the recent pattern of crackdown on LGBT activists in Morocco and was likely to damage the country‚Äôs international reputation as a tourist destination. ‚ÄúThere seems to be an escalating crackdown on gay and bisexual men in Morocco. A moral panic is being whipped up about homosexuality, aided by sections of the media,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThese are just the latest of several arrests in recent months. In this case, and some others, there is no evidence of same-sex acts. Lahcen and Mohsine appear to have been arrested for the mere expression of affection, which is technically not a crime under Moroccan law.‚Äù Tatchell added: ‚ÄúMale homosexuality is widespread in Morocco. Until recently there was a de facto toleration of same-sex relations, providing they were private and hidden. The intensifying repression coincides with more gay Moroccans coming out and the emergence of online gay publications and chat rooms.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-22T17:38:04Z,world,World news,Accademia della Crusca: saving Italian one bastardised word at a time,"Name: Accademia della Crusca. Age: Old. Established in 1583, it‚Äôs the oldest language academy in the world. Location: Florence, of course, home of Italian culture. Motto: ‚ÄúIl pi√π bel fior ne coglie.‚Äù Which means ... ‚ÄúShe gathers the fairest flower.‚Äù And what does that mean? No idea. It‚Äôs a line from Petrarch. Lost in translation, perhaps. What‚Äôs the meaning of ‚ÄúCrusca‚Äù? Bran, strangely enough. They see themselves as linguistic sifters. Does Italian need sifting? The academicians, sort of a linguistic Ukip, reckon so. They are mortified by the way English words are despoiling the beauties of Italian and are planning a fightback. Starting when? Today. Oggi. Well done. Oggi, oggi, oggi. Less well done. What‚Äôs the plan? The academy‚Äôs chief, Claudio Marazzini, has called a summit and is promising to set up a quick-response unit to ‚Äúgo after politicians, bureaucrats and journalists who bring English words into our language‚Äù. What sort of words are worrying them? The communications expert Annamaria Testa, who started the campaign last year, enumerated hundreds, including austerity, chewing gum, download, outsourcing, public relations, politically correct, taskforce, welfare and wishful thinking. Management jargon was especially singled out. The Italian navy then made matters worse by using the slogan ‚ÄúBe cool and join the navy‚Äù. The last straw was prime minister Matteo Renzi tabling a ‚Äújobs act‚Äù. Instead of? La legge sul lavoro. Ah, naturalmente. Yep. Anyway, a petition to ban ‚ÄúItalianglo‚Äù has attracted 70,000 signatories. And quite a few signoras, too, presumably? Indeed. The academicians want to dispatch Italians who use hybrid versions of English words to a particularly fiery circle of hell. Such as? ‚ÄúFooting‚Äù for jogging, ‚Äúbaby parking‚Äù for creche, ‚Äúsexy shop‚Äù for sex shop, ‚Äúmister‚Äù for football manager, ‚Äúbox‚Äù for garage. Can the academicians win? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too late to do something about ‚Äòcar sharing‚Äô,‚Äù admits Marazzini, ‚Äúbut we need to find Italian words in a hurry for ‚Äòquantitative easing‚Äô.‚Äù Alleggerimento quantitativo? OK, we can all use Google Translate. Not to be confused with: The war on Franglais. Do mention: Dante, Ariosto, Boccaccio, Calvino, Machiavelli, Pirandello, Umberto Eco.

2015-06-22T15:21:54Z,world,World news,UK anti-austerity protest - your pictures,"Tens of thousands marched through London and Glasgow on Saturday to protest against the Conservative‚Äôs government‚Äôs ongoing commitment to austerity. We received hundreds of images and stories from the day via GuardianWitness. We have rounded up some of the highlights and themes that emerged from the banners, placards and stories that marchers shared with us. 1) Marchers gather in the city of London
2) Left-wing politicians on the march Charlotte Church and the inevitable Russell Brand were the celebrity voice of the protest, which the former giving a notably stirring speech at parliament square. But politicians of a left wing persuasion were also present, with Labour leadership hopeful Jeremy Corbyn and Greens stalwart Caroline Lucas among those spotted by our readers.
3) The NHS The fear of further cuts to the NHS was a big focal point on Saturday‚Äôs rally, with health workers making their point with wit and style.
4) Crafty ways of getting your message across Alongside the banners and signs provided by The People‚Äôs Assembly Against Austerity and the assorted protest and campaign groups, there were a startling number of home made offerings, from cross-stitch to the simply cross.
5) Animals against austerity The members of the animal kingdom were well represented at Saturday‚Äôs march, with plenty of dogs drawing attention to various causes. Even grumpy cat made an appearance, albeit in placard form.
6) The silly and the serious Rules of British protest marches: there will always be at least one protester referencing Father Ted, and there‚Äôll be some exceedingly twee and unlikely demands. But surely we can all get behind scones not drones.
7) Members of the government turning up to protest (sort of) David Cameron and George Osborne both took time out from their busy schedules to lend their support to the march. Cameron in particular seemed to be everywhere - and occasionally dressed as a crab. He was spotted clapping his claws to the speeches in parliament square, before making his way (sideways) back to Downing Street.
8) Fuck the fucking fuckers This isn‚Äôt the first time the colourful fuck the fucking fuckers collective have been spotted on a protest march, but they do seem to be growing in number.
9) Swearing generally It was a very sweary protest.
10) The more polite approach Well. These things are relative.
11) Dressing up for the cause
12) Goths against austerity Various goth factions were spotted along the march - ‚Äúthe blackest block,‚Äù as one person on Twitter commented. Goths are particularly common in the north of England, an area particularly hit by the government‚Äôs austerity agenda.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-22T15:03:15Z,world,World news,Only a third of the EU is governed by the centre-left,"These are challenging times for Europe‚Äôs centre-left parties. Since last year‚Äôs European parliament elections, where the centre-right European People‚Äôs party (EPP) emerged as the largest bloc, there have been 13 parliamentary and presidential elections in the EU. Of these, the centre-left has won only one ‚Äì in Sweden. Following the ousting of Denmark‚Äôs centre-left government last Thursday, only a third of the EU‚Äôs population of 503 million is now led by a centre-left head of government or state. Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, France, Italy, Malta, Slovakia and Sweden are the only EU members that are on the centre-left.
Defining the political orientation of a government isn‚Äôt as straightforward as it may initially sound. First, different voting systems make coalitions more likely in some countries than in others. Second, the distribution and separation of powers between the head of government (the prime minister) and the head of state (usually the president, or a monarch) differs across the continent. And third, every pundit will have their own definition of what it means to be centre-left. However, one definition that can be used is membership of the European council, the EU institution that comprises the heads of state or government of the 28 member states. And political positioning defined by affiliation in the European parliament. Based on this definition, the eight countries on the centre-left together comprise about 32.5% of the EU‚Äôs population. Even including Romania, where there have been disputes in the past between the president‚Äôs and the prime minister‚Äôs offices on who should attend the council, would take the tally to 36% of the EU‚Äôs population. One explanation for the changing political landscape in Europe is, of course, the nature of electoral cycles. In fact, after the previous Danish election in 2011, the landscape was even more dire for Europe‚Äôs centre-left. Back then, only 14.5% of the 28 countries‚Äô total population was led by the centre-left. Following the vote before that, though, in 2007, it was nearly 45%.
With elections coming up later this year in Portugal and Spain, the centre-left might have the opportunity to rebalance the scales slightly. In Portugal, the Socialist party led by Ant√≥nio Costa has a small lead in the polls. And in Spain, although the conservative People‚Äôs party was the largest party in recent local elections (and leads in the national polls), it is set to lose half its regional governments due to the combined support for the socialist PSOE and leftwing Podemos. If a similar result were repeated at the general election, a fragmented parliament may spell the end to Mariano Rajoy‚Äôs four years in office. On the other hand, elections in Poland, also due later this year, will provide little solace for the centre-left. The contest there is between the centre-right Civic Platform (PO) and the more conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-22T13:45:10Z,world,World news,UN accuses Israel and Hamas of possible war crimes during 2014 Gaza conflict,"A United Nations inquiry into the 2014 Gaza war has accused Israeli and Palestinian factions of multiple potential violations of international law including suspected war crimes. Calling on Israel to ‚Äúbreak with its lamentable track record‚Äù and hold wrongdoers responsible, the hard-hitting report commissioned by the UN human rights council lays most of the blame for Israel‚Äôs suspected violations at the feet of the country‚Äôs political and military leadership. The commission ‚Äì chaired by a former New York supreme court judge, Mary McGowan Davis ‚Äì says leaders should have been aware as the war progressed that their failure to change course was leading to mounting civilian casualties. ‚ÄúThose responsible for suspected violations of international law at all levels of the political and military establishments must be brought to justice,‚Äù it says.
Israel, which refused to co-operate with the inquiry, said on Monday the report failed to recognise the ‚Äúprofound difference‚Äù between ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äôs moral behaviour‚Äù and the ‚Äúterror organisations‚Äù it confronted. Denying that Israel commits war crimes, Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said: ‚ÄúThe report is biased. The commission that wrote it is under a committee that does everything but protect human rights.‚Äù Hamas also rejected the findings. A senior official, Ghazi Hamad, said on Monday that its rockets and mortars were aimed at Israeli military sites, not at civilians. The report accuses both Hamas and the Israeli military of breaches of international law in the way they fought the conflict. The UN commission says it gathered ‚Äúsubstantial information pointing to serious violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law‚Äù by both sides.
Israel began its offensive last July in response to heavy rocket fire from Hamas and other militant groups. More than 2,200 Palestinians, including hundreds of civilians, were killed during the fighting, according to UN and Palestinian officials, while 73 people ‚Äì the vast majority military personnel ‚Äì died on the Israeli side. Hamas and other Palestinian factions are accused of using indiscriminate rocket and mortar fire and of the murder of alleged Palestinian collaborators. The report‚Äôs authors say: ‚ÄúThe use of rockets in the possession of Palestinian armed groups, indiscriminate in nature, and any targeted mortar attack against civilians constitute violations of international humanitarian law, in particular of the fundamental principle of distinction, which may amount to a war crime.‚Äù For its part, Israel faces charges that it potentially breached international law in multiple areas of the conduct of its war, including the targeting of residential homes with precision, the excessive use of artillery in civilian areas, and the loosening of troops‚Äô rules of engagement such as the use of the Hannibal Protocol in Rafah. The report calls on Israel to provide further details of its ‚Äútargeting decisions‚Äù, saying this would allow for further independent assessment of its conduct in Gaza.
The report also questions Israel‚Äôs claims to have gone above and beyond the requirements of international law in warning civilians of impending attacks, noting that warnings were either ineffective at the time or that civilians had nowhere to flee to. ‚ÄúThe commission recognises that the general warnings issued by the Israel Defence Forces saved lives. At the same time, these warnings were often used in a context where people fleeing were unable to identify a safe place to go owing to the unpredictability of many attacks over a lengthy period of time.‚Äù In particular, it points out that at times 44% of the coastal strip was either under an evacuation order or attack, leaving many with no safe place to go. On the issue of the targeting of residential homes with precision weapons, the report examined 15 specific cases in which 216 people were killed, including 115 children and 50 women. The report‚Äôs authors could find no reason to explain why in six cases houses has been attacked. It notes: ‚ÄúMany of the incidents took place in the evening or at dawn, when families gathered for iftar and suhhur, the Ramadan meals, or at night, when people were asleep. The timing of the attacks increased the likelihood that many people, often entire families, would be at home. Attacking residential buildings rendered women particularly vulnerable to death and injury. ‚ÄúIn six of the cases examined by the commission, and in most cases reported on by non-governmental organisations, there is little or no information available to explain why residential buildings, which are prima facie civilian objects immune from attack, were considered to be legitimate military objectives.‚Äù The report concludes: ‚ÄúIn many incidents, however, the weapons used, the timing of attacks, and the fact that the targets were located in densely populated areas indicate that the Israel Defence Forces may not have done everything feasible to avoid or limit civilian casualties. ‚ÄúIsrael should provide specific information on the effective contribution of a given house or inhabitant to military action and the clear advantage to be gained by the attack. Should a strike directly and intentionally target a house in the absence of a specific military objective, this would amount to a violation of the principle of distinction. It may also constitute a direct attack against civilian objects or civilians, a war crime under international criminal law.‚Äù
On the question of Israeli ground operations, the report also voices serious misgivings after investigating massive use of artillery fire against Shuja‚Äôiya, Khuzaa and Rafah. It remarks: ‚ÄúDuring the ground operations, the Israel Defence Forces used explosive weapons extensively in densely populated areas of Gaza.‚Äù It adds that such use was ‚Äúhighly likely to constitute a violation of the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks. Such use may, depending on the circumstances, qualify as a direct attack against civilians, and may therefore amount to a war crime.
‚ÄúIn addition, the fact that the Israel Defence Forces did not modify the manner in which they conducted their operations after initial episodes of shelling resulted in a large number of civilian deaths indicates that their policies governing the use of artillery in densely populated areas may not be in conformity with international humanitarian law.‚Äù The report also examines the use of firepower in instances when Israeli troops were under threat, arguing that the balance between force protection and the requirement to protect civilians was seriously compromised. ‚ÄúThe commission believes that the military culture created by such policy priorities may have been a factor contributing to the decision to unleash massive firepower in Rafah and Shuja‚Äôiya, in utter disregard of its devastating impact on the civilian population. Moreover, applying this protocol in the context of a densely populated environment through the use of heavy weaponry predictably leads to violations of the principles of distinction and proportionality.‚Äù McGowan Davis, the chair of the UN commission, said: ‚ÄúThe extent of the devastation and human suffering in Gaza was unprecedented and will impact generations to come. There is also ongoing fear in Israel among communities who come under regular threat.‚Äù
Netanyahu said Israel did not commit war crimes. ‚ÄúIsrael is defending itself from a murderous terrorist organisation that calls for its destruction and which has perpetrated many war crimes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAny country that wants to live would have acted this way. But the commission expects a country, the citizens of which have been attacked by thousands of missiles, to sit idly by. We will not sit, and have not sat, idly by. We will continue to take strong and determined action against all those who try to attack us and our citizens, and we will do so in accordance with international law.‚Äù
A spokesman for Israel‚Äôs foreign ministry said: ‚ÄúIt is well known that the entire process that led to the production of this report was politically motivated and morally flawed from the outset. ‚ÄúIt is regrettable that the report fails to recognise the profound difference between Israel‚Äôs moral behaviour during Operation Protective Edge and the terror organisations it confronted.‚Äù Before the report‚Äôs publication, Israel had gone on a media offensive, producing its own report, which found no fault with its conduct in Gaza.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-22T13:32:38Z,world,World news,Performers in 'palace revolt' against director of  Norway's national opera,"Norway‚Äôs national opera opened to worldwide acclaim in 2008, its gleaming marble home on the banks of the Oslo fjord making a bold and optimistic statement about the future. But, behind the ice-cool facade, tensions in recent weeks have been boiling over in an off-stage drama in which the opera‚Äôs staff have been compared to the Hebrew slaves singing for freedom in Verdi‚Äôs Nabucco. Singers and musicians have staged ‚Äúa palace revolt‚Äù against the director, Per Boye Hansen, who in turn has rallied support from opera stars across Europe and hinted at a ‚ÄúKafka-like‚Äù vendetta against him. Each side has traded allegations in the media, revealing a violent clash of egos and ambitions in the world of classical opera. The very public washing of dirty linen was triggered by a surprise announcement from the board in May that Hansen, against his wishes, had been told to leave when his contract expires in two years‚Äô time. The Norway opera‚Äôs internationally renowned boss has faced artistic criticism from a conservative cultural establishment, but also from his staff, who have baulked at his allegedly autocratic leadership style. The criticism has exasperated the cognoscenti, according to whom Hansen is quite simply one of Europe‚Äôs finest cultural leaders. In a letter to Norway‚Äôs government, 16 international opera figures pleaded for the 57-year-old to stay on after 2017, arguing that his devoted efforts in his homeland had made the Norwegian national opera one of the leading ensembles outside Scandinavia.
Eivind Gullberg Jensen, one of Norway‚Äôs best-known classical conductors, said he was shocked Hansen would have to go so soon. ‚ÄúHe has barely begun, and he has done a brilliant job so far,‚Äù he told the Guardian. Pianist Leif Ove Andsnes said Hansen‚Äôs departure was ‚Äúincomprehensible‚Äù, after he had set the opera house on the map internationally. However, from inside the opera itself, a different story has emerged. Ellen Horn, the opera board‚Äôs outgoing chairman, said Hansen had been a ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù opera director who had lifted it into an international league. But the board had received reports of concern from staff, which it had investigated, she said.
Anonymous comments from staff appeared in Norwegian media alleging that Hansen was manipulative, uncompromising and prone to outbursts. For three years, they had endured a moody and self-centred boss, according to an opinion piece in the newspaper Dagbladet by lecturer and musician, √òystein Imsen. Hansen responded with a seven-page letter that was leaked to the press, in which he claimed he had not been told of ‚Äúa single verifiable, concrete event or action that supports allegations of misconduct or unacceptable management style from my side‚Äù. He told the Aftenposten newspaper: ‚ÄúCreating art is not an exercise in democracy.‚Äù The row has focused attention on Hansen‚Äôs artistic achievements. Calling on the director to quit immediately, the tenor √òystein Wiik said he could not understand why Hansen‚Äôs production of Offenbach‚Äôs Tales of Hoffmann had been ‚Äúset in a landfill‚Äù, with Hoffmann himself ‚Äústaggering around drunk and a bottle of whiskey glued to his hand‚Äù. Hansen had staged several ‚Äúoffbeat‚Äù productions with provocative, tasteless antics, said Henning H√∏holt, editor of online reviews magazine Kulturkompasset. ‚ÄúHe thought Norway was ready for that. But he can‚Äôt just take his friends from Germany up here and expect we will also say ‚ÄòHow wonderful!‚Äô. People don‚Äôt want to see it.‚Äù
Paul Curran, Hansen‚Äôs predecessor as director of the Norway opera, resigned six months before his contract expired after a disagreement with the chief executive. There has been ‚Äúan awful lot of criticism‚Äù at every level, Curran said. Numerous former colleagues at the opera had said they had written a letter to the chief executive, Nils Are Karstad Lys√∏. ‚ÄúThis was effectively a vote of no confidence, they couldn‚Äôt work with Hansen. It was a palace revolt.‚Äù But Curran also pointed to the very different workplace culture in Norway, in which there is a strong ethos of fairness and ‚ÄúJanteloven‚Äù, or the law of Jante ‚Äì a Scandinavian phenomenon where no one can be considered to be better than anyone else and everyone, including the cleaners, must have an equal say. ‚ÄúIt is harder to run an opera house in Norway than in Berlin,‚Äù Jensen said, ‚Äúbecause in Germany, a leader is expected to use their power combined with very good artistic leadership. In Norway, if you stick your face too far forward you somehow have to pay for it.‚Äù
Baritone Espen Landvik, representing soloists at the opera, wrote on his blog that since Norway abolished its aristocracy in 1814 its society had had a flat structure, ‚Äúand it‚Äôs not so easy to swallow for many‚Äù. The opera director is at the top and has ultimate control, but a production should be the result of collaboration with the performing artists based on cooperation and mutual respect, Landvik added. Jan Koop, a German cellist and steward for the MFO musicians‚Äô union at the opera, said employees in Norway enjoyed stronger workplace rights, so an opera director couldn‚Äôt just come in and change everything. ‚ÄúThe board has had to look at what the employees need to deliver high quality,‚Äù Koop said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs probably a bigger issue here than abroad, because employees are better protected and better organised ‚Äì and we dare to speak up about problems.‚Äù Hansen, Lys√∏, Horn and Landvik declined to comment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-22T13:25:56Z,world,World news,Taliban attack parliament building in Kabul with suicide car bomb and RPGs,"Two people, including a child, died when Taliban fighters attacked the Afghan parliament building in Kabul, injuring dozens of civilians and forcing lawmakers to evacuate amid gunfire and explosions. The Taliban claimed responsibility only minutes after the attack on Monday, which unfolded after a suicide car bomber blew themselves up outside the parliament gates and six other attackers tried to storm the building. When parliament guards pushed the attackers back, the insurgents retreated to an empty building under construction, from where they fired rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns at the parliament, said police spokesman Abdurrahman Rahimi. Police said two civilians, a woman and a child, were killed in the attack, which left a thick plume of smoke hanging over the parliament complex and tore a huge crater in an adjoining street. At the time of the attack, lawmakers were gathered to vote on the nomination of a new defence minister. Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahed, told the Guardian that the insurgents picked the time and location of the attack because of the presence of many high-level officials. Mohammad Aref Rahmani, a parliamentarian in the building at the time, said the blast could be felt inside and parts of the ceiling fell down. ‚ÄúThere was dust all over the room. After that, we heard explosions from RPGs and lighter weapons, like Kalashnikovs and machine guns,‚Äù he said. Fawzia Koofi, another lawmaker, said the security forces were slow to respond. ‚ÄúWe went to the basement but we didn‚Äôt see any security forces. We went to the basement ourselves,‚Äù she said. After 30 minutes, she and other parliamentarians were able to get inside their armoured vehicles to drive to safety. ‚ÄúThe enemies of Afghanistan would like to harm our democracy. We are not armed people, we are just talking,‚Äù Koofi said. Kabir Amiri, a spokesman for Kabul hospitals, told the Guardian that 31 civilians had been injured in the attack. The attack follows recent incidents which have rattled the Afghan capital. On 14 May, gunmen killed 14 people, including nine foreigners, when they stormed a guesthouse in central Kabul. Two weeks later, on 26 May, gunmen attacked another guesthouse, housing dozens of foreign contractors, but luckily this time there were no fatalities. The parliament attack is also a sign of division within the insurgency. Some leaders seem open to reconciliation but others are less convinced that opting for a role in the established political system is the way to go. While recent attacks intensify on the ground in Afghanistan, Taliban leaders based in Qatar have been meeting informally with people close to the Afghan government, including female lawmakers, in attempts to restart peace talks. The Pakistani government condemned the attack, saying in a statement that it commended the Afghan security forces. ‚ÄúWe stand with our Afghan brothers in our common struggle against terrorism,‚Äù the statement said. The insurgents, who rejected a proposal from clerics to impose a ceasefire during the fasting month of Ramadan, have been emboldened by last year‚Äôs withdrawal of foreign troops, and by the prolonged deadlock in the new government, which has been unable to appoint people for many key security positions. Over the weekend, in the north of the country, Taliban forces took control of Chardara district in Kunduz province, which has borne the brunt of the Taliban‚Äôs annual fighting season. Speaker hailed for calm reaction
In the aftermath of the attack, the Afghan parliament‚Äôs speaker, Abdul Rauf Ibrahimi, has emerged as something of a hero. Video recordings show Ibrahimi remaining exceptionally calm, as dust from the explosions and gunfire rises around him, and lawmakers scatter for safety. Ibrahimi, who was speaking to parliamentarians gathered to vote on the government‚Äôs nomination for a new defence minister, initially attempted to continue his speech before being led away by security personnel. He was about to introduce the second vice president and defence minister nominee Mohammad Masoom Stanekzai, when the attack occurred. The speaker proceeded to calmly escort lawmakers out of the building, causing users on social media to hail his courage.

2015-06-22T13:15:55Z,world,World news,Christian charity to train UK churches in protecting against Isis attack,"A British charity that provides assistance to Christians in predominantly Muslim countries is hosting a training session in London on Tuesday to advise UK churches on protecting their premises and congregations against an attack by Islamic State militants. The Barnabas Fund, which says it offers ‚Äúpractical aid for the persecuted church‚Äù, has invited more than 50 church leaders to participate in the half-day session at Westminster‚Äôs Central Hall, to be led by the charity‚Äôs international director, Patrick Sookhdeo. Police representatives will be present to give advice. An email with the subject line ‚ÄúProtecting British churches from terrorist attack‚Äù warns: ‚ÄúGiven the dramatic growth of IS in the Middle East and the increased anti-Christian rhetoric and attacks from that group, plus the recently thwarted attempts to attack churches in Paris, the possibility of an Isis attack on British churches cannot be discounted.‚Äù The email ‚Äì leaked to the Church Times and seen by the Guardian ‚Äì continues: ‚ÄúThe meeting will consider critical vulnerabilities and how these can best be mitigated. It will include practical advice for realistic measures that local church leadership can adopt to protect their congregations and buildings without causing undue alarm or hindering a congregation‚Äôs ministry and outreach.‚Äù Sookhdeo, a former adviser on Islam to the Ministry of Defence, said the conference was being held against a backdrop of ‚Äúgrowing anti-Christian persecution, where terrorist organisations are increasingly focusing on Christian communities‚Äù. He added: ‚ÄúExtremists are trying to stir up inter-religious strife, sectarian conflict.‚Äù Church leaders would be urged to work closely with law enforcement agencies and security services, he said. ‚ÄúChurches are vulnerable places because they are open places. The advice we give is to work closely with the police in the area and also with the local imam. What we want is to build community cohesion.‚Äù Sookhdeo cited as causes for concern the arrest in April of a Muslim man in France who was suspected of planning attacks on churches, and the murder last week of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, which illustrated the vulnerability of churches. The Barnabas Fund had planned the conference as ‚Äúa confidential, closed-door meeting, not to be made public. Now it has become a public issue. It‚Äôs not us here creating the problem.‚Äù According to Charlie Winter of the Quilliam Foundation, a counter-extremism thinktank, the conference ‚Äúcould send the wrong message‚Äù in exacerbating tensions between Christians and Muslims in the UK. ‚ÄúBut this is what Isis has been working towards ‚Äì making people scared and feeling they are targets.‚Äù Winter added: ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen or heard anything to suggest that churches in the UK are being targeted by Isis.‚Äù A spokesman for the Church of England declined to comment before the conference. The Barnabas Fund was established in 1990 ‚Äúto send financial support to projects which help Christians where they suffer discrimination, oppression and persecution as a consequence of their faith‚Äù, according to its website. It lists 22 countries in which it is working to help Christians, including Syria, Egypt, Pakistan and Iran.

2015-06-22T12:43:56Z,world,World news,EU launches naval operation to monitor Libyan people smugglers,"The European Union claims it has turned a new page in its efforts to tackle the Mediterranean migration crisis, as officials announced the long-awaited start of surveillance-based naval operations against Libyan people smugglers. Fifteen ships, aircraft and drones from at least 10 EU countries will be used to monitor the activity of smuggling boats carrying migrants from Libya to Italy. Their mission will be to decide whether it will be possible to mount full-scale combat operations against the smugglers in future, amid concerns from migration specialists about the precision of the information that will be gathered.
The vessels will operate outside of Libyan waters, an EU diplomat said on Monday, as military operations have a go-ahead neither from the UN, nor from Libya‚Äôs two rival governments. In a separate EU initiative, an intelligence hub has also been set up in Sicily to help collate the information gathered and to interview recent migrant arrivals about the smuggling process. The EU‚Äôs foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said the mission was just one part of a ‚Äúholistic‚Äù plan to solve migration, with other initiatives underway to tackle the root causes of the largest wave of mass migration since the second world war. But rights activists warned that any enlarged military mission might harm the very people the EU says it wants to help, and migration specialists questioned the use of intelligence gathered so far from Libyan territory. Mogherini said: ‚ÄúThe EU has never taken the issue of migration as seriously as we are doing now. With this operation, we are targeting the business model of those who benefit from the misery of migrants. But it‚Äôs only a part of a broader strategy, including the cooperation with our partners in Africa ‚Ä¶ to contribute to save lives, dismantle the networks of the smugglers of human beings and address the root causes of migration.‚Äù But campaigners warned against prioritising military operations more than helping the migrants themselves. Judith Sunderland, the author of a recent Human Rights Watch report on Mediterranean migration, said: ‚ÄúRight now it‚Äôs just surveillance, which is fine. We understand the legitimate interest in getting info on how smuggling networks operate. But our main message is that any use of force against smugglers has to be calibrated to ensure the lives and safety and rights of asylum seekers and migrants who are in the hands of smuggling.‚Äù Concerns rose after the UK withdrew the 176-metre HMS Bulwark from search-and-rescue operations this weekend, replaced it with the 90-metre HMS Enterprise and admitted that the latter vessel‚Äôs focus would be ‚Äúintelligence-led‚Äù. Sunderland added: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a reminder that we have to remain vigilant. As soon as countries think they can, they will emulate the UK and reduce their commitment in the Mediterranean and the death toll may rise once more.‚Äù Researchers investigating smuggling networks in Libya also questioned the effectiveness of conducting intelligence efforts from outside of the country‚Äôs borders. Tuesday Reitano, head of the secretariat at the Global Initiative against Transnational Organised Crime, is compiling an extensive report for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, on the same subject. She argues that the EU‚Äôs surveillance operation will ‚Äústruggle to add value‚Äù unless it is conducted in Libya itself, or in the countries that migrants pass through to reach its borders. Reitano said: ‚ÄúThe majority of the flow through Sicily now is sub-Saharan migrants, mainly west Africans, who are using a series of ad hoc community-based trafficking networks that are transacting in cash or hawala [an informal system of money transfer] for the most part and moving through inaccessible parts of the Sahara and southern Libya. There are few, if any, ‚Äòkingpins‚Äô or formal criminal networks at play that would significantly impact the flow if removed. ‚ÄúTargeting operations in Libya is even less credible. Libya is a open market for smugglers, with the number of players proliferating rapidly, and the only barrier to entry being ability to access a boat.‚Äù For their part, smugglers in Libya have previously scoffed at any EU attempt to tackle them. When the possibility of military action was first mooted in April, one Libyan smuggler told the Guardian: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been happening for years, these promises and threats. They‚Äôll move on. What are they going to do, put two frigates here?‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-22T12:41:02Z,world,World news,Cameron yet to discuss EU plans with seven national leaders,"David Cameron is yet to discuss his proposals for EU treaty renegotiations with seven national leaders, including his Greek counterpart, but Downing Street still hopes officials will have wrapped up technical discussions about a deal within several months. The prime minister has spoken to 20 EU leaders about his hopes in broad terms, but not those of Greece, Austria, Portugal, Bulgaria, Croatia, Lithuania or Malta. He is planning to have more bilateral meetings with some of these leaders before a crucial European council gathering on Thursday and Friday. Cameron will also have discussions with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor and most important leader in the debate, when he visits Berlin for a state dinner with the Queen on Wednesday night. The conversations with the remaining leaders could prove tough. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, is likely to be preoccupied with his country‚Äôs financial crisis, while the Austrian chancellor, Werner Faymann, was quoted by the German magazine Der Spiegel in May as suggesting that Cameron was not acting responsibly on the EU by planning an in/out referendum for the UK. Although the European council is expected be dominated by the financial problems of Greece and the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean, Downing Street said Cameron‚Äôs effortsto change the EU would also be on the agenda at some point. The prime minister‚Äôs official spokeswoman said he wanted technical discussions at official levels to begin soon after the June summit and be concluded within several months - suggesting those meetings would be wrapped up the next big European council gathering in December. ‚ÄúOn renegotiation, we would like to maintain momentum on the discussions we‚Äôve had so far and pave the way for technical talks following the European council. One would expect them to take several months ‚Ä¶ The Germans have already indicated they are open to having official-level discussions,‚Äù she said. One area to be discussed at the council is the format of these formal talks, including how British officials conduct them with their counterparts from other countries, the European council and whether the European commission is also involved. Cameron has promised to hold a referendum on Britain‚Äôs membership of the EU by the end of 2017, but indicated he would be open to bringing the vote forward. The most likely date is currently thought to be autumn 2016, after he ruled out holding it on the same day as other elections in May next year. The prime minister is under mounting pressure in the UK from his Eurosceptic backbenchers to provide more detail on his shopping list of demands, with Liam Fox, a former defence secretary, and Steve Baker, the co-chair of the Conservatives for Britain group, saying he should present his plans by the Tory party conference in the autumn. Downing Street says it has already provided the four key areas where Cameron is seeking change. In general terms, he is looking at are: a four-year ban on EU migrants claiming in-work benefits; providing greater protections for non-eurozone countries to ensure they cannot be outvoted in the single market by eurozone countries; giving Britain an optout from the EU‚Äôs commitment to create an ‚Äúever-closer union‚Äù of the peoples of Europe; and giving national parliaments the ability to club together to block EU legislation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-22T11:11:27Z,world,World news,Cat clings to plane wing for flight,"A cat has escaped with at least one of its nine lives after stowing away on an ultra-light aircraft flight. A video has been posted on YouTube of the cat digging its claws into the aircraft‚Äôs wing as its pilot and passenger fly hundreds of feet above the ground at first apparently unaware of its presence. Romain Jantot, understood to be the pilot in the clip, cites a flying club in Kourou, French Guiana, in the film‚Äôs description. He uploaded the video on Sunday and it has already received more than 75,000 views. ‚ÄúA standard flight until ‚Ä¶ I still don‚Äôt know if it got in after the pre-flight check or if I missed it,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe cat is doing well, she is still our mascot.‚Äù All appears well and cat-free as the aircraft accelerates on the runway and begins its takeoff.
But about 38 seconds into the clip, the cat slowly creeps into view under the plane‚Äôs left wing, making its way towards the pilot and passenger with a sinister slow crawl.
A few seconds later the animal is clearly exposed ‚Äì and like a feline Jack Bauer it grasps the wing with true grit, going unnoticed by the pilot for 60 seconds.
Just after a minute has passed, the pilot‚Äôs shock is clear as he notices windswept stowaway. Never before has a man‚Äôs face said ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a cat on the wing of my plane‚Äù with such unequivocal clarity.
The pilot immediately begins his descent and, after a comfortable landing, undoes his seatbelt before the aircraft has come to a halt and rushes to lower the cat to safety.
Some three minutes after takeoff, the flight draws to a happy conclusion and the cat leaps to the runway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-22T10:30:00Z,world,World news,Civilian death toll from explosive weapons soars,"The global civilian death toll from explosive weapons has increased dramatically in recent years, driven in part by the greater use of aerial bombs on populated areas, often by governments including Syria and Israel, according to a report. Although the international community has taken concerted action to curb the use of chemical weapons, the report by advocacy group Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) confirms that conventional explosives, can be just as devastating and indiscriminate when used against towns and cities. AOAV‚Äôs report, Explosive States, which examines data for 2014, found that when explosive weapons were used in urban areas, 92% of the casualties were civilians, compared with 34% in rural areas. In 2014, there were 32,662 civilian casualties from weapons including aerial bombs, mortars and car bombs, an increase of 5% on 2013, and 52% higher than 2011, when AOAV started collecting data.
‚ÄúThis is the third consecutive year that we have seen an increase in civilian deaths and injuries from explosive weapons,‚Äù Iain Overton, the director of investigations at AOAV, said. ‚ÄúWith civilians bearing the brunt of explosive weapon harm in Gaza, Ukraine, Nigeria, Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, the question has to be: how many more will have to die before states agree to end the use of explosive weapons in populated areas?‚Äù More than half the civilian casualties in 2014 were caused by improvised explosive devices (IEDs) such as car bombs and suicide vests. The prevalence of such weapons in Iraq has helped make it the most dangerous place in the world for civilians, in terms of explosive weapons, with more than 10,000 casualties for the second year running. Syria was second with 6,245 recorded civilian casualties (though AOAV acknowledges that it is likely to be gross underestimate due to reporting difficulties). Deaths by IED increased dramatically in Nigeria over the course of 2014, as Boko Haram targeted markets, bus stops and places of worship. Almost all the 2,407 casualties in the country were caused by car bombs, suicide bomb attacks or other IEDs.
The most striking and lethal development in 2014 was the increased use of aerial bombs by governments on densely populated areas. The number of civilian casualties from such weapons almost trebled from the previous year. The overwhelming majority of the casualties by aerial bombardment were caused by Syria (46% of the total) and Israel (35%). In Syria, government forces made dramatically increased use of barrel bombs ‚Äì containers filled with fuel, explosives and chunks of jagged metal typically pushed out of helicopters by hand, killing people and destroying buildings over a wide areas. In 2013, barrel bombs accounted for 20% of aerial attacks. In 2014, that proportion had doubled. The bulk of barrel bomb attacks (85%) were on urban areas. Israeli air attacks accounted for more than half the civilian casualties in Gaza in 2014. According to UN figures, there were 2,131 deaths from Israel‚Äôs Operation Protective Edge in July and August, 69% of which were civilian. But Israel also used high explosive ground-launched and naval shells during that campaign against built-up targets. As a result, Israel outdid even Syria as the state responsible for the most civilian casualties from explosive weapons in 2014, according to the AOAV report.
‚ÄúOur data shows that states were far more willing to carry out aerial bombings in populated areas, bucking a recent trend. It‚Äôs a deeply worrying development,‚Äù Overton said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost no surprise to see Israel was the state force behind the most civilian casualties from explosive weapons. The weapons used in Gaza last year included thousands of unguided artillery shells, as well as massive aircraft bombs, which, even if guided to a target, can still impact a wide area. AOAV‚Äôs research suggests, that for artillery at least, Israel had relaxed the rules, making it easier for troops to use these weapons in or near populated areas. You simply can‚Äôt do that on such a large scale without increasing risk of death, injury and damage to civilians and civilian areas.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-22T10:29:05Z,world,World news,German protests grow over detention of Egyptian journalist,"Egyptian journalist Ahmed Mansour has spent a second night in police custody in Germany as uncertainty continued following his arrest at Berlin‚Äôs Tegel airport on an Egyptian warrant. Mansour‚Äôs lawyer in Berlin, Fazli Altin, told the DPA news agency that his client faces an extradition hearing on Monday. However, Tobias Kaehne, spokesman for the Berlin court, said he knew nothing of any hearing and would only confirm that Mansour, who has dual Egyptian and British citizenship, was being held while Berlin state prosecutors decide whether or not to apply for an extradition warrant. While the Berlin court will have the task of deciding what to do with Mansour, the German government, specifically the foreign ministry and the justice ministry, will likely be consulted given the politically sensitive nature of the case. A foreign ministry spokesman said on Monday that no one would be extradited from Germany if they faced the death penalty. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think one can say this loudly enough: Of course, nobody will be extradited from Germany who risks being sentenced to death abroad,‚Äù Martin Schaefer told a news conference. Mansour, a senior journalist with al-Jazeera, was convicted in absentia in 2014 of torturing a lawyer in Tahrir Square in 2011 and sentenced to 15 years in prison. He rejected the charges, calling them ‚Äúa flimsy attempt at character assassination‚Äù. Mansour was detained while attempting to board a flight to Doha on Saturday ‚Äì two weeks after the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, made a state visit to Berlin. Guido Steinberg, a political analyst interviewed by Mansour during his visit to Berlin, expressed concern and surprise that the German government had not intervened on his behalf. ‚ÄúAs far as I know, the German government could intervene,‚Äù he told the Guardian. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm very surprised that it hasn‚Äôt happened yet. Mr Mansour needs to be set free, and an official apology is necessary I think.‚Äù
There were a number of protests against Mansour‚Äôs potential extradition on Sunday and Monday morning. A group calling itself the German-Egyptian Union for Democracy gathered around 100 protesters outside the Berlin jail where he is being detained. They held signs which read: ‚ÄúFreedom for Ahmed Mansour. Freedom for Egypt. Freedom for Journalists.‚Äù MPs across all of Germany‚Äôs main political parties have also voiced concern. Among the most outspoken has been the opposition Green party‚Äôs Franziska Brantner, who said in a statement on her website: ‚ÄúThe Berlin judiciary should under no circumstances allow itself to become a willing tool of the capricious regime in Cairo.‚Äù MPs from the coalition government parties have also protested. Rolf M√ºtzenich, deputy parliamentary leader of the Social Democratic party, told the Mitteldeutsche Zeitung newspaper: ‚ÄúThe Egyptian judiciary works by political guidelines. It is anything but independent. That needs to be taken into consideration.‚Äù Philipp Mi√üfelder, foreign policy spokesman for the Christian Democratic Union, said: ‚ÄúI think deportations and extraditions to countries that have the death penalty are very problematic.‚Äù
Egypt accuses both Qatar and al-Jazeera of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, which was branded a terrorist organisation after the military deposed the president, Mohamed Morsi, in 2013. Three journalists with al-Jazeera English spent more than 400 days in prison following their arrest in Cairo in late 2013. The trial was regarded internationally as a farce. Steinberg, from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs thinktank, suggested three reasons why Germany is attempting to maintain a good relationship with the Egyptian government ‚Äì one of the themes of Mansour‚Äôs latest broadcast. ‚ÄúFirstly, the German government sees Sisi as providing stability ‚Äì which I think is nonsense ‚Äì then, Israel wants Germany to support Egypt, and thirdly there are commercial affairs. You probably heard about the Siemens deal.‚Äù Steinberg was referring to a multibillion-euro power turbine deal that the German engineering multinational sealed with the Egyptian government in the week of Sisi‚Äôs visit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-22T09:58:38Z,world,World news,"'When the buying stops, the killing can too' √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú  Chinese dog meat festival faces internal pressure","The Yulin dog meat festival is facing an increasing backlash from within China, after years of international criticism. About 10,000 dogs are likely to slaughtered during this year‚Äôs event, which got underway on Sunday and marks the summer solstice in the town in south-west China. Dog meat is considered a delicacy in some parts of China but there is increasing opposition to the practice as dogs have become popular pets among China‚Äôs growing middle class, particularly in affluent cities. While the festival has been a focus of international outcry in previous years, opposition is growing in China, with a number of celebrities including actor Fan Bingbing adding their voices to an online campaign. Fan features in a video with a number of other celebrities holding signs saying: ‚ÄúDogs are our friends, please don‚Äôt hurt them.‚ÄùApparently concerned about the adverse publicity, Yulin‚Äôs local government has distanced itself from the festival, which has been running since 1995. Earlier this month, it announced that there was no official dog meat festival and that it was something that had spread among some traders and local people. ‚ÄúYulin government itself or any social organisations have never held a summer solstice lychee and dog meat festival in any form,‚Äù read the announcement, carried in state media. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese social media users have also been vocal in their opposition of the festival. One user on the social networking site Weibo, Yu Yun Qiang Wei, said: ‚ÄúIf there is no one willing to eat dog meat, then the industry would not exist. When the buying stops, the killing can too.‚Äù Another said dogs ‚Äúneed a warm home. If you don‚Äôt love dogs, please don‚Äôt hurt them. If you love them, please treat them well.‚Äù Yulin residents claim that the festival and the practice of eating dog meat is a local tradition and that the dogs are not killed in an inhumane way. However, activists say the dogs are transported to Yulin from all over China and are often domestic animals that have been stolen. Photos circulating online showed hundreds of dogs squeezed into tiny cages and dead animals being butchered on the pavement. A small number of Chinese animal activists have travelled to Yulin in an attempt to save dogs from ending up on plates. One particularly determined dog lover is reported to have bought 100 dogs from traders. Yang Xiaoyun travelled from Tianjin in northern China to Yulin and bought the dogs for 7,000 yuan (¬£711), according to local media reports. Last year, Yang bought 360 dogs. She says she intends to set up a home to look after the dogs. ‚ÄúEating dog meat is their local custom. I don‚Äôt want to change that, I only wish I can influence them by what I am doing,‚Äù Yang was quoted as saying by Fa Zhi Wan Bao, a Beijing-based news website. An AFP photographer at the scene said that about 10 animal rights activists unfurled banners outside the Yulin government headquarters before a group of 20 unidentified men came and chased them off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-22T08:39:38Z,world,World news,Buddhist monks seek to ban schoolgirls from wearing headscarves in Burma,"An influential group of Buddhist monks in Burma is proposing to ban Muslim schoolgirls from wearing headscarves, in the latest sign of growing religious tension in the country. The Organisation for the Protection of Race and Religion, a panel of monks known locally by the acronym Ma Ba Tha, said the headscarves were ‚Äúnot in line with school discipline‚Äù. Ma Ba Tha held a conference in Rangoon at the weekend. Some 1,300 monks from monasteries around the country gathered to discuss plans to promote a nationalist agenda as the country heads toward landmark elections later this year. In a list of recommendations released late on Sunday, Ma Ba Tha told its members to lobby the government to put further restrictions on the country‚Äôs beleaguered Muslims, and included references to the wearing of either headscarves or burqas. ‚ÄúWe will demand seriously for the government to ban Muslim students wearing the burqa in government schools and to ban the killing of innocent animals on their [Muslims‚Äô] Eid holiday,‚Äù it said, referring to Muslim cultural practices that Buddhist nationalists believe go against the culture of Buddhist-majority Burma. Explaining the move, Ma Ba Tha monk U Pamaukkha said: ‚ÄúWhen they [Muslims] live in Myanmar, they need to obey the law and regulations of the country. We are not targeting or attacking their religion.‚Äù The group also said it would ‚Äúshow the people the right track‚Äù when it came to the elections, expected in November, encouraging people to vote for candidates who ‚Äúwill not let our race and religion disappear‚Äù. The group would keep monitoring ‚Äúcrimes by non-Buddhists‚Äù and using Facebook to spread news about alleged threats to Buddhism in Burma, its statement said. Ma Ba Tha was officially formed in June 2013, when bouts of inter-communal violence were spreading around the country, with Buddhist mobs targeting members of the Muslim minority. Riots have been triggered by social media posts reporting alleged rapes of Buddhist women by Muslims. Inter-communal violence in western Burma‚Äôs Rakhine State the previous year displaced some 140,000 people, mostly stateless Muslims identifying themselves as Rohingya, who have since taken to the sea in their thousands fleeing oppressive conditions, sparking a regional human smuggling crisis. The monks have already proved their ability to wield influence over Burma‚Äôs quasi-civilian government, which replaced a military junta in 2011. After a Ma Ba Tha signature campaign, president Thein Sein‚Äôs administration drafted four laws restricting interfaith marriage and religious conversion, banning polygamy and limiting population growth. While the laws have met with little resistance in a parliament dominated by former and serving military officials, so far only the population control law ‚Äì which enables officials to restrict women to one child every three years ‚Äì has been passed. The prominent nationalist monk U Wirathu spoke at the conference on Saturday, pledging that Ma Ba Tha would increase its pressure on the government to pass the remaining laws. The monk also extolled the growth of Ma Ba Tha in its first two years. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs as if we‚Äôve come from the sky,‚Äù he said. The group of monks is at the vanguard of a nationalist movement that threatens to overshadow gains made by Burma‚Äôs reformers, with many suggesting it has the backing of an anti-reform faction in the ruling elite. David Mathieson, a senior researcher on Burma for Human Rights Watch, said: ‚ÄúThe Ma Ba Tha have become an unaccountable and arrogant political force based on extremist religious and social views, like a fifth column using Buddhism to serve shady political and economic interests.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-22T06:00:06Z,world,World news,"Migrants on Hungary's border fence: 'This wall, we will not accept it'","Crouched in the darkness, 500 metres from the Hungarian border, 15 Syrian refugees whisper about how they should cross into the EU. A few miles back, they switched off their phones. Then they picked up sticks to protect them from local gangsters. Now they‚Äôre organising into pairs: going two-by-two means they might not trigger the heat sensors on the border. And it is at this moment that a 23-year-old pharmacist, Mohamed Hussein, absent-mindedly decides to light a cigarette.
‚ÄúPut it out!‚Äù comes the collective hiss, betraying a rising sense of fear. Several in this group have previously been jailed for a fortnight by the Hungarian police after crossing the border, before being returned to Serbia. Now they‚Äôre trying again. ‚ÄúThe border between Greece and Macedonia was very easy,‚Äù whispers Selim, a 36-year-old Syrian sales manager, whose home in old Aleppo was destroyed by an army rocket. ‚ÄúBut this is the most difficult bit, the Hungarian border.‚Äù And it is about to get a lot harder. Last week, Hungary‚Äôs illiberal government began drawing up plans to stop people like Selim and Hussein ‚Äì by building a four-metre high fence along its 110-mile (177km) border with Serbia.
‚ÄúThis is a necessary step,‚Äù the government‚Äôs spokesman, Zolt√°n Kov√°cs, told the Guardian by phone from Budapest. ‚ÄúWe need to stop the flood.‚Äù Rights groups see the move as the obvious conclusion of a wave of government-led xenophobia. In recent months, Kov√°cs‚Äôs colleagues have conflated immigrants with extremists, announced a national consultation on the twin themes of migration and terrorism, and floated the idea of placing all migrants in what would be some of Europe‚Äôs first internment camps since the second world war.
But Kov√°cs argues that a fence is a legitimate response to a huge spike in migration that has this year turned Hungary into a hidden frontline of Europe‚Äôs migration crisis. Most of the media coverage centres on Italy and Greece, which have borne the brunt of the maritime arrivals. But Kov√°cs claims that the onward movement of mainly Syrian, Afghan and Iraqi migrants from Greece through the Balkan land route has quietly made Hungary ‚Äúthe most affected EU country in absolute terms. Over 50,000 have entered Hungary illegally since January. Italy and Greece are lagging behind by a couple of 2,000.‚Äù With hundreds arriving in all three countries every day, Kov√°cs‚Äôs figures cannot be confirmed. But certainly Hungary must contend with a migrant influx that is comparable to that faced by Mediterranean countries. And this forest, lining a river that leads to the Danube, is one of the main secret thoroughfares into the country from Serbia ‚Äì particularly for Syrians. ‚ÄúPeople start gathering here around four or five in the afternoon,‚Äù says Abu Khalil, a Syrian doctor waiting in the last town before the border. ‚ÄúAnd then they walk through the night.‚Äù
As the sun sets, huddle after huddle of Syrian refugees, travelling together for protection, edge north along the bends of the river. At other points along the border, migrants pay smugglers to get them across. But here, everyone guides themselves, using tips passed on by those who passed through in previous weeks. There are doctors and businessmen walking, as well as children and old men. Every so often, in the distant darkness, you can hear a baby cry.
They say that not even a wall will put them off. ‚ÄúWe are Syrians,‚Äù says Mohamed Hussein, a fortnight after he spoke to ITN as his boat landed on the Greek island of Lesvos. ‚ÄúWe can solve anything. We made the first written language, so we can break the wall. If they use electricity, we will take gloves and cut it.‚Äù Hussein‚Äôs perseverance is a case in point. On his left wrist he has a tattoo that honours Pink Floyd ‚Äì ‚ÄúI love progressive rock!‚Äù ‚Äì and on his right wrist, an image of a ship. It‚Äôs to remind him of the boat he tried to take from Turkey to Europe last December. He says it ran into trouble on New Year‚Äôs Eve, and coastguards took him back to Turkey. So the Hungarians, Hussein concludes, are ‚Äúnot going to solve migration like this. They need to solve the real problem and get rid of Bashar al-Assad and Isis.‚Äù But right now these particular Syrians face a more pressing concern. On the dyke above the river, still a couple of miles from the border, they can make out two mysterious cars. Are those the local thieves they‚Äôve heard about ‚Äì or the police? ‚ÄúMan, I‚Äôm so stressed,‚Äù says Nizam, a young computer scientist who left Syria after his father died in a bombing last year. ‚ÄúKeep your voices down,‚Äù Selim interrupts. ‚ÄúAnd hide in the woods.‚Äù
Twenty miles to the west, another group of refugees are arguably in even more desperate straits. The Syrians usually stay in a couple of cheap hotels. But many Afghans, who largely enter Hungary by a more westerly route, hide out in the overgrown grounds of a disused brick factory. ‚ÄúThis is a famous place,‚Äù says Rahman Niazi, an 18-year-old Afghan student. ‚ÄúEvery Afghan goes through here, because here there‚Äôs always people who speak their language ‚Äì and then they walk to Hungary.‚Äù Migrants first started trickling here in 2011, when the annual number of arrivals to Hungary was around 4% of what it is now. Four years on, around 200 migrants now gather here every day, estimates Tibor Varga, a local priest who hands out food at the factory several times a week. The casual visitor would find it hard to find them. The refugees hide in a vast stretch of overgrown sweetcorn fields nestling between a sewage works and a rubbish tip, where the crops have long knotted with nettles and grass flowers. Migrants call the space the jungle, and it is not hard to see why. It‚Äôs very easy to get lost.
Weaving through the tall and thick foliage, to a soundtrack of crackling crickets, you can hear the voices of different clusters of refugees, and step across the detritus of migrants past. But finding them happens almost by chance. A small hollow will suddenly open up in the undergrowth to reveal a huddle of a dozen Afghans ‚Äì often waiting till nightfall before making for Hungary. Here they camp in the open air and hoist their water from an old well ‚Äì but still try to create some kind of normality. ‚ÄúPlease at least take this,‚Äù Yama Nayab, an Afghan surgeon, says to a passing stranger, holding out a cup of dirty well-water. ‚ÄúIn Afghanistan, it would be our duty to offer you food as our guest.‚Äù
Today, the irony of Nayab‚Äôs ingrained hospitality could not be starker. Stabbed four times in the chest by the Taliban earlier this year, he recovered and fled the country with his wife and two toddlers. Since then, they have walked and bussed through Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Bulgaria and Serbia to find somewhere that will offer them a future. ‚ÄúWherever I find a safe place,‚Äù Nayab says, ‚Äúa country that accepts me and gives me a chance, I will start my life there.‚Äù Today, he‚Äôs just discovered that Hungary wants to build a wall to stop him doing that. Not that a wall will deter him. ‚ÄúIn Afghanistan, life is not safe, and every human who wants a safe life will make a hole in that wall, or find another way,‚Äù he explains, and uses his own story to illustrate his point. A surgeon with the Afghan army, he says he was approached by a Taliban fighter as he returned home one day near the start of this year. ‚ÄúWhy are you working for the government?‚Äù the man said to him. ‚ÄúHere in Afghanistan. the Americans and the pagans made a government ‚Äì and you are working for that government.‚Äù
Then the man got out a knife. ‚ÄúAnd then he did this,‚Äù says Nayab, pulling up his shirt to reveal four pink scars circling his heart. It‚Äôs tense in the jungle. Many of the people here are waiting for instructions from the men they call their chief. These are the smugglers to whom they pay around ‚Ç¨10,000 (¬£7,170) before they depart from Afghanistan. At every stage of their odyssey to Europe, they call this man, who then gives them a set of new directions. Sometimes it‚Äôs a GPS coordinate for the next place they should walk to. Sometimes it‚Äôs a bus route. Occasionally, the chief will send them a car. Once, as they prepared to walk to Iran, his men gave Niazi the first western clothes he‚Äôd ever worn. ‚ÄúHe has a deputy in every country,‚Äù the student explains.
While they wait for his call, everyone fears an attack from the police. Attempting to walk from Iran to Turkey, two of Niazi‚Äôs companions were shot by Iranian border guards. In Bulgaria, he says he was beaten and robbed by the local police. In a nearby thicket, an Afghan kickboxer says the constant tension has made him take up smoking. ‚ÄúUsually I don‚Äôt smoke,‚Äù says Ajmir, 21, who fled Afghanistan after he says a fellow kickboxer was killed for playing a sport deemed to be too western. ‚ÄúBut here it‚Äôs so dangerous, I‚Äôm so nervous. We don‚Äôt have any papers. I don‚Äôt want to be fingerprinted. So now I am smoking.‚Äù Back on the border with Hungary, Syrian Mohamed Hussein hurriedly puts out his own cigarette as his friends take their last breather before crossing the border. They whisper encouragement to each other, to gee themselves up. ‚ÄúIf we stick together, we can do this,‚Äù Hussein tells Nizam, with whom he‚Äôs travelled since Turkey. Then the group rises, and walks towards the invisible line where Hungary‚Äôs wall will shortly stand. ‚ÄúThis wall, we will not accept it,‚Äù says Hussein, and bounds over the border.

2015-06-22T01:31:50Z,world,World news,British man drowns off Malta coast where two others died in May,"A British man has drowned off the coast of Malta, in the same spot where two British tourists died less than a month ago. The 59-year-old, who has not yet been named, got into trouble in Comino‚Äôs famous Blue Lagoon about 2.30pm on Sunday. The man was taken by helicopter to the nearby Gozo general hospital, where he later died. Etienne Micalles, secretary general of the emergency response rescue corps said: ‚ÄúThe man was outside of the Blue Lagoon when bystanders reported to the lifeguard station that there was a person in the water who appeared to be immobile.‚Äù The Red Cross chief lifeguard, Robert Brincau, said double-red flags were hoisted by lifeguards on Sunday, indicating that because of rough conditions the beach was dangerous for swimming. Brincau urged all bathers to abide by the instructions given by lifeguards, who advise people that swimming under double-red flag conditions was a risk to their lives. Last month two British men, both 35, drowned while swimming in the same area. Micalles said the lagoon‚Äôs crystal blue waters meant it attracted large numbers of tourists. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that the area is dangerous, but the issue is it‚Äôs very popular,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe more people who frequent the area more chance of an incidence.‚Äù A spokeswoman for the foreign office confirmed the death and said, ‚ÄúWe stand ready to provide consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-21T23:01:21Z,world,World news,FTSE 100 boardroom diversity set to decline as non-white talent pool shrinks,"Attempts to increase ethnic diversity in the boardrooms of the UK‚Äôs biggest companies are heading backwards, according to research which shows a fall in the pool of non-white talent being groomed for boardroom seats in FTSE 100 firms. The proportion of non-white managers in 7,700 positions below the boardroom level of FTSE 100 companies has fallen to 5.7% from 6.2% a year ago, the study found. ‚Äú[This is] an extremely disappointing result, possibly the most significant of our study: a decline in levels of non-white representation. In effect, the FTSE 100 has lost almost 40 of approximately 480 non-white leaders,‚Äù it said.
The research, conducted by Green Park executive recruitment and published on Monday, follows findings published in December which showed that 62% of FTSE 100 companies have all-white boards, up from 61% the year before. This is despite a campaign by the previous business secretary, Vince Cable, to encourage companies to ensure they recruit at least one non-white director by 2020. It is not clear if the new government intends to adopt this policy. The research did not find an executive director of Chinese or east Asian heritage. In the 2011 census, 87% of the population described themselves as white. Raj Tulsiani, chief executive of Green Park, said: ‚ÄúDespite all the focus on increasing diversity within the FTSE 100 to help business operate more competitively around the world, our research shows that UK companies are getting less ethnically diverse rather than more over the past year. It‚Äôs particularly concerning to see that at pipeline level, we‚Äôve lost such a large number of potential ethnic minority leaders, suggesting that the situation is likely to continue to worsen rather than improve in the future.‚Äù Of the lack of Chinese and east Asian people, Tulsiani said: ‚ÄúWe know that this group forms the single most successful educational demographic in the UK, and has done for quite some while, so big companies need to ask themselves, why are they not drawing on this group‚Äôs talent and insights to help provide a competitive edge in targeting important markets for growth?‚Äù At boardroom level there has been an increase in the number of non-white chairs as a result of the elevation of Hikma Pharmaceuticals into the FTSE 100 in March. Its chairman, Said Darwazah, joins Jac Nasser of mining company BHP Billiton and Fred Phaswana of paper and packaging group Mondi in the league table. The departure of Tidjane Thiam as chief executive of Prudential ‚Äì he quit to run Credit Suisse ‚Äì helped reduce the number of non-white FTSE 100 bosses from six, along with the ejection of oil services firms Petrofac and Amec from the index. The inclusion of Darwazah, who holds the joint chairman and chief executive role at Hikma, puts the total at four. The other three are Carnival‚Äôs Arnold Donald, Ivan Menezes at Diageo and Rakesh Kapoor at Reckitt Benckiser.
The Green Park study also looked at gender diversity in boardrooms, which were challenged by Cable to have 25% of roles occupied by women this year. The report found an increase in the number of female chairs in the FTSE 100 from one to three as Susan Kilsby of pharmaceutical company Shire and Sarah Bates of wealth management firm St James‚Äôs Place join Alison Carnwath from Land Securities. The number of female chief executives has also increased from four to five. According to Green Park, women comprise 12.6% of executive directorships on boards, up from 9.6%, and 27.9% of non-executive positions, up from 23.9%. At the so-called operating board level, just below the main board, the proportion is 18.7%, little changed from 18.2% a year before.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-21T21:01:20Z,world,World news,Creditors offer Greece six-month bailout reprieve as Tsipras weighs response,"Greece‚Äôs international creditors are aiming to strike a deal to stop Athens defaulting on its debt and possibly tumbling out of the euro by extending its bailout by six months and supplying up to ‚Ç¨18bn (¬£12.9bn) in rescue funds. The negotiators representing Greece‚Äôs lenders are also proposing to pledge debt relief for the austerity-battered country ‚Äì but officials stressed that a breakthrough hinged on a positive response from the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras. Negotiations were continuing on Sunday night, hours ahead of crucial gatherings of eurozone finance minsters and leaders in Brussels, which Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, Fran√ßois Hollande, the French president, and Tsipras are expected to attend. All three leaders spoke over the weekend, with contributions from European commission head Jean-Claude Juncker.
The crisis meeting was convened in an attempt to ease Greece‚Äôs debt crisis before a critical ‚Ç¨1.6bn payment to the International Monetary Fund falls due next Tuesday. Greece‚Äôs creditors were still waiting for Tsipras and his Syriza party to formally submit revised fiscal targets, pensions cuts and tax increases in an attempt to secure the six-month lifeline, concessions that the country‚Äôs leader has resisted since he came to power five months ago. At a cabinet meeting in Athens earlier on Sunday, Tsipras is believed to have discussed offering Greece‚Äôs creditors ‚Äì the European Central Bank (ECB), the IMF and the European commission ‚Äì unspecified concessions on tax and pensions reform. A statement from Tsipras‚Äôs office said: ‚ÄúThe prime minister presented [Merkel, Hollande and Juncker] with Greece‚Äôs proposal for a mutually beneficial agreement that will give a definitive solution and not a postponement of addressing the problem.‚Äù However, it was not clear that Tsipras would be able to go far enough to make a final agreement possible on Monday, when the country‚Äôs banks and the international money markets reopen after another weekend of pressure on the Greek financial system. Reuters reported on Sunday that ‚Ç¨1bn worth of withdrawal orders had been lodged with Greek banks over the weekend ‚Äì on top of the ‚Ç¨4bn that left the country‚Äôs banking system last week. The news agency also said that the European Central Bank was set to discuss extending financial help to the banks this morning, amid fears that Greek banks would be unable to open on Tuesday.
A hectic round of telephone diplomacy took place over the weekend between leaders in Athens, Berlin, Paris and Brussels while technocrats on both sides sought to hammer out the small print of the fiscal arithmetic forming the basis for a last-minute agreement days before Greece‚Äôs existing bailout expires. With time running out, the only way an IMF default could now be avoided is for the ECB to raise the ceiling on the short-term debt Athens is allowed to sell, the officials said. This would need to happen by Monday next week. Brussels sources also signalled moves to address Tsipras‚Äôs key demand ‚Äì that the creditors need to offer debt relief to Greece. Some form of debt restructuring would be promised to Athens in the future, but it would come with strings attached and not as part of the current bailout package, they said. Yanis Varoufakis, the outspoken Greek finance minister, said on Sunday that Greece‚Äôs fate hinged on Merkel, and told her she faced a stark decision. But his spokesman reacted sceptically to suggestions of creditor promises on eventual debt relief, describing the eurozone as ‚Äúpathological liars‚Äù.
Eurozone finance ministers will meet at lunchtime on Monday in Brussels, four days after a previous session collapsed in mutual recrimination in Luxembourg. The summit is a success for Tsipras, who has consistently insisted that the debt crisis can be resolved only by Europe‚Äôs political leaders. The Greek cabinet met on Sunday to discuss what a source close to the government said was an outline proposal drawn up by the prime minister‚Äôs closest political and economic advisers. It included changes to the tax and pension systems. Pensions and benefit cuts are perhaps the most delicate of all the issues that Tsipras‚Äôs government has so far defined as red lines not to be crossed. The source said Athens was only ready to concede a reduction in higher pensions that would affect no more than 80,000 people. The Greek concessions were also said to include new taxes, the elimination of early retirement allowances and a levy on companies. According to the state television channel ERT, the new Greek proposal also includes the Tsipras government in effect agreeing to greater austerity than previously sanctioned. The country would set a new target of running a surplus amounting to 1% of the country‚Äôs gross domestic product. The six-month rescue extension being mooted would see Greece qualify for ‚Ç¨7.2bn in bailout funds still to be disbursed as well as ‚Ç¨10.9bn already lent to the country but earmarked for recapitalisation of its weakened banks. The latter sum could be quickly transferred to the government to facilitate debt repayments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-21T19:37:54Z,world,World news,Europol web unit to hunt extremists behind Isis social media propaganda,"A new Europe-wide police unit is being set up to scour the internet for the ring leaders behind Islamic State‚Äôs social media propaganda campaign, which it has used to recruit foreign fighters and jihadi brides. The police team will seek to track down the key figures behind the estimated 100,000 tweets a day pumped out from 45,000 to 50,000 accounts linked to the Islamist terror group, which controls parts of Iraq and Syria. Run by the European police agency Europol, it will start work on 1 July, with a remit to take down Isis accounts within two hours of them being detected. Europol‚Äôs director, Rob Wainwright, told the Guardian that the new internet referral unit would monitor social media output to identify people who might be vulnerable and those preying on them. He said: ‚ÄúWho is it reaching out to young people, in particular, by social media, to get them to come, in the first place? It‚Äôs very difficult because of the dynamic nature of social media.‚Äù
The director added that the police team would be working with social media companies to identify the most important accounts operating in a range of languages that are ‚Äúunderpinning what Isis are doing‚Äù. Europol said it would not name the social media firms who have agreed to help the police. It will use network analytics to identify the most active accounts, such as those pumping out the most messages and those part of an established online community. Wainwright said the new unit would aim to ‚Äúidentify the ringleaders online‚Äù, but even then counter-terrorism investigators could not go through every one of the estimated 50,000 targeted accounts, as there were too many and new ones could easily be set up. Last week, Isis‚Äôs ability to reach into British communities to gain recruits was demonstrated once again. One Briton, Talha Asmal, a 17-year-old from Dewsbry, West Yorkshire, is believed to have killed himself in a suicide bombing in Iraq, while three Bradford sisters are feared to have fled to Syria with their nine children in the hope of joining a brother who has been fighting the Assad regime. A total of 700 Britons have travelled to territory controlled by Isis in Syria and Iraq ‚Äì a problem shared with other European countries. Europol‚Äôs database tracking suspected foreign fighters in the two countries has 6,000 names. Some of those may be facilitators, or their associates. Wainwright said up to 5,000 were believed to have travelled to Isis-held territory from countries including Holland, France and Belgium, as well as from the UK. He said some were ‚Äúdisaffected‚Äù youths migrating from teenage gangs in their own countries seeing Isis as a ‚Äúbigger gang in Syria‚Äù. But he added that others being attracted are those who had bright futures in their home countries. The new European initiative is in part based on Scotland Yard‚Äôs counter-terrorism internet-referral unit. The hope is the new unit will boost efforts across European countries, with results passed back to nations to take action against the individuals running the accounts. The unit is part of European governments‚Äô response to the terrorist attacks on the office of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris in January. Wainwright said money used to fund Isis activities will also be hunted down. He added: ‚ÄúWhere you follow the money trail, it helps find who they are, what they are doing and who their associates are.‚Äù The home secretary, Theresa May, stressed in a speech this week the need to tackle the cross-border threat of Isis. She said: ‚ÄúThe threat ‚Ä¶ that we face is a common one shared by many of your countries. And if we are to defeat it, we need to work together. ‚ÄúWe have also supported the EU in setting up an internet-referral unit at Europol to address the increasing amount of terrorist and extremist propaganda available on the internet, and I am pleased to say the UK will be seconding a police officer to this unit.‚Äù David Cameron last week said Isis was using the internet to lure western youngsters to its cause. He said: ‚ÄúIt may be medieval in its outlook, but it is modern in its tactics, with the internet as the main tool to spread its warped worldview.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-21T18:36:32Z,world,World news,Greeks fear further pension cuts as eurozone deadline looms,"Maria Nikolaidou had her 40th birthday on Friday. But, she said: ‚ÄúI am now too old to get a job.‚Äù In Greece, where economic output has fallen by a quarter and the unemployment rate is 26%, employers can pick and choose, and offer the successful applicants pay that would have seemed derisory before the country‚Äôs descent into its economic hell. ‚ÄúI am single, yet still of childbearing age,‚Äù said Nikolaidou, stirring a coffee in a suburban Athens bar. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a menace.‚Äù Since losing her job as a content editor for the Greek subsidiary of a US internet giant, Nikolaidou has lived with her 74-year-old mother, who shares with her an ‚Ç¨800-(¬£572)-a-month retirement pension. Ask Nikolaidou about the demands of Greece‚Äôs creditors for pension cuts and she replies: ‚ÄúBut they‚Äôve already been cut. My mother‚Äôs used to be ‚Ç¨1,300.‚Äù
The Tsipras government has insisted that several issues, including labour reform and tax increases, lie beyond ‚Äúred lines‚Äù it refuses to cross. But of all the matters to be discussed on Monday in Brussels with the leaders of the eurozone, pension cuts are the most sensitive. It is the area in which Greece‚Äôs negotiators will be under the greatest domestic pressure not to concede. In the fashionable Kolonaki district of Athens, Pagona Koutouraki explains how her income has halved since the onset of the crisis and the imposition of austerity measures intended to bring the country back into line with the rest of the eurozone. ‚ÄúMy pension was supposed to be ‚Ç¨1,700 a month,‚Äù said the retired secondary school teacher. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs already been cut to ‚Ç¨1,000, and if the lenders‚Äô proposals are accepted, it‚Äôll go down to ‚Ç¨800.‚Äù
Like many middle-class southern Europeans, however, Koutouraki owns ‚Äúsome houses‚Äù and, while rents too have fallen drastically, the extra income she gets allows her to maintain a certain quality of life. ‚ÄúI seek out free exhibitions and other events and try to find sales of books and paintings,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI take a holiday, but for five days and not 10.‚Äù A run on deposits that drained the banks of more than ‚Ç¨4bn last week has given jolting plausibility to a scenario that would tear apart the country‚Äôs superficial, resigned calm: one in which, lacking an agreement this week, the country would default on its debts. Non-payment of a loan from the International Monetary Fund that falls due at the end of the month, warned Yannis Stournaras, the governor of the Bank of Greece, would lead ‚Äúultimately to the country‚Äôs exit from the euro area and, most likely, from the European Union‚Äù. It is a prospect that fills Koutouraki with alarm. On Friday, she joined a demonstration in the Greek capital under the slogan ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre staying in Europe‚Äù. She intends to take to the streets again on Monday as the eurozone chiefs meet in Brussels to once again insist on Greece‚Äôs place in Europe. ‚ÄúWe want to stay,‚Äù she said, lighting her third cigarette in less than half an hour. ‚ÄúBut more for political and geostrategic reasons than for economic ones.‚Äù She points to growing instability in the Balkans and the proximity of Turkey. ‚ÄúIf there were only financial reasons, I doubt if anyone in Greece would want to stay,‚Äù she joked.
In fact, according to a poll in the newspaper I Avgi on Sunday, 62% of Greeks thought they would be worse off if their country went back to the drachma, against 22% who thought they would benefit and 16% who were undecided. Those and similar findings, combined with poll evidence of a clear majority ready to accept compromise with Greece‚Äôs creditors, suggest the government could have relatively little difficulty persuading the electorate to accept the solutions reportedly under consideration at the weekend. Tsipras‚Äôs main problem remains his party. The attitudes and rhetoric of Syriza seem to have changed little in the five months since it took power. In an interview published on Sunday, the interior minister, Nikos Voutsis, accused the lenders ‚Äì the European Central Bank, IMF and European commission ‚Äì of blackmail. He said: ‚ÄúThey want the Syriza government to become a footnote after it is defeated, after it bows its head.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe want an agreement,‚Äù Kostas Barkas, a Syriza MP, said. ‚ÄúBut we have to build another Europe. We have to save Europe.‚Äù Panagiotis Ioakimidis, an emeritus professor of political science at Athens university, said the most Eurosceptic elements within the party had actually gained ground since the election in January. ‚ÄúThe most leftwing factions have become more vocal and more intransigent, and they are in a stronger position,‚Äù he said. That has potentially crucial implications for the government‚Äôs interaction with Greece‚Äôs creditors. It has been widely argued that the protracted talks have at least had the merit of enabling Tsipras to promote realism in his party and make it more amenable to an eventual compromise. But, said Ioakimidis, ‚ÄúTsipras has done nothing to control the anti-EU and anti-eurozone elements in Syriza.‚Äù That may be changing. On Saturday, a newspaper close to Syriza published an article by the deputy culture minister, Nikos Xydakis, in which he seemed to suggest he had been converted to the idea of giving up the euro. ‚ÄúGreece had the drachma for 200 years and made great achievements,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúI do not think that since the euro we have made much progress.‚Äù On Sunday, he went on television to say his words had been misunderstood. He had merely been making ‚Äúa historical assessment‚Äù.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-21T18:00:51Z,world,World news,Wife of Israeli politician tweets racist Obama joke ‚Äì and social media reacts,"The wife of a senior Israeli minister sparked outrage on Sunday by posting a racist joke about President Barack Obama on Twitter. Judy Shalom Nir Mozes, a well-known face on Israeli TV and the wife of the country‚Äôs interior minister Silvan Shalom, quickly deleted the offending tweet ‚Äì but it was too late to avoid mounting criticism. The post that set off a wave of international public anger was short and to the point. ‚ÄúDo you know what Obama coffee is? Black and weak‚Äù, Mozes tweeted in English. Protests on Twitter came swiftly in English and Hebrew, including messages such as ‚ÄúHave you gone mad?‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better erase this ‚Ä¶ frighteningly racist‚Äù. After deleting the tweet, Mozes posted: ‚ÄúI apologise, that was a stupid joke somebody told me.‚Äù But Twitter users had already taken screen shots of the offensive message. One user posted: ‚ÄúHow human garbage works ‚Ä¶ Delete plus fake apology. Clearly found the racist joke funny enough to share. Trash‚Äù. Mozes has been involved in social-media controversy before. In 2012 she was nominated to represent Unicef, the United Nations body dealing with children‚Äôs rights and emergency needs, in Israel, and was set to join a sparkling list of royal and celebrity ambassadors that has included David Beckham, Sarah Jessica Parker, William and Kate, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Queen Rania of Jordan, Shakira and Sir Roger Moore. But according to the Jerusalem Post, she resigned after whipping up a political storm when she posted messages to Facebook vociferously supporting Israel‚Äôs military bombardment of Gaza and referring to Palestinians there simply as ‚Äúpeople whose children are fed hate towards Israel ... who have it in their DNA to hate us‚Äù. In the US, Mozes‚Äô Tweet hit raw nerves. On Sunday, the subject of race was once again leading every news outlet, days after a 21-year-old white man shot dead nine black worshippers in a church in Charleston, South Carolina. One Twitter user wrote: ‚ÄúWife of Israeli interior minister @JudyMozes tweeted racist slur [about] POTUS (President of the United States) while we mourn loss of 9 [because] of racism.‚Äù Mozes appeared to compound her predicament, posting another joking statement, which began ‚ÄúSorry if I caused offense to anyone‚Äù and added that she hoped she would still be married when her husband heard about the row.

2015-06-21T17:36:43Z,world,World news,"German tourists in Greece: 'everybody has been so kind ‚Äì overfriendly, even'","Gazing out over Thessaloniki‚Äôs waterfront, Regina Jost, a social worker from Jever, in northern Germany, was on her last day of a week‚Äôs holiday discovering Greece‚Äôs picturesque northern beaches. ‚ÄúWhen I told my friends I was going to Greece on vacation, they said: ‚ÄòOh be careful, something might happen, you‚Äôll come up against bad feeling against Germans, people will hold it against you for being German,‚Äô‚Äù she said. But despite the political tension between Athens and Berlin as Greece battles for economic survival, Jost said she had not experienced what some German media have described as ‚Äúthe fear of spit in the ouzo‚Äù. After six years of Greek caricatures of Angela Merkel in Nazi uniform, Greek demands for Nazi war reparations and the resentment at Berlin‚Äôs stance as unrelenting paymaster, only one person had been slightly frosty towards Jost ‚Äì and that was a German whom she had asked for directions. ‚ÄúThere has been no bad feeling. Everybody has been so kind ‚Äì overfriendly, even,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis is all about the politics, tourists are not responsible for that.‚Äù Bj√∂rn J√ºrgensen, an electrical technician travelling with her, added: ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt thought about the crisis at all, people have been great.‚Äù
The tourist sun-loungers and bars seem a world away from the meeting rooms of Brussels. But tourism is more than ever a barometer of Athens‚Äôs international relations and a lifeline for the economy. Tourism is Greece‚Äôs biggest industry, making up a fifth of GDP. Last year, record numbers of tourist flocked to Greece, including a record 2.5 million Germans; there was a 17% increase of Germans arriving on package holidays. This year had been expected to set further records, but the uncertainty over Greece‚Äôs future and fears of a credit crunch and capital controls has begun to scare off Germans. The surge in tourism last year that helped drag the country out of a six-year slump has given way in the first months of this year to a drop in momentum. While UK and US tourists rush to benefit from the exchange rate, German bookings for Greece have unexpectedly declined since the radical left Syriza took power and as the economic crisis deepened. This month Germany‚Äôs travel board felt the need to issue a statement assuring travellers: ‚ÄúDespite isolated political campaigns against Germany in the past, German tourists do not need to fear hostility or hatred in Greece.‚Äù So crucial is the tourist trade to Greece that two conservative German politicians, Axel Fischer and Ruediger Kruse, proposed that German holidaymakers whose holiday spending helps boost the Greek economy should be reimbursed ‚Ç¨500 by the German state on their return ‚Äì on condition that the hotel and restaurants they visited have paid their taxes. On a long stretch of beach at the holiday spot of Perea, outside Thessaloniki, Eleftheria Poungoura had repainted her gift shop and carefully arranged the array of scarves, bags and luxury souvenirs. But on her newsstand the headline from the front page of the Daily Mirror ‚Äì ‚ÄúAcropolypse Now‚Äù ‚Äì was a reminder of the possibility of Greece having to leave the euro.
Poungoura, who trained in computer graphics, had been struggling to find a job over the past few years, so she had opened her shop almost two months ago. ‚ÄúAt fist I thought people would think I was absolutely crazy starting a business. But I‚Äôm starting fresh, other businesses have debts and owe lots of money, it‚Äôs much easier for me to survive.‚Äù She said she worked from 10am to 3am each day and didn‚Äôt feel able to take on staff. ‚ÄúTourist income is the biggest income we have, the biggest hope,‚Äù she said. Poungoura had had many German tourist customers, one of whom had been buying Bild every day for three weeks. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt let politics get in the way of personal relations,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúGreeks do not hate German people, many of my friends live in Germany, many have gone there to work.‚Äù Those working in Greek tourism worry that any VAT hikes that might be imposed under a financial deal in the coming days might force a rise in prices. On Perea‚Äôs beachfront, value for money was a crucial draw for tourists. ‚ÄúThe other day, some German visitors came in and bought six bottles of wine. They said they were going to Athens and the same wine would be far more expensive if they bought it there. Price does matter,‚Äù Poungoura said. Angela Verbeneiuc, a Romanian economist, had been travelling the beaches with her family, attracted by the weather and the prices. She had noticed the high contingent of eastern European and Russian visitors. Nikolai Marchenko, an engineer from Siberia who worked in Thessaloniki and was showing tourist friends around, said that if Greece left the euro there was ‚Äúno doubt‚Äù the country would turn to Russia for support. Susan and Roger Askill, from the West Midlands, had been travelling in Rhodes and Crete before returning to the Cyprus cottage they had retired to several years ago. They had heeded Foreign Office advice to bring enough cash to get by in case of bank closures, and used hotel safes during their journey. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs best to be prepared but we never considered cancelling our trip,‚Äù Susan Askill said. Odd Skriubakken, a retired teacher from Sarpsborg, Norway, said: ‚ÄúMy wife has just retired and needed some sun. We booked months ago and wouldn‚Äôt have dreamt of cancelling. Despite everything, Greece is still seen primarily as a holiday destination. I‚Äôd rather come here to spend money helping the economy and helping the people.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-21T15:08:05Z,world,World news,Saudi Arabia tells citizens to ignore latest WikiLeaks release,"Saudi Arabia has warned its citizens to ignore thousands of its diplomatic documents leaked by the transparency site WikiLeaks, which give a rare insight into the kingdom‚Äôs habit of buying influence and monitoring dissidents. The 61,000 Saudi cables, the first tranche of 500,000 promised by Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, also show the country‚Äôs sharp focus on its strategic rival Iran and the revolution in Egypt, and support for allies and clients in Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and elsewhere in the Middle East. Nothing yet published matches embarrassing revelations about the Saudis in WikiLeaks‚Äô 2010 release of US diplomatic documents, which reported King Abdullah calling to ‚Äúcut off the head of the [Iranian] snake‚Äù as well as drink- and drug-fuelled partying by minor royals in Jeddah. But routine secret correspondence from the foreign ministry in Riyadh and embassies abroad, some from as recently as April this year, catalogues many of the preoccupations of the conservative monarchy, the world‚Äôs biggest oil exporter, especially during the turbulent period of the Arab spring from early 2011. According to one document, Gulf states were prepared to pay $10bn (¬£6.3bn) to secure the release of the deposed Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak, which appears to support a previous claim about this by a leading Muslim Brotherhood politician. A 2012 cable reveals concern that Iran was receiving ‚Äúflirting American messages‚Äù that suggested the US did not oppose a peaceful Iranian nuclear programme so long as it had guarantees, including from Russia. Others from that period show Saudi plans for an anti-Iran satellite TV channel to broadcast in Persian from Bahrain, and plans to disrupt Iranian channels. The cables show Riyadh often seems worried about any advantage for Tehran: one document explains that if an Arab summit conference were held as scheduled in Baghdad in 2012, it would mean ‚Äúhanding Iraq to Iran‚Äù. Cables also show efforts to back opponents of Nouri al-Maliki, the then Shia prime minister of Iraq, who was close to Iran. Correspondence from the embassy in Beirut shows contacts with the Lebanese Forces leader, Samir Geagea, over cash payments to ease financial problems. Geagea had publicly defended Saudi Arabia and opposed president Bashar al-Assad of Syria, and generally shown ‚Äúreadiness to do whatever the kingdom asks of him‚Äù, the cables say. Al-Akhbar, the Beirut newspaper that is publishing the documents with WikiLeaks, is a supporter of Assad and Iran‚Äôs Lebanese militia ally Hezbollah. The documents examined so far do not mention Saudi backing for anti-Assad rebels, most likely because these are handled by the country‚Äôs intelligence service. Correspondence from the Saudi embassy in London shows filming of protesters and a discussion of legal action against the Guardian over an article by Saad al-Faqih, an Islamist. An appearance by Faqih on Egypt‚Äôs ON TV channel brought a proposal to ‚Äúfind out how to co-opt it‚Äù. But the billionaire owner of the station, Naguib Sawiris, did not want to be ‚Äúopposed to the kingdom‚Äôs policies‚Äù and he ordered that Faqih never be interviewed again. ‚ÄúThe extent of Egypt‚Äôs ruling establishment‚Äôs self-prostitution to Saudi money is both embarrassing and unsurprising,‚Äù commented the writer Iyad al-Baghdadi, in one of many weekend social media reactions since the documents were released. Ala‚Äôa Shehabi, a Bahraini dissident concerned by the Saudi intervention in her country, called the trove a ‚Äúrare insight into the most opaque regime in the world‚Äù. Toby Matthiesen, a Cambridge University academic, said: ‚ÄúFor Saudi experts there is little surprising so far ‚Ä¶ but the details will hurt a lot of corrupt people.‚Äù The documents include several references to ‚Äúhostile‚Äù media. An undated note describes the influence of journalists sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood on the Qatar-owned channel al-Jazeera, which has often fallen foul of the Saudis. The papers also show how in 2010 they purchased hundreds or thousands of subscriptions to publications in Damascus, Abu Dhabi, Beirut, Kuwait, Jordan and Mauritania in order to secure favourable coverage. Influence and money are recurring themes. Reports from Sana‚Äôa state that the proceeds of the sale of 3m barrels of oil given to Yemen in 2012 never reached the country‚Äôs treasury. Another document accuses Qatar of paying a Yemeni sheikh to foment rebellion in the army and to prevent the 2012 presidential election of Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi. The Sydney Morning Herald found documents with instructions from the Saudi government to its Canberra embassy relating to the payment of large subsidies to prominent Arabic newspapers and media organisations in Australia. The Sunday Times reported that a document in the cache showed Saudi Arabia was prepared to pay the BBC correspondent Frank Gardner ¬£1m in compensation after he was shot in Riyadh by al-Qaida. Gardner told the newspaper the compensation never materialised. On Sunday the Saudi foreign ministry spokesman Osama Nugali warned citizens not to ‚Äúallow enemies of the state to achieve their intentions in regards to exchanging or publishing any documents,‚Äù many of which, he said, had been ‚Äúfabricated in a very obvious manner‚Äù. WikiLeaks did not say where it obtained the documents, but it referred in a press release to Riyadh‚Äôs statement in May that it had suffered a breach of its computer networks ‚Äì an attack later claimed by a group calling itself the Yemen Cyber Army. The Guardian has not been able to independently verify the authenticity of the documents. Reuters and the Associated Press contributed to this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-21T14:56:06Z,world,World news,Greece and eurozone leaders in last-ditch scramble to reach deal,"The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, and European leaders were attempting to stitch together a last-minute Greek bailout deal on Sunday following a frantic round of phone calls to discuss an outline agreement. The high-level diplomacy comes as eurozone finance ministers and their government leaders prepare for a key summit in Brussels on Monday that could determine whether or not Greece remains a member of the group. Following a cabinet meeting in Athens, Tsipras is believed to have offered Greece‚Äôs creditors concessions on key issues such as VAT and pensions. It is not clear, however, whether the offer goes far enough to make a final agreement possible on Monday. Eurozone leaders are offering Tsipras a form of debt relief - the key point for Athens - but not immediately. Greece needs to pay the IMF ‚Ç¨1.6bn by 30 June. It is understood that the only way it will be able to make the payment is if the European Central Bank - one of its three creditors - raises the ceiling on the volume of short-term debt that the government can sell to the Greek central bank. Tsipras, the German chancellor Angela Merkel, the French president Fran√ßois Hollande and the European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker talked to one another by phone on Saturday and Sunday while technocrats from both sides resumed contact on the fiscal arithmetic required to secure up to ‚Ç¨9bn (¬£6.4bn) in rescue funds to Greece to stave off bankruptcy, default and possibly the eurozone‚Äôs first departure. ‚ÄúThe prime minister presented the three leaders with Greece‚Äôs proposal for a mutually beneficial agreement that will give a definitive solution and not a postponement of addressing the problem,‚Äù a statement from Tsipras‚Äôs office said. The new proposals were also being discussed at a Greek cabinet meeting on Sunday.
Eurozone leaders will meet on Monday evening following the collapse of extremely bad-tempered talks last week in Luxembourg. The summit will be preceded by the second gathering of eurozone finance ministers in four days as they scramble to strike a deal before the bailout expires at the end of the month. The Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, said his country‚Äôs fate was in Merkel‚Äôs hands and told her she faced a stark decision. He said there would be no agreement that did not include the prospect of debt relief for Greece, something not on offer from the eurozone unless Tsipras commits to and proves he can implement the kind of austerity measures he was elected to reject. Monday evening‚Äôs leaders‚Äô summit will have difficulty agreeing on a new deal unless the finance ministers reach a consensus on the detail. There was talk that the summit would fail to finalise an agreement, but could agree outlines that would then be worked on through the week before yet another summit next week, just as Greece‚Äôs bailout package is due to lapse. The last-ditch talks come as Tsipras‚Äôs Syriza party plans a rally in Athens to send ‚Äúa loud message of resistance‚Äù against demands for more cuts and tax hikes in a country battered by years of recession. ‚ÄúDemocracy cannot be blackmailed, dignity cannot be bargained,‚Äù the party said in a statement on Sunday, announcing the protest. ‚ÄúWorkers, the unemployed, young people, the Greek people and the rest of the peoples of Europe will send a loud message of resistance to the alleged one-way path of austerity, resistance to the blackmail and scare-mongering.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-21T14:26:34Z,world,World news,Al-Jazeera journalist Ahmed Mansour held in Germany on Egyptian warrant,"A senior journalist with al-Jazeera has been detained in Germany as a result of an Egyptian arrest warrant, raising a possible international dimension to the antagonism between Cairo and the Qatar-based network. Ahmed Mansour was detained at Berlin‚Äôs Tegel airport while attempting to board a flight to Doha on Saturday, and his case was due to be considered by prosecutors in Berlin on Monday. Mansour was convicted in absentia in 2014 of torturing a lawyer in Tahrir Square in 2011. He rejected the charges, calling them ‚Äúa flimsy attempt at character assassination‚Äù. The British-Egyptian journalist initially told al-Jazeera that authorities in Germany held him on an Interpol notice; however it later transpired he was held after a request from Egypt. Martin Steltner, a spokesman for the Berlin state prosecutor in whose custody Mansour was held, said: ‚ÄúIt was an Egyptian arrest warrant ... The problem is, as state prosecutors we have jurisdiction because he was arrested in Berlin. We cannot begin to assess the content of the arrest warrant yet. We‚Äôre going to start that tomorrow [Monday].‚Äù Steltner said that if the case had political consequences, the foreign ministry would be involved in the decision about what to do with Mansour. The arrest, coming only two weeks after Abdel Fatah al-Sisi‚Äôs state visit to Berlin, has sparked outrage among Germany‚Äôs opposition parties. ‚ÄúAfter the red carpet for Sisi, is the German government now [his] henchman?‚Äù said Green party MP Franziska Brantner on Twitter. Egypt accuses both Qatar and al-Jazeera of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, which was branded a terrorist organisation after the military deposed president Mohamed Morsi in 2013. Three journalists with al-Jazeera English spent more than 400 days in prison following their arrest in Cairo in late 2013. The trial was regarded internationally as a farce.Steltner also said that if the case had political consequences, the foreign ministry would be involved in the decision about what to do with Mansour. Whether it is down to a bureaucratic misunderstanding or not, the arrest, coming only two weeks after Abdel Fatah al-Sisi‚Äôs state visit to Berlin, has sparked outrage among Germany‚Äôs opposition parties, and already looks like an embarrassment for Angela Merkel‚Äôs government. Mansour was convicted in absentia in 2014 of torturing a lawyer in Tahrir Square in 2011. Mansour rejected the charges, calling them ‚Äúa flimsy attempt at character assassination‚Äù. Meik Gauer, a spokesman for the federal police in Berlin, earlier told the Guardian: ‚ÄúIt was an international arrest warrant. We handed him over to the Berlin police last night. He will be arraigned before the committing magistrate, who will decide whether he stays in custody or whether he will be extradited or what happens in this case. I expect that to happen on Monday. ‚ÄúAll countries that put out an international arrest warrant that is also valid in Germany will go via the Bundeskriminalamt [federal criminal police office],‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúThe BKA then puts the arrest warrant into its system, so that the federal police at the border control also has access to it. Our contact is not Interpol, but the BKA ‚Äì that is the central base where all documents for Germany are filed. I don‚Äôt know if Interpol had anything to do with it.‚Äù An online petition calling on Angela Merkel to release Mansour has gathered around 17,000 signatures. Interpol said in October 2014 that it had denied a request from Egypt to issue a ‚Äúred notice‚Äù ‚Äì similar to an international arrest warrant ‚Äì as the request did not satisfy its requirements. Reached by phone in Cairo, a spokesman for Egypt‚Äôs interior ministry declined to comment on the case. Interpol confirmed there was no red notice, but declined to comment further. Al-Jazeera‚Äôs acting director general, Mostefa Souag, said: ‚ÄúThe crackdown on journalists by Egyptian authorities is well known. Our network, as the Arab world‚Äôs most-watched, has taken the brunt of this. Other countries must not allow themselves to be tools of this media oppression, least of all those that respect freedom of the media as does Germany.‚Äù Mansour recently conducted an interview with Abu Muhammad al-Julani, the leader of Jabhat al-Nusra, a Syrian insurgent group affiliated with al-Qaida. Mansour‚Äôs detention could raise concerns for three journalists with al-Jazeera English who are facing an ongoing ordeal in the Egyptian legal system. Mohamed Fahmy, Baher Mohamed and Peter Greste spent more than 400 days in prison after they were arrested in Cairo in December 2013. They were convicted in a bizarre trial of collaborating with a terrorist group ‚Äì a reference to the Muslim Brotherhood ‚Äì and sentenced to seven to 10 years in prison. An appeals court ordered a retrial in that case in December, and Greste was deported to his home country of Australia. He faces a possible conviction in absentia as the retrial comes to a conclusion in Cairo in the coming weeks. He called Mansour‚Äôs arrest a ‚Äúhugely worrying development‚Äù. Al-Jazeera has been at the centre of a geopolitical dispute between Egypt and Qatar, a small Gulf state widely regarded as sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood. Since Egypt‚Äôs armed forces removed the Brotherhood-backed president Morsi from power in July 2013, a military-backed government has launched a clampdown on the Brotherhood and other opposition groups. Thousands of people have been jailed and more than 1,000 killed in a series of confrontations between security forces and pro-Morsi protesters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-21T12:25:17Z,world,World news,Scan of mummified body of Swedish bishop reveals baby hidden in coffin,"For almost 350 years Bishop Peder Winstrup lay quietly in his coffin in the crypt of the magnificent cathedral at Lund in Sweden, concealing a secret: the body of a tiny baby, tucked in under his feet. The little corpse, believed to be of a baby born several months prematurely, was revealed for the first time when scientists scanned the coffin and the mummified body of Peder Winstrup, believed to be one of the best preserved 17th-century bodies in Europe. ‚ÄúOne of the main discoveries when we conducted the CT scanning was that Mr Winstrup is not alone in the coffin,‚Äù Per Karsten, director of the historical museum at Lund University, said. ‚ÄúActually, he has a companion, a small child, a five- to six-months-old foetus of a human child, and it has been deliberately concealed under his feet at the bottom of the coffin ‚Äì so maybe there is a connection.‚Äù The discovery came as a complete surprise to the scientists, who had only expected to find a wealth of information about Winstrup‚Äôs life and social conditions in 17th-century Sweden. The imposing coffin in the crypt of the cathedral had been opened several times before, and a black and white photograph taken almost a century ago showed the remarkable condition of the remains, with all his clothes perfectly preserved and his bearded face shrunken but still recognisable from a portrait. The earlier investigations missed the baby, buried in the deep layer of herbs which half filled the coffin.
DNA testing is planned for both bishop and baby to see if they are related. However Karsten believes the baby may have been illegitimate and destined for burial in unsanctified ground, and that somebody took advantage of the bishop‚Äôs burial to give it a Christian resting place. Winstrup was a scholar, scientist, collector and theologian, and one of the founders of Lund University in 1666, now ranked among the top 100 in the world. He was appointed Bishop of Lund in 1638, holding the title as the diocese and the region transferred from Danish to Swedish control, and died in 1679 ‚Äì probably, the research has revealed, of pneumonia after several long and painful illnesses including gout, arthritis, gallstones, plaque which would have affected his heart, and possibly tuberculosis. One consequence of his wealth was that he had access to sugar, denied to most people in his day, which cost him the loss of many teeth and decay in several remaining ones. ‚ÄúThe gall bladder also has several gallstones, which could indicate a high consumption of fatty food,‚Äù Caroline Ahlstr√∂m Arcini, an osteologist working on the project, said. He had also injured a tendon in his shoulder, which she said meant he would have had difficulty even with simple tasks, such as combing his hair or putting on a shirt. The coffin was opened in order to apply modern scientific techniques to a body known to be in remarkable condition. The other surprise for the scientists was that the body was not embalmed; it was naturally dried out with all its internal organs. The bishop was buried on a mattress stuffed with herbs including juniper and wormwood, and a pillow of hops, which the scientists believe would not just have masked the smell but helped preserve the remains. Although the colours have faded, his clothes were also perfectly preserved, including a velvet cape and leather gloves. More tests are planned, but the two bodies will eventually be reburied ‚Äì together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-21T12:18:15Z,world,World news,Anti-austerity protest passes off peacefully with just five arrests,"Britain‚Äôs largest anti-austerity demonstration in four years has passed off with only five arrests made. Between 70,000 and 150,000 people marched through central London on Saturday to protest against government plans for deep budget cuts before a rally in Parliament Square. The Metropolitan police worked with organisers to run a low-key policing operation, with few officers visible along the route. ‚ÄúThere were five arrests throughout the operation ‚Äì none of them for anything major,‚Äù a Met spokesman said. Those arrested were taken in on suspicion of criminal damage, possession of articles to commit criminal damage, assault on police, theft and recall to prison, the spokesman added.
At one point, a group of demonstrators dressed in black with their faces covered split off from the main march and crossed Waterloo bridge to the South Bank but they were quickly surrounded by police. Another protest group, Sisters Uncut, for a while blocked Westminster bridge, which was not among the roads closed for the demonstration, but police took no action. An outbreak of heavy rain dispersed most protesters from Parliament Square at around 6pm on Saturday. Nearby pubs were full, although many protesters from further afield were ferried back to their home towns in coaches. Some media reports had stoked fears that a hard core of protesters would try to hijack the event. The Mail on Sunday accused activists of a ‚Äúriot plot‚Äù to turn the demonstration into a ‚Äúrampage‚Äù, claims those named in the story have denied. In the week leading up to the demonstration, a police crackdown led to the arrest of activists previously linked to direct actions in London. Several were given police bail conditions forbidding them from attending the protest. There were no arrests at at a smaller anti-austerity demonstration in Glasgow, Police Scotland said. Demonstrations also took place in Bristol and Liverpool. No one at Avon and Somerset police or Merseyside police was available for comment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-21T12:02:37Z,world,World news,Berkeley balcony collapse: families vow to fight to prevent similar accidents,"The families of two of the six students who died in the Berkeley balcony collapse have vowed to fight to ensure similar accidents never happen again. As the first four bodies of the Irish students arrived back home on Sunday morning, the families of Ashley Donohoe, a US-Irish citizen from Rohnert Park, California, and Olivia Burke, her first cousin from Dublin, said their children died through no fault of their own. Last week there was outrage in Ireland over a New York Times article that highlighted the drunken antics of Irish students on the west coast of the US just hours after the six young people fell to their deaths outside the Berkeley apartment complex. The Donohoe and Burke families said: ‚ÄúThe family want everyone to know and understand that Ashley and Olivia were two intelligent, talented and hardworking women. They had bright futures ahead of them.
‚ÄúWe will fight to make changes so that no family will ever have to go through what we have been through for the past five days which has changed our lives for ever. ‚ÄúOur daughters and all the other students were responsible young adults who were celebrating their friend‚Äôs 21st birthday in what they felt was a safe environment. Unfortunately that turned to tragedy through no fault of their own.‚Äù Families of four of the dead, Eoghan Culligan, Lorc√°n Miller, Niccolai Schuster and Eimear Walsh, issued a statement on Saturday night thanking everyone in the US and Ireland for their sympathy and support and asking for their privacy to be respected. Before leaving San Francisco the families said: ‚ÄúOur children were extraordinarily blessed in their friends and we are enormously proud of them. As we leave Berkeley and return home to Ireland with our beloved sons and daughters we would like to thank everyone in America and Ireland for their sympathy and support, which has been a tremendous comfort to us at this tragic time.‚Äù The bodies of the four students are now in Dublin after the plane taking their remains home to Ireland landed around 11.15am on Sunday. The relatives of Olivia Burke are flying back to Ireland later on Sunday. The inquiry into the balcony collapse is focusing on rain damage and dry rot as possible causes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-21T11:27:51Z,world,World news,"Hitler's art of flowers and fairytale castles sells for ¬£280,000 at auction","Fourteen watercolours and drawings by Adolf Hitler have fetched a total of ‚Ç¨391,000 (¬£280,000) at a controversial auction in Nuremberg. A view of Bavaria‚Äôs famous fairytale castle Neuschwanstein brought the highest price of ‚Ç¨100,000 (¬£71,500) at the auction on Saturday, while a still life of a bunch of carnations fetched ‚Ç¨73,000. The other works, all painted or drawn between 1904 and 1922, and most of which are signed ‚ÄúA Hitler‚Äù, included views of various buildings in Vienna, an image of Prague in the fog, and a female nude. According to the Weidler auction house, the bidders were investors in China, France, Brazil, Germany and the United Arab Emirates. Auctioneer Kathrin Weidler told DPA news agency: ‚ÄúThese collectors do not specialise in this painter, but have a general interest in high-value art.‚Äù There is no law against the sale of Hitler‚Äôs art works in Germany as long as they do not show any Nazi symbols, but press commentators have questioned the morality of allowing such auctions to go ahead. The Weidler auction house has previously defended the sale of Hitler‚Äôs paintings on the grounds that they represented ‚Äúhistorical documents‚Äù. In November 2014, Weidler also sold Hitler‚Äôs painting of a Munich register office for ‚Ç¨130,000 ‚Äì the high price was attributed to the original sales bill that came with it. In 2009, Mullock‚Äôs auction house in Shropshire sold 15 of Hitler‚Äôs paintings for a total of ¬£97,672.
Few in Germany want to be seen making a profit from the Nazi dictator‚Äôs work. The Bavarian state archive, which owns some of Hitler‚Äôs work, has a policy of not paying for the works, but accepts them as donations in order to take them out of circulation. Last November, the head of the auction house, Herbert Weidler, promised to give some of the proceeds of the sale of Hitler‚Äôs Munich painting to charity, saying that if none accepted the offer, the local civic preservation society Altstadtfreunde N√ºrnberg (‚ÄúFriends of the old city of Nuremberg‚Äù) would be given the money. The chairman of the society, Karl-Heinz Enderle, immediately expressed surprise at the presumption that he would accept the donation, and told local media that he had no intention of taking it. The Nazi dictator is thought to have produced hundreds of art works as a young man when he was eking out a living in Munich and Vienna, but there are also thought to be many forgeries on the market. ‚ÄúSince Hitler had no style of his own as a painter, but generally just copied, it is very difficult to be sure what is by Hitler,‚Äù Vienna art historian Birgit Schwarz told Die Welt newspaper last year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-21T11:00:07Z,world,World news,'The home of racism': Walter Scott and church shootings lay bare Charleston's original sin,"The white suspects are being held in an isolation wing of the same jail: a four-storey fortified facility that sits next to a swampy river bend on the outskirts of Charleston, surrounded by razor wire and patrolled by police dogs. The prisoner in cell 1140B at Charleston County detention center is Michael Slager, 33, the North Charleston police officer who was charged with murder 10 weeks ago, after video footage surfaced showing him shooting a black man, Walter Scott, in the back as he fled, unarmed. On Thursday, Slager was joined in the Administrative Segregation Unit by Dylann Roof, less than 48 hours after the 21-year-old allegedly walked into a historically black church in the city, prayed with worshipers and then opened fire. He reloaded up to five times. By the end of his shooting spree nine congregants, all of them black, were dead. Their ages ranged from 26 to 87. At the jail on Friday, after an emotionally charged bond hearing at which family victims stood up to express their grief but offer forgiveness, Mitch Lucas, the jail‚Äôs administrator, was frank in explaining why two of his newest and most notorious inmates were held in such close proximity. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so they don‚Äôt get killed before we get them to court,‚Äù he told reporters. While Slager and Roof stand accused of very different crimes, both are charged with gunning down black victims in shootings that intensified a national debate about race in America. The geographical proximity of the two tragedies, if nothing else, invites comparisons. The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church, where Roof killed his victims after reportedly telling friends he wanted to spark ‚Äúa race war‚Äù, is less than 12 miles from the unremarkable grassy knoll where Slager was filmed shooting Scott five times in the back. Technically, they were in separate cities ‚Äì North Charleston, where Scott was killed, is its own jurisdiction. But it was the same, sprawling conurbation. ‚ÄúThe community has still not healed from what happened to Walter Scott,‚Äù said Tamika Myers, who works for a group that comforts victims of gun violence. ‚ÄúThis is devastating.‚Äù But Myers said she was uncomfortable about linking the two tragedies. ‚ÄúThere is a big racial issue here, and people need to open their eyes to that,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut these were two different deaths.‚Äù ‚ÄòIt looked like he was trying to kill a deer or something‚Äô
In many ways, of course, Slager‚Äôs shooting of Scott is not comparable with the bloody massacre that unfolded at the Emanuel church on Wednesday. Roof exhibited hallmarks of a white supremacist, posting an image of himself on Facebook in a jacket emblazoned with the flag of apartheid-era South Africa. After spending an hour with a Bible study group in the basement of the Emanuel church on Wednesday, he suddenly pulled a handgun from a fanny pack and opened fire. When his victims pleaded with him to stop, Roof is said to have told them: ‚ÄúYou rape our women and you‚Äôre taking over our country. You have to go.‚Äù Before he left the church, according to a court warrant, Roof uttered ‚Äúracially inflammatory‚Äù remarks to one of the survivors. The incident in which Scott died, in stark contrast, spiralled from a routine traffic stop. There has been no suggestion of overt racist intent. On 4 April, Slager spotted Scott driving with a broken tail light and pulled him over. When Scott fled the scene, the officer gave chase and a scuffle ensued. The 50-year-old wriggled free and was running away when he was shot in the back. When eyewitness video of the incident emerged, it immediately prompted sharp questions about the value of black lives in America and the levels of state violence committed against African American men. Slager was caught on video removing his firearm, pausing, taking aim and then discharging his weapon eight times. ‚ÄúWhen I saw it, I fell to my feet and my heart was broken,‚Äù Walter Scott‚Äôs father, also named Walter, told a TV reporter at the time. ‚ÄúIt looked like he was trying to kill a deer or something, running through the woods.‚Äù Charleston residents are divided over whether there are parallels between the two shootings. Some argue the consecutive tragedies are just a terrible coincidence. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see the correlation, other than that innocent people have died and it gives our city the sense we will never be the same,‚Äù said William Dudley Gregorie, a soft-spoken city councilman and trustee of the Emanuel church, where he has worshipped all his life. ‚ÄòCharleston is the home of racism‚Äô Others in the city contend there are obvious parallels that cannot be ignored, and say they speak to wider truths about racial inequality in America. Both shootings shocked the nation, and were immediately interpreted ‚Äì in the court of public opinion, at least ‚Äì through the prism of race. McKayla Roberts, 21, was one of a handful of locals who appeared at the Emanuel church in the aftermath of the shooting in the same Black Lives Matter T-shirts they had worn to protests over Scott‚Äôs death three months ago.
‚Äú‚ÄòBlack lives matter‚Äô means more than police shouldn‚Äôt be killing us,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt means people shouldn‚Äôt be killing people, period.‚Äù She was cautious not to to ascribe motives to either the shooting of Scott or the massacre at the Emanuel church, but said she was not surprised tragedies with such obvious racial dimensions should befall her city. ‚ÄúCharleston is the home, the mother of racism,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúRemember this is where they brought us Africans first.‚Äù Charleston‚Äôs history, and much of its wealth, was born from the slave trade ‚Äì some 70% of African slaves brought to America were shipped to Charleston‚Äôs port. The Emanuel is the oldest black congregation south of Baltimore: in 1822, one of its founders, Denmark Vesey, was the ringleader of a planned slave revolt, one of at least two to emerge from the church. Martin Luther King was one of several civil rights leaders to visit the church in the 1960s. The church massacre has brought historic racial tension to the fore again, rejuvenating a campaign to have the Confederate flag permanently removed from its position flying on the grounds of the state house. Leaders argue its very presence is a bitter reminder of South Carolina‚Äôs torrid history and say they will propose a bill, named after a victim of the massacre, in the state legislature for the flag‚Äôs removal. Experts maintain that South Carolina has been unable to effectively deal with white supremacy and extremism, with Roof himself a prime example of its pervasiveness in certain sectors of society here. ‚ÄúSouth Carolina has been a hotbed of pro-Confederate sympathy, running right up to the current date,‚Äù said Heidi Beirich, director of the intelligence project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups. ‚ÄúThis is just a state with a lot of racial problems and a lot of historical baggage.‚Äù ‚ÄúAt times, it‚Äôs been placed with the highest per capita rate of hate groups,‚Äù Beirich said, adding it is now home at to least 19 active hate groups. One leader of Charleston‚Äôs local Black Lives Matter protest movement, Shakem Ahket, 35, said he believed there was ‚Äúsome connection‚Äù between racial tension sparked by Scott‚Äôs shooting and Roof‚Äôs decision to carry out his massacre in the town. He pointed out how the pastor of the Emanuel church ‚Äì a state senator named Clementa Pinckney, who was the most high profile of the nine victims ‚Äì was a leading voice for justice following Scott‚Äôs death. ‚ÄúI believe he was targeted,‚Äù said Ahket, saying the pastor‚Äôs response to Scott‚Äôs killing, and the history of the church, had to be more than a coincidence. ‚ÄúThis would be the perfect place for a white supremacist to kind of send a message that they are in total opposition to any kind of black liberation.‚Äù Pinckney campaigned for body cameras to be made mandatory for police and hosted town hall discussions about Scott‚Äôs death in the weeks following the shooting. Pinckney‚Äôs cousin, Sylvia Johnson, has said that when Roof arrived at the church he specifically asked to meet the pastor, raising the possibility that the attack on Pinckney was somehow premeditated. Roof has so far not explained his motives but on Saturday a website containing a manifesto apparently written by Roof came to light. That manifesto states: ‚ÄúI chose Charleston because it is most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country. We have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the internet. ‚ÄúWell someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me.‚Äù The author also claims to have been ‚Äútruly awakened‚Äù by the case of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager who was killed by George Zimmerman in Florida three years ago. After his arrest on Thursday in North Carolina, 250 miles away from Charleston, Roof reportedly confessed to the killings. His conversations with detectives have not been publicly released. Prior to his arrest, police said there was nothing to suggest he worked in coordination with any wider white supremacist network. ‚ÄúWhy that young man chose this church instead of our church across the way when we have meetings in the evening?‚Äù asked Cress Darwin, a white pastor at the nearby Second Presbyterian church. ‚ÄúWas it because they were black and this is such a visible and historic church? I don‚Äôt know. But I do know that if it was done to separate us further, it won‚Äôt work.‚Äù Race in America
Many of the mourners who emerged on Charleston‚Äôs streets this week for a succession of vigils talked about how the church massacre has brought them together. Scott‚Äôs death back in April itself brought legislative action, with a new law now mandating all police officers in South Carolina must wear body cameras. ‚ÄúThe body camera bill had no chance, there was no way in the world it was ever going to pass, then Walter Scott got killed and the paradigm shifted, and then all of a sudden what couldn‚Äôt be done became a done deal,‚Äù pastor Nelson B Rivers, from the National Action Network civil rights group, told a large vigil on Friday. Yet on a much broader level there are few signs that the racial tensions that have risen to the fore over the past year have done much to heal the country‚Äôs historical divisions. Scott‚Äôs death was just the latest in a long line of deaths of black men at the hands of police that have prompted a national conversation some say is unprecedented. The shooting of Michael Brown in August last year prompted rioting in Ferguson, Missouri, and protests that later spread across the country. There was the police shooting of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old gunned down by police as he played with a replica gun in Cleveland; and the death of Eric Garner, who died after being placed in a chokehold in Staten Island, New York. Both were caught on camera. In the same month Slager shot Scott, Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old African American, died after being arrested in Baltimore. His death later led to rioting in the city. At the height of those disturbances Baltimore‚Äôs congressman, Elijah Cummings, walked into the epicentre to tell reporters they were witnessing ‚Äúthe civil rights cause for this generation‚Äù. ‚ÄúAmerica needs to wake up ‚Äì big time,‚Äù he said. In contrast, Barack Obama, America‚Äôs first black president, has struggled to speak about the country‚Äôs racial conflicts in a way that resonates on the ground. Opinion polls have repeatedly shown that a majority of Americans believe race relations have become worse, not better, during Obama‚Äôs six years in the White House. In the aftermath of the Charleston shooting, on Thursday, Obama said it ‚Äúobviously raises questions about a dark part of our history‚Äù.
‚ÄúThe good news,‚Äù he then added, ‚Äúis I am confident that the outpouring of unity and strength and fellowship and love across Charleston today, from all races, from all faiths, from all places of worship, indicates the degree to which those old vestiges of hatred can be overcome.‚Äù Comedian Jon Stewart, however, articulated in starker terms the frustration felt by many in America. ‚ÄúI have nothing other than just sadness that once again we have to peer into the abyss of the depraved violence that we do to each other, and the nexus of a just gaping racial wound that will not heal but we pretend doesn‚Äôt exist,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confident, though, that by acknowledging it, by staring into that and seeing it for what it is, we still won‚Äôt do jackshit.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúYeah. That‚Äôs us.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-21T07:39:03Z,world,World news,Greek crisis: episodes of despair and drama as moment of truth nears,"Sunday Five years is a long time to be in crisis. It‚Äôs freefall by a thousand cuts; loss in myriad ways, hard choices that never get easier. Last week, as Greece descended into drama, a young man appeared on the marble steps of the neoclassical building opposite my home. Head in hand, he sat there from Sunday to Wednesday, in the beating sun, a wheelie bag in front of him, a slice of cardboard perched on top that read: ‚ÄúI am homeless. Help please!‚Äù When you live in Athens you do not flinch at the signs of decay: to do so would be to give in. But somehow the sight of this forlorn figure ‚Äì a waif of a man, eyes fixed only at his feet, the embodiment of wounded pride ‚Äì brought home as never before that Greeks are in crisis. Was he giving up or making a hard choice? If he was 22, and he barely seemed that, his entire adult life had been spent in crisis. This is the great tragedy of Greece. It has not only been needlessly impoverished; it now eats up its own. The elderly woman who occasionally rifles through the rubbish bins on the corner of the square my office overlooks ‚Äì often carrying a Louis Vuitton bag ‚Äì is so glad she was born at the end of the 1946-49 civil war. ‚ÄúAt least then it could get better. Today it can only get worse.‚Äù
Monday For five years we have all felt as if we are on a runaway train, hurtling into the unknown. Sometimes the train picks up speed, sometimes it slows down, but never enough to stop. This week, as the drumbeat of default, impending bankruptcy and disastrous euro exit thudded ever louder, the train felt as if it might derail altogether. Had a lunatic got hold of the controls? On Monday morning it began to feel like it. For me, the day started at 2am when I received a text from Euclid Tsakalotos, the point-man in negotiations between Athens and the European Union, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund ‚Äì the three bodies keeping the debt-stricken country afloat. ‚ÄúWe made huge efforts to meet them halfway,‚Äù he wrote hours after talks reached an impasse over a reform-for-cash deal that could save Greece. ‚ÄúBut they insisted on pension and wage cuts.‚Äù By mid-morning, global stock markets were tumbling. By midday, the world had learned that, without an agreement, Greece might not be able to honour an end-of-month debt repayment to the IMF worth ‚Ç¨1.6bn (¬£1.1bn). By midnight, newscasters, looking decidedly nervous, had broken their own taboo: many were talking openly of euro exit.
Tuesday From the outset, the Greeks have felt at war. For most, it has been a war of attrition, a levelling of life under the brute force of austerity. The relentless budget cuts and tax increases demanded in return for two bailouts ‚Äì at ‚Ç¨240bn, the biggest rescue programmes in global financial history ‚Äì were the breeding ground for the anger that fuelled Syriza, the radical left anti-austerity party catapulted into power in January; the creditors, with Germany at the helm, the convenient scapegoats for pent-up anger and rage. But by Tuesday the environment had become more poisoned still. Addressing his increasingly irate Syriza MPs, the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, ratcheted up the pressure, accusing the IMF of ‚Äúcriminal responsibility‚Äù. Greece would ‚Äúnever submit‚Äù to its, or Europe‚Äôs, ‚Äúirrational demands‚Äù. Later that day, the deputy defence minister, Costas Isychos, insisted that Athens meant what it said. ‚ÄúWe are going to stop this neoliberal tsunami and this is not a bluff or a poker game. We are simply not going to go back on our promises,‚Äù he told me. Was he not afraid of Grexit? Hadn‚Äôt I noticed, he retorted, that Europe was crumbling? ‚ÄúI hope they come to their senses and stop blackmailing the Greek government and the Greek people,‚Äù he snapped. ‚ÄúWe cannot have a lowering of wages and pensions. We cannot be the only country without trade union rights or basic salaries. They cannot continue to use Greece as a giant guinea pig for neoliberal dogmas.‚Äù With the rhetoric at such levels, it did not take long for diplomatic niceties to be dispensed with in Brussels. The ever-collected IMF chief, Christine Lagarde, would soon counter that there was an urgent need for dialogue with ‚Äúadults in the room‚Äù. Wednesday The background of this story is Europe and the desire of a small country on its southern periphery, surrounded by enemies to its east and an incendiary Balkan peninsula to its north, wanting to remain a member of its central core. But at what cost? On Wednesday, thousands piled into Syntagma square, facing parliament to protest against austerity. I chanced upon a group of schoolteachers, enraged that Europe was turning Greece into a ‚Äúslave colony of debt‚Äù. All of them Syriza voters, of one thing they were sure: the government had made far too many concessions. ‚ÄúTsipras‚Äôs mistake is that he hasn‚Äôt toughened his stance,‚Äù said Dimitris Papatheodourou, for years an educator in a secondary school in Athens. ‚ÄúThe government has already retreated on so many of its pre-election pledges. The 47-page proposal that it gave lenders [outlining reforms in return for cash] was horrible, a massive retreat.‚Äù Papatheodourou is typical of the growing contingent who now think Greece might be better off outside the eurozone. ‚ÄúI was never for rupture,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut now I am 100% sure that rupture is the only way out. Europeans are no longer being logical. The demands they are making are absurd.‚Äù Thursday Is time running out to save Greece? With Athens‚Äôs access to bailout funds expiring in nine days, lenders say that it is, in no uncertain terms. Almost everyone I know feels trapped in some tragicomic theatre of the absurd: bit-players in a drama whose every act feeds the next. The script has no rules, it is writing itself. Greece‚Äôs gargantuan debt may only have grown ‚Äì the result of a rescue programme that has overly emphasised fiscal targets at the expense of structural reform ‚Äì the economy may have shrunk by almost 30% and unemployment may be at record levels, but most Greeks still see Europe (and the euro) as the only way of ensuring that their country is saved from itself. The alternative ‚Äì a precipitous decline in living standards, runaway inflation, riots and worse ‚Äì is too awful to contemplate. On Thursday, an even larger crowd poured into Syntagma, this time to chant ‚Äúwe are staying in Europe‚Äù. Among them were many older Athenians ‚Äì clearly denizens of the city‚Äôs bourgeois elite, their hair coiffed, their Chanel suits immaculately pressed ‚Äì who ordinarily would never take to the streets. ‚ÄúPeople cannot believe what is happening. That we are looking at the prospect of the country going bankrupt or being ejected from the euro,‚Äù said Anna Asimakopoulou, a conservative MP who also took part in the protest. ‚ÄúFor the first time this week I thought they‚Äôre not bluffing, if they don‚Äôt get a deal that they see as halfway decent they‚Äôll go in the opposite direction, they‚Äôll take the country out of the single currency. But the truth is there are no quick-fix solutions. There is a bad scenario and a worst-case scenario. Either Tsipras accepts austerity worth ‚Ç¨5bn or we leave.‚Äù Earlier that day I had sat with Tsakalotos in his eighth-floor office overlooking parliament. Urbane, sober, mild-mannered, the Oxford-educated economist is the ‚Äúsoft‚Äù face of Syriza abroad ‚Äì the man who tempers the abrasiveness of the finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis. It was, he said, true that a ‚Äúgame of chicken‚Äù was being played. His hair had gone grey almost overnight. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not out of pique or pride that we are holding out. We are holding out because we want to be able to deliver what we promised. Our bottom line is we can‚Äôt sign an agreement that is not economically viable.‚Äù Not many had expected the drama to play out this long. As Europe‚Äôs pre-eminent anti-austerians, could they keep their nerve? ‚ÄúWe have no choice,‚Äù he said, as news arrived that a meeting of eurozone finance ministers had, yet again, ended in failure.
Friday By the morning it was clear a mini bank run was taking place. Queues outside ATMs were small and orderly, but by lunchtime, when lenders close for the week, withdrawals by worried depositors were estimated at more than ‚Ç¨3bn over the course of five days. In Russia, the visiting prime minister stepped up the brinkmanship, proudly announcing that little Greece was not scared ‚Äúto look towards other seas‚Äù. ‚ÄúJustice is on our side,‚Äù he said as Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, concurred that Athens‚Äôs creditors had misbehaved. Back in Athens, the headlines had become ever more dramatic. ‚ÄúLast chance for a deal‚Äù; ‚ÄúKnife at our throat‚Äù; ‚ÄúSOS Greece‚Äù, the dailies screamed from their front pages. Five months of fruitless talks have wrought further mayhem. With each passing day the economy, already in stasis, deteriorates a little more. The cumulative effect of businesses closing ‚Äì around 60 are believed to shut every day ‚Äì has brought job losses of more than 20,000 this year alone. That afternoon, in the boardroom of the Hellenic Confederation of professionals, craftsmen and merchants, Giorgos Kavvathas, the organisation‚Äôs president, painted a picture that was vivid and dark. He is a large man, who chose his words carefully as he fiddled with the cufflinks in his shirt. ‚ÄúThe market has been strangulated, there is no movement whatsoever,‚Äù he sighed. ‚ÄúAnd now they want us to take more measures, measures that have already failed, measures that will only make matters worse. What we are looking at is a slow death, because that is what they will mean.‚Äù Later that night I spoke with Fotini Tsaliloglou, Greece‚Äôs foremost professor of psychology. Degradation has come in stages and now the whole nation is terrified of losing hope ‚Äì the motto on which Syriza had run for office. ‚ÄúDignity is being tested,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe are in a double bind with no easy way out. Greeks are such a proud people, and they feel so humiliated both economically and symbolically. It is going to take them time to adjust to the loss.‚Äù Saturday Time, of course, is the one thing that is not on Greece‚Äôs side. And on Saturday, as the clock ticked ever closer to the make-or-break EU summit that will decide the country‚Äôs fate on Monday, it was menace that hung in the air.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-21T07:33:06Z,world,World news,Greek prime minister prepares last-ditch offer to avoid default on debts,"The race to save Greece from economic collapse has intensified as the country‚Äôs beleaguered leader conducted a flurry of behind-the-scenes negotiations before an EU summit on Monday that is expected to decide the country‚Äôs fate. Alexis Tsipras, the prime minister, met senior officials on Saturday in an attempt to devise a package of reforms that would secure emergency funds and avoid the nation defaulting on its massive debts. It will be the third such proposal that Athens has made to its creditors in as many weeks. ‚ÄúWe will try to supplement our proposal so that we get closer to a solution,‚Äù Greece‚Äôs minister of state, Alekos Flabouraris, told broadcaster Mega TV. ‚ÄúWe are not going [to the summit] with the old proposal. Some work is being done to see where we can converge, so that we achieve a mutually beneficial solution.‚Äù Flabouraris, widely seen as a mentor to the young prime minister, said Tsipras would hold crucial talks with the head of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker. The Greek cabinet will meet in an emergency session on Sunday with Tsipras also dispatching senior officials to Brussels. The frantic diplomacy came as Greece‚Äôs eurozone partners warned that, after five months of fruitless talks, the game was up for Tsipras‚Äôs radical leftwing government. The country, which has been thrown two lifelines since 2010, has until 30 June to secure ‚Ç¨7.2bn (¬£5.1bn) in bailout funds. Failure to release the loans will result in default, as Greece owes ‚Ç¨1.6bn to the International Monetary Fund at the end of the month. On Friday the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, who convened Monday‚Äôs summit, warned the situation was dire. Either Tsipras‚Äôs anti-austerity government accepted painful reforms, reportedly at a cost of ‚Ç¨5bn, he suggested, or it would go bust. ‚ÄúWe are close to the point where the Greek government will have to choose between accepting what I believe is a good offer of continued support or to head towards default,‚Äù he said in a video message. That ultimatum appears to have focused minds.
Among the measures that the Syriza-led coalition was reportedly working on on Saturday were reductions in early retirement schemes. Pension and VAT reforms, along with labour deregulation, remain sources of friction between the two sides. Speculation is rife that Greece‚Äôs creditors at the EU, European Central Bank and IMF would offer a six-month extension of the bailout programme ‚Äì disbursing more than ‚Ç¨10bn in aid to tide the country over the summer ‚Äì if agreement was reached. Discussions over a third bailout Athens will inevitably also require would be kicked down the road. Speaking to the Observer, Athens‚Äôs chief negotiator, Euclid Tsakalotos, described the prospect of a short-term deal as perhaps the worst possible outcome. Prolongation of the political uncertainty ‚Äì and scenarios of Greece‚Äôs enforced exit from the euro ‚Äì would, he said, do nothing for the country‚Äôs economic recovery. ‚ÄúWhat we need is a mid-term solution that will take us through to the end of 2016,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA short-term solution might be the worst of all. What we don‚Äôt want is a postponement of issues like Grexit and financing, so the economy remains depressed and people don‚Äôt have a shift in expectations. Optimism is a material force in the economy.‚Äù The war of words between Athens and its lenders reached boiling point last week amid signs of a complete breakdown of trust between the two. Writing in the Irish Times, the Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, accused his eurozone counterparts of being unwilling to even hear him out ‚Äì or discuss the proposals Greece had drawn up ‚Äì at a meeting many had hoped would end the crisis last week. ‚ÄúIs it more likely that the eurozone will become a better union to belong to if Greece is thrown to the wolves, despite the type of proposals tabled at Thursday‚Äôs eurogroup meeting?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúOr is a deal revolving around these proposals more likely to lead to greater openness, efficiency and democracy?‚Äù Tsipras, who was elected in January on a platform of ‚Äúwiping out‚Äù the foreign-mandated budget cuts that have impoverished Greeks, has been roundly criticised for his handling of the talks. During a visit to Russia last week, he intimated that Athens would be prepared to forge other alliances if its relations with Europe broke down. Last week, Juncker accused Tsipras of deliberately misinforming Greeks of the demands creditors had made. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand Tsipras,‚Äù Juncker told German news weekly Der Spiegel. ‚ÄúThe trust I placed in him has not always been reciprocated in kind.‚Äù Trust ‚Äì or the lack of it ‚Äì may well determine the outcome of Greece‚Äôs fate on Monday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-21T07:00:04Z,world,World news,"Three sisters, nine children, one dangerous journey to the heart of Isis. What is the lure of the caliphate?","A year after the establishment of the so-called caliphate by Islamic State, western governments are struggling for strategies to challenge sympathy among their citizens towards the militants. Foreigners continue to migrate to the territory in spite of substantial military, security and PR efforts and after Isis‚Äôs widely publicised military defeats in recent months. And last week the process took a sinister new turn: three British sisters from Bradford left their husbands and travelled to Syria, taking with them their nine children, to live under Isis. Seven hundred Britons are now estimated to have made the difficult, dangerous and, to many, incomprehensible journey. Such incidents are hard to anticipate and to deal with and they arguably help Isis to bolster its claims of legitimacy and relevance. A British official with a senior position in the effort to challenge the appeal of Isis to British Muslims told me that lessons were being drawn from the previous successes of al-Qaida. But this attitude, which is widespread, is one of the biggest mistakes officials and specialists make about the appeal of Isis. To apply knowledge about al-Qaida to understanding Isis is to build on previous failures ‚Äì not least because al-Qaida still exists, though it is overshadowed by a more successful organisation. But more significantly, Isis bears greater resemblance to populist Islamist movements than to al-Qaida, notwithstanding their ideological proximity. Whereas al-Qaida is elitist and detached from ordinary Muslims, Isis tends to be more vernacular in the way it addresses its audience and their grievances and aspirations. It also appeals to a far wider demographic than those willing to join or publicly support its cause. David Cameron said as much on Friday when he warned of the dangers posed by members of communities and families that ‚Äúquietly condone‚Äù the ideology of Isis. Since the group‚Äôs rise last year, I have talked to dozens of members in Syria and Iraq. What emerges strongly is the expressed belief of many that Isis can be persuasive, liberating and empowering. Some members I interviewed echoed recent statements by British Muslims who joined the group. One of those is Abdelaziz Kuwan, a Bahraini teenager who rose through the Isis ranks to become a security official in charge of three towns in eastern Syria. I spoke to him over many months before he was shot dead in October 2014. In one conversation, he said: ‚ÄúI walk in the streets [of Bahrain] and I feel imprisoned. I feel tied up ‚Ä¶ This world means nothing to me. I want to be free.‚Äù His statement is eerily reminiscent of what Mohammed Emwazi, the Kuwaiti-born British national better known as ‚ÄúJihadi John‚Äù, once wrote in an email: ‚ÄúI feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London.‚Äù The families of both Kuwan and Emwazi reported being made to feel strangers in their own countries. Kuwan‚Äôs family migrated from Syria to Bahrain in the 1980s and Emwazi‚Äôs family reportedly belonged to a category of stateless migrants in Kuwait known as bidoun (without). No family members of Isis militants said that a person‚Äôs decision to join the group was logical or consistent with how they had previously led their lives. Many had been quiet, insulated from a wider society towards which they bore resentment. At least three who had travelled to the territory mentioned the Arabic word haiba (charisma or prestige) to describe Isis as they described their motives for joining. But it was the overwhelming sense of ‚Äúimprisonment‚Äù that people said they experienced before joining Isis that recurred in my interviews. Even if potential recruits have only a vague notion of how Isis operates, the group still offers them a chance to join the armed struggle. In the process of recruitment, ideology becomes an instrumental supporting factor in drawing in and retaining recruits even if the reality in Syria and Iraq does not meet their expectations. Members feel empowered not only by the fighting capabilities of the group but by its ideology, which provides them with tools and zeal to argue back against even the most learned of Muslim clerics, whom Isis labels as distorters of Islam‚Äôs authentic message. ‚ÄúWhen you listen to the clerics of [Isis],‚Äù said Mothanna Abdulsattar, an Isis member who joined after he was captured by the group for working with the Free Syrian Army before Isis took over his area, ‚Äúyou are shocked that most of our Islamic societies have deviated from the true religion. They follow a religion that was invented two decades ago, or less.‚Äù This latter statement is particularly relevant in western societies. Extremist ideologues often argue that an Islam that preaches peace and harmony was invented and promoted by the state. They ridicule it as ‚ÄúBritish Islam‚Äù or ‚ÄúAmerican Islam‚Äù. Such arguments gain currency in communities that distrust their religious and political leaders, and make individuals living in such communities suspicious and less accepting of moderate views. In both the Middle East and the west, religious leaders have been reluctant to speak loudly and consistently against Isis, often for fear of being labelled as stooges to their governments.
Women who join Isis, such as the Bradford sisters, are driven by similar sentiments. Women feel empowered by Isis, including in relation to their family members. In Syria and Iraq, Isis controls conservative, tribal societies, which means most of its public rulings tend to affect men more than women. Men are banned from smoking cigarettes or shisha and playing cards. If a woman is found violating the Isis dress code, her husband or father would be punished, not her. In tribal societies, women are also traditionally not allowed to share inheritance, but Isis has reversed that if the case is reported. Women have used such practices and rulings to report their husbands to Isis members and even win a divorce. Although these practices are not widely reported by the media, it is likely that those who go to join Isis would have been briefed about them. In the same way that Isis offers a chance for teenagers and non-conformists to rebel against their communities and families, it also offers the same for women. Last week, a source living in a Gulf country said his sister, who lives in an Isis territory, said she threatened to leave everything behind, including her husband, and fight with Isis. ‚ÄúI told her that they would get her divorced from her husband and would marry her off to one of them,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShe laughed and said they would not do such a thing.‚Äù There are a myriad of factors that lead people to join or sympathise with Isis, both ideological and pragmatic. Some factors can weaken with time or if an alternative is provided to match the group‚Äôs appeal. However, factors that lead families to migrate to a conflict zone in groups must compel governments to look for deeper issues in their societies. These dynamics are more lasting and have little to do with whether the group endures, because the underlying issues remain. The group generally offers an alternative for the politically repressed and the socially estranged. Foreigners are generally driven by a need to belong, to be empowered and to seek retribution against something or someone, whether a system, a government or a family. Deep and abiding identity crises among Muslims are often exacerbated and shaped in isolated communities that governments, including in the UK, fail to address.

2015-06-20T23:05:01Z,world,World news,"‚ÄòEven if your home town is Dewsbury, you can be British and Muslim at the same time‚Äô","A devout Muslim, former social worker, proud Dewsbury resident and foster father to two white British brothers, Kauser Tai is a weary but patient defender of his home town against charges that it is a segregated hotbed of extremism. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt depress me, but it is sad,‚Äù said Tai, whose mother still lives in the terraced house where he grew up and whose work as a consultant includes courses explaining Islam to non-Muslims. ‚ÄúThere is no incompatibility between being British and being Muslim.‚Äù His home, a former mill town set among rolling hills some 10 miles south of Leeds, was thrown into the media spotlight a decade ago when police descended on the house of 7/7 suicide bomber and ring leader Mohammad Siddique Khan. This month, it was in the headlines again after Talha Asmal, a 17 year old from its Savile Town area, killed himself in an Isis suicide attack on a refinery in Iraq. The two deaths bookended a decade of unfortunate publicity for the town. In the wake of the latest one, David Cameron has called on Muslim communities to do more to stamp out radicalisation. In Deswbury, his speech was met with frustration and disappointment by the people who say they feel marginalised, starved of funds and abandoned by officials who are far quicker to condemn than to reach out to Muslims. They feel these same people are oblivious to the wider problems that fuel radicalisation. ‚ÄúWe are a community under siege,‚Äù said Fakhera Rehman, after breaking the Ramadan fast at a community centre and mosque that welcomes both men and women. ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt know who they can talk to, what they can say, how they can say it, how they can ask for help.‚Äù Rehman should be a natural leader in the fight against extremism. Devout, smart and articulate, she is manager of an interfaith forum and a concerned mother of a teenage boy, but in a few weeks funding cuts will close her group. ‚ÄúI totally agree with some parts of what David Cameron was saying, by saying we shouldn‚Äôt do finger-pointing. But that‚Äôs exactly what they are doing ‚Ä¶ putting the burden of responsibility on the Muslim community,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe are multiple communities: I have a school community, I have a work community, I have a neighbourhood community, and we need to all be working together. It needs to be different faiths, different backgrounds, male, female, young, old.‚Äù Tai says Dewsbury is being unfairly tarred by the coincidence that it was home to one man radicalised before he arrived in the town and the largely online grooming of a vulnerable teenager 10 years later. London bomber Khan only moved to the area a few months before his death, and is thought to have been radicalised mostly in a bookstore in his former home in the Beeston district of Leeds. Asmal‚Äôs family appear to have been oblivious to their son‚Äôs hardening views. ‚ÄúThere is no way [his father] would have let his son go. What parent would?‚Äù said Hanif Patel, a local businessman who knew the family. He was so shocked by Asmal‚Äôs radicalisation that he has not been able to face even paying a condolence visit. ‚ÄúTo be honest, I‚Äôve not been to see them, because I don‚Äôt know what to say.‚Äù It is a revulsion everyone in Dewsbury says they share. ‚ÄúI have never seen this ‚Äòsilent condoning‚Äô. We are all horrified,‚Äù said retired parole officer Mohammad Razaq. ‚ÄúWhich mosque is not condemning them?‚Äù Mixed in horror at the attack is sadness that a home they love is once more linked with death and destruction. More than once, people announced proudly they are Dewsbury ‚Äúborn and bred‚Äù or launch into a tribute to its quiet streets. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve travelled the world, I can tell you, and there‚Äôs no place like Dewsbury,‚Äù said Patel, with an enthusiasm undiminished by the gloomy chill of a late June evening. Still, they admit it is struggling with the problems that many of Britain‚Äôs non-Muslim towns share, from a weak economy to the blight of drug abuse. A reputation for extremism may only further isolate young people who might be vulnerable to radicalisation. ‚ÄúIf people feel no hope, they may be going,‚Äù said another Hanif who did not want to give his last name. An IT specialist who is also an enthusiastic guide to the attractions and history of Dewsbury, from a countryside ice-cream parlour to a seventh-century Christian saint. ‚ÄúParenting is much harder than it ever was before. I think people are losing their connection with their kids and it‚Äôs about reconnecting and having that love and time.‚Äù Isolation and a lack of opportunities are one of the biggest risk factors for radicalisation, according to Deeyah Khan, a film-maker who was herself a target of extremists. She recently explored what draws young British Muslims to radical groups, in the documentary Jihad ‚Äì A British Story. ‚ÄúAttacking racism and discrimination is a very important way to work against radicalisation,‚Äù she said in an interview. ‚ÄúWe need a broader perspective on what counter-radicalisation means. ‚ÄúSurveillance is an attempt to locate people once they have already become radicalised. We need to enable a societal change that means people don‚Äôt feel this sense of emptiness, this lack of hope and dreams. ‚ÄúWe need people to feel at home, to be included, that they are being heard and understood, and that they are part of this society.‚Äù Mehrun Mohamed is another Dewsbury mother worried for her children and frustrated by a society apparently unable to see the woman below the headscarf or the men behind the beard. She is part of an inter-faith book club, learned to cycle in Savile Town with no more opposition than an occasional raised eyebrow from more conservative neighbours, and is a valued teacher at a primary school in a mostly white area. She and her husband moved to the United Kingdom from South Africa more than a decade ago, because they were worried about the poisonous legacy of apartheid and wanted to bring their children up in a multicultural, multiracial environment. They chose the UK over the US, where they also had job offers, because they thought it was a more tolerant country, but for the first time are wondering if they have made the right choice. Today they have to contend with a cocktail of fears for their sons about physical attacks in Dewsbury, grooming online and more nebulous but very real concerns that they are internalising the relentless drumbeat of negative reporting about Islam. ‚ÄúMy boys now, if there is an incident anywhere and we don‚Äôt know the identity of the perpetrators, the first thing they will say is ‚Äòjust wait a couple of hours and it‚Äôs going to turn out that the person is a Muslim‚Äô,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey say we know Muslims are not supposed to do all these things, Islam does not condone these actions, but still they say, wait and see.‚Äù For all the fears that Dewsbury has become self-segregated, the senior positions in the local Kirklees council are all still held by non-Muslims, and there are not many senior Muslims in other important local organisations, like the police and National Health Service. ‚ÄúFor the past six years I‚Äôve been working here, I‚Äôve been trying to say ‚Äòwe need role models, they need people in there who look like them, so they can say ‚Äì this is where I can be,‚Äù said Rehman. ‚ÄúYou have to raise the aspiration of kids. If they believe they are different, that they [as Muslims] are responsible for anything bad that happens, how are we ever going to get them out of this?‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-20T23:05:00Z,world,World news,"Goodbye, Lenin: how a weighty symbol of the Soviet past divided a Ukrainian city","In Sloviansk, a city in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, council meetings have rarely been as turbulent as they were towards the end of last month. The reason was the decision by the mayor, Oleg Zontov, to move for a vote over the application of a law that had only just been passed by the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko. This ‚Äúlaw on the condemnation of communist and Nazi totalitarian regimes‚Äù, voted through by parliament on 9 April, prohibits all defence of Nazism and communism. The sale of communist souvenirs, and even the singing of the Internationale, is now banned in Ukraine. Individual offenders risk up to five years in prison. Members of organisations risk up to 10. The legislators were seemingly not worried about the risk of deepening the cultural abyss between western Ukraine and the Russophone east of the country, a centre of Soviet industrialisation between 1930 and 1950, and a place where nostalgia is ever present. In Sloviansk, the mayor belongs to the Poroshenko bloc and he decided to apply the new law in his own way, targeting the statue of Lenin that enjoys pride of place opposite city hall. The national law has not yet taken effect, but debates are already under way over changing communist-era names of Ukrainian cities. Dnipropetrovsk, for instance, (named after the celebrated revolutionary Grigory Petrovsky) could be quickly retitled. At the Sloviansk council meeting of 29 April, a vote on the ‚Äúdismantling of the monument to Lenin, situated in October Revolution Square‚Äù was added to the order of business. But ‚Äúthe meeting was suspended and the vote postponed,‚Äù explained Edouard Torskiy, a journalist with Delovoy Slavyansk, when ‚Äúmilitant communists barged in on the meeting, threatening a return of separatist forces if the councillors targeted Soviet symbols‚Äù. Last year this city was seized by pro-Russian separatists led by Igor Girkin, a former Russian army officer who also goes by the name of Strelkov (Shooter). For a time it became the epicentre of the fighting between pro-Russia rebels and pro-Kiev forces. Strelkov briefly became minister of defence for the self-proclaimed Republic of Donetsk, taking numerous hostages, including journalists and observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The city changed hands again in June 2014 after fierce bombardment. But tensions are still high, in both the city and among its politicians, because the pro-Kiev mayor is in a minority on the council. The elected officials are more or less the same as before. The majority belong to the Party of the Regions, the organisation headed by former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, who fled the country after the Maidan revolution, and the Communist party. The next local elections will take place in October. Towards the end of last April, the giant Lenin statue had already been vandalised, covered in pink paint and adorned with a Ukrainian flag as a scarf. Around its base, placards explained ‚Äúhow to spot a separatist‚Äù, offering tips on recognising signs of separatism in one‚Äôs neighbours. To begin with, local nationalists appeared to leave it to the councillors to decide the fate of the statue ‚Äì though since the beginning of the war, and well before the ‚Äúde-communisation‚Äù law was passed, more than 100 statues of Lenin have been demolished, many in the middle of the night. On 27 May a new council meeting was scheduled and Zontov placed the statue on the order of business again. All of Sloviansk‚Äôs nationalist groups attended to express support for its removal, with nationalist parties Svoboda and Right Sector turning out en masse. The number of nationalist militants has boomed since the war began, even though the number of MPs from these two groups only went up to seven out of 450 at the general election last October. In Sloviansk the nationalists have long been frustrated at their lack of representation on the council. At the meeting the nationalists‚Äô constant interruptions led to a scuffle before the issue of the statue had even been broached. However, after temporarily halting proceedings, the mayor was able to start the debate. ‚ÄúI am responsible for the political life of our city,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere are many different points of view in our council. To find compromises, we have to talk with each other and take a decision today.‚Äù Zontov proposed that, rather than being destroyed, the statue should be sold at auction or placed in a museum. As he spoke, nationalists in combat dress took position close to the council members. Then a man shouted from the public area: ‚ÄúI have in my hand a letter signed by 4,000 residents. People are against the destruction of the statue because it‚Äôs part of their history, part of their youth. You should listen to the opinions of your fellow citizens.‚Äù The ensuing row deepened the divide between the younger generation, which looks towards Europe, and their often nostalgic elders, who lived under the USSR. The self-declared ‚Äúpatriots‚Äù shouted: ‚ÄúShame on you! Glory to Ukraine. Glory to our heroes!‚Äù Then a young nationalist militant told the assembly: ‚ÄúIt was Lenin who began the process of destruction of Ukraine. He brought the famine to Ukraine from 1922, then he launched a violent collectivisation. He created an ideology that killed millions of people.‚Äù Another young man berated the councillors: ‚ÄúYou are ‚Äòprovocateurs‚Äô. We are the descendants of people assassinated by that man. We are going to make that statue disappear. Now you are going to decide whether it‚Äôs destroyed or whether it‚Äôs removed. That is the choice we give you.‚Äù The uproar resumed with loud shouts of ‚Äúseparatists‚Äù filling the hall, followed by cries of ‚ÄúShame on you‚Äù. Zontov brought the meeting to an early close, but shouted above the clamour: ‚ÄúWe have six months to resolve this question. Come to the next meeting.‚Äù In the hall afterwards, militants flourished a placard calling for ‚ÄúSloviansk without Lenin.‚Äù Tamara, an opposition member, left the assembly assailed by insults from the young nationalist militants, but didn‚Äôt seem too bothered. ‚ÄúOur mayor doesn‚Äôt do anything for this city. He only offers suggestions for destruction,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe has found 50 people to support his plan. We have collected 4,500 signatures against the destruction of the statue. Even if Lenin wasn‚Äôt a good human being, he was part of our history and you don‚Äôt wipe out history like that.‚Äù But in the end the debate was settled by the minority. In the early hours of 3 June, militants from Right Sector tore the statue down.

2015-06-20T23:05:00Z,world,World news,Britain signs convention on protecting treasures in war zones,"Britain is to end years of indecision by ratifying an international agreement aimed at preventing the loss of cultural and historic artefacts in conflict zones, amid growing outrage at the destruction by Isis militants of ancient sites in Iraq and Syria. The culture secretary, John Whittingdale, is to introduce legislation that will finally sign the UK up to the 1954 Hague Convention, set up after the second world war to protect archaeological and historical sites, works of art, manuscripts, books and other objects. About 115 countries have ratified the convention but over the years the UK government has cited a range of reasons for not following suit, including lack of parliamentary time and a belief that this is not an effective way to protect such treasures. One concern is believed to have been that ratification might leave the country open to renewed pressure to return the Elgin marbles to Greece, although there is nothing in the convention that would bind the UK to do so. Whittingdale also announced that ministers would set up a ‚Äúcultural protection fund‚Äù to help preserve cultural heritage in potential or existing conflict zones, and help with the recovery of artefacts. He is to convene a summit of senior government figures and cultural leaders from the British Museum, the V&A, the British Council and other key organisations ‚Äì such as Unesco and the Red Cross ‚Äì to advise on how to proceed. In April one of the country‚Äôs foremost archaeologists, Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn, a Cambridge academic, said it was outrageous that the government was ‚Äúdithering‚Äù over ratification at a time when Isis was threatening some of the world‚Äôs top cultural treasures. The moves were welcomed by the director of the British Museum, Neil MacGregor, as ‚Äúan important step towards safeguarding the world‚Äôs cultural property at risk in conflict zones‚Äù. He added that the museum was developing, with colleagues in Iraq, a programme to establish a specialist corps of rescue archaeologists in the country. ‚ÄúIt is important to start this training now, as rescue archaeology will be essential as soon as it is once again possible to visit the key sites we believe have been damaged and to plan their recovery.‚Äù While Isis has claimed responsibility for the destruction of artefacts in Mosul museum, and reports indicate that they were responsible for the bulldozing and looting of the historic sites of Nimrud and Hatra, the full extent of the destruction is not yet known, as archaeologists have not been granted access to the sites. Last month, Islamic State group fighters advanced on the ancient ruins at Palmyra, raising fears that the Syrian world heritage site could face destruction of the kind already wreaked in Iraq. Whittingdale said last night: ‚ÄúWhile the UK‚Äôs priority will continue to be the human cost of these horrific conflicts, the UK must also do what we can to prevent any further cultural destruction.The loss of a country‚Äôs heritage threatens its very identity. The knowledge and expertise of the experts in our cultural institutions makes us uniquely qualified to help. I believe that the UK therefore has a vital responsibility to support cultural protection overseas.‚ÄùThe Department for Culture Media and Sport said countries that were party to the convention were ‚Äúrequired to respect cultural property situated within the territory of other parties by not attacking it, and to respect cultural property within their own territory by not using it for purposes which are likely to expose it to destruction or damage during armed conflict.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-20T23:04:00Z,world,World news,"For Isis women, it‚Äôs not about ‚Äòjihadi brides‚Äô: it‚Äôs about escape","At the beginning of this year, al-Khansa brigade uploaded its Arabic manual for women in Islamic State. The 10,000-word document advises that Muslim girls are married between the ages of nine and 17, cover their bodies and faces and live in seclusion. Meanwhile, women and girls as young as 10 from Iraq‚Äôs minority sects have been enslaved and raped. Yet Islamic State‚Äôs ability to attract women is unprecedented. By May, 60 women had left the UK to join. Over the past few days, three sisters left Bradford to join their brother, taking with them nine children. Why would any woman submit herself and her children to the hazards of a war zone for the opportunity to live in a state of near chatteldom? Attempts to explain this often jump to the concept of the jihadi bride. Since most of the women are adolescents, it is assumed the ‚Äúholy warriors‚Äù of the Islamic state have a dangerous sexual allure, like a boy band accessorised with beards and semi-automatic weapons. However, most of the recruitment of women is carried out by women themselves, so assuming the only factor is a teenage crush trivialises their decision-making. Often, women‚Äôs participation in Islamic State does not require a gendered explanation. They can be just as bloodthirsty, disaffected and politically engaged as men. As for the constricted lives they will encounter, some can be attracted to the security of traditional family roles. Although Hitler‚Äôs roles for women were limited to Kinder, K√ºche, Kirche (children, kitchen, church), almost half of the votes he gained were from women. They preferred a model of gender relations that allowed them a degree of domestic autonomy and status as wives and mothers ‚Äì if nothing else. Indeed, some Muslim women in the UK already live under circumstances almost as constrained as in Islamic State due to the restrictions of family ‚Äúhonour‚Äù. For these women, Islamic State presents a route of escape. Some who seek to counter parental controls may turn to scripture, to use a language that carries weight within their households. A great deal of racist violence is also directed at Muslim women, who are more visible than men. This can leave women isolated and fearful; hyper-aware of their identity, which marks them out for hostility. There are many reasons why a person might become interested in more radical interpretations, from spiritual curiosity, an awakened political awareness or a wish for a more ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù identity. Each journey has its own beginning, but each is a quest ‚Äì for meaning, identity, community; for answers. Few of these quests dispatch women and girls to the Turkish border, but for some, particularly those who are naive, isolated and lacking social and emotional support, these are the first steps towards adopting extremism. While making my documentary Jihad, I interviewed several women involved in radical movements. One told me that because of sexual abuse she felt a desire for justice and had no faith in the British system that had failed her. The stonings and beheadings carried out under the name of justice in Raqqa‚Äôs ‚Äúheaven square‚Äù (nicknamed ‚Äúhell square‚Äù by those living under Islamic State‚Äôs occupation) may well have suited her thirst for retribution. She told me that a sense of comradeship with pious young women helped her feel safe and protected; that her status as a mother was honoured: that it gave her life a sense of purpose. Eventually, she left, saying the experience left her feeling spiritually hollow. But for women like her, dealing with exclusion, pain and disaffection, Islamic State is only a click away. Exposure to traumatising online propaganda materials, such as scenes of the murder and massacre of Muslims, induces anxiety and arousal, burning these perceptions deep into the psyche. Very real injustices and outrages against Muslims become amplified; a complex reality can become distorted into a simplified worldview, where sinister forces pose a deliberate, existential threat to Islam. This belief becomes nourished and echoed across a network of like-minded individuals, until it drowns out more nuanced understandings. Young people are particularly vulnerable to this black-and-white worldview, in which the in-group becomes understood as wholly noble, righteous and oppressed, and the enemy as devious, cruel and domineering. Within this schema, terrorism presents itself as heroism, a defence of home and community and values held sacred, from white supremacists such as Anders Breivik to the nationalism of the IRA. Islamic State positions itself as a place of refuge, a shining mirage in which Muslim fantasies can come to a glorious fruition, where domination and power can be reclaimed. This functions through one of the most powerful and most dangerous resources in history: youthful idealism, through directing it towards the exhilarating prospect of building a new and ‚Äúperfect‚Äù society. To discourage women and men from joining this brutal movement, we need to heal the vicious cycle of violence, fear and hatred which is growing between communities, and to move towards a future that includes us all. We need to move away from the divisions of us and them and build on our shared humanity. We need to be open and honest about the driving factors of radicalisation from the violent foreign policies, the impact of the war on terror, family and psychological problems, discrimination and ideologies of hatred. This way we can try to avoid the tragic loss of more of our children; who believe themselves to be opening a new morning for humanity while stumbling in the night, over the bones of the dead.

2015-06-20T23:01:00Z,world,World news,Britain replaces migrant search and rescue ship with smaller naval vessel,"Britain is replacing the Royal Navy flagship that has saved the lives of more than 2,900 Mediterranean migrants with a survey vessel just half the size. The HMS Enterprise, which is 3,700 tonnes and 90 metres long, will take over from HMS Bulwark ‚Äì 19,000 tonnes and 176m ‚Äì as part of what the government has called its ‚Äúintelligence-led effort‚Äù in an attempt to tackle the migration crisis. A team from GCHQ will also work on identifying the smugglers helping migrants enter Europe from Africa and the Middle East. Downing Street said HMS Enterprise would help by gathering intelligence ‚Äúwhile continuing to rescue people as necessary‚Äù but it would appear to be a deliberate scaling down of capability. The announcement of the replacement is likely to disappoint campaigners who want the government to play a meaningful role European Union‚Äôs search and rescue operation in the Mediterranean. Italian coastguard officials said in May that the EU needed to make saving lives a priority, after the Mare Nostrum search and rescue programme ended in November 2014.
David Cameron sent HMS Bulwark to the Mediterranean on 23 April, after widespread concern about the rising death toll among migrants making the perilous sea crossing to southern Europe, and it has been used in dozens of rescues since. But the Ministry of Defence said the flagship‚Äôs involvement was only planned to last for 60 days. HMS Bulwark is an assault ship with 325 crew and has flight deck space for two large helicopters, as well as a landing dock for Royal Marines to launch operations in small boats. Enterprise is a survey vessel with 48 crew and has space for a single motor boat and helicopter landing pad. The survey ship has been used in the Gulf of Aden monitoring the Somali coastline, as well as scientific missions such as mapping the seabed of the Persian Gulf. A Downing Street spokeswoman said the government was determined to ‚Äúdo more to better understand the smuggling network and business model‚Äù. She said the involvement of GCHQ will help identify organised crime groups, as well as their routes and methods. ‚ÄúThe information uncovered by analysts will be used to help disrupt those orchestrating the smuggling, and could pave the way for the second phase of the operation which would involve intercepting smugglers‚Äô vessels on the high seas and ‚Äì subject to agreement from others ‚Äì in territorial waters, and impounding their vessels.‚Äù Italian police have already amassed a large amount of intelligence about people smuggling operations. The British government has been under pressure from other European countries to help in the relocation of some of the 54,000 migrants who have landed in Italy so far this year. Both David Cameron and Theresa May, the home secretary, have refused to have any involvement. EU foreign ministers are due to meet on Monday to sign off on a new joint naval operation in the Mediterranean.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-20T23:00:41Z,world,World news,"Greek eurozone crisis: In or out, financial future is far from rosy","Why are eurozone leaders holding yet another make-or-break Greek summit? Despite a series of fraught meetings, Greece is still on the brink of default, and eurozone leaders, preceded by their finance ministers, are due to meet tomorrow in another attempt to strike a deal. Time is running out: the country‚Äôs banks are facing a debilitating run on their deposits as nervous savers take out their cash. Greece‚Äôs chief negotiator, Euclid Tsakalotos, has said Athens can‚Äôt pay ‚Ç¨1.6bn (¬£1.1bn) due to the IMF on 30 June unless its creditors release ‚Ç¨7.2bn in bailout funds that have been held up pending an agreement on fresh economic reforms. How far apart are the two sides? On paper, the gap looks relatively narrow ‚Äì ‚Ç¨2bn or so ‚Äì but there are issues of principle at stake. In particular, Greece is refusing to agree to pension reforms that creditors say are essential; and Athens wants talks on debt relief, which lenders are refusing to agree. The mood music is also grim. When Thursday‚Äôs gathering of finance ministers broke up with no agreement inside little more than an hour, the IMF‚Äôs managing director, Christine Lagarde, pictured, said there would only be progress ‚Äúwith adults in the room‚Äù. A defiant Alexis Tsipras responded by flying to St Petersburg to stress his solidarity with Russia and insist that, while Greece is in a ‚Äúwhirlpool‚Äù, he is ‚Äúnot scared of the sea‚Äù. Could they still do a deal? Yes. Either side might blink at the last minute ‚Äì Angela Merkel is unlikely to want to be the German leader who allowed the unravelling of the eurozone, and even the radical Syriza government may fear the consequences of plunging out of the single currency. But if Syriza makes large concessions, it would have to tackle a domestic political rebellion. What if no deal emerges? Without an agreement, Greece will be forced to miss its payment to the IMF, which Lagarde has suggested would immediately be treated as a default. Grexit would not necessarily follow, but if Greece has lost the financial backing of its creditors it may decide that the best hope of economic recovery lies outside the single currency. Its fellow euro-members may even hold open the exit door if they judge that a managed departure would have the least damaging consequences for the rest of the eurozone. There would also have to be capital controls to shore up the fragile Greek financial system. Some analysts believe the state of the banks may make capital controls necessary even before the end of the month. One said: ‚ÄúThe ‚Äòperfect storm‚Äô hitting the Greek banking sector, which includes a deteriorating economy, increasing non-performing loans and large deposit outflows, may oblige the government to implement capital controls even before the default materialises.‚Äù How would financial markets react? Probably with horror. While it has been a real possibility for some time, the fact that the single currency is not irrevocable would still be likely to send tremors through eurozone equity and bond markets. What about the long-term future for Greece outside the eurozone? Nobody knows. It‚Äôs just possible that ‚Äúre-drachmatisation‚Äù could help to kickstart growth, but Greece still has deep economic problems and, as the long-running saga of Argentina‚Äôs default shows, there are no set rules that allow a country to walk away from its debts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-20T19:14:10Z,world,World news,Sir Tim Hunt: my gratitude to female scientists for their support,"The beleaguered UK scientist Sir Tim Hunt on Saturday thanked the hundreds of female scientists who have written to support him in the wake of the furore triggered by his controversial remarks about women in science. Hunt, who won the Nobel prize in 2001 for his work on cell biology, became the focus of furious online attacks earlier this month over comments about women in science being disruptive. He had to resign from several academic posts, including an honorary position at University College London (UCL). However, support for Hunt has since mushroomed, with fellow Nobel prize winners, senior academics and leading scientists and politicians ‚Äì including Brian Cox, Richard Dawkins and Boris Johnson ‚Äì lining up to denounce the treatment of the 72-year-old biologist. ‚ÄúMy inbox is now bulging with touching emails from young women scientists who have been kind enough to write and thank me for inspiring them and helping them on their way,‚Äù Hunt told the Observer yesterday. ‚ÄúIt has also been of great comfort to me to see many women at the top of science testifying for my record in supporting women scientists.‚Äù Top female scientists who have expressed support include physicist Dame Athene Donald, biologist Professor Ottoline Leyser and physiologist Dame Nancy Rothwell. All decried his jocular remarks, but described in warm terms his past support for young scientists of both sexes.
Hunt added that he had held senior posts in universities and research centres around the world and had always sought to help female scientists in their work. ‚ÄúFor example, I fought for seven years to have creche facilities at the Okinawa Institute of Science of Technology ‚Äì and was ultimately successful. Less successful have been efforts to get a creche at the new Crick Institute in London, but this is something I will continue to push for. ‚ÄúI certainly don‚Äôt recognise myself as the horrible sexist portrayed in media reports, and I don‚Äôt think the women who have worked with me throughout my career do either,‚Äù said Hunt, who added that he was particularly upset by the journal Nature which accused him of ‚Äúbelittling women‚Äù, an accusation he flatly rejected. Hunt also pointed out that, initially, his remarks about women in science and their alleged tendency to weep had not been fully reported. ‚ÄúLet me tell you about my trouble with girls,‚Äù he told delegates at the World Conference of Science Journalists in Seoul. ‚ÄúThree things happen when they are in the lab. You fall in love with them, they fall in love with you, and when you criticise them, they cry.‚Äù Crucially, Hunt said, he then added the words, ‚Äúnow seriously‚Äù before going on to praise the role of women in science and in Korean society. ‚ÄúThe words ‚Äònow seriously‚Äô make it very clear that I was making a joke, albeit a very bad one, but they were not mentioned in the first reports and I was deluged with hate mail,‚Äù Hunt said. However, he did acknowledge that his ‚Äúidiotic joke‚Äù had touched a nerve. ‚ÄúMy comments have brought to the surface the anger and frustration of a great many women in science whose careers have been blighted by chauvinism and discrimination,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf any good is to come from this miserable affair, it should be that the scientific community starts to acknowledge this anger, recognise the problem and move a lot faster to remove the remaining barriers.‚Äù Many leading scientists urged University College London to apologise to Hunt for forcing him to resign and reinstate him. ‚ÄúIf UCL did offer to reinstate me, it would be churlish of me to refuse, but really my work there was over,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI am not in a rush to do anything, quite frankly. It is coming up to Wimbledon, which I love. In the past I have always been too busy to watch much of it. Now I can relax for the first time and enjoy the tennis when it starts in a few days. So, yes, I suppose there have been some benefits to this business.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-20T17:57:37Z,world,World news,'People have finally had enough': middle England marches against austerity,"A single fiddle vied with the rumble of drums as a chorus of whistles filled the air. Two police helicopters loomed above the river of placard-carrying protesters that stretched from the Bank of England towards St Pauls.
Marijuana smoke drifted in the early afternoon drizzle as the chants began. Cheers went up when the poster girl of the anti-cuts movement snuck through the crowd to join the front of the march. Clutching an ‚ÄúEnd Austerity Now‚Äù placard, Charlotte Church stood smiling as the good-natured crowd counted down to the start of the largest protest against the cuts since the Tories won the election. The singer was joined celebrities including Russell Brand and Julie Hesmondhalgh, the actor who played Hayley Cropper in Coronation Street. Politicians Martin McGuinness and Diane Abbott ‚Äì one of Labour‚Äôs London mayoral hopefuls ‚Äì also lent their support, along with Unite leader Len McCluskey.
Despite the sprinkling of showbiz and political glitter, it was a day when middle England came out to make its voices heard. The march was no urban-led, youthful demonstration. The placards told of long journeys made from the far corners of the country. They came from Shropshire, Suffolk, Chesterfield and Wiltshire. And while many carried banners urged ‚ÄúDefy Tory Rule‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo Cuts‚Äù, there was a wide spectrum of agendas being pursued. ‚ÄúNHS Not Trident‚Äù was a popular placard. So too was a call for an end to war. Some signs were heavy on humour. ‚ÄúHeaven knows we‚Äôre miserable now‚Äù read one placard. ‚ÄúFuck the fucking fuckers‚Äù, in fluorescent pink and yellow, was one that caught the eye.
There were groups opposing fracking and others attacking funding cuts faced by mental health services. Some sought to promote veganism or the rights of migrants. Some wanted a greater say for Cornwall, while others demanded respect for the transgender community. Finance was a major preoccupation. Many demanded an end to tax havens. ‚ÄúWe are all Greeks‚Äù read one banner. ‚ÄúBanker Wanker‚Äù read another. Bottles of wine and cans of lager were passed around. People took selfies as they marched passed some of London‚Äôs most famous landmarks pushing buggies and wheelchairs. Lending her support was Katie, 40, a teacher from Walthamstow, and her three young children, no strangers to anti-austerity protests. ‚ÄúI hope it will make a difference,‚Äù she said as thousands of people chanting ‚Äúno ifs, no buts, no public sector cuts,‚Äù streamed past. ‚ÄúPeople have finally had enough. I‚Äôm hopeful that this is the start of something. This is definitely the biggest march I‚Äôve been on.‚Äù
Her children looked a little tired. She had promised to take them for lunch somewhere as a treat. So had she any experience of the austerity the crowd was protesting against? ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got less money now than I used to have,‚Äù she said. But the real impact, she said, was felt not in her home but at her work. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sending kids home with leftover school dinners because they‚Äôre not getting fed at home. If I‚Äôve got some spare kid‚Äôs clothes, I‚Äôll bring them in for them. Lots of our teachers bring in breakfast for their pupils.‚Äù Had it always been like this? She shook her head. ‚ÄúOnly in the last four years have I noticed it. There‚Äôs just less and less support for low income families. Once they would have intervened to help them but not now.‚Äù On the crowd ploughed. Up it went to the Royal Courts of Justice where those carrying banners defending the Human Rights Act gave their loudest cheer. As it passed a particular well-known bank on the Strand a chant went up: ‚ÄúPay your taxes.‚Äù Diners in the restaurants near to Trafalgar Square waved, and Japanese tourists filmed the spectacle on their smart phones. Outside Downing Street the crowd halted to boo. Someone let off a few smoke cannisters. ‚ÄúDavid Cameron get out, we know what you‚Äôre about,‚Äù they sang, before marching on to Parliament Square. Along the Embankment fleets of coaches waited to take them back to the shires and market towns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-20T16:52:43Z,world,World news,Levy on frequent leisure flyers proposed to make airport expansion unnecessary,"Plans for a ‚Äúfrequent flyer‚Äù tax to curb demand for leisure flights and make a new runway in south-east England unnecessary have been unveiled by an influential group of transport campaigners, environmentalists and tax experts. Ministers, and candidates seeking to be the next mayor of London, including Tory hopeful and green campaigner Zac Goldsmith, are being urged to back the proposals, which supporters argue in a letter to the Observer would relieve ministers at a stroke from having to make the invidious choice between expanding Heathrow or Gatwick airports. Sir Howard Davies, former leader of the CBI and head of the Airports Commission, will report within a fortnight on how he thinks capacity can best be expanded in the south-east. He is expected to make a recommendation to develop either Heathrow or Gatwick, but may insist on tough environmental conditions being met by the ‚Äúwinner‚Äù. These could allow ministers room to judge which option they believe would achieve the best balance between the economic benefits and environmental impact. The decision is one of the most controversial and politically difficult facing the new Tory government. Expansion of Heathrow is being resisted by several Tory cabinet ministers ‚Äì including international development secretary Justine Greening and foreign secretary Philip Hammond ‚Äìwhose constituencies would be affected, as well as by London mayor Boris Johnson. A group of Tory MPs is also campaigning against an expansion of Gatwick. With debate intensifying, green campaigners, transport groups, economists and tax experts have joined to propose the radical plan, which they say would reduce costs for once-a-year holiday travellers, while hitting those who choose to fly regularly. They say it would also ensure the UK could comply with its obligations under the Climate Change Act. Under the plan, backed by the Campaign for Better Transport, the New Economics Foundation, the Tax Justice Network, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth among others, air passenger duty would be scrapped and replaced by a new frequent flyers levy. Everyone would be able to take one flight a year without paying any levy, but for subsequent journeys the levy would rise each time. Using accepted methods to calculate the effect of price on demand, experts say the number of flights taken by the better-off for leisure purposes ‚Äì which account for much of recent growth ‚Äì would be cut to a level that would make extra airport capacity unnecessary. In their letter they say: ‚ÄúBritain‚Äôs skies are already some of the busiest in the world, and Howard Davies knows that these expansion plans cannot be made to fit with the UK‚Äôs long-term commitments under the Climate Change Act. Contrary to aviation lobby rhetoric, a new runway is not needed to allow more international business flights, which have been declining steadily since the turn of the century. ‚ÄúThe hub airport argument is a smokescreen. In reality, growing demand for air travel is concentrated in the short-haul leisure sector and among a small, wealthy minority of the population. It is more of these flights that a new runway will in practice service. ‚ÄúThis growth in flights is driven by air fares that are kept artificially low through generous tax subsidies; aviation is exempt from fuel duty by international treaty and zero rated for VAT, alongside wheelchairs and baby clothes. Yet these tax breaks almost exclusively benefit the richest section of British society. Our analysis of passenger survey data shows that 15% of the UK population are taking 70% of all our flights, while half of us don‚Äôt fly at all in any given year.‚Äù They argue the new levy would shift the burden ‚Äúaway from families flying to their annual holiday and on to the frequent fliers who are driving expansion. Our research shows that this would let the UK meet our climate targets without making flying the preserve of the rich ‚Äì and without needing to build any new runways.‚Äù Stephen Joseph, director of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: ‚ÄúReplacing air passenger duty with a frequent flyers levy could, on the evidence so far, make it unnecessary to build any new runways. As the politics of airport expansion get more difficult, we think the government should look seriously at the levy proposal, to ensure that the richest who take the most flights pay the most tax.‚Äù John Stewart, chair of Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise, which campaigns against expansion of Heathrow, added: ‚ÄúThe beauty of this proposal is that it ticks both the equity and green boxes. It is a way of controlling the growth of aviation but still allowing ordinary families a holiday in the sun.‚Äù With business leaders impatient for a decision, the government has said it will not comment on airport expansion until Davies has reported. Sources have indicated that a decision on which option to back is unlikely until the end of the year. Some government insiders believe it will then be difficult to back expansion of Heathrow in the runup to the mayoral elections next May.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-20T16:40:56Z,world,World news,Anti-austerity protests: tens of thousands rally across UK,"Forty-four days after David Cameron won an unexpected majority in the general election, the opposition parties are still picking themselves up off the floor. On Britain‚Äôs streets, however, tens of thousands of people took up their placards and marched in London, Glasgow and elsewhere in the first major protest against the government‚Äôs plans for five more years of austerity. Estimates of the size of the rally in central London on Saturday varied between 70,000 and more than 150,000. Several thousand more gathered in Glasgow‚Äôs George Square and smaller demonstrations were reported in other cities, including Liverpool and Bristol. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here to say austerity isn‚Äôt working,‚Äù said Caroline Lucas, the Green Party MP, to great applause from the crowd in Parliament Square at the end of the London march. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here to say that it wasn‚Äôt people on jobseekers‚Äô allowance that brought down the banks. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt nurses and teachers and firefighters who were recklessly gambling on international markets. And so we should stop the policies that are making them pay for a crisis that wasn‚Äôt of their making.‚Äù
Marching under the banner End Austerity Now, protesters denounced public sector cuts, the treatment of the disabled and the vulnerable through welfare cuts, and the privatisation of the NHS. Teachers, nurses, lawyers and union groups marched under their own banners. Chants and songs demanded equality, more help for the poor and an end to Tory government. There was a sprinkling of celebrity faces, with Russell Brand, Charlotte Church and the actor Richard Coyle among the crowd. Northern Ireland‚Äôs deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, told the rally: ‚ÄúIt is David Cameron‚Äôs cabinet of millionaires, they are the people who are the real spongers. They are the people who are given free rein to live out their Thatcherite fantasies at the expense of ordinary, decent communities throughout these islands.‚Äù Protesters set off from outside the Bank of England, and by the time the march reached Westminster, its final destination, a sea of banners, placards and flags stretched for more than a mile down Whitehall and past Trafalgar Square. The Savoy Hotel, fearing trouble, closed their front entrance on Saturday afternoon. ‚ÄúThis is a magnificent demonstration,‚Äù said John Rees of the People‚Äôs Assembly Against Austerity, which organised the protest. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs only a beginning. We can‚Äôt win with only one demonstration.‚Äù
Len McCluskey, Unite‚Äôs general secretary, addressed the marchers from a stage overlooking Parliament. ‚ÄúLet me warn this government, once again, push us outside of the law and you will be responsible for the consequences, not us,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe desire for a better world, a peaceful world, a world where human endeavour is used to enhance all people, where solidarity and community spirit reign supreme, that has always been part of the Labour movement‚Äôs DNA and we won‚Äôt let them steal it from us.‚Äù In Glasgow, some of the biggest cheers were for Jeane Freeman, of Women for Independence, who gave a passionate speech at the rally. She argued that austerity was a Westminster choice rather than a necessity: ‚ÄúAusterity is a comprehensive attack on the rights of men, women, children,‚Äù she said. Labour‚Äôs London mayoral candidate Diane Abbott said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sad that there are not more Labour MPs here. Tory austerity is not necessary and the Labour party should be making the case for an alternative.‚Äù
Jeremy Corbyn, the only one of the four Labour leadership candidates spotted at the rally, received a rapturous reception in Parliament Square, where he spoke passionately about his vision of society. ‚ÄúI want us to stand up as brave people did in the 1920s and 1930s, and said we want a state that takes responsibility for everybody to ensure nobody is destitute ‚Ä¶ We each care for all. Everyone caring for everybody else. I think it‚Äôs called socialism,‚Äù he said. Tackling criticism that demonstrations do nothing to change government policy, Corbyn said mass movements had been at the root of the Labour movement, leading to the institution of the welfare state and national health service. ‚ÄúThe people that marched in this square in the 1850s with the people‚Äôs charter didn‚Äôt achieve very much that day. They were dismissed as out of date, out of time and irrelevant. ‚ÄúWithin 50 years, we had a national insurance system. Within 20 years we had a universal education system. Within 70 years we had council housing. Within 100 years we had a universal health service.‚Äù He slammed those who tried to blame migrants and the jobless for the crisis. ‚ÄúI stand with those people that came to this country, worked, contributed and are part of our society,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI want a humanitarian and decent response to those people who are victims of war, that are dying in the Mediterranean trying to reach a place of safety. I am not prepared to join a campaign of Benefits Street and attacking so-called benefits scroungers.‚Äù Russell Brand, the last speaker in Parliament Square, said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm inspired to see such incredible numbers in this square after the results of the election. ‚ÄúMy personal feelings about this movement are very, very deep. Without a welfare state my mum would have died of cancer several times. I am personally a product of the welfare state because I signed on for eight years while I learned to be a comedian. ‚ÄúWe need to learn to talk to one another and recognise that our time on this Earth is fragile and temporary. If we don‚Äôt build systems on the idea of love and togetherness the alternative is unconscionable.‚Äù
Pascale Mitchell, a school librarian and carer from Bermondsey, south London, was there with her 15-year-old daughter. She said: ‚ÄúI had had to donate to a friend because her benefits were sanctioned and she had to go to a food bank. I‚Äôm seeing the impact around me and it‚Äôs only going to get worse.‚Äù Boos erupted as demonstrators walked past Downing Street. The anarchist group Class War marched with a banner that read: ‚ÄúWe must devastate the avenues where the wealthy live.‚Äù A unit of police carefully monitored a handful of black-clad protesters. It had been reported earlier that several people with convictions, or who were alleged to have caused trouble at past demonstrations, had been prevented from marching. The mood was overwhelmingly good-natured. Parents walked with their children in pushchairs, young people clustered in groups of friends, older people and activists mixed. One young man had covered his face with a bandana handed out by the Network for Police Monitoring. When asked why, he said it was because of CCTV. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an oppressive, absolutist state where you don‚Äôt have to do anything wrong. Just have your picture taken and the facial recognition system will get you on the database and class you as a terrorist, even if you are just attending a protest. The real terrorists are financial.‚Äù Young people said they felt particularly exposed by the billions in cuts the government plans. Owen Winter, 16, from Cornwall, got up at 5.30am to get to London for the protest. He marched with a placard that read: ‚ÄúYour cuts, our future.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm demonstrating because I feel that the cuts are particularly harsh for young people and affect them quite negatively, and I think that I‚Äôm going to grow up dealing with the repercussions. Generally, I think young people get a raw deal out of politics,‚Äù he said. His friend Morgan Centini, also 16, added: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve grown up in an environment where I‚Äôve watched the public sector in my home town destroyed. Watching the cuts rip apart a community, I can‚Äôt put it into words really. It‚Äôs disgusting.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-20T14:02:07Z,world,World news,Iranian vice-president attacks hardliners over volleyball ban for female fans,"One of Iran‚Äôs vice-presidents has condemned conservative hardliners who are blocking her attempt to let women watch volleyball matches. Shahindokht Molaverdi, whose brief covers women and family affairs, denounced men whose violent threats prevented women getting into a match on Friday as sanctimonious. Two hundred tickets for Iran‚Äôs keenly anticipated clash with the US at the Azadi sport complex in Tehran were reserved for women, but security officials at the stadium refused to allow them in to see the game. Women have been banned from attending sporting events since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, but Hassan Rouhani‚Äôs moderate government has been trying to relax the restrictions. An Iranian volleyball official said the 200 women‚Äôs tickets had not been approved by security officials and so were not valid. Hardliners have recently stepped up their campaign against women watching live sport, handing out posters in central Tehran branding female volleyball fans as prostitutes and sluts. Writing on Facebook, Molaverdi said that her conservative opponents were ‚Äúfrom those who were denounced two years ago by voters, and who had crawled into their cave of oblivion‚Äù‚Äù. She criticised the ‚Äúcrowd of sanctimonious people who published one notice after another denouncing the modest and decent girls and women of this land‚Äù and who ‚Äúused obscene and disgusting insults that only befit themselves‚Äù. The issue of gender at sporting events attracted international attention after the arrest last summer of a British-Iranian law graduate, Ghoncheh Ghavami, who took part in a protest outside a stadium in the capital before a male volleyball match. Jailed for five months before being released on bail, she was later sentenced to a year in prison for propaganda against the government and having contacts with opposition groups.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-20T13:30:15Z,world,World news,Charleston shooting echoes a painful history of attacks on black churches,"During a 1998 trial following the 1995 race-related burning of a black church in South Carolina, one witness on the stand recalled a casual conversation between two male members of a local white supremacist group: ‚Äúhell, let‚Äôs burn a church‚Äù, one white supremacist said to the other, according to records by the Southern Poverty Law Center. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one right down the road.‚Äù From 1822 when the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston was attacked for the first time and burned to the ground, to 1963 when four school girls were killed in a church basement in Birmingham, Alabama, following a racially motivated bombing, and through the 1990s when dozens of churches were set on fire across the American south, ending this week in Charleston, South Carolina: the pattern is undeniably, disturbingly there. ‚ÄúThe African American church, itself born out of a protest movement, is a symbol to African American community and culture,‚Äù says Yolanda Pierce, an associate professor of African American Religion at Princeton Theological Seminary, pointing out that the site of Wednesday‚Äôs killings, fondly referred to by some as ‚ÄúMother Emanuel‚Äù, was a church that was founded because of black freemen and slaves‚Äô very marginalization from white religious services in the first place. ‚ÄúWhether we are looking at the 16th street bombing in Alabama in 1963, or this recent massacre, these are targeted specific attacks on African American communities, against African American lives. It is quite clear that it is about race,‚Äù she said. Pierce said striking in a place of worship that has traditionally been a sanctuary and a refuge ‚Äì where black people have been able to retreat away from racist practices and oppression ‚Äì sends a message: ‚ÄúYou are not safe in a place that you call home.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe attack is actually on the African American community at large and the church acts as the symbol for this,‚Äù she closes. It is hard to grapple with the reality of Wednesday‚Äôs horrific church attack in Charleston, South Carolina, where a white 21-year-old man is charged with fatally gunning down nine African American women and men as they attended Bible study. And yet ‚Äì as uniquely shocking as the incident is ‚Äì from a historical standpoint, it is no isolated event. The attack somewhat disturbingly inscribes itself within a long American tradition of physical attacks on black churches ‚Äì sometimes deadly, sometimes not ‚Äì by white Americans.
The practice of terrorizing black churches goes back centuries, starting during slavery ‚Äì when black churches were often forbidden, or dismantled, sometimes burned ‚Äì and stretches over the few decades of American‚Äôs still young history into the 1990s, when more than 70 burnings of black churches, predominantly in the south, led to a congressional hearing on the subject. ‚ÄúPeople have been talking about this as a terrible mistake, or tragedy. But when you think about it historically, it is not a mistake. It is actually a part of a system and a process of terrorizing black people and black bodies, particularly in spaces that they have carved out as sanctuaries,‚Äù Pierce said. ‚ÄúToday has been a very difficult day,‚Äù the Rev Terrence Evans said on the phone. The weight of the church killings rested heavy on the shoulders of the pastor, who leads another predominantly African American AME congregation in Dallas, Georgia, an Atlanta suburb of 5,000 or so residents that lies 300 miles to the west of Charleston. He spoke to a few members of his own congregation following the news of the church attacks, he says, and they have been thinking of ways to help. People have been worried about his safety. He has brushed concerns off. ‚ÄúWe are going to have to look into ways to be more vigilant with security,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut that does not mean we will carry guns, that does not mean we will have security outside the door.‚Äù Above everything, ‚Äúthe doors of the church will remain open to whomever,‚Äù he said. Perhaps one of the most painful details to emerge from Wednesday‚Äôs series of events was that the white accused perpetrator of the mass killing was welcomed into the black church in Charleston to join Bible study for an hour before turning on his hosts and shooting them dead. Four little girls and other senseless attacks Evans‚Äôs mind has been so preoccupied with senseless killings, racial injustices tied to Ferguson, police violence against black people, and addressing the issue of violence within the community, that it had not dawned on him to draw any parallels with the history of his own church, which was burned in 1995. On the surface, the 1995 episode is a curious blip, one that created no physical harm to anyone, but for the fact that the place of worship of a small community was burned down, and that the church took a short while (a year) to properly rebuild. ‚ÄúIt was a child. A very young boy who was only maybe 11 or 12 years old that broke into the church. ‚ÄúFor whatever reason, he decided that he wanted to burn the church. He set the church on fire in the choir area. Watched it burn for a little while and then he actually called the fire department himself. There wasn‚Äôt any major issue, other than the church burned.‚Äù Evans, whose almost entirely African American congregation practices within the majority white city of Dallas, Georgia, has tried to piece together the events of what happened one day in June 1995 ‚Äì almost exactly 20 years ago ‚Äì when a young white boy decided to set fire to the church he leads. But the details have proven murky. Evans, who has been the pastor at St Paul AME in Dallas for the last five years, wasn‚Äôt in the area at the time, and news clippings are few and far between. He has had to mostly rely on oral history from members of his congregation. It was probably race-motivated, he says. There were, after all, many other churches in the area ‚Äì with much whiter congregations ‚Äì that could have been targeted, and yet this is the one that was. Unlike the events in Charleston this week, which demand action and attention in and of themselves, it may be conceivable to push this two-decade-old episode away, and categorize it as negligible. But the 1995 burning happened at a time when black churches were being burned by the dozens in the south. That same month in Clarendon County, South Carolina, a century-old church was burned to the ground in an organized attack by members of the local branch of the Ku Klux Klan. A subsequent, successful court case brought by the Southern Poverty Law Center on behalf of the church, that fined the Klansmen millions of dollars for their role in the attack, effectively dismantled the South Carolina chapter by bankrupting it. But Richard Cohen, president of SPLC, says that while many of the 1990s attacks on black churches were certainly racially motivated, most of them were not organized responses against civil rights advances the way that black church attacks in the 1960s had been. In 1963, the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama, undertaken by four Ku Klux Klan white, male members, killed four African American girls aged 11 to 14. The church in question had been the site of civil rights organizing in the months leading up to the deadly bombing.
A lot of them could probably be put on the backs of kids doing ‚Äúthrill crimes at rural black churches where they could get away with things‚Äù, he said. But Pierce, the professor at Princeton Theological Seminary, says one incident cannot be divorced from the other. ‚ÄúWhen we understand it as a pattern of behavior, when we understand it as a historical construct, then we have to sit with questions of: what causes this to happen? And what allows it to be? And how is it that we are having these conversations again and again?‚Äù The Charleston Emanuel AME church was burned to the ground in 1822 after white residents uncovered a meticulously planned slave revolt partially organized and conceived by one of the church‚Äôs founders, Denmark Vesey. Vesey, who was put to death 40 years before the Emancipation Proclamation that formally ended American slavery, was a black man who had bought his way out of slavery, but had been unable to secure the freedom of his wife and children. For Greg Carr, an associate professor at Howard University who chairs its Afro-American studies department, the reason for ongoing, historical attacks on black churches can be placed on a fear by white America of an armed, black populace ‚Äì a fear that in turn has origins within the American revolution against the British. ‚ÄúOne of the chief forces of colonial England unrest in terms of the American colony is the accusation ‚Äì specifically in places like South Carolina and Virginia ‚Äì was that the British were considering, and they were, abolishing slavery, and offering to the enslaved Africans a negotiated access to different forms of citizenship, which would have included the right to bear arms,‚Äù Carr says. Carr says he is fed up with talks of an American dream, and of black martyrs like those young girls in Birmingham, Alabama, of calls by a president for gun control, a culture of which was conceived precisely to keep black Americans down. ‚ÄúThose words ring hollow to African Americans who do not seem to enjoy protection from state violence, or from private paramilitary acts of violence,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThis speaks to the structural failure of America to protect its black citizens.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-20T12:56:08Z,world,World news,Greece to make improved offer to international creditors,"Greece is to improve its offer to its international creditors in a new attempt to find agreement before a deadline at the end of June which could force the country into default and out of the eurozone.
Athens has been locked in negotiations with European leaders for weeks, but has been unable to reach a compromise on the reforms demanded by its creditors in return for a fresh tranche of cash. The European Central Bank provided ‚Ç¨1.8bn in emergency funding for the Greek banking system on Friday to keep it afloat over the weekend, after Greeks withdrew more than ‚Ç¨1bn in a single day, prompted by fears that their country was about to slip deeper into economic crisis. The minister of state, Alekos Flabouraris, told a Greek television show on Saturday morning that the government was prepared to bring new reforms to the table when talks restarted. ‚ÄúWe will try to supplement our proposal so that we get closer to a solution,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are not going there with the old proposal. Some work is being done to see where we can converge, so that we achieve a mutually beneficial solution.‚Äù If Greece does not receive a fresh bailout from its creditors by 30 June, it will be unable to meet the next repayment of ‚Ç¨1.6bn to the International Monetary Fund and could be turfed out of the single currency. The prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, and his leftwing government elected in January on an anti-austerity platform, have so far refused to give in to eurozone demands that they cut pensions and raise taxes. Flabouraris, who is close to Tsipras, said he was confident a deal would be reached soon. A teleconference between Tsipras and the head of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, will probably take place today, he said. Tsipras is on his way back to Greece from Russia, where he has been seeking support from Vladimir Putin. Speaking in St Petersburg on Friday, Tsipras expressed confidence that a deal would be done. ‚ÄúAll those who are betting on crisis and terror scenarios will be proven wrong,‚Äù he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-20T12:41:43Z,world,World news,Charleston shooting: Confederate flag at heart of growing political storm,"Pressure is mounting on South Carolina to pull down the Confederate flag that continues to fly on the grounds of the state capitol, after a Republican legislator announced plans to introduce a bill to remove the divisive symbol that has inflamed feelings in the wake of the Charleston church shootings. Norman ‚ÄúDoug‚Äù Brannon, a white legislator, said on MSNBC that he wanted to introduce the bill because of the death of his friend Clementa Pinckney, a reverend and state senator who was pastor of the Emanuel AME church and one of nine worshippers gunned down there on Wednesday night. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not political tonight, but I do have access and I will file that bill in December,‚Äù Brannon said.
The flag, which represents the region that seceded from the Union in 1861 in defense of slavery, has become the focus of rising tension in South Carolina as a result of the racist opinions expressed by the suspected shooter, Dylann Roof, 21, who was arrested a day after the rampage in a car that bore the Confederate icon. The Battle Flag of the Northern Virginia Army, as the controversial banner is also known, once flew above the state house dome, but was moved to its current location still in state grounds in 2000. President Barack Obama said pointedly on Friday that the flag belongs in a museum. Speaking after a vigil on Friday at the the TD arena in downtown Charleston, South Carolina senator and Republican presidential hopeful Lindsey Graham conceded that further debate on the matter needed to occur but declined to take a position. ‚ÄúThere are graveyards of Confederate soldiers all over the state ‚Äì what do we do? How much of revisiting one‚Äôs past is it going to take before we can move forward? To the extent this debate helps us move forward, let‚Äôs have that debate.‚Äù Asked by the Guardian what his position in that debate was, however, Graham responded: ‚ÄúThat it happens here.‚Äù During standing ovations at the vigil, as those on the podium called for the flag to come down, Graham and fellow South Carolina republican senator Tim Scott stayed seated. The growing demand for a resolution to South Carolina‚Äôs official attachment to one America‚Äôs most notorious symbols highlights the fault-line that exists to this day in a state that has consistently failed to make a clean break with its racist secessionist past. The revived dispute over the Confederate flag that has erupted in the wake of the Charleston shootings is just the sharpest expression of an age-old seeping wound. All across the state, from the urban centers of Columbia and Charleston to the conservative rural heartlands in the north, examples of the Confederacy‚Äôs stranglehold on the collective imagination, at least of many white Carolinians, abound. They vary from moderate to extreme, from whimsical to revolutionary.
At the mild end of the spectrum are the many outposts of what might be called Confederacy nostalgia, epitomized by the Confederate Museum located just a few blocks away from the Emanuel AME church. The museum has been curated in a hall that in 1861 was used to recruit and arm thousands of secessionist soldiers. It is still run by the Charleston chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, a group formed by the female descendants of the soldiers and sailors of the Confederate forces. Its exhibits include the Secession Flag, as well as a captured Union battle flag. On the more extreme end, South Carolina remains a hotbed of neo-confederacy nationalism calling for a new secession, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center which monitors hate groups and extremist organisations. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no other state that has this level of pro-confederate sympathies, of hate-group organizations or such an open public display of the Confederate battle flag,‚Äù said the SPLC‚Äôs Heidi Beirich. The law center has identified 19 active hate groups in South Carolina, some six of which have secessionist aspirations.
Debate about the prevalence of Confederate imagery in South Carolina was rekindled by photographs of Roof posing on the bonnet of his car that bore a Confederacy license plate. He also made ‚Äúracially inflammatory‚Äù comments during the shooting spree, according to local police. Though there is no evidence that Roof was directly connected to any hate groups or secessionist campaigns, there are concerns that ubiquitous cultural references to the golden past of the antebellum south may have fueled his racist obsessions. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt get those ideas from nowhere,‚Äù Beirich said. One of the most prominent secessionist groups in the state is the South Carolina League of the South. It owns a ‚ÄúSouthern Patriot Shop‚Äù and a two-acre plot of land in Abbeville, site of the first secession speeches in 1860 that triggered the civil war, which it has turned into a memorial park. The league‚Äôs chairman in South Carolina, Pat Hines, told the Guardian that the purpose of the group was the ‚Äúsurvival and wellbeing of the southern people. We feel we are under siege ‚Äì we‚Äôve been under attack for the past 150 years.‚Äù Hines said that the league‚Äôs members in South Carolina wanted to see a new secession of the southern states. He estimated that some 25% to 40% of the population of the state supported the idea.
Then he clarified to the Guardian that he was referring exclusively to white South Carolinians. ‚ÄúWe consider southern people to be whites,‚Äù he said. Hines denied that the new secessionist movement had any responsibility for the crazed violence of the Charleston mass killer. In fact, he said the league was upset by Roof‚Äôs adoption of the Confederate flag. ‚ÄúWe have negative feelings about the fact that this drug-addled young man chose to display southern symbols. We don‚Äôt advocate doing anything like he did. Ask how many southern nationalists have been involved in mass shootings ‚Äì the answer is zero.‚Äù In Columbia, the state capital, there were rumors on social media on Friday that a demonstration would take place in an effort to push lawmakers to finally remove the Confederate flag from the state house. It was first raised above the dome of the capital building in 1961, a provocative act coming at a particularly sensitive moment in the history of US civil rights. Jayne Williams, who is white, ended up being one of two people to show up for the rumored demonstration, and instead sat in the sweltering heat, next to the flags and the signs she had made demanding that the flag be taken down. ‚ÄúThe fact that a pastor and a victim served in the state house and they are basically flying a white victory flag out here is just disgusting me,‚Äù said Williams, who is a graduate of Columbine high school, the site of what was once the United States‚Äô most notorious mass shooting. She drove from North Carolina to South Carolina on a whim, having told her husband that she knew it was crazy, but she needed to see the Confederate flag flying full mast outside the state house building in Columbia, while state and American flags flew at half mast in honor of the nine of victims of the Charleston shooting. Frustrated, sad and angry, Williams placed nine American flags around the state house‚Äôs Confederate memorial, in honor of the Charleston victims. A black state trooper had to ask her to remove the flags.

2015-06-20T11:37:14Z,world,World news,World‚Äôs most inaccessible art found in the heart of the Colombian jungle,"A British wildlife film-maker has returned from one of the most inaccessible parts of the world with extraordinary footage of ancient rock art that has never been filmed or photographed before. In an area of Colombia so vast and remote that contact has still not been made with some tribes thought to live there, Mike Slee used a helicopter to film hundreds of paintings depicting hunters and animals believed to have been created thousands of years ago. He said: ‚ÄúWe had crews all over the place and helicopters filming all over Colombia. As a photographer, Francisco Forero Bonell discovered and took the pictures for my movie.‚Äù The extraordinary art includes images of jaguar, crocodiles and deer. They are painted in red, on vertical rock faces in Chiribiquete national park, a 12,000 square kilometre Unesco world heritage site that is largely unexplored. There are also paintings of warriors or hunters dancing or celebrating. ‚ÄúIt is the land that time forgot,‚Äù Slee told the Observer. There had previously been only vague reports of rock art in the area, which is known as Cerro Campana, he said: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no information, maps or communication. It‚Äôs such a massive central part of Colombia.‚Äù Though some paintings had previously been found and photographed elsewhere in Chiribiquete, this Cerro Campana art has never been filmed or photographed, Slee said: ‚ÄúIt was an absolutely stunning moment to be able to get the footage.‚Äù Slee used a helicopter to gain access to the area, as the terrain is impenetrable ‚Äì thick vegetation, forested rock peaks and valleys, sheer cliffs and giant rock towers soaring through a rainforest canopy. Professor Fernando Urbina, a rock art specialist from the National University of Colombia, was struck by the ‚Äúmagnificent naturalism‚Äù of the depictions of deer when shown the photographs. ‚ÄúThey reveal the hand of a master of painting,‚Äù he said, adding that the paintings could be up to 20,000 years old. He was particularly interested in a human figure in a seated position whose arms appear to be folded over his shoulders, a ritual position in Amazonian cultures. ‚ÄúA seated man has special significance as the sage of the tribe,‚Äù he said.
The art may have been painted by the Karijona tribe, a few of whose members still live in the region. The seated position might suggest a prisoner or slave, Urbina said.Jean Clottes, a French prehistorian, and author of Cave Art ‚Äì a book covering key sites such as Lascaux in France ‚Äì described the images as exciting and well-preserved, but said it would be hard to determine their age because radiocarbon dating could not be used, as they were painted with mineral-based materials derived from iron oxide rather than the charcoal used in European rock art. The species depicted are thought to include capybaras, snakes and anteaters. Slee described the art as a wildlife chapel. ‚ÄúThe peoples who once lived here have left in pictures testimony of their awe and respect for the wild,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen I saw the images, I honestly felt an affinity with the artists. They were attempting to capture the power, grace, spirit and essence of the animal in pictures. Perhaps it was to make the hunt better next day, but there is clearly careful observation in their art. It‚Äôs what contemporary photographers, painters, film-makers set out to do when they create a wildlife project.‚Äù Slee made his name making natural history films and directed the movie Bugs! 3D, about two rainforest insects, narrated by Judi Dench. In 2012, the Observer reported that his Flight of the Butterflies 3D had captured butterflies in unprecedented detail, moving scientists to tears at an early screening. Over the past three years, Slee has been exploring Colombia to make Colombia: Wild Magic, which will be in cinemas next year. Through spectacular footage, it portrays ‚Äúa majestic tropical wilderness‚Äù ‚Äì but one he said was threatened by humans who are ‚Äútaking more than they are giving‚Äù. With swooping aerial footage and detailed close-ups, it reveals a landscape of canyons and caves, lakes and lagoons, rivers and rock masses with ‚Äúthe largest varieties of living things on the planet‚Äù, including unique species of hummingbird and endangered jaguar.
Drawing on the expertise of a dozen scientific advisers, the film warns of threats from the world‚Äôs ‚Äúcraving‚Äù for natural resources such as gold and emeralds. Slee said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got illegal gold-mining polluting the rivers, we‚Äôre overfishing the seas, the habitat destruction is massive. We‚Äôre taking out the rainforest, we‚Äôre losing species every week. We have the most beautiful country on Earth and we are in danger of destroying it. There are places that no Colombian has been. It‚Äôs mainly because, when you think of Colombia, you think of kidnapping and drugs.‚Äù Bonell, a Colombian conservationist and photographer, was inspired to become executive producer of the film, describing the region as ‚Äúone of the few areas on our planet that still remains unspoiled and unexplored‚Äù. The film has been produced by British company Off The Fence, and will be distributed free in schools in Colombia, as well as cinemas, ‚Äúspreading the word about what their country has and the need to protect it‚Äù, Slee said. Slee hopes to return for another large-scale expedition focusing on the rock art. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve probably only scratched the surface,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere are believed to be many hundreds of these cave paintings dotted throughout that central region.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-20T08:49:41Z,world,World news,Obama's strong words on Charleston shooting: 'I refuse to act as if this is the new normal',"Declaring that he refused to ‚Äúact as if this is the new normal‚Äù, President Barack Obama on Friday called for a national moment of soul-searching over gun violence, in his second statement in as many days on Wednesday‚Äôs mass shooting inside a church in Charleston, South Carolina. ‚ÄúMore than 11,000 Americans were killed by gun violence in 2013 alone,‚Äù Obama said in an afternoon appearance at a national conference of mayors in San Francisco. ‚ÄúIf Congress had passed some commonsense legislation after Newtown, after a group of children had been gunned down in their own classroom, reforms that 90% of the American people supported ‚Ä¶ we might still have more Americans with us.‚Äù
The words echoed a statement the president delivered at the White House on Thursday, in which he said that ‚Äúat some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries‚Äù. Gun advocacy groups including the National Rifle Association have said a new national debate over guns was inappropriate so soon after the massacre, in which nine African Americans were shot dead inside Emanuel AME church. Dylann Roof, a 21-year-old white man said to have yelled racist taunts before he shot, was arrested on Thursday and charged with the crime.
In his statement to the mayors, the president rejected a foreclosure of the gun debate. He said repeated incidences of mass shootings made a serious national discussion about gun control more urgent. ‚ÄúAs much as we grieve this particular tragedy, it‚Äôs important to step back and recognize that these tragedies have become far too commonplace,‚Äù Obama said. Over the course of his presidency, Obama has delivered similar statements expressing shock and dismay, and calling for change, after other mass shootings. Victims have included soldiers at Fort Hood, Texas, in two separate incidents; wounded congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, Arizona, and six others who were killed; moviegoers in Aurora, Colorado; worshippers at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin; first-graders in Newtown, Connecticut; and people at a Washington DC naval base. In his statement, the president said that Congress should follow the will of the people, and that the national will had shown itself capable of rapid change on issues such as same-sex marriage and, more incrementally, on climate change. The same can happen with gun control, Obama said. ‚ÄúI am not resigned,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI have faith that we will eventually do the right thing. I was simply making the point that we have to move public opinion. We have to feel a sense of urgency. ‚ÄúAt some point as a country, we have to reckon with what happens. It‚Äôs not enough to express sympathy. You don‚Äôt see this kind of murder, on this scale, with this kind of frequency in other advanced countries on earth.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-20T02:02:23Z,world,World news,Putin says Fifa's granting of World Cup to Russia 'should not be questioned',"Russia fought honestly for the right to host the 2018 World Cup and the decision should not be called into question, Vladimir Putin has declared. Swiss judicial authorities are investigating the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar as part of a far-reaching corruption scandal that has also raised questions about the 2010 event in South Africa. ‚ÄúWe fought in an honest manner [for the tournament] and we won. We do not think the decision should be questioned,‚Äù Putin told journalists on the sidelines of an investment forum in Saint Petersburg. ‚ÄúWe were ready and that‚Äôs what convinced Fifa. The stadium construction has already started. The head of Fifa‚Äôs auditing and compliance committee, Domenico Scala, this month warned Russia and Qatar could lose the right to host the the 2018 and 2022 World Cups if evidence was found of corruption in the bidding process. Putin said Russia supported the corruption inquiry currently unfolding at world football‚Äôs governing body but said it was ‚Äúup to a court to decide if someone was guilty‚Äù. The president said no evidence had been found of any corruption. ‚ÄúIf anyone has evidence, let them present it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe won in a fair fight and are going to host the World Cup.‚Äù Putin also insisted Russia wanted to co-operate with Washington and its allies in dealing with the threat posed by Islamic State and other global challenges as he tried to allay investors‚Äô fears over the country‚Äôs course. Putin blamed the United States for ignoring Russia‚Äôs interests and trying to enforce its will on others but he sent conciliatory signals, saying Moscow wanted a quick settlement to the Iranian nuclear standoff and a peaceful political transition in Syria. Russia wanted February‚Äôs Ukraine peace agreement to succeed, he said. Fighting there would stop once Ukraine provided broader rights to its eastern regions, gave amnesty to the rebels and called local elections. The annual event, intended to burnish Russia‚Äôs image before global investors, was tarnished by the freezing of Russian accounts in France and Belgium on Thursday as part of an effort to enforce a $50bn judgment to compensate shareholders of the now-defunct Yukos oil company. Putin sought to downplay the freeze and said Russia would contest it. He argued the arbitration court in The Hague, Netherlands, which issued the ruling in 2014, does not have jurisdiction over Russia. The court ruled Russia must pay damages to shareholders in the oil company, which was dismantled in a politically driven onslaught that saw its chief executive, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, sentenced to 10 years in prison. EU and US sanctions over Ukraine have helped push Russia‚Äôs economy into recession and cut investment and imports dramatically. Putin, however, argued on Friday the Russian economy was on the path to recovery and the west hurt itself by imposing the sanctions. Asked about the downing of a Malaysia Airlines plane over eastern Ukraine last July that killed all 298 people on board and triggered the toughening of western sanctions, Putin said it was necessary to wait for the conclusions of the Dutch Safety Board investigation into the crash. Controversy continues over who downed the airliner. Ukraine and the west suspect it was destroyed by a surface-to-air missile fired by Russian soldiers or Russia-backed separatist rebels fighting in the area. Russia denies this. Putin referred to an unofficial report alleging the damage to the Malaysian airliner could have been inflicted by a missile launched from the area held by Ukrainian forces at the time. Putin‚Äôs speech on the economy lacked any engagement on his part or specific proposals to turn around the economy. A large number of Russian and foreign investors in the audience were reading news or emails on their smartphones as Putin delivered a speech in which he did not address the severe crisis businesses in Russia are facing. In contrast to the economy speech, Putin was much more animated while responding to questions about foreign policy. His emphasis on foreign affairs has reflected the way the Kremlin has been running Russia since the Ukrainian conflict began. Critics have blamed Putin for sacrificing the country‚Äôs economic growth for geopolitical ends such as the 2014 annexation of Crimea. David Iakobashvili, founder of Russia‚Äôs once-largest beverage company and head of a Russia-US business council, said businessmen have got used to the fact Putin seems to prioritise foreign policy goals over domestic development. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very clear today that geopolitics is more important from his point of view,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut ... we shall adapt to whatever environment has been presented by the government and act accordingly.‚Äù Addressing the forum, Putin argued Russia wants February‚Äôs peace deal for Ukraine to succeed. He said Russia was exerting pressure on the rebels to abide by the agreement and urged the US to encourage Kiev to comply. Ukraine and the west have accused Russia of breaking the peace deal by supporting the rebels with troops and weapons. Moscow denies this. Commenting on the accusations, Putin said the rebels are defending themselves against the Ukrainian military. He added that ‚Äúonce an attempt is made to solve the problem by political means, those weapons will be gone‚Äù. In Washington, State Department spokesman John Kirby called on Russia to fully implement February‚Äôs ceasefire agreement in Ukraine and remove heavy weapons from the country. As for Putin linking the arms to a political solution, Kirby said it was ‚Äúdifficult to have a political solution when you‚Äôve still got thousands of combined Russian separatist forces inside Ukraine fomenting violence and instability, and violating the agreement that they signed up to.‚Äù Putin used the investment conference as yet another opportunity to blame the US and the European Union for triggering the Ukrainian crisis by refusing to take into account what he described as Russia‚Äôs legitimate interests. ‚ÄúThey have pushed us back to the line beyond which we can‚Äôt retreat,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúRussia isn‚Äôt seeking hegemony or some ephemeral superpower status.‚Äù Putin said Russia wants to co-operate with the west in tackling global threats and challenges ‚Äì including Islamic State, calling the extremist group an ‚Äúabsolute evil‚Äù that requires stronger joint efforts to combat. Putin also said Russia wants a deal ending the standoff over the Iranian nuclear program to be signed as planned before the end of June, but cautioned against putting ‚Äúunfulfillable‚Äù demands upon Tehran. And he also voiced readiness to encourage the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, to discuss a peaceful political transition. He explained Moscow‚Äôs backing for the Syrian ruler was to prevent the victory of radical forces who would begin a reign of terror. ‚ÄúWe are ready to work with the president to ensure political transformation, so that all Syrians have access to instruments of power,‚Äù he said.

2015-06-19T23:57:08Z,world,World news,A novel oasis: why Argentina is the bookshop capital of the world,"Their country has endured military dictatorship, economic collapse and a particularly vituperative brand of politics, so perhaps it is not surprising that Argentinians should still find solace in the oldest of pleasures: curling up with a good book.
The country‚Äôs capital Buenos Aires has more bookshops per inhabitant than any other city in the world, according to a recent study by the World Cities Culture Forum. With a population of around 2.8 million, Buenos Aires has at least 734 bookstores ‚Äì roughly 25 bookshops for every 100,000 inhabitants. Worldwide, only Hong Kong comes close, with 22 bookshops per 100,000, followed by Madrid in a distant third with just 16 and compared to a mere 10 bookshops for every 100,000 for London. Gabriela Adamo, who until recently was the president of the city‚Äôs annual book fair ‚Äì an event which draws over 1 million visitors each year ‚Äì says Argentina‚Äôs love affair with the book is related to the wave of mass immigration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A century ago, Buenos Aires was the shining capital of one of the wealthiest countries of the world. European immigrants poured into Buenos Aires, creating a multicultural environment in which culture and the arts thrived. At one stage Buenos Aires boasted two English-language newspapers, various German-language papers (including at one stage a pro-Nazi paper, an anti-Nazi one and a Jewish newspaper) along with a plethora of Spanish-language newspapers, magazines and literary and arts publications. ‚ÄúThe book as an object became a cultural symbol back then. It‚Äôs something that persists today,‚Äù said Adamo. But contemporary economics also plays a role: books are exempt from Argentina‚Äôs standard sales tax ‚Äì a whopping 21% on most goods ‚Äì and internet sales and electronic book readers have yet to make inroads on the local publishing market. Amazon does not have an Argentinian site and import restrictions make it a bureaucratic nightmare to purchase books from international internet sellers. ‚ÄúArgentinians still prefer to come in and browse for books,‚Äù said Antonio Dalto, business manager of the Ateneo Grand Splendid bookshop. ‚ÄúWe have a website for selling books, but it only draws a small percentage of readers. As a matter of fact, they seem to use it more to select titles online, but then they come to buy the actual book here at the shop.‚Äù
That is perhaps unsurprising, considering the grandeur of the shop‚Äôs setting: opened as a theatre in 1919 and converted into a giant bookstore 15 years ago, the Grand Splendid still boasts the beautiful ceiling frescoes painted by an Italian artist almost a century ago. Around 1 million customers visit it each year to browse through its gargantuan 21,000 square feet showroom, or withdraw into one of the old theatre boxes perched for a leisurely read. ‚ÄúCulture is very important to the people of Buenos Aires. Even young kids read books, we see them here every day. Books for teenagers are one of our biggest sellers,‚Äù said Dalto. Publishers and booksellers say that the city‚Äôs book market is distinctly catholic in taste, immune to fads or fashion. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a very particular kind of reader here, with wide and varied demand,‚Äù said Adamo. Argentina is one of the most prolific book publishers in Latin America, and the number of titles published has grown steadily each year, from 16,092 in 2004 to 28,010 last year. The total number of books printed in 2014 was 123m. Publishing experts have also linked the country‚Äôs love for reading to its obsession with psychoanalysis: Argentina has more psychologists per inhabitant than any other country in the world, and according to Virginia Ungar, a member of the Buenos Aires Psychoanalytical Association, the habitual introspection of therapy makes Argentinians ideal readers. ‚ÄúPsychoanalysis, reading and the arts in general are all linked because they are all an inquiry into the depths of personality. Both literature and psychoanalysis work with the word,‚Äù said Ungar, who is president-elect of the International Psychoanalytical Association founded by Sigmund Freud in 1910. It is not only the market for new books which is thriving: Buenos Aires also has a total of 102 rare and secondhand bookshops, far outranking London with only 68 or Berlin, with only six, and only third in terms of secondhand bookshops per inhabitant after Johannesburg and Tokyo, most of them congregated along Avenida Corrientes.
The city‚Äôs unusual hours ‚Äì people often meet for dinner at 11pm, and shops stay open until after midnight ‚Äì also play a role, said Ignacio Iraola, general manager of the Argentinian branch of the Spanish publishing behemoth Planeta. ‚ÄúBuenos Aires is a city that wakes up late and the day stretches out into the early hours,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAvenida Corrientes is like a long, open bookshop that never sleeps.‚Äù Away from the city centre, local bookshops also thrive. Tucked away in the bohemian neighbourhood of Villa Crespo is La Internacional Argentina, an independent store which specialises in first editions of Latin American authors. On a recent evening, its owners Francisco Garamona and Nicol√°s Moguilevsky, both thirtysomething, were ending the day with some bottles of red Argentinian wine in the back room where they run Mansalva, a speciality press that publishes many first-time novelists and poets, as well as art books by Argentinian painters. ‚ÄúIf this was a job we would have got bored by now and quit ‚Äì our existence is a miracle,‚Äù says Garamona. Although the bookshop and Mansalva press barely scrape by, they have been in business for 15 years now, a testament to the unquenchable thirst of the city for books. ‚ÄúWe hold a fair every two months on a Saturday on the sidewalk here,‚Äù says Moguilevsky. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really surprising, sometimes up to 500 people come, many of them young kids. And they usually walk away with two or three books that they get here for the price they would pay for just one at one of the big bookshops downtown.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T23:02:17Z,world,World news,'I forgive you': Charleston church victims' families confront suspect,"‚ÄúI forgive you,‚Äù said the daughter of 70-year-old Ethel Lance to the 21-year-old man who allegedly murdered her mother in church and appeared at an emotionally charged video court appearance in Charleston on Friday afternoon, two days after a horrific mass shooting here.
Relatives of the Emanuel church victims stood up one by one in the courtroom, offering forgiveness to the man accused of murdering their sons, mothers and grandfathers in cold blood, as a nation continued to call for justice. Dylann Roof appeared at his bond hearing via videolink from the Charleston detention center, where he is being held in isolation. Officials later confirmed he is being detained in the same jail unit as Michael Slager, the white police officer who just 10 weeks ago stood in the same court, charged with the murder of Walter Scott, whom he shot five times from behind as the unarmed black man ran away. ‚ÄúYou took something very precious from me, but I forgive you,‚Äù Lance‚Äôs daughter said through tears. ‚ÄúIt hurts me. You hurt a lot of people, but may God forgive you.‚Äù Speaking of her son Tywanza Sanders, who was also killed on Wednesday night trying to shield his great aunt from gunfire, Felicia Sanders said to the suspect: ‚ÄúWe welcomed you Wednesday night in our Bible study with open arms. You have killed some of the most beautifullest people that I know. Every fiber in my body hurts. I will never be the same.‚Äù
She continued: ‚ÄúTywanza was my hero. But as they say in the Bible study, we enjoyed you, but may God have mercy on your soul.‚Äù Roof stood still, in an oversized black-and-gray striped inmate‚Äôs uniform, as Judge James Gosnell requested a representative from each family to declare if they wished to make a formal statement. The 21-year-old was flanked by two heavily armored officers throughout the hearing. He uttered very few words, confirming his age, employment status and address in a timid baritone. As successive relatives stood to offer him forgiveness, he expressed no emotion, staring down and occasionally into the camera inside a cell. Court officials later confirmed that Roof could see into the courtroom and heard each of the speeches, but he could not see the relatives who stood a few feet away from the judge, out of his view. Alanna Simmons, the granddaughter of 74-year-old retired pastor Daniel Simmons, stood after Sanders. ‚ÄúAlthough my grandfather and the other victims died at the hands of hate, this is proof that they lived and loved,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHate won‚Äôt win.‚Äù In all, five representatives of the nine people killed in the massacre spoke at the hearing, with President Barack Obama tweeting shortly after the hearing that the ‚Äúdecency and goodness of the American people shines through in these families‚Äù.
In an address later on Friday in San Francisco, Obama made a renewed call to action on gun control, saying he had ‚Äúfaith we will eventually do the right thing‚Äù despite political gridlock in Washington. ‚ÄúThe apparent motivations of the shooter remind us that racism remains a blight that we have to combat together,‚Äù he said. The small courthouse in Charleston was packed full of relatives and friends who had arrived earlier in the afternoon in small groups, walking through the sweltering 95-degree heat, flanked by sheriff‚Äôs deputies and taking no questions from media. In an opening statement Judge Gosnell asked that Roof‚Äôs family be acknowledged as they were also victims of his crimes. ‚ÄúWe would like you to take this opportunity to repent,‚Äù said Anthony Thompson, grandson of 59-year-old Myra Thompson as the family‚Äôs statements continued. ‚ÄúRepent. Confess. Give your life to the one who matters the most, Christ, so he can change your ways no matter what happens to you and you‚Äôll be OK. Roof‚Äôs family later issued its first public statement since the shooting: ‚ÄúWe have all been touched by the moving words from the victims‚Äô families offering God‚Äôs forgiveness and love in the face of such horrible suffering,‚Äù the family said. Immediately after the hearing, court officials released Roof‚Äôs arrest warrants, which provided chilling new details on how all nine were shot during a prayer group meeting at the historic Emanuel AME church in downtown Charleston. Roof was seen on security camera footage entering the church on Wednesday night, at 8:06pm, the warrants said. He spent an hour studying with the dozen parishioners in the Bible study room and then opened fire, striking each victim ‚Äúmultiple times‚Äù. ‚ÄúPrior to leaving the Bible study room he stood over a witness to be named later and uttered a racially inflammatory statement to the witness,‚Äù the warrant states. After a manhunt, Roof was identified to police by both his father and uncle, who recognized him and his car from photographs distributed to the public by police. Roof‚Äôs father confirmed to police that his son owned a .45 caliber handgun, which he was seen carrying out of the church shortly after 9pm on Wednesday. Investigators stated in the warrant that .45 caliber shell casings were recovered in the church. On Friday afternoon, the US justice department announced it is investigating whether the church shooting could be a hate crime or an act of domestic terror. On Thursday, the attorney general, Loretta Lynch, had described the massacre as a ‚Äúbarbaric crime‚Äù, and said it was being looked at as a hate crime. ‚ÄúActs like this have no place in our country and in a civilized society,‚Äù Lynch said in Washington. Roof‚Äôs homicide charges make him eligible for the death penalty, for which South Carolina‚Äôs Governor Nikki Haley advocated during a visit to Charleston on Friday. Earlier in the day, the NAACP national president, Cornell William Brooks, condemned the church attack as a hate crime. ‚ÄúThis was an act of racial terrorism and must be treated as such,‚Äù Brooks said in an emotional press conference of his own. Brooks, who spent time in Charleston as a child as both his grandfather and uncle owned barbershops nearby, said the state and the US as a whole needed to examine the underlying racial hatred that fuelled Roof‚Äôs crime. He made particular note of the Confederate flag flying above the South Carolina state house. ‚ÄúSome will assert that the Confederate flag is merely a symbol of years gone by, a symbol of heritage, not hate. But when we see that symbol lifted up as an emblem of hate ‚Ä¶ as an inspiration of violence, that symbol has to come down.‚Äù Tensions over the flag have been renewed since the shooting, and local politicians were preparing legislation to have it removed. On Friday morning, the Republican presidential candidate and South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham attempted to distance Roof‚Äôs actions from the flag‚Äôs prominent position in South Carolina politics. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to give this guy an excuse about a book he might have read or a movie he watched or a song he listened to or a symbol out anywhere. It‚Äôs him ‚Ä¶ not the flag,‚Äù Graham told CNN. The senator was present at a vigil, later on Friday, when hundreds of people cheered and applauded at repeated calls for the flag to be removed from state buildings. There was a loud expression of support from Nelson B Rivers, from the National Action Network civil rights group, who compared calls for the flag to be taken down for the legislation to introduce body cameras in the aftermath of Walter Scott‚Äôs death. ‚ÄúWalter Scott got killed and the paradigm shifted, and then all of a sudden what couldn‚Äôt be done became a done deal,‚Äù he said. Amid a rising a cacophony of supportive shouting, Rivers called on lawmakers in the auditorium: ‚ÄúYou will take that flag down, you will taken it down!‚Äù Graham, who sat impassively, later told the Guardian he welcomed the debate, although declined to take a firm position. ‚ÄúThere are graveyards of confederate soldiers all over the state ‚Äì what do we do? How much of revisiting ones past is going to take before we can move forward?‚Äù Graham and South Carolina‚Äôs other senator, Tim Scott ‚Äì also a Republican ‚Äì both remained seated during standing ovations following calls for a ‚Äúrational conversation‚Äù about gun rights in America. Charleston‚Äôs mayor, Joseph P Riley, said he did not want to inject any kind of politics into the situation, but added: ‚ÄúNine people died, because of this crazed man, with obviously easy access to a handgun,‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is complicated, and the right to bear arms is ingrained in the Constitution and life in America, but we can‚Äôt just forget about this and we must encourage a national discussion. There has got to be a better way.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to live in a country where you need a security guard for Bible study.‚Äù Further vigils to mourn the nine murdered church members were planned to continue in Charleston and throughout the US through the weekend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T22:04:18Z,world,World news,Obama on Charleston shooting: 'I refuse to act as if this is the new normal' ‚Äì live updates,"Here‚Äôs a final summary for today: Dylann Roof, the 21-year-old suspect appeared at an emotional bond hearing in Charleston at 2pm ET. Though only 13 minutes long, we heard from the judge, the suspect himself and the victim‚Äôs families who offered Roof forgiveness. New details of the shooting emerged on Friday afternoon, as the arrest warrants were released to the public. NAACP national president Cornell William Brooks called the shooting an ‚Äúact of racial terrorism‚Äù in a powerful speech on Friday. He also said that the confederate flag ‚Äúmust come down‚Äù from the South Carolina state capitol. Meanwhile, Rick Perry has called the massacre a ‚Äúdrug-induced accident‚Äù.

2015-06-19T21:58:27Z,world,World news,'He was my hero': Charleston mother hails 26-year-old killed shielding victims,"Tywanza Sanders, 26, the youngest victim of the deadly shooting at the Emanuel AME church in Charleston, died trying to shield the oldest victim, his great aunt Susie Jackson, 87, from the barrel of a gun. That simple act of courage has emerged as perhaps the enduring image of the victims‚Äô resilience in the face of the hatred unleashed by the shooter on Wednesday night. At about 9pm that night, as the Bible studies class attended by Sanders, Jackson, and 10 other church regulars drew to a close, a stranger who had walked into their midst about an hour previously pulled out a gun. Dylann Roof, 21, is charged with murdering nine of the congregants, each of the deceased shot multiple times. The description of Roof‚Äôs alleged offences released by the Charleston police department on Friday suggests that he stood over one of the survivors of the attack ‚Äúand uttered a racially inflammatory statement‚Äù. Sanders‚Äô actions stand in stark contrast to the alleged racial animosity of his assailant. Accounts originating from the three survivors of the attack indicate that the young man remained strikingly calm as he tried to talk the shooter out of what he was about to do. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to do this,‚Äù Sanders said. When the shooter moved to pull the trigger anyway, saying he was going to kill everyone in the room, Sanders is said to have leapt in front of the gun, putting himself between the firearm and his great aunt. He took the first bullet, but the killer reloaded and they both died. Sanders‚Äô mother, Felicia Sanders, was also at the Bible studies meeting on Wednesday. She survived by playing dead. At Roof‚Äôs bond hearing on Friday she put the loss of her child in the most simple terms. ‚ÄúTywanza is my son, but he was my hero.‚Äù To Roof, she said: ‚ÄúWe welcomed you Wednesday night in our bible study with open arms. You have killed some of the most beautifullest people that I know. Every fiber in my body hurts ‚Äì I will never be the same.‚Äù There were four members of the Sanders extended family in the basement of the Mother Emanuel church that night. In addition to Tywanza Sanders and Susie Jackson who died, and Felicia Sanders who survived, another family member Ethel Lance, 70, was also killed. By Friday a deep sense of shock had settled over the Sanders family home, a classic Charleston wooden house with porch just a few blocks away from the scene of the shooting. Most of the family was grieving behind closed doors, but Tywanza‚Äôs cousin Horace Taylor, 33, took time to recall for the Guardian the ‚Äústandup guy‚Äù that he had been. Taylor said that his cousin was ‚Äúalways speaking positive, he was always with a smile on his face. Though he was younger than me, I looked up at him as my big cousin.‚Äù He said that Sanders had an entrepreneurial bent, and was forever seeking the next venture that would allow him to better himself and support his large extended family. He worked two jobs ‚Äì cutting hair in a barber shop in North Charleston and working in a restaurant kitchen. In his spare time he wrote rap lyrics and poetry. ‚ÄúWhile other kids fall into drugs and shit, he was just trying to find another way to make a better life for all of us,‚Äù Sanders said. That same concern to do the right thing was on display on Wednesday night, Taylor added. ‚ÄúTywanza tried to save my grandma. He tried to protect everybody else from those bullets. I‚Äôm pretty sure he knew he wasn‚Äôt going to make it, but he still did his best to save others. That‚Äôs the man he was.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T21:41:40Z,world,World news,Police crack down on activists on eve of London austerity march,"Police have launched a crackdown on activists previously linked to direct action protests before what is expected to be the largest anti-austerity demonstration of the year.
At least three activists arrested on suspicion of offences at earlier demonstrations have been handed fresh bail conditions forbidding them from attending the protest march on Saturday, sources have told the Guardian. A fourth activist was arrested on suspicion of offences at an anti-gentrification protest in Brixton in April and released on bail under similar conditions. A fifth attended a police station voluntarily and was not arrested. Officers are believed to be hunting two more. Critics have accused the police of staging a politically motivated crackdown before more than 65,000 people are expected to gather in the City for a march against the government‚Äôs austerity agenda. The moves by the Metropolitan police are being seen as an attempt to thwart direct action during the demonstration. In the past year, groups campaigning against austerity and the gentrification of London have gained widespread coverage with a number of stunts. Lisa McKenzie, an activist with Class War, an anarchist group, said: ‚ÄúThere seems to be a massive crackdown. There is some sort of political motivation behind all of this. This is not the Met police; they haven‚Äôt got the brains. I think there‚Äôs a political motivation to stop this wave of direct action going on all across the city.‚Äù
A spokesman for Liberty, the human rights group, said: ‚ÄúWe have seen bail conditions abused by the police in the past to impede the right to protest of people neither charged nor convicted of a related criminal offence. The whole question of lengthy police bail when used as a restriction on protest and even on journalism needs urgent parliamentary attention.‚Äù Police targeted activists from groups including the Brick Lane Debates, the London Black Revolutionaries and Squatters and Homeless Autonomy. The latter group have been behind a wave of occupations of empty buildings in central London. Saturday‚Äôs march, organised by the People‚Äôs Assembly Against Austerity, will begin outside the Bank of England on Threadneedle Street and end in a Parliament Square rally. This week‚Äôs arrests follow an article in the last edition of the Mail on Sunday which accused activists of planning violent disruption to the march. The paper sent two reporters to a Brick Lane Debates meeting in Dalston, east London, where it said it uncovered a ‚Äúriot plot‚Äù by activists who were planning to turn the peaceful demonstration ‚Äúinto a rampage‚Äù. One of the arrested activists told the Guardian that the MoS story was mentioned in his interview with police. He was released without charge after being arrested on suspicion of violent disorder outside Downing Street during a demonstration in May. Katya Nasim, a Brick Lane Debates activist who was named in the story, denied its allegations. She has made a complaint directly to the newspaper after it claimed she called for demonstrators to storm a stage set up for the rally. ‚ÄúNo one proposed at the meeting storming the stage,‚Äù said Nasim. ‚ÄúWe welcome Saturday‚Äôs People‚Äôs Assembly demonstration, it looks set to be a massive expression of discontent. ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a long history of the rightwing media misreporting and misrepresenting the left and leftwing campaigns. I think it‚Äôs politically motivated. In the runup to big demonstrations, it‚Äôs quite a classic scenario: the scaremongering in the media and the intimidation of activists.‚Äù Arnie Hill, of the London Black Revolutionaries, who was mentioned in the same Mail on Sunday story, dismissed the newspaper‚Äôs implication that it had infiltrated a secret planning meeting of the far-left. ‚ÄúThe meeting itself was a public meeting. It was not a conspiratorial meeting as they say,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAll we were talking about was how to make the demonstration more effective.‚Äù Hill said the paper had recycled untrue claims about his involvement in earlier protests. He has complained directly to the paper and is preparing to take up the issue with the Independent Press Standards Organisation. Neither Nasim nor Hill were among those arrested. The Metropolitan police said it did not comment on bail arrangements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T20:47:18Z,world,World news,Rick Perry calls Charleston church shooting an 'accident',"Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry on Friday suggested the fatal shooting of nine black people at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, by a white male was a drug-induced ‚Äúaccident‚Äù.
The former Texas governor was asked about the mass shooting at Emanuel AME church during an interview with the conservative NewsmaxTV. A spokesman for Perry later clarified that the Republican presidential candidate meant to say ‚Äúincident,‚Äù but the soundbyte drew immediate attention and backlash. Perry, who announced this month that he is running for president again after a failed bid in 2012, said he didn‚Äôt know if the tragedy was an ‚Äúact of terror‚Äù, but acknowledged it was ‚Äúa crime of hate‚Äù. But Perry then pivoted to what he called the ‚Äúreal issue to be talked about‚Äù ‚Äì drugs. ‚ÄúIt seems to me ‚Äì again, without having all the details about this one ‚Äì that these individuals have been medicated. And there may be a real issue in this country, from the standpoint of these drugs, and how they‚Äôre used,‚Äù Perry said. Some acquaintances of Dylann Storm Roof, the 21-year-old gunman in the Charleston killings, have said he used drugs ‚Äì a detail that has been seized upon by conservative conspiracy websites such as Infowars.
But Roof, who was apprehended in North Carolina on Thursday, has confirmed that the killings were both premeditated and racially motivated. The shooting suspect told authorities he wanted to ‚Äústart a race war‚Äù, after confessing to attending Bible study with the victims and then opening fire. In addition to steering the conversation away from race and terrorism, Perry also accused Barack Obama of trying to take firearms away from the American people by pushing for stricter gun laws in the wake of mass shootings like the one in Charleston. ‚ÄúThis is the MO of this administration, any time there is an accident like this, the president is clear. He doesn‚Äôt like for Americans to have guns and so he uses every opportunity, this being another one, to basically go parrot that message,‚Äù Perry said. He added that pushing gun control was a ‚Äúknee-jerk reaction‚Äù that would do little to change gun violence ‚Äúas long as evil and cowardice is alive in the world‚Äù. Perry said he wasn‚Äôt ready to point to any policy changes that could prevent another Charleston, and said it was up to South Carolina to decide if the Confederate flag should continue to fly on the grounds of the state capitol in Columbia.
Other Republican presidential hopefuls have not explicitly discussed guns in relation to the Charleston massacre, but have cautioned that new laws are not the answer. The New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, who is weighing a presidential bid but has not officially declared himself a candidate, told a conservative gathering on Friday morning that laws would not be able to prevent what happened in Charleston. ‚ÄúThis type of conduct is something that only our display of our own love and good faith that is in our heart can change ‚Äì laws can‚Äôt change this,‚Äù Christie said during a speech at the Faith and Freedom Coalition conference in Washington, DC, an event that draws a largely evangelical audience. ‚ÄúOnly the goodwill and love of the American people can let those folks know that that act was unacceptable, disgraceful.‚Äù Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor who formally launched his presidential campaign this week, mourned the Charleston victims at the same conference but did not get into any policy implications. ‚ÄúThey were praying. They were learning and studying the word of the Lord,‚Äù Bush said on Friday. ‚ÄúIn times like these, in times of great of national mourning, people of faith, all of us must come together and at least reflect on this and fortify our strength and love of Christ, love of God to be able to continue to go forth.‚Äù Bush was also reticent to discuss race when a reporter at the Huffington Post asked him if the shooting was racially motivated. ‚ÄúIt was a horrific act and I don‚Äôt know what the background of it is, but it was an act of hatred,‚Äù Bush said, although he acknowledged the role played by race when asked again.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Looks like to me it was, but we‚Äôll find out all the information,‚Äù Bush said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear it was an act of raw hatred, for sure. Nine people lost their lives, and they were African American. You can judge what it is.‚Äù The Charleston shooting is being investigated as a hate crime or an act of domestic terrorism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T20:22:18Z,world,World news,A day without Haitians as vendors stay clear of Dominican marketplace,"Avenida Duarte in the Dominican capital is a busy bustling commercial street where hundreds of vendors ‚Äì both Dominican and Haitian ‚Äì normally clog the sidewalks selling everything from clothes to hot dogs. On Friday, however, a day after the window for undocumented migrants to apply for residency permits closed, the only salesmen and women working were Dominicans.
This week saw the final deadline for the Dominican government‚Äôs ‚Äúregularization plan‚Äù for residents of the country without documents ‚Äì most of whom are Haitian or Dominicans of Haitian descent. Dominican authorities are now prepared to deport those who did not register. Daniel, 33, a Haitian immigrant, usually sets up his water and soft drinks stall on Duarte early. But he‚Äôs too afraid to be seen there now after being unable to register. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared to go back and sell because they might pick me up and send me home. I don‚Äôt want to be separated from my family,‚Äù said Daniel, whose two children were born in the Dominican Republic. ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt know what to do, except stay home until we know what the government‚Äôs going to do.‚Äù Others, who like Daniel, were unable to register because of bureaucratic delays, have decided not to wait for the police or military to round them up and repatriate them forcibly, with reports of buses filled with Haitians heading toward the border. ‚ÄúWe know of many people who‚Äôve decided to leave already,‚Äù says Ana Geraldo, a lawyer at Centro Bono, which works with Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent. An informal survey of the centre‚Äôs users showed that some 200 buses per day have been leaving Santo Domingo for the border with people going back to Haiti for the past week. But people born in the Dominican Republic to undocumented migrants say they have no reason to leave. For decades, the Dominican Republic recognized the children of Haitian migrants born in the country as Dominican citizens but they were rendered stateless by a 2013 ruling of the Dominican constitutional court and now risk being deported to a country where they have no citizenship or familial bonds. Elena Lorac, 26, is one of the lucky ones. Lorac, who is studying to become a social worker, was born in the Domincan Republic of Haitian parents, but only received her identity card on Monday. ‚ÄúI was born here and the government has been threatening to deport me,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúFor months, I‚Äôve had to live in fear that they will deport me to Haiti ‚Äì a country I don‚Äôt know and have never been to. This is my country and they want to deny it to me.‚Äù On Friday the UN High Commission for Refugees urged Dominican authorities not to deport Dominicans of Haitian descent. ‚ÄúWith a stateless population in the Dominican Republic estimated at more than 200,000 people, the consequences of expulsion could be devastating,‚Äù a UNHCR spokesman, Adrian Edwards, told a press briefing in Geneva. ‚ÄúIt is of the utmost importance that the Dominican Republic takes necessary action to prevent any expulsions of stateless Dominicans because of the human rights implications and to avoid creating a new refugee situation,‚Äù the UNHCR said in a statement. The interior and police minister, Jos√© Ram√≥n Fadul, responded that the Dominican Republic ‚Äúwould not accept interference‚Äù on the matter and denied that there were refugees in the country.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T18:38:13Z,world,World news,ECB staves off collapse of Greek banking system with emergency funding,"The European Central Bank provided just enough support on Friday to stave off the collapse of the Greek banking system as political and financial pressure was piled on Athens before a crisis summit of eurozone leaders on Monday. With more than ‚Ç¨1bn (¬£715m) leaving Greek banks on Friday alone, the ECB provided ‚Ç¨1.8bn in emergency funding to keep the system operating over the weekend and said it would meet again on Monday to decide whether to provide further help. The ECB‚Äôs tough line came as a succession of European politicians demanded the Greek government of Alexis Tsipras come up with proposals that would prevent Greece‚Äôs default and its possible exit from the single currency. European commission sources said a meeting of finance ministers ‚Äì to be held hours before the leaders‚Äô summit ‚Äì would discuss plans for managing Greece‚Äôs exit from the single currency. Far from buckling, the Greek prime minister put on a show of defiance on Friday during a visit to Russia, where he made a pitch for support from Vladimir Putin. ‚ÄúWe are ready to go to new seas to reach new safe ports,‚Äù Tsipras said. Russia‚Äôs deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich had hinted that Russia would consider a loan to Greece. ‚ÄúThe most important things for us are investment projects and trade with Greece. If financial support is needed, we will consider this question,‚Äù he said in an interview on RT television. Since Tsipras became head of the leftwing Syriza-led coalition five months ago, he has said the Greek debt crisis will be solved by the eurozone‚Äôs political leaders rather than its finance ministers. Speaking in St Petersburg, he expressed confidence that a deal would be done. ‚ÄúAll those who are betting on crisis and terror scenarios will be proven wrong,‚Äù Tsipras said. Failure to end the stalemate between Greece and its creditors at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Thursday led to fresh Greek deposit withdrawals, bringing the total for the week to ‚Ç¨4.2bn. Greek bank shares have lost almost a third of their value since the end of May, as Athens and its creditors ‚Äì the International Monetary Fund, the ECB and the European commission ‚Äì maintain a standoff over ‚Ç¨7.2bn in bailout funds that Greece needs in order to meet a ‚Ç¨1.6bn payment to the IMF by 30 June. The support from the ECB meant no queues outside Greek banks on Friday, but a European commission vice-president said the assistance was only temporary measure. Speaking in Luxembourg at a meeting of EU finance ministers, Valdis Dombrovskis said: ‚ÄúIt is very clear that to regain financial stability a clear agreement is needed on the programme, and a credible strategy needs to be presented by the Greek authorities showing how they will regain financial stability and economic growth.‚Äù The British chancellor, George Osborne, said Tsipras should do a deal before it was too late, and that Europe should start preparing for the worst. ‚ÄúWe have entered the eleventh hour of this Greek crisis and we urge the Greek government to do a deal before it is too late. We hope for the best, but we now must be prepared for the worst,‚Äù Osborne said on Friday outside the Luxembourg gathering. Donald Tusk, Poland‚Äôs prime minister and president of the European council, said: ‚ÄúWe are close to the point where the Greek government will have to chose between accepting what I believe is a good offer of continuing support, or head towards default. At the end of the day it can only be a Greek decision and a Greek responsibility.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe game of chicken needs to end and so does the blame game,‚Äù he said. European commission sources stressed that for the Eurogroup of finance ministers or the leaders‚Äô summit to consider a compromise, Greece would first need to submit new proposals on contentious issues such as pension reform and a widening of the tax base for VAT. Tsipras has insisted that making pensions less generous or raising VAT would cross his government‚Äôs ‚Äúred line‚Äù and would push Greece even deeper into recession. Athens wants its creditors to agree to a debt swap that would help it reduce its budget deficit without any additional economic pain.
The creditors argue that without such reforms, Greece will not be able to be financially independent, but they were uncertain on Friday night as to whether Athens would table anything new at the meetings on Monday. ‚ÄúIf there are no new proposals from Greece to discuss, the ministers are likely to instead talk about how to handle Greece‚Äôs default,‚Äù one eurozone official said. The IMF‚Äôs managing director, Christine Lagarde, has insisted that Athens will be given no leeway over the 30 June deadline for the ‚Ç¨1.6bn payment. Failure at Monday‚Äôs talks would intensify the outflow from Greek banks and increase the chances of capital controls being imposed. Tsipras has also come under pressure from political opponents at home. Anna Asimakopoulou, a shadow finance minister with the New Democracy party, said: ‚ÄúThere is a bad scenario and a worst-case scenario. Either Tsipras agrees to take austerity measures worth ‚Ç¨5bn, because that is what the Europeans are asking, or he takes Greece out of the eurozone And the problem is this. He doesn‚Äôt have a mandate for either.‚Äù Jonathan Loynes, the chief European economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: ‚ÄúThe failure to reach a deal at last week‚Äôs Eurogroup meeting and the rapid outflow of deposits from Greek banks suggest that a near-term eurozone exit may now be more likely than not. ‚ÄúWe do not buy the view that Greece would slip out of the eurozone without a ripple. Should it become clear that a major default and exit are indeed coming soon, we will pull down our projections for growth across the rest of the eurozone this year and next, possibly to predict a renewed recession.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T18:34:39Z,world,World news,Berkeley student deaths: shock and heartbreak as tragedy touches Ireland,"The Omniplex cinema in Rathmines, Dublin, is a long way from Berkeley, California. But this week the staff there, like so many people across Ireland, have been touched by a tragedy that unfolded in the early hours of Tuesday in the American university town. Jack Halpin, a University College Dublin (UCD) student, Gaelic football player and former part-time employee of the Omniplex, was one of a group of young people celebrating a 21st birthday party when the balcony of the flat they were on crumbled under their feet. Six students in their early 20s died after they plunged 12 metres to the pavement below and seven others were taken to hospital. The injured included Halpin, 21, and his friend Clodagh Cogley: he gripped on to her and cushioned her fall. Halpin suffered a broken back and has had several operations since Tuesday. Ireland‚Äôs minister for the diaspora who is in Berkeley said on Friday that the conditions of Jack Halpin and Conor Flynn, both injured, were improving rapidly Jimmy Deenihan told a press conference: ‚ÄúIt seems certain now that they are going to have ‚Äì and make ‚Äì a full recovery‚Äù He thanked the John Muir medical centre for the way they looked after the two young men and said they were very fortunate to get the medical treatment that they did. ‚ÄúWe have the reports that Jack may have helped save the life of one of the girls involved,‚Äù said Mark Anderson, operations director for Omniplex, who was Halpin‚Äôs boss before he left for summer in the United States. ‚ÄúThis is the ultimate act of bravery and selflessness that would be typical of a guy like Jack.‚Äù
Over at the main campus of UCD, a memorial service was held on Friday for the six people who died, including the three who attended the university. Eimear Walsh and Lorc√°n Miller were studying medicine, while Niccolai Schuster was reading history and politics. They died alongside their friends Olivia Burke, Eoghan Culligan and Irish-American student Ashley Donohoe. Her funeral is to be held on Saturday in California. The other victims‚Äô families plan to bring back the bodies to Ireland this weekend.
Before the memorial service, the taoiseach, Enda Kenny, said the Irish people‚Äôs reaction to the tragedy showed how the country united at the most challenging of times. ‚ÄúThe reaction to the tragedy showed the solidarity of Irish people when adverse events occurred,‚Äù Kenny said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve always had this in Ireland; people understand adversity, they understand death, they understand people being taken away.‚Äù That solidarity was on display on the crowdfunding site gofundme.com, which by late Friday afternoon had raised more than $150,000 (¬£95,000) for the victims. It was also in evidence in the national furore prompted by an article in the New York Times late on Tuesday that focused on the thousands of Irish students who travel with special J-1 visas to the US every summer. These students, said the article, were ‚Äúnot just a source of aspiration, but also a source of embarrassment for Ireland, marked by a series of high-profile episodes involving drunken partying and the wrecking of apartments in places like San Francisco and Santa Barbara‚Äù.
It quoted a 2014 column by Cahir O‚ÄôDoherty, the arts and culture editor of the Irish Voice, expressing distress at ‚Äúthe callous destruction unleashed by these loaded Irish students‚Äù at a rented house in San Francisco. ‚ÄúThey ripped chandeliers from the ceilings, they broke doors and they smashed windows; they even punched holes in the walls,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúThen they abandoned the place without a heads-up or a word of apology.‚Äù The perceived implication that the celebrating students may have in some way been to blame for the balcony collapse sparked hurt and fury. The New York Times public editor, Margaret Sullivan, wrote on her blog on Wednesday that her office had field hundreds of complaints about the piece from readers who were ‚Äúquite understandably‚Äù upset.
Indulging in the stereotype of drunken, feckless Irish students caused huge offence. And it could not be further from the selfless actions of Halpin, which have been credited by the 21-year-old Cogley‚Äôs family as having possibly saved her life. They said: ‚ÄúBoth of them sadly came off as badly as each other. Jack tried to grab Clodagh and helped lessen the impact of her fall. They both fell at the same time.‚Äù In the US, the focus of the inquiry into the tragedy is now on rain damage and dry rot that allegedly weakened the supports on the balcony where the Irish students were standing. Anger in the victims‚Äô home country was compounded when it emerged that the company that built the apartment in Berkeley was accused two years ago of building faulty balconies in another building, as court documents showed. The California-based Segue Construction paid $3.4m to settle litigation over alleged defects in a condominium development in Millbrae, California, after a homeowners‚Äô association sued, the residents‚Äô lawyer confirmed to the US media. Cogley, the granddaughter of an Irish rugby commentator, is now listening to Harry Potter tapes while recovering from her injuries. JK Rowling, the author of her favourite books, tweeted a get-well-soon message in which she wished her a speedy recovery.
Meanwhile,Katie Wolahan, a friend of Lorc√°n Miller, wrote on her blog of her memories of someone who was ‚Äúnothing short of a gentleman‚Äù. ‚ÄúLorc√°n had so much more to give, but his achievements in life far exceeded the time he had. He brought immeasurable happiness and joy to me and so many others, something I am eternally grateful for,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúHe will be in my heart always.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T17:51:03Z,world,World news,Glass ceiling in the sky: Qatar Airways√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ problem with pregnant cabin crew,"Round the back of one Gulf airline‚Äôs corporate HQ, a door opens into a hall dominated by a lifesize recreation of a passenger jet‚Äôs fuselage. Inside, a multinational class of young women demonstrate their grasp of safety drills and emergency procedures. The plane‚Äôs evacuation slide drops into a swimming pool, where recruits practise how to save passengers in the event of a flight ditching into the sea. In another mocked-up cabin, the women extinguish fires flaring in seats and overhead cabins. This is the serious business of cabin crew training school. But whereas firefights, safety experts and lifesavers will stop here, female flight attendants pass down the corridor for the next chapter in their training, and one that some consider just as important: the beauty salon. Here, they will be given exact rules on mandated shades of makeup, hairstyling and uniform. For airlines, particularly at the top end of long-haul, cabin crew have long been a crucial part of the branding and marketing ‚Äì focusing on young, attractive women, projecting a seductive modernity and glamour with smiling ease, but in truth, performing arduous tasks for long hours for little pay. No wonder Qatar Airways wants to lock them up.
A judgment this week from the UN‚Äôs International Labour Organisation threw a renewed spotlight on working practices at the Gulf airline, which demands its crew live under curfew in monitored accommodation, and restricts their movements, relationships and family life. In particular, the ILO demanded the end of a lingering contractual clause allowing the airline to fire ‚Äì or ‚Äúterminate‚Äù, in Qatar‚Äôs peculiar parlance ‚Äì crew in the event of pregnancy. Past contracts had also stipulated a ban on marriage without express company permission; since pressure was first put on the airline by the ITF, the international transport workers‚Äô federation, new contracts have been amended on both counts. One startling provision remains: that female crew cannot be driven to or from work by a man other than a family member. This, the airline says, is for ‚Äúcompliance with a particular cultural norm in Qatar‚Äù. When the news broke of the ILO judgment, many outsiders responded with incredulity that a modern multinational could treat its employees in such a way. But within the industry, there was little surprise. For Qatar Airways is less unusual than it might seem ‚Äì within the airline industry, or Qatar. And whether as a representative of its industry or country, its working practices point to a troubling anomaly in the culture of modern aviation that has deep roots in the past.
The Gulf carrier‚Äôs practices are not dissimilar from the grand tradition of earlier international aviation, when flying was associated with glamour and luxury, and a married, ageing or pregnant woman had no future at American airlines either. Some argue that airlines such as Qatar have built award-winning commercial success and a reputation for service that western airlines now find hard to emulate. Kathleen Barry, author of a history of flight attendants, Femininity in Flight, says: ‚ÄúWhen you start looking at the Middle Eastern and Asian carriers, they are upholding a tradition of flight service standards, and uniforms, that aren‚Äôt sustainable in an American and western European labour context.‚Äù Yet Qatar‚Äôs contractual issues only tell part of the story: the ITF compiled testimony from employees describing a culture where minor lapses earned dismissal ‚Äì with swift deportation from the Gulf following. One serving crew member claimed: ‚ÄúPeople get sacked daily for many stupid reasons, such as posting a picture in uniform, from a flight, your accommodation, having tattoos ... The biggest problem is there are no workers‚Äô rights in this country, so there‚Äôs nowhere to complain. If you don‚Äôt like anything you simply get sacked and if that happens before completing two years with the company, you have to pay a bond that many cannot afford.‚Äù Accounts from past and serving crew who spoke to the Guardian ‚Äì usually on condition of anonymity, having signed stringent confidentiality clauses in their contracts ‚Äì confirm that breaches of formal and unspoken codes of conduct have led to careers being curtailed. Sherin Galal, a flight attendant, said she briefly found herself imprisoned after the airline ‚Äúterminated‚Äù her and revoked her visa: medical staff had reported her to the airline‚Äôs grooming centre after spotting a small tattoo. Like other staff, she claims to have been left in limbo after suspension from the airline. Crew are hired from abroad, and Qatar‚Äôs ‚Äúkafala‚Äù sponsorship system means workers cannot find other employment, but also cannot leave the country without the company authorising an exit permit. One long-serving cabin attendant living in Qatar kept his marriage secret, claiming that airline staff made clear that if he applied for permission he would be sacked. He said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm from the Middle East. This has nothing to do with culture or religion. It is all to do with control. We all need a job ‚Äì that‚Äôs why we are here, that‚Äôs why we joined. But this isn‚Äôt what we signed up for.‚Äù
Qatar Airways says that there are only a handful of allegations, and points to the tens of thousands of crew it employs, and the numerous awards it has won. Even so, the stories remain startling ‚Äì and do not only feature women. Ahmed Khalil, a cabin attendant who had been commended for good service, says he ended up imprisoned without charge for two nights and deported after briefly sticking chewing gum over the CCTV lens in the accommodation building. One European attendant claims she was sacked and deported and told she was a ‚Äúdisgrace‚Äù after innocuous photos of crew in everyday clothes attending a private party were emailed to the airline‚Äôs boss. Before her experience, she said, she didn‚Äôt believe people when they said why they had been fired: ‚ÄúWe thought they were lying and had done something bad ‚Äì you think it must only be rumours ‚Äì but here it‚Äôs happening to me. You‚Äôre living in a grey zone, you don‚Äôt know what is allowed.‚Äù Gabriel Mocho Rodr√≠guez, civil aviation secretary at the ITF, said: ‚ÄúCrew have told me their stories in tears. The fear they experienced they retain even after leaving the country.‚Äù Qatar Airways has accused the ITF of a ‚Äúvendetta‚Äù; in previous responses emailed to the Guardian it said the ITF was ‚Äúvery frustrated at not being able to operate in Qatar and is making inaccurate allegations‚Äù. But others back the ITF‚Äôs claims. Some say they have been blacklisted from travel through the Gulf state after being sacked or resigning. The ILO‚Äôs ruling called on the Qatari government to push the airline to give foreign employees ‚Äúappropriate complaint mechanisms to ensure that they can obtain redress without being exposed to stigmatisation or reprisals, and without the fear of being deported‚Äù. It observed that ‚Äúaccess to such procedures and remedies by cabin crew members, who are migrant workers, may be difficult because of the fear of victimisation or reprisals, including dismissal and deportation from the country‚Äù. It is hard to be sure where these draconian measures originate. But in Qatar and beyond, the airline‚Äôs chief executive, Akbar Al Baker, is a man who wields considerable power. And some recruits say that an encounter with his exacting standards can spell the end. Jacques Nell, an ex-cabin attendant from South Africa, also ‚Äúterminated‚Äù for having a tattoo on his arm (visible tattoos are forbidden at many airlines, but Nell‚Äôs were under his uniform) claims that after confronting Al Baker about unpaid wages, he ended up imprisoned for five nights to be ‚Äútaught a lesson‚Äù. Nell said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a scary thought that this is happening to many people in Qatar and that they have such power to do this to the workforce.‚Äù Qatar Airways has refused to comment on specific claims, although an airline spokesman said: ‚ÄúQatar Airways does not arrest people, nor have any powers to do so.‚Äù Al Baker recently refused to answer direct questions at the global airlines annual summit in Miami, saying only: ‚ÄúI will not speak to the Guardian, you write negative things about Qatar.‚Äù A spokesman for the airline said: ‚ÄúCandidates applying to work at Qatar Airways are fully aware of the rules and regulations prior to joining, and it is entirely their choice whether to join our five-star airline or not.‚Äù
As Qatar Airways points out, its employment conditions are not dissimilar to other airlines in the Gulf. Sympathetic sources argue that it is exercising, to some extent, a duty of care for thousands of young foreigners, predominantly women, who emigrate to work in the alien, conservative culture of the Gulf; that employees need to keep their nose clean and head down and work hard. That leaves little scope for human frailty among young recruits. One who was sacked after being arrested for holding hands in a cafe said: ‚ÄúI accept I made a mistake, but ... You have to quit your job, leave everything behind ‚Äì I invested quite a bit of money to get there.‚Äù Instead of a career, she found herself penniless in Qatar, waiting in the airline dormitories before finally being sent home. There are signs Qatar Airways is changing: the contracts are rewritten, and the government insists that the airline company is working diligently to improve its policies, practices and benefits for cabin crew staff. But a glimpse of the mentality in Qatar Airways‚Äô management was revealed by an email that found its way to the press earlier this year: a photo circulated to all crew of a senior flight attendant, apparently the worse for wear, crashed on the floor outside the staff HQ. A manager lamented: ‚ÄúHow can we change rules when we do not behave as mature individuals?‚Äù Onerous and unfavourable crew working conditions are not unique to the region though. Salaries are low throughout the industry ‚Äì barely taxable at some UK airlines. Virgin Atlantic crew typically earn ¬£11k basic, before earning extra for their flying hours. Ryanair claims its crew can earn up to ‚Ç¨35,000 (¬£25,000), topped up by selling scratchcards, but other studies suggest a far lower average. Its crew are employed via a third party agency, Crewlink, which makes applicants pay ‚Ç¨500 to register and then deducts a substantial training fee from new recruits‚Äô wages. And yet, of course, the allure of the skies remains. Airlines find recruits a plentiful commodity, and ‚Äì when insured by training bonds and freed from international labour standards ‚Äì a relatively disposable one.
In the big international airlines, the continued glamour and opportunity for long-haul flying is a major draw: one Virgin Atlantic stewardess, on wages below the UK poverty threshold, said she had absolutely no regrets at leaving a well-paid City job for the Branson stardust and global travel. For others, the job has become more prosaic. Youth unemployment levels in Europe has led to highly qualified graduates searching out crew jobs. One Spanish Ryanair crew member told me he valued being able to get back home to bed in Luton each night after a series of rapid short hops around the continent. But the catch-all term ‚Äúcabin crew‚Äù masks a long-evolving role. According to historian Barry, the first attendants were exclusively men, on the small aircraft of the 1920s, when air travel was pioneering and adventurous; from the 1930s, when it was seen as less of a risky business, women were hired, eventually creating a sexual division of labour on the plane. ‚ÄúMen became pursers, or senior crew ‚Äì but increasingly invisible to the public in terms of the cultural glamourisation. The image of the job became very feminised: looking after people, serving, looking great.‚Äù By the 1960s, almost no one was hiring men. ‚ÄúPan Am flipped towards women for the perceived psychological benefits: an ability to charm and make people feel at home ‚Äì and then to become the hostesses for this very lavish party in the sky,‚Äù she adds.
Only, in fact, in the decade after the Civil Rights Act was passed in the US did many of their airlines stop the kind of practices for which Qatar has been reprimanded. Women would be expected to retire once married; when some remained unmarried, United Airlines and others introduced policies that crew should be forcibly retired at 32, or sometimes 35. Until the 1970s, American crew could equally expect to get the sack if pregnant. Flight attendants became the branding, says Barry. ‚ÄúIt became a question of who had the prettiest with the most stylish uniforms. They hired designers: Pucci Braniff uniforms was the start of this more obviously sexualised image, all hotpants and boots.‚Äù While Ryanair has only recently ditched its unclad crew calendar, generally life has moved on, albeit sometimes slower than on the ground. Gone are the official weight-versus-height charts that some airlines used ‚Äì although some physical prescription remains under the guise of fitness, or the ability to wear the uniform. But the role of glamorous attendants to project the brand is strong as ever: when, for example, Emirates announced a deal with Rolls-Royce at a recent London press conference, the grey-haired CEOs were flanked by female uniformed crew standing on stage immobile, smiles fixed, throughout.
That obsession with the body and grooming persists, adding to what Barry calls the ‚Äúlabour of femininity‚Äù. Maintaining the look, particularly in a heavily stylised, close-fitting crew outfit, with hair and makeup, can be a particularly time-consuming business for attendants ‚Äì mandatory but off the clock for shift rates. Some airlines charge the crew for their uniform. And yet for all that the airlines might project a Stepford Wife-style passivity, the job has always been more: Barry says the expertise and the safety role was made clearer to the flying public through the efforts of unions and feminists in court cases ‚Äì and underlined by the wave of skyjackings of the 1970s. ‚ÄúBut deregulation and feminism are distinct to the US and the west.‚Äù In aviation‚Äôs global market, social progress starts to represent a competitive disadvantage ‚Äì one reason why unions have backed a controversial campaign by three US airlines to limit the rights of Gulf carriers to fly to the US. Crew in Britain and beyond have been forced to accept swingeing pay cuts in recent years, and more than one airline boss may secretly envy the lack of rights afforded to hapless staff abroad. When Qantas was slashing crew and other jobs, its chief executive, Alan Joyce, explained his problems at the Australian flag carrier to a global airline summit, and nodded to the Qatar Airways boss beside him on the stage: ‚ÄúAkbar told me I should put the union leaders in jail.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T17:28:56Z,world,World news,Governor of South Carolina calls for death penalty for Dylann Roof,"The governor of South Carolina called for the death penalty on Friday, for the 21-year-old man accused of shooting and killing nine black churchgoers on Wednesday in Charleston. ‚ÄúWe will absolutely want him to have the death penalty,‚Äù Nikki Haley said of Dylann Roof, who has been charged with nine counts of murder and possessing a weapon during the commission of a violent crime. He was due to appear for a bond hearing in Charleston on Friday afternoon, probably by video link from the county jail where he is being held. No one answered the door on Friday at the home in Eastover, North Carolina, where Roof lived as recently as March. Lush plants, a stately American flag and a private property warning sign stood outside the property, which stands about 100 miles away from the site of the mass killing at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church.
‚ÄúHe just seemed real quiet and kept to himself,‚Äù said Kim Fleming, manager of Mr Bunkys, the general store across the street on Garner‚Äôs Ferry Road, a two-lane highway that is a popular route to South Carolina‚Äôs coast. Fleming said she had met Roof several times. ‚ÄúI just couldn‚Äôt believe it was someone walking around here,‚Äù she said of the shooting. ‚ÄúThis is not the norm.‚Äù Yet according to a roommate, Roof had been ‚Äúplanning something like that for six months‚Äù. Other friends recalled racist tirades against African Americans ‚Äútaking over the world‚Äù and Roof‚Äôs desire to ignite ‚Äúa civil war‚Äù. ‚ÄúHe was big into segregation and other stuff,‚Äù Dalton Tyler told ABC News. ‚ÄúHe said he wanted to start a civil war. He said he was going to do something like that and then kill himself.‚Äù Joseph Meek Jr, a childhood friend who saw Roof the morning before the shooting, said that, a few weeks ago, Roof told him that he had used birthday money from his parents to buy a .45-caliber Glock pistol and that he had ‚Äúa plan‚Äù. He didn‚Äôt say what the plan was, but Meek said it scared him enough that he took the gun out of Roof‚Äôs car and hid it in his house until the next day. (Roof‚Äôs uncle Carson Cowles said this gun had been a 21st birthday gift from Roof‚Äôs parents.) Meek said he and Roof had never discussed race growing up. But when they recently reconnected and got drunk on vodka, Roof told him ‚Äúblacks were taking over the world [and] someone needed to do something about it for the white race‚Äù, he told the Associated Press.
‚ÄúHe said he wanted segregation between whites and blacks. I said, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs not the way it should be.‚Äô But he kept talking about it,‚Äù Meek said. The comments resonate horribly with reported remarks Roof allegedly made to victims of the shooting. Sylvia Johnson, a cousin of Clementa Pinckney, a pastor killed in the attack, relayed a harrowing account she said was provided to her by a female survivor. The survivor‚Äôs son, who was also at the meeting, ‚Äúwas trying to talk him out of doing that act of killing people‚Äù, Johnson said. She added that Roof replied: ‚ÄúI have to do it. You rape our women and you‚Äôre taking over our country. And you have to go.‚Äù Meek said that when he woke up on the morning of the mass killing Roof was at his house, sleeping in his car outside ‚Äì its license plate bearing the flag of the slave-owning Confederate South, which fought an unsuccessful civil war to secede from the United States in the 1860s. Later that day, Meek said he and some friends had gone to a nearby lake but Roof stayed behind, saying he would rather see a movie. The next time Meek saw Roof was in surveillance-camera photos distributed by police in the aftermath of the killing. ‚ÄúI knew it was him,‚Äù Meek said. A high school contemporary, John Mullins, told the Daily Beast: ‚ÄúHe made a lot of racist jokes, but you don‚Äôt really take them seriously like that. You don‚Äôt really think of it like that.‚Äù
But now, he said, it seemed that ‚Äúthe things he said were kind of not joking‚Äù. Richard Cohen, the president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said Roof was not known to his organization, which tracks hate crimes across the US, but based on his Facebook page he appeared to be a ‚Äúdisaffected white supremacist‚Äù. The Facebook page showed him wearing a black jacket adorned with two flags associated with white supremacy: that of apartheid-era South Africa, and that of Rhodesia, the white-ruled country that later became Zimbabwe. There was little personally identifying information on the page, which has not been independently verified by the Guardian, but it is notable that a number of his Facebook friends are black. ‚ÄúHe had black friends,‚Äù a high school friend, Antonio Metze, told AP. ‚ÄúI never thought he‚Äôd do something like this.‚Äù Meek‚Äôs mother, Kimberly Konzny, described Roof as a ‚Äúsweet kid‚Äù. ‚ÄúHe was quiet. He only had a few friends,‚Äù she said. His uncle described him as introverted. Carson Cowles told his sister, Roof‚Äôs mother, that the young man was overly withdrawn, Reuters reported. ‚ÄúI said he was like 19 years old, he still didn‚Äôt have a job, a driver‚Äôs license or anything like that and he just stayed in his room a lot of the time,‚Äù Cowles said. But Mullins told the Daily Beast that the young Roof had been ‚Äúkind of wild‚Äù. ‚ÄúHe used drugs heavily a lot,‚Äù Mullins said. ‚ÄúIt was obviously harder than marijuana. He was like a pill popper, from what I understood. Like Xanax, and stuff like that.‚Äù Though police say Roof lived in Columbia, North Carolina, he apparently had ties to the nearby Lexington area. Roof had a mixed educational record in the Lexington school district, attending White Knoll high school in both the 2008-09 and 2009-10 school years. He repeated ninth grade both years, but was pulled and re-enrolled more than once. He also attended White Knoll elementary school for fourth grade in 2003-04. The Lexington school district said it was unable to find annual photos of Roof, and that it has no records of other schools he might have attended. Roof previously had at least two run-ins with the law. The Lexington county district attorney‚Äôs office confirmed that Roof had been charged with possession of a controlled substance in March but the circumstances surrounding that arrest remain unclear. He was also arrested in April for misdemeanour trespassing in Lexington county. Additional reporting by Michael Safi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T17:24:14Z,world,World news,Greek crisis standoff: five possible outcomes,"The standoff between the EU commission and Greece must be resolved by the end of the month. Either Brussels releases the last ‚Ç¨7.2bn (¬£5.14bn) of bailout cash due to Athens under its existing rescue deal or Greece goes bust. Here are the possible scenarios to how this may play out: 1 The creditors blink It is possible the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, will persuade her fellow EU leaders on Monday that the European commission and the other creditors ‚Äì the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund ‚Äì must keep the single currency together by agreeing a debt swap. This would trade in in old loans for new longer term ones and has been proposed by Athens because it would cut the interest rate on payments due over the next year. Athens says this would be worth ‚Ç¨2bn and bring the budget into line with creditor demands. 2 Greece blinks Athens could ditch its debt swap proposal and agree further spending cuts ‚Äì but spread over a wider area of government expenditure. At the moment creditors are demanding big cuts to pensions, but Athens says that‚Äôs a no go. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, could offer stricter limits on early retirement, trim other state budgets or extend VAT to new areas to find a further ‚Ç¨2bn of savings. This would be a retreat for him but not a complete surrender.
3 Greece leaves the euro If both sides refuse to move there is likely to be a run on the Greek banks. The ECB would likely stop supporting the banks, or threaten to do so. Athens would have to introduce capital controls to halt the flow of funds out of the country. At this stage, Greek departure from the single currency would not be inevitable. Athens would have a choice: fall into line and hope to scrap the capital controls, as Cyprus has done, or make plans for a new currency. Tsipras would probably hold a referendum before taking the big step of leaving the euro. This would take a minimum of two weeks. If the vote backs quitting the euro rather than more austerity ‚Äì divorce proceedings begin. 4 The Greek government collapses With the banking system paralysed, Greece grinds to a halt. Capital controls prove economically damaging and politically toxic. The government struggles to produce an alternative currency to the euro. Employers are forced to close, creating more unemployment. Riots on the streets split the ruling Syriza party and parliament, forcing new elections and a new government, that accepts all the austerity measures demanded by Brussels in return for the ‚Ç¨7.2bn. 5 The can is kicked down the road EU leaders agree to temporarily supply Greece the funds needed to repay ‚Ç¨1.6bn of debt to the IMF at the end of this month and other debt payments due later in the summer. Athens promises to embark on further economic reforms, to be monitored by the lenders. The delay allows time for talks to continue into the autumn in the hope that a compromise deal is agreed, but does not reduce Greece‚Äôs debt burden. Financial markets assume the crisis will reappear later in the year. They are right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T17:03:38Z,world,World news,Tourists in Greece: 'Everybody should come and spend money here',"Tourists arriving pale and stressed at Athens airport on Friday came doubly prepared ‚Äì as well as sunscreen and flipflops many were carrying wads of extra cash just in case there is a Greek banking collapse. Kees van den Berg, from Utrecht, who was catching a taxi into town with his girlfriend, Martje, flashed an envelope containing ‚Ç¨1,500. ‚ÄúShould do us for a week,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure the risk is exaggerated, though. I can‚Äôt see it coming to that ‚Äì a huge holiday destination with no cash, at the beginning of the summer?‚Äù
Greek customers withdrew more than ‚Ç¨3bn from the country‚Äôs banks between Monday and Thursday, leading to fears of serious liquidity problems and an urgent appeal by the Greek national bank for emergency funds from the European Central Bank. The country‚Äôs government is in a standoff with its European and international creditors over the terms of an aid-for-reforms deal the lenders have said must be agreed before they will release a final ‚Ç¨7.2bn in bailout funds. Athens needs that money before the end of the month if it is to avoid defaulting on a ‚Ç¨1.6bn International Monetary Fund loan and find itself unable to pay pensions and public sector wages. Adrian Lewis, from New York state, who was heading to Crete with his partner and young daughter after a few days in Athens, said he had brought $500 with him ‚Äúbecause I was aware of what was happening and I didn‚Äôt know what currency was going to be fluid. Dollars generally work.‚Äù The family had also withdrawn the maximum amount of euros they could on Friday morning. ‚ÄúThe possbility of a bank run and maybe capital controls was on my mind,‚Äù Lewis said, ‚Äúbut everything seems remarkably calm. There was a bit of a queue at the ATM and a few people taking photographs, but nothing to worry about. And the Greek people we‚Äôve met have been relaxed and amazingly generous.‚Äù
Their view chimed with those of others in departures, bronzed and ‚Äì in the main ‚Äì relaxed, who said they had experienced no difficulties despite the looming crisis. ‚ÄúNot the slightest problem,‚Äù said Andy Birbeck, from west London, who was returning home with his wife and two daughters after a week on Rhodes and a few days in Athens. ‚ÄúWe did anticipate problems, but we probably needn‚Äôt have.‚Äù Birbeck said the family had brought enough euros with them for their stay so used cash almost the whole time, resorting to a credit card only once. ‚ÄúBut from what we saw it wasn‚Äôt really necessary,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEverything looked like it was working fine.‚ÄùJohanna Meyer, originally from Hamburg but currently studying in London, said she felt guilty. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs way too many really mean and ignorant things said about Greece in my home country,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve brought ‚Ç¨500 with me just in case of problems, and I will absolutely spend them.‚Äù
Kirsi Koskinen, from Tampere in Finland, who was about to go island-hopping with her husband, Arttu, and infant daughter, said she too was concerned ‚Äì but not by a possible shortage of euros. ‚ÄúWe come each year at this time,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI love this country, I love the Greeks, and think it‚Äôs really terrible what‚Äôs happening here. Everybody should come and spend money here, everybody. They need it, really.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T16:55:06Z,world,World news,Attack on 11-year-old in Rio highlights fears of rising religious intolerance,"Dressed in the traditional white robes of the Afro-Brazilian Candombl√© religion, 11-year-old Kailane Campos, her grandmother and some friends were walking home from their temple in Rio de Janeiro, when they heard shouts from across the street. ‚ÄúThere were two guys holding Bibles, jumping up and down and shouting that we had abandoned God and that we were going to burn in hell,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThen one of them picked up a stone, threw it at us, and it hit me on the head.‚Äù Bleeding heavily, Kailane passed out, while the two men jumped on a bus. The others in her group helped her back to their temple before taking her to the nearest hospital.
The attack has highlighted fears of rising religious intolerance among the more militant members of Brazil‚Äôs rapidly growing evangelical movement. With new churches aggressively competing for souls and space in the country‚Äôs poorer urban peripheries, many Afro-Brazilian worshippers have felt threatened by the extreme hostility of some of their pastors. ‚ÄúI hope that what happened to me can serve as some kind of warning,‚Äù Kailane said. Followers of Candombl√©, which blends ancestor worship, spiritualism and Catholic cosmology, have long faced discrimination from an officially secular state. But over recent years, reports of abuse, beatings and forced evictions from Afro-Brazilian places of worship have increased, according to Ivanir dos Santos, the president of the Commission to Combat Religious Intolerance. Dos Santos argues that certain evangelical pastors are attacking these religions and their followers, partly as a way of boosting their own congregations.
‚ÄúThey want to make people ashamed to practise Candombl√©, so they feel they have to turn to the church,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut how can you be a Christian with such hate in your heart?‚Äù The latest incident was covered widely in the Brazilian media. Kailane‚Äôs grandmother, K√°tia Marinho, 53, a Candombl√© priestess, launched a social media campaign with an image of herself holding a sign reading: ‚ÄúI dress in white. White of peace. I am Candombl√©. And you?‚Äù A few days after the attack, Kailane was abused again while giving an interview to a local TV station outside the police medical institute where she had gone to register the crime. ‚ÄúThe media only care about gays and witches,‚Äù a passerby shouted at her. Speaking at her temple in the working-class district of Vila da Penha, Marinho said that it had become more difficult to be a Candombl√© devotee over recent years. ‚ÄúThere are people who tell their followers that our faith is a way of worshipping the devil,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey insult our religion all the time and people with weak minds absorb these things.‚Äù Marinho, whose daughter Karine ‚Äì Kailane‚Äôs mother ‚Äì is an evangelical Christian, was anxious to avoid blaming the church. ‚ÄúThe people who did this are not Christian. They are crazy people and crazy people cannot be allowed to live in the midst of society.‚Äù Silas Malafaia, a prominent evangelical pastor, warned against jumping to conclusions about the attack on Kailane. ‚ÄúTell me what kind of evangelical is in favour of violence?‚Äù he said in a video posted on his website. ‚ÄúWhen have we ever tried to stop the freedom of religious expression of anyone?‚Äù Although there is anecdotal evidence of attacks on Afro-Brazilian religions, few official statistics exist on the subject. Data compiled by the presidency‚Äôs human rights‚Äô secretariat shows that there were 39 recorded acts of religious intolerance in Rio de Janeiro in 2013 and 2014, making it the state with highest number of incidents. However, the figures are not broken down by attacks on particular faiths. Dos Santos is due to present a dossier of incidents involving Afro-Brazilian religions to the state assembly in August. According to the 2010 census, Brazil‚Äôs evangelical population grew by 61.5% over the previous 10 years. Over 22% described themselves as evangelical, up from 9% in 1991. The number of Catholics fell in the same period, from 73.6% to 64.6%. Yvonne Maggie, an anthropologist who has written extensively on Afro-Brazilian religions, said that Candombl√© has long coexisted peacefully with Catholicism. Many of their worshippers venerate the same saints, with some actively practising both religions. ‚ÄúRecent acts of aggression have happened as a result of the rise of non-traditional neo-Pentecostalist churches, some of which demonise Afro-Brazilian religions,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not an organised persecution, but a rise in individual cases, many of which are mixed up with other issues.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T16:50:39Z,world,World news,Israeli man killed and another injured after car shot at in West Bank,"One Israeli man has been killed and another wounded when their car was shot at in the occupied West Bank near the settlement of Dolev. They were found slumped by their car on a dirt road on Friday not far from the settlement. Pictures in local media show the car had been hit several times. IDF military spokesman Peter Lerner said the two men, both aged 25, had been flagged down on the dirt road by a Palestinian man apparently seeking assistance. ‚ÄúA Palestinian approached a vehicle that was in the area and asked them to stop ‚Ä¶ and shot the two from close range.‚Äù Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the area near the scene of the attack was cordoned off. ‚ÄúForces are currently searching the area for suspects. This is being treated at as a terror attack,‚Äù Rosenfeld said. ‚ÄúOne of the wounded arrived with no vital signs and the medical team pronounced him dead. The other man is lightly wounded and is receiving treatment,‚Äù a spokeswoman for the Sheba medical centre said. Shootings of settlers in the West Bank have tapered off in recent years as Palestinian attackers have resorted to throwing rocks and petrol bombs at passing Israeli cars. There has been a spate of attacks in which cars have been rammed into civilians waiting for public transport in Jerusalem in the past year and a number of people have been killed. Tensions flared in Jerusalem last year, both before and after the Gaza war, but the city has been relatively calm in recent months. The attack occurred on the first Friday of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, but prayers at Jerusalem‚Äôs al-Aqsa mosque, which police said were attended by about 80,000 worshippers, passed without incident.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T16:41:29Z,world,World news,European parliament accused of 'hiding away' proof of torture by Assad regime,"The European parliament has ruled against holding a major public exhibition of photographs documenting torture and abuse in Syrian government institutions, deeming the images too provocative, ‚Äúdisturbing and offensive‚Äù, the Guardian has learned.
The MEPs have decided that the photographs, smuggled out of Syria at great risk by a defector from the Assad regime codenamed Caesar, may only be shown at an undetermined future date in a small conference room on the parliament‚Äôs grounds. However, few people are likely to see it there and will not be endorsed by the organisation, even though the exhibition and its horrifying images were officially hosted by the United Nations. A diplomatic source familiar with the discussions told the Guardian: ‚ÄúThese photos are a powerful reminder of the systematic torture and mass killings ongoing in Syria ‚Äì the very least the European parliament can do is bear witness. ‚ÄúThe suggestion that a photo exhibition should be hidden away in a committee room is unheard of, and seriously calls into question the judgment of those responsible for this decision.‚Äù The UN in March hosted an exhibition of 30 photographs out of some 55,000 smuggled by Caesar, a former military photographer who fled the country with the evidence stashed on flash drives. Though warning signs were placed around the exhibition, officials at the time said it was imperative the international community did not ‚Äúlook away‚Äù from the atrocities, documented in Syrian government prisons and hospitals. The war in Syria, now in its fifth year, has claimed more than 220,000 lives. A European parliament spokesperson confirmed that the College of Quaestors, a body of five MEPs that rules on such matters, had unanimously voted against hosting the photographs in the large exhibition space with its thousands of visitors. The spokesperson said the parliament‚Äôs public exhibition areas could only host cultural events and exhibits. But correspondence seen by the Guardian showed that MEPs rejected the planned photographs because they were deemed ‚Äúoffensive and disturbing‚Äù as well as ‚Äúprovocative‚Äù. The parliament hosts an annual commemorative event and exhibit on the Holocaust. Organisers suggested removing some of the more graphic images and to open the exhibition during limited time slots, but the College of Quaestors refused, according to the diplomatic source. The parliament has also told organisers that it would not officially endorse the exhibition, which was originally scheduled to run for five days but will now only last one day if it goes ahead, the source said. Mouaffaq Nyrabia, the opposition Syrian National Coalition‚Äôs representative to the EU, said in a statement: ‚ÄúThe series of photographs taken by the Syrian regime defector ‚ÄòCaesar‚Äô present clear and compelling evidence ‚Äì endorsed by the UN ‚Äì of Assad‚Äôs systematic campaign of murder and torture, and are important testimony to the suffering of Syrians at the hands of this brutal dictatorship.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúThis is why I urge the European parliament to turn its words of support on the protection of human rights in Syria into action, starting with providing full access to exhibit a small number of the ‚ÄòCaesar‚Äô photographs. ‚ÄúThe situation in Syria is now a global crisis, whose impact upon Europe has repeatedly been made clear. Europe can and must play a more proactive role in achieving a political transition in Syria, and accountability must be central to these efforts.‚Äù Alyn Smith, a Scottish National party MEP and the lead sponsor of the exhibition, said hosting it at a meeting room was a ‚Äúdecent compromise‚Äù given the sensitive nature of the photographs, and the fact that it would be hosted on the European parliament‚Äôs grounds. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs really important for parliament to host that exhibition,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe must not close our eyes to the fact that this is happening.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T16:34:38Z,world,World news,Play unites former militiamen from two sides of Lebanese conflict,"The militant stared down from the rooftop through the scope of his rifle. ‚ÄúI think I see a fighter,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a 70-year-old man,‚Äù said the young man hiding behind him. ‚ÄúWell my father was 70 when they killed him,‚Äù the militant replied. ‚ÄúBut you know,‚Äù countered the young man. ‚ÄúThey say an eye for an eye makes the whole world go blind.‚Äù That was the central message of Love and War on the Rooftop: A Tripolitan Tale, a play within a play that premiered this week in Beirut. The theatre production brought together former militiamen from Sunni and Alawite communities of the northern port city of Tripoli. It was a rare effort at reconciliation in Lebanon, a nation whose social and political fabric has been stretched to breaking point by the war in its larger neighbour Syria. Tripoli has been a frontline of the war. Two impoverished neighbourhoods in particular ‚Äì Jabal Mohsen, which supports Syria‚Äôs Alawite president, Bashar al-Assad, and the Sunni-majority Bab al-Tabbaneh, which backs the Syrian opposition ‚Äì have engaged in a series of clashes that have left hundreds dead. The two neighbourhoods are separated by a single small road, Syria Street. ‚ÄúI thought everyone in Bab al-Tabbaneh was a terrorist,‚Äù said one of the Alawite youths who took part in the play. ‚ÄúBut it wasn‚Äôt true at all. They are kids like us, poor like us, who have also been deceived, who have the same anxieties that we do.‚Äù The theatre production stars 16 young men and women from Tripoli, who play actors struggling to put on a theatre production. Its story centres on Ali and Aisha, a Alawite man and a Sunni woman who fall in love. It is based on the true story of a cast member named Ali who married a Sunni girl from Bab al-Tabbaneh despite the objections of their families and Lebanese politicians. The names have significance. Imam Ali, the prophet Muhammad‚Äôs cousin and son-in-law, is the most revered figure in Shia Islam, and the Alawite sect is named after him. Aisha is the name of the first caliph Abu Bakr‚Äôs daughter, who was married to the prophet Muhammad and later led an army that fought against Ali. More radical than the play‚Äôs structure and the fact that it relies on youth who have never stood on a stage before is that it confronts the taboo concept of reconciliation.
Lebanon‚Äôs own 15-year civil war ended only because its participants exhausted themselves. A general amnesty was issued and many of the warlords whose militias perpetrated myriad atrocities still run the country. The fate of thousands of people disappeared remains unknown. ‚ÄúThis was the worst thing that happened to Lebanon,‚Äù said Lucien Bourjeily, the play‚Äôs director and scriptwriter. ‚ÄúThe war never ended, I would say, but it got to a cold war.‚Äù March, a Lebanese NGO that has worked on conflict resolution projects among local youth, had been looking into ways to address the problems in Tripoli. The organisation was concerned at the portrayal of the clashes as ideological and sectarian, when it believed they were mostly due to endemic poverty and lack of opportunities. March approached Bourjeily to collaborate on a theatre production, and recruited the young actors from local communities, and arranged for them to take part in theatre classes under Bourjeily‚Äôs supervision, as well as workshops on conflict resolution and communication skills. Bourjeily chose not to impose a ‚Äúforeign text‚Äù on them and drew on their real-life stories for the script. ‚ÄúSome have never been to school and don‚Äôt read and write, so me coming in and talking about character and scene analysis and Moli√®re and Shakespeare and all these things wouldn‚Äôt really matter,‚Äù he said before the final rehearsal session. ‚ÄúThey would have walked out of the room.‚Äù One Sunni teenager who took part in the play threw his first bomb when he was 13. He said of working with Alawites on the play: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to take part in it. The politicians who exploited us taught us that these are our enemies, but I had never seen them or dealt with them. But all those ideas changed when I came down and met them.‚Äù Soon the actors were eating and drinking together and reading lines to each other, and had come to realise that they shared similar dreams and challenges such as finding a job and getting married. Now they say that if clashes erupt again they would not fight. ‚ÄúI knew that if I went [to Jabal Mohsen] I should prepare to die, and if one of them came down he would die,‚Äù said the Sunni actor. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how I thought before the play. But next time I go up there with [an Alawite colleague], we‚Äôll get drunk, and then he‚Äôll come over and we‚Äôll also get drunk.‚Äù He said his involvement in the fighting had not been motivated by sectarianism. ‚ÄúSomeone would come to you and give you a bomb and tell you to throw it, and here‚Äôs 50,000 liras [¬£20] for the effort. We didn‚Äôt have work, so we did it. If you didn‚Äôt have a pack of cigarettes, you‚Äôd do it and take the 50,000. They taught us criminality.‚Äù His Alawite colleague agreed: ‚ÄúIf a Muslim kills a Muslim, he isn‚Äôt a martyr,‚Äù he said. A preview in Tripoli drew a mixed Sunni and Alawite crowd and was well received. Bourjeily hopes its message will resonate not just in Lebanon but in Syria as well. ‚ÄúWe are affected by Syria so much,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI truly hope that this play and the vision and the image that these guys give when you see them on stage ‚Äì Alawites and Sunnis together doing this creation ‚Äì give a message not only to Lebanon but all participants in the war in Syria today. There is so much fear of the other in Syria today that makes it impossible for progress to happen.‚Äù That vision was summed up in a melodious couplet at the play‚Äôs end: ‚ÄúWe shall not go our separate ways, no matter how much they try / Aisha loved Ali, and sacrificed for him. We will not sully our hands, we are brethren / Sunni, Shia, Alawi, they must not fight.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ This article was amended on 23 June 2015 to clarify the the roles of the NGO and the director in the proposal for the play.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T15:29:54Z,world,World news,'Tsipras has a bus full of people and has to change the wheel while driving',"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right, they can go ahead and do it now,‚Äù said Vassili Michaelides, a systems analyst, turning away from the National Bank cashpoint on Syntagma Square in central Athens with a clutch of ‚Ç¨20 notes. ‚ÄúThey haven‚Äôt gone down on their knees and signed the first piece of paper they were given, like all the others. But it‚Äôs time now to bring back a deal. Because honestly, nobody here can take this for much longer.‚Äù After five years of savage recession and austerity that have left 26% of the workforce without a job and seen GDP shrink by a quarter, followed by six fraught months of talks aimed at securing some kind of sustainable future, Greeks are running out of patience. ‚ÄúWe need an agreement,‚Äù said George Efstratiadis, who owns a Patras-based family firm specialising in water pumps which ‚Äì after writing off ‚Ç¨500,000 (¬£350,000) of bad debts and laying off half its workforce back in 2011 ‚Äì has recently hired 10 new staff as business has slowly improved. ‚ÄúWe just need them to seal the deal. Business needs stability, and we could live with pretty much whatever gets decided ‚Äì but we just need a decision. They‚Äôre looking after the pensioners and the public-sector employers, that‚Äôs fine, that‚Äôs right ‚Äì but not if it means this much uncertainty.‚Äù In central Athens on Friday the banks were open, the cashpoints were dispensing notes, the cafes were busy and the sesame-seed bagel stands doing a brisk morning trade. But as rumours swirled of imminent insolvency, capital controls and even bank closures by Monday, a steady stream of people ‚Äì though never enough to call a queue ‚Äì were taking money out of the National Bank branch. ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm worried,‚Äù admitted Dimitris, who works for an insurance company and ‚Äì since he had just taken out ‚Ç¨1,000 in ‚Ç¨50 notes ‚Äì was reluctant to supply a surname. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried because this is now getting very uncertain indeed. The government is not telling us what it will do, how it intends to solve this. I‚Äôm making sure I have enough for the start of next week. Just in case.‚Äù With the headline in Friday‚Äôs Kathimerini newspaper warning that the Bank of Greece had asked the European Central Bank for ‚Ç¨3.5bn of emergency funding to offset some ‚Ç¨3.2bn that has haemorrhaged from Greece‚Äôs largest banks since Monday, some were holding back out of principle. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel 100% secure, that‚Äôs certainly true,‚Äù said Giota Georgiades, who works for a timber and paper import agency. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want to take all I have out of the bank. If everyone did that, the whole system would go.‚Äù But like almost everyone here, Georgiades ‚Äì who had withdrawn just ‚Ç¨30, ‚Äúenough for today and maybe tomorrow‚Äù ‚Äì said she was confident a way out would be found from her country‚Äôs face-off with its creditors. ‚ÄúI am optimistic,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey will arrive at a solution, I think ‚Äì it‚Äôs in no one‚Äôs interests for Greece to fall over the edge ‚Äì but it had better be found soon now. It had really better be found soon. Now there is almost no more time left.‚Äù
Polls suggest that as the aid-for-reforms talks drag on and the country edges ever closer to debt deadlines and an eventual default, perhaps crashing out of the eurozone in the process, a clear majority of Greeks now expect the country‚Äôs leftist-led government to reach an agreement with its lenders: its eurozone partners, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Asked this week by the GPO polling firm to choose between a ‚Äúbad deal‚Äù and staying in the euro, or no deal and a return to the drachma, more than 56% said they would prefer a bad deal (70% also said they believed the standoff would end with the government climbing down.) That leaves the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, in ‚Äúa difficult position‚Äù, said Nick Malkoutzis, who runs the news and comment website MacroPolis. ‚ÄúPeople like the fact that he‚Äôs stood up to the institutions,‚Äù said Malkoutzis, ‚Äúthat he‚Äôs saying look, this austerity programme isn‚Äôt working. But the longer this goes on, the more it looks like there might not be an agreement ‚Ä¶ The more dangerous that feels.‚Äù Tsipras is holding firm against a number of key reforms demanded by the lenders in exchange for the release of a remaining ‚Ç¨7.2bn in bailout funds before the end of the month, when Greece is due to repay some ‚Ç¨1.6bn in IMF loans. He argues that implementing the proposals, which include cutting pensions and raising some taxes, would mean breaking his election promises and would deepen Greece‚Äôs economic and humanitarian crisis. But his problem, Malkoutzis said, is that: ‚ÄúEveryone, the people, the experts, the markets, is telling him to do a deal ‚Äì but no one is telling him to accept the deal that‚Äôs on the table. He‚Äôs trying to find a compromise that means people are happy because Greece stays in the euro ‚Äì but not accept measures that mean he and his government will be out of office in a few months.‚Äù Not everyone sees a deal as inevitable. Stavros Messines, who runs The Cube, a co-working space for Greek (and some foreign) tech start-ups, said he saw three possible outcomes to the standoff. ‚ÄúGreece could become sort of socialist-led country with its own currency, launched on a wave of popular passion after it pushes the EU to the limit,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOr a deal could be struck ‚Äì maybe one that doesn‚Äôt particularly suit anyone, but a deal nonetheless. Or, nobody knows what the hell they‚Äôre doing and what happens, happens. I hope, I really hope, it‚Äôs the second. But there‚Äôs far too much passion, too much animosity, in this now. Everyone needs to step back, calm down.‚Äù Upstairs, Triantafyllos Xylouris, one of the young entrepreneurs behind Greece‚Äôs biggest ever app ‚Äì a trivia game called Quizdom that is on 1.1m smartphones in Greece ‚Äì conceded Tsipras had ‚Äúa pretty impossible task‚Äù. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got a bus with a load of people, and he has to change the wheels and the engine while he‚Äôs driving it,‚Äù said Xylouris.
But while austerity has ‚Äúclearly been a disaster‚Äù, Xylouris felt the government, elected in January, ‚Äúdid not come in with a particularly clear plan of how, realistically, to get what they wanted‚Äù. That uncertainty was compounded, he said, by ‚Äúa simple lack of trust ‚Äì you know, I think if Germany trusted Greek politicians to be sincere, honest, disciplined, there‚Äôd be no problem with a cheque for ‚Ç¨50bn, to be spent on growth.‚Äù But Tsipras and his party are different, said Tonia Katerini, a Syriza activist who helps run a thriving solidarity grocery store in the Exarchia district of Athens: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a huge change: we have a government that cares about the situation of everyone who has been affected by austerity. They do care.‚Äù From where Katerini stands, the main problem with the talks so far has been that ‚Äúthe government has already relaxed its red lines. It‚Äôs pushing for less, on salaries, on taxes ... And it should never have tried to negotiate on their ground. ‚ÄúIt should have said, right from the start, we cannot accept Greece‚Äôs debt as it is. How can we possibly increase GDP while paying back all that debt? Those repayments should be invested in the real economy, for growth.‚Äù A clear commitment to at least discuss debt relief must be part of whatever deal Tsipras brings home, said Malkoutzis: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs still room for an agreement. If the lenders can make that commitment, and if a way can be found to minimise the impact of pension reforms on pensioners ‚Äì that‚Äôs a deal he can sell in parliament, and to Greek society.‚Äù ‚ÄúPeople are tired,‚Äù said Olga Zetou, who works three days a week in a bar. ‚ÄúPeople are just so tired. And getting disillusioned. I don‚Äôt know what I want any more. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid, and I don‚Äôt even have children or a real job to worry about. Nothing is moving. Everything is frozen. And everyone feels more and more insecure.‚Äù It might almost be better, Zetou argued, to ‚Äúdo something really ‚Ä¶ dramatic. Because this really isn‚Äôt working. It‚Äôs better to say, ‚ÄòI divorce you‚Äô, isn‚Äôt it, than to be the one who is kicked out? We have so little left to lose.‚Äù Her friend, Dione Davids, agreed that people are ‚Äúrunning out of patience. We‚Äôre in limbo. Are we in, are we out? Euro or drachma? All I want is a bit of political stability, and a normal society. Not too much to ask, is it?‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T15:28:48Z,world,World news,Shooting suspect Dylann Roof charged with nine counts of murder,"The suspect in the mass shooting of nine church leaders at Bible study in one of America‚Äôs oldest black congregations has been charged with nine counts of murder and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime, police say. Dylann Storm Roof has reportedly confessed to carrying out the shootings at Emanuel AME church on Wednesday night. CNN is reporting that it has been told by two law enforcement officials that Roof has told authorities that he was the shooter. NBC reported the same. The Guardian cannot confirm this. According to the CNN account, the 21-year-old resident of Columbia, South Carolina, said that his motive had been that he wanted to start a race war. Roof is being held at the Al Cannon detention center in North Charleston. A bond hearing has been scheduled for Friday afternoon, though Roof is likely to appear by video link rather than in person. Nikki Haley, the governor of South Carolina, told NBC News on Friday that she wanted Roof to face a capital prosecution. ‚ÄúWe will absolutely want him to have the death penalty,‚Äù she said. Authorities said that Roof was being kept in isolation away from other people at the jail. He was also being kept on suicide watch for his own protection, they said. New questions were also emerging about how Roof acquired the firearm that he allegedly used in the attack at the historic African American Emanuel AME church. Relatives have indicated that he was given a Glock handgun by his father in April as a birthday present, but CNN law enforcement officials familiar with the details said that he had told officers that he bought a gun recently from a gun shop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T13:13:14Z,world,World news,Greek prime minister reaches out to Vladimir Putin for help in financial crisis,"Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, has made a broad overture to Russia as he seeks a way out of his country‚Äôs debt and currency impasse, telling Vladimir Putin that Greece wants new partners to help it out of the crisis. In a speech delivered in front of Putin in Russia, Tsipras said Moscow was one of Greece‚Äôs most important partners, and dismissed critics who wondered why he was in St Petersburg and not in Brussels trying to secure an urgent deal with European creditors.
‚ÄúAs all of you are fully aware, we are at the moment at the centre of a storm, of a whirlpool, but we live near the sea so we‚Äôre not scared of storms. We are ready to go to new seas to reach new safe ports,‚Äù he added, in a subtle nod to his hosts. Tsipras said the world‚Äôs economic centre of gravity had shifted and that there are ‚Äúnew emerging forces‚Äù such as the Bric countries and Putin‚Äôs new Eurasian union that are playing a more important economic role. ‚ÄúRussia is one of the most important partners for us,‚Äù said the Greek prime minister, ahead of formal talks with Putin. His intervention came as Greece teetered on the brink of a banking crisis, a deal between the government in Athens and creditors owed $320bn still elusive. Greece wants significant debt relief in return for fiscal reforms; lenders are reluctant to be generous to a country that has struggled to balance the books for years. ‚ÄúThe EU should go back to its initial principles of solidarity, justice and social justice. Ensuring strict economic measures will lead us nowhere,‚Äù Tsipras said. ‚ÄúThe so-called problem of Greece is the problem of the whole European Union.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe question is whether the EU can once again be a social solidarity hub or it will continue to pursue the path that will lead to a dead-end,‚Äù he added. Putin has met Tsipras on several occasions this spring as the debt crisis has intensified, leading to suggestions that Moscow might be prepared to step in where Brussels fears to tread in order to bolster its influence in southeastern Europe. The two countries announced a deal earlier in the day to route a pipeline through Greece that would carry Russian gas to Europe. Greece can expect transit payments ‚Äì but not until the project is completed in 2019. Putin‚Äôs aides indicated that Moscow would consider lending Greece money if required, though no formal request had yet been submitted. But in his earlier speech at the St Petersburg Economic Forum, Putin was coy about Russia‚Äôs intentions towards Greece. Russia itself is weathering an economic setback triggered by low oil prices and sanctions. Putin said it had successfully negotiated the worst of the crisis and was once again ‚Äúopen to the world‚Äù.
But he too put the accent on ties with Bric countries and Latin America, noting the difficulties in relations with Europe. ‚ÄúWe are following very closely what happens in Europe because it is our major trading partner. I hope that problems will go away and we will continue to develop our relationship further.‚Äù Asked whether Russia saw its economic future more closely bound into a China-led grouping, he added: ‚ÄúWe are not creating a bloc-based approach. We are trying to create a global approach.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are not being aggressive. We are persistent, we are consistent in pursuing our interests.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T13:00:54Z,world,World news,Danish rightwinger Kristian Thulesen Dahl rides high on populist tide,"When Kristian Thulesen Dahl first heard that election-night exit polls were predicting a doubling of support for his populist, rightwing Danish People‚Äôs party (DPP), he burst into song. Cheered on by supporters on a stage in Copenhagen, he led the celebrations with a rendition of the Liverpool FC anthem You‚Äôll Never Walk Alone. Thulesen Dahl‚Äôs companionable choice of song was not out of place in a country that pays close attention to British politics and lifestyles. Last week the multiparty right-of-centre alliance that is now expected to take power in Denmark, led by Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen‚Äôs Venstre (Liberal) party, pledged supportfor David Cameron‚Äôs efforts to reform the European Union. And the outgoing Social Democrat prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, is married to the son of the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock.
Thulesen Dahl‚Äôs success in helping the DPP become the second-largest party in Denmark‚Äôs parliament, the Folketing, with 21% of the vote, sets a daunting precedent that Britain‚Äôs Ukip ‚Äì with which the DPP is sometimes compared ‚Äì can only dream of matching. Whatever people may say about the clean-cut, politically savvy Thulesen Dahl and his divisive anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-Brussels stance, he is no Nigel Farage. Soft-spoken and plausible, the 45-year-old Thulesen Dahl ran on a platform that appealed to anti-foreigner and nationalist sentiment while promising a range of incentives, particularly to the ‚Äúgrey vote‚Äù, including improved healthcare provision for elderly people and higher public-sector spending. Ignoring opponents‚Äô claims that his sums did not add up, he offered to finance increased welfare benefits and pensions by cutting spending on settling and housing asylum seekers, refugees and EU immigrants. Coincidentally or not, 43% of DPP voters were older than 60. It was a seductive campaign narrative that pulled rival parties, including Thorning-Schmidt‚Äôs Social Democrats, to the right while denying them a clearly separate ideological identity. A similar phenomenon is evident across Scandinavia ‚Äì and to some degree, in Britain ‚Äì where the left has lost control of the agenda and is failing to provide credible alternative answers. Thulesen Dahl has now emerged as the kingmaker of Danish politics, with the balance of power teetering on a 90/89-seat split between the blocs of right and left. ‚ÄúThis election campaign has shown that we are a party that the others just can‚Äôt avoid. We are a party to be taken seriously here in this country,‚Äù Thulesen Dahl declared on election night. The political establishment knows this is no idle boast. Some see him as Denmark‚Äôs nation-saving white knight ‚Äì he belongs to the 17th-century chivalric Order of the Dannebrog. Others suspect a more destructive agenda. In a country of 5.7 million people, of whom 9% were born abroad, immigration from within the EU and from further afield is an incendiary issue that has become mixed up with anti-Muslim, or anti-Islamic, sentiment. Denmark received almost 15,000 asylum seekers in 2014, more than double the number for 2013. Like other European countries, it is watching the unprecedented influx of migrants across the Mediterranean this year with trepidation. In an interview in 2013 Thulesen Dahl said Denmark should accept more refugees from non-Muslim countries and fewer from Muslim countries, in effect saying there was no room for more Muslims. During the election campaign he was more circumspect. But it seems clear the DPP surge fed off fears about the ‚Äúenemy within‚Äù symbolised by February‚Äôs deadly attacks in Copenhagen by a lone Islamist extremist. The incident was seen as an assault on a traditional Danish value, freedom of speech.
In an echo of the British debate on radicalisation, the DPP has threatened to prosecute imams such as Abu Bilal Ismail, a preacher at the Grimhojvej mosque in Aarhus that has sent many young Muslims to Syria. Thulesen Dahl‚Äôs specific policies comprise cuts to immigration, withdrawal from the EU‚Äôs Schengen free-movement area and reinstating border controls with Germany and Sweden, opposition to further EU integration (including a possible British-style in/out referendum), mooted cuts in foreign aid, higher pensions for the less well-off and higher business taxes. Citing what it says is widespread concern about ‚Äúbenefits tourism‚Äù and criminal gangs infiltrating Denmark from eastern Europe, the DPP will side with David Cameron against Germany‚Äôs Angela Merkel and others in an attempt to curb free movement within the EU. ‚ÄúWe want an EU where power is brought back to the member states and where the commission doesn‚Äôt rule,‚Äù S√∏ren Espersen, the DPP‚Äôs foreign affairs spokesman, told the Guardian during the campaign. ‚ÄúThat is of the utmost importance to the future of Europe, we believe. ‚ÄúWe think David Cameron is speaking on behalf of many, many states that don‚Äôt want to see the continuation of this madness. What is going on in Britain is to the advantage of the whole community.‚Äù
To maximise his chances of enacting his programme, Thulesen Dahl must decide whether or not to join a coalition led by Rasmussen‚Äôs Liberals. Most DPP supporters reportedly want him to sign up, but Thulesen Dahl is dithering, pointing to the period from 2001 to 2011 when his party exerted significant influence on a rightwing coalition on key issues that mattered to it, but stayed outside government. He is said to want to avoid the fate of Britain‚Äôs Lib Dems and Norway‚Äôs Progress party, which were tainted by time spent in office. But any government led by Rasmussen and the Liberals would be fragile given the right‚Äôs one-seat majority in parliament and the fact that the Liberals came a poor third in the poll, losing a quarter of their seats. If Dahl is perceived to be undermining a weak new administration for his own ends, or failing to turn promises into reality, the populist tide that raised him high this week could turn and sink him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-19T11:30:34Z,world,World news,Children suffer worsening conditions in Calais's dismal Jungle 2 migrant camp,"Growing numbers of unaccompanied children and young people are living in increasingly squalid conditions in a huge makeshift camp for migrants in Calais. More than 3,000 people ‚Äì including children as young as 12 and 13 ‚Äì who have fled war, poverty and oppression are living in a sprawling camp known locally as Jungle 2. Aid workers say living conditions for migrants in Calais have worsened in the past few months with a lack of food, blankets and shelter leading to growing tensions. ‚ÄúIt is much worse than it was before,‚Äù said Martine Devries, from M√©dicins du Monde. ‚ÄúThere are more people and they are becoming more desperate and are taking more risks. Last year people would only make attempts to get on to lorries at night, now there are so many and they are so desperate people are trying in broad daylight.‚Äù
The camp, which was set up in April after the previous ‚ÄúJungle‚Äù camp was demolished, has a day centre that provides shower facilities and one meal a day for migrants as well as overnight accommodation for 100 women and children. However, aid workers say they are being overwhelmed by the numbers of people coming, mainly from east Africa, the Middle East and Afghanistan, and conditions in the rest of the site are desperate. Among the warren of tents, Bahad, who left his home in Ethiopia when he was 16 and travelled across the Sahara and into Libya, said surviving day to day was tough. ‚ÄúIt is very difficult,‚Äù said Bahad, who arrived at the camp by himself three months ago. ‚ÄúWe get one meal a day but you have to queue for many hours for it and sometimes it finishes before you get to the front.‚Äù It was late afternoon and he said he had not eaten since the day before. ‚ÄúEveryone here is always hungry,‚Äù he said. Like many in the camp, Bahad has a chilling account of his journey to Calais. He says more than half of the 40 people who set out with him died ‚Äì either crossing the Sahara or in Libya, where he says many were shot by the police.
Now he is one of six people living in a small tent tucked between mounds of rubbish and an area used as a toilet. As he spoke, a man nearby was being treated by medical volunteers for what appeared to be a broken hand. He said he got it the day before when the police beat him. ‚ÄúThe police are very hard,‚Äù said Bahad. ‚ÄúIt is very tough here ‚Ä¶ the dirt and the lack of food, the police.‚Äù He waved his hand at the rubbish piled up outside his tent. ‚ÄúIt is not what I expected Europe to be.‚Äù Bahad says he wants to go to England because it is safe and he can get an education ‚Äì and that he loves football. ‚ÄúI am pretty good you know,‚Äù he said with a smile. He had been in Calais three months and said he would try for another month then think again. ‚ÄúBut then what? I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he said. As conditions worsen, Devries says there are growing tensions in the camp as more people stay for longer. ‚ÄúThere is pressure on everyone and there have been some big fights,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúFights for food, fights for everything. People are hungry and living like this is one thing for two or three weeks but another if you are here for three or six months, like some of these people are.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T11:11:24Z,world,World news,Flight stowaway in critical condition as police investigate links with fall victim,"A man remains in a critical condition in hospital after surviving a 10-hour flight by clinging to the undercarriage of a British Airways flight from which another stowaway is feared to have plunged to his death. The survivor was found unconscious in the undercarriage of the plane on Thursday morning having endured freezing temperatures over the 8,000 miles (12,875km) flight from Johannesburg to London. The body of the dead man was discovered an hour later on the roof of a west London office building. It is not clear if he was killed in the fall; flight data reveals the plane would have been at an altitude of around 1,400ft (427m) when it passed over the area. Police say they believe they know the survivor‚Äôs identity and that he is 24 years old, but are awaiting confirmation. Scotland Yard said officers were looking into whether there was a connection between the survivor and the dead man, who was found under the busy flight path of planes coming into Heathrow over the Richmond area. ‚ÄúAt this time, there is no evidence to link the death to the discovery of a stowaway in the undercarriage of a plane at Heathrow airport; however, this is one line of enquiry into identifying the deceased and the circumstances of his death,‚Äù the Metropolitan police said.
There have been previous cases of stowaways plunging to their deaths in west London after smuggling themselves on to planes. They hide in the landing gear where they are exposed to the elements and endure sub-zero temperatures. Most are killed by the cold and lack of oxygen at high altitude. In September 2012, Jos√© Matada, 26, died after falling from the undercarriage of a Heathrow-bound flight from Angola on to a street in Mortlake, west London. An inquest into his death heard that the Mozambican man was likely to have survived temperatures as low as -60C (-76F) for most of the 12-hour flight. It was believed he was dead or nearly dead by the time he hit the ground. David Learmount, an aviation expert and consulting editor of Flight International magazine, said the fact that one of the two men survived the long flight suggests he may have been able to get into the baggage hold section of the aircraft, which would raise serious security questions. ‚ÄúIf these two were neither airline nor airport staff and somehow managed to get on a flight, then it becomes a serious security issue. Just how did they get [on the restricted] airside at the airport? ‚ÄúThen there‚Äôs the question of just where on the plane these two were. If a person was in the wheel well of a plane on an 11-hour flight there‚Äôs really very little chance of surviving. You are either going to be frozen to death by temperatures of -50C or you are going to die through lack of oxygen with the plane flying at 35,000ft.‚Äù
The victim fell on to the offices of the online marketplace Notonthehighstreet.com on a busy road. Charles Campbell, 59, a carpenter from Ealing in west London, left a bunch of yellow flowers at the scene, saying that he thought no one else would. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got a family and it‚Äôs Father‚Äôs Day on Sunday. This is not first time this has happened,‚Äù he said. Worshippers at a church across the road from where the dead man‚Äôs body was found would pray for him, the vicar, the Rev Neil Summers, said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very shocking when something like this happens on your doorstep. Coupled with all the migrants coming across the high seas into Europe from north Africa, it‚Äôs just another example of how desperate people are to reach this country to try to find a better life for themselves.‚Äù Johannesburg‚Äôs OR Tambo international airport, where the flight originated, announced that security was being heightened and said the incident was the first of its nature there in 10 years. Colin Naidoo, a spokesman for Airports Company South Africa, which manages the airport, said authorities were still investigating how the stowaways made it past security. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a security breach ‚Ä¶ we need to find out how and why this happened,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very rare for this to happen in South Africa.‚Äù The British Airways flight departed for Heathrow at 7.45pm (1745 GMT) on Wednesday, Naidoo added.

2015-06-19T11:03:50Z,world,World news,Charleston church massacre: 'What happened in there was brutal',"Dylann Storm Roof walked up the 23 slate grey steps that led to the main entrance of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church and asked for the pastor. It was Wednesday, and that meant Bible study night. Security cameras captured the slender 21-year-old dressed in dark trousers and a grey sweatshirt, with his hair cut into a distinctive bowl, entering the church by the main door. There was no sign in the video footage of the gun that he carried, carefully hidden. His father had given him a .45-calibre handgun in April as a 21st birthday present.
No one, it seemed, thought to turn the young man away. The church in downtown Charleston had a history of opening its doors to strangers that stretched back decades. Inside, a dozen regular members of the church were gathered around a table in a basement meeting room. It was the time of the week when congregants came to gain ‚Äúa closer relationship with God‚Äù, as the church describes the sessions. ‚ÄúIs something missing from your life?‚Äù the church website says. ‚ÄúAre you doing all you can to have a closer relationship with God? If you have a desire to learn more about God, then join us.‚Äù On Wednesday at about 8pm Roof answered that call. Having asked for the pastor, he sat down right next to him.
Before the shooting began, Roof‚Äôs youngest victim, 26-year-old student Tywanza Sanders, a 2014 graduate of Allen University, released a Snapchat video to a friend. It provided a glimpse of the gathering in the moments before the carnage.
The video, obtained by CNN and Mashable, is grainy and shaky, showing only the briefest glimpse of the scene. The bible group is seen sitting around the table in a large, wood-panelled room. Books and papers were on the table, and the participants were sitting on folding chairs.
One still image from the video shows Clementa Pinckney, who also held a position as a South Carolina state senator, in a green shirt, gesturing to the others and possibly smiling. At least three other unidentified black people are in the frame. At the far side of the table was Roof, partially obscured by his soon-to-be victims.
If Sanders was the youngest of those victims, the oldest was his great-aunt Susie Jackson. At 87, she had been coming to the Emanuel her entire life. As her son, Walter, told the Guardian, she rarely missed a Sunday service, was an integral part of the church‚Äôs gospel choir, and was also a dab hand at cooking for the congregation. Not long ago, she won first prize in the annual church fair for her hot devilled crab cakes. She greatly enjoyed the prize, her son said, two days at the Charleston Hyatt. The church, and her family, were the centre of Susie Jackson‚Äôs world. ‚ÄúThis is just senseless,‚Äù he said of his mother‚Äôs death, just hours after the shooting, having travelled from his home in Cleveland to rejoin his grieving family.
‚ÄúTo kill innocent people like that. It‚Äôs hard on all of us. My mother was always there for us ‚Äì she was always the one people would turn to when they had a problem.‚Äù
Other congregants at the table were Dr Daniel L Simmons Sr, 74, and Ethel Lance, 70, a reverend and a custodian respectively of the Emanuel church, and Myra Thompson, 59, the wife of a vicar at another local church. ‚ÄúThese weren‚Äôt just ordinary people,‚Äù said William Hamilton, a local attorney who knew several victims. ‚ÄúThey were major community names who had done things for us here for years.‚Äù DePayne Middleton-Doctor, 49, worked in Charleston county as director of the federal community development block grants; Cynthia Hurd, 54, was the regional manager of the St Andrew‚Äôs library, and Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, 45, was a speech therapist at a high school north of the city. So far only Sanders‚Äô seconds-long Snapchat, supplemented by an equally sketchy indirect account given by one of the three survivors, have been able to provide clues to what happened inside that room. What is known is that Roof sat quietly among the worshippers for about an hour as they studied the Bible. Both local police and the FBI have declined to provide details about what happened next.
However Sylvia Johnson, a cousin of Pinckney, relayed a harrowing account she said was provided to her by a female survivor. Johnson told NBC that Roof sat next to Pinckney throughout the class, but then made his move as the meeting was coming to an end. ‚ÄúAt the conclusion of the Bible study, from what I understand, they just start hearing loud noises ringing out. The suspect had already wounded a couple of individuals, including my cousin.‚Äù Johnson said the survivor told her that Roof reloaded his weapon five times and engaged in conversation with his victims as they pleaded with him to stop. The survivor‚Äôs son, who was also at the meeting, ‚Äúwas trying to talk him out of doing that act of killing people‚Äù, Johnson said. She added that Roof replied: ‚ÄúI have to do it. You rape our women and you‚Äôre taking over our country. And you have to go.‚Äù It was not until hours later that news of the shooting began to spread around Charleston ‚Äì and across the country. Roof fled the scene in a black sedan with Confederate flag licence plates, and was arrested, the following day, more than 200 miles away, across the North Carolina border.
By the early hours of Thursday morning, distraught relatives of the victims had gathered at the nearby Embassy Suites hotel. ‚ÄúRaw emotion was out,‚Äù said Tamika Myers, 40, who works at Blind Justice, a local group that assists grieving relatives of shooting victims. ‚ÄúPeople were crying. Some were passing out.‚Äù The identities of only three victims were relayed to families that night, Myers said. By 5am the coroner, Rae H Wooten, had to explain why identification was proving so difficult. ‚ÄúWhat happened in there was brutal,‚Äù Myers said. ‚ÄúIt was gruesome.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T10:36:38Z,world,World news,Stowaway death of man who died with a single pound in his pocket,"The tragic death of a stowaway in London, who plunged from a plane, echoes that of Jos√© Matada, who died with a single pound in his pocket after hiding in the landing gear of a plane. Like the as-yet-unnamed man who fell to his death on Thursday, Matada was on a British Airways flight from Africa ‚Äì in his case Angola ‚Äì and his body was found close to Heathrow airport. Matada was discovered on the pavement of Portman Avenue in East Sheen shortly before 7.45am on 9 September 2012, the day after his 27th birthday. He was either dead or at the point of death due to hypothermia and lack of oxygen when he fell from the plane as its undercarriage opened for its descent into Heathrow, an inquest heard. Despite wearing only light clothes, he appeared to have survived the bulk of the 12-hour trip from the south Atlantic coast of Africa through being young and fit, though low oxygen levels and temperatures of as low as -60C in the unpressurised wheel recess of the Boeing 777 would have left him unconscious. Matada, known as Youssop, had no identity papers on him and no one had reported him missing. It was only in April 2013 that detectives said they had been able to identify him, after analysis from an Angolan mobile phone sim card found in a pocket. This showed he had been exchanging text messages with an Anglo-Swiss woman for whom he had formerly worked. The woman said Matada had worked for her family as a housekeeper and gardener when they lived in South Africa in 2010. She correctly described a distinctive tattoo on his left arm, matching that on the body found in west London. It was many months more before his family was finally traced. In January last year, the BBC reported that his family had come forward and identified themselves to the authorities in Mozambique after reading about his death in a local newspaper. His older brother, Domingos Matada, said he had last spoken to his brother in June 2012, when he believed he was in South Africa, but could not get through after that. ‚ÄúI called others who knew him there, but they said, ‚Äòhe‚Äôs disappeared‚Äô,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect him to go to another country, I just thought he‚Äôd suddenly appear here one day, or call.‚Äù In November 2014, Matada‚Äôs body was exhumed from an unmarked grave in Twickenham and flown home to his family in Mozambique.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T10:30:11Z,world,World news,UN launches fresh Yemen aid appeal as WHO confirms dengue fever outbreak,"The United Nations has launched a renewed appeal for $1.6bn in funds to help civilians in Yemen, as the World Health Organisation confirmed an outbreak of dengue fever in the Arab world‚Äôs poorest country, where a growing humanitarian crisis is spiralling out of control and a massive aid pledge by Saudi Arabia has failed to materialise. Yemen is reeling from the effects of a blockade imposed by a Saudi-led coalition, which launched an aerial campaign in March to stem the advance of Houthi rebels allied with Iran. The blockade has led to severe fuel, water and medicine shortages in Yemen, where the UN believes 21 million people, or 80% of the population, are in need of humanitarian assistance. Stephen O‚ÄôBrien, UN under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs, launched the revised funding appeal, telling donors a ‚Äúlooming catastrophe‚Äù was in the making.
The WHO says it has confirmed an outbreak of dengue fever in the country, with more than 3,000 cases recorded since March ‚Äì a number that is likely to rise due to the collapsing infrastructure and health system. A health ministry official in the southern port city of Aden told the Associated Press that at least 5,000 people have been diagnosed with the mosquito-borne virus. He said mountains of uncollected garbage, along with untreated sewage and heat, have contributed to its spread. Dengue causes fever, headaches and skin rashes. Potentially lethal cases, mainly in children, involve abdominal pain, vomiting and difficulty breathing, according to the WHO. The Houthis, members of the Zaydi sect of Shia Islam, took control of Sana‚Äôa last year before advancing on the country‚Äôs south, driving the president of Yemen, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, into exile. They are allied with former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was ousted in a deal brokered by the Gulf states after Arab spring-style protests. The Saudi coalition is concerned about the growing influence of its regional rival Iran, and has responded with near-daily air strikes. More than 2,500 people have been killed and 11,000 injured so far in the war, which has had limited success in halting the Houthi advance. Amanda Pitt, the spokesperson for the UN‚Äôs Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha), told the Guardian on Thursday the organisation‚Äôs appeal would ‚Äúhighlight the significantly increased aid and protection needs across the country‚Äù.
‚ÄúAs with all the crises we are dealing with, appeals are issued on the basis of people‚Äôs needs,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey are aimed at all or any donors, be they governmental, private sector or individuals, to raise the funds needed to carry out vital aid activities.‚Äù The UN launched a ‚Äúflash appeal‚Äù in April, urgently asking for $274m in funds to deal with the crisis. Saudi Arabia said at the time that it would cover the entire cost of the appeal, ordering the disbursement of $274m towards humanitarian aid in Yemen. However, the Saudi pledge has yet to materialise. The UN says it has so far received $163m in Yemen funds in 2015, but a list of donors that was last updated on Wednesday does not include Saudi Arabia. ‚ÄúWe are continuing to work with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on the modalities of transferring the humanitarian funds that were pledged to help the people of Yemen,‚Äù said Pitt.
‚ÄúOf course we cannot speak on behalf of donors or determine decisions made by them with regard to timing, recipients, or other factors related to humanitarian funding.‚Äù The aid appeal comes against a backdrop of UN-brokered talks in Geneva between Yemeni factions involved in the war that has made little progress towards a resolution to the conflict. Earlier this week the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-Moon, called for an immediate halt to the fighting in Yemen at the opening of the talks: ‚ÄúYemen‚Äôs very existence hangs in the balance.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T10:18:51Z,world,World news,"One in four plane stowaways can survive, but London case is astonishing","Given the number of desperate people attempting to reach Europe by land or sea on incredibly risky journeys, stowaways on aircraft are comparatively rare. But security at airports is usually tighter than at other borders, and the risks of an attempt are enormous, with the prospects of survival remote.
The fact that one of the two men who secreted themselves on the eight-hour BA flight from Johannesburg to London Heathrow has survived the journey, albeit in a serious condition in hospital, is astonishing. While neither the airline nor the police have yet confirmed it, the most likely scenario is that the stowaways would have hidden in the landing gear of the plane, exposing themselves to temperatures of -50C to -60C. There have been occasional previous recorded cases of people making it alive, on shorter flights at lower altitudes. A 20-year-old Romanian man made it to Heathrow from Vienna in 2010, concealed in the undercarriage of a private jet that flew comparatively low, in air still thick enough for lungs to function. But normally the combination of cold, lack of oxygen and air pressure experienced at a plane‚Äôs cruising height, outside the artificially maintained conditions of the cabin, would prove fatal. If they can withstand the flight, the stowaways need to cling on and remain conscious when the wheels come down on the approach to the airport. One of the two men on the BA flight appears to have been beyond the point of endurance by the time the plane was on its descent over Richmond, his body falling on to shops below. US Federal Aviation Authority records suggest that, at best, one in four stowaways survives. Others die or fall in transit; some are crushed when the mechanised landing gear retracts into the wheel well; most survivors suffer severe hypothermia or frostbite, often losing limbs. Thursday‚Äôs tragic incident recalls the death of Jos√© Matada, who made a similarly desperate attempt to reach the UK from Angola in 2012, His body was found on a pavement in East Sheen in south-west London and an inquest found he was either dead or at the point of death due to hypothermia and lack of oxygen when he fell from the plane. Airport security is normally extremely tight, even in places where security outside the terminal is a problem. Airline and airport staff would normally perform pre-flight checks, including inspection of the wheel well, although airlines say security is ultimately the airport‚Äôs responsibility. Passengers and workers face numerous checks. But airport perimeter fences are often surrounded by the worst poverty, such as the shanty towns in Luanda, the Angolan airport from where that last reported Heathrow-bound stowaway flew.
The Angolan capital responded to that event by tightening security to have all international flights followed by a security patrol vehicle for evening departures, keeping the plane‚Äôs undercarriage in full view. That this latest incident appears to have originated in Johannesburg, a major international airport, will worry airport security experts, who have pointed out that if a stowaway can reach a plane‚Äôs exterior and hide, planting an explosive could also be possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T10:15:08Z,world,World news,Danish People√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s party leader demands border crackdown after election success,"Denmark woke up on Friday to a radically altered political landscape after the anti-immigrant Danish People‚Äôs party finished second in the country‚Äôs general election and demanded stricter border controls to stem the movement of migrants. The DPP took more than 21% of the vote and 37 seats in the country‚Äôs 179-seat parliament. On a night of political contradictions, the centre-left Social Democrats, who increased their vote and were easily the biggest party, conceded defeat and Helle Thorning-Schmidt, Denmark‚Äôs first female prime minister, resigned as party leader.
The Liberal party of the former prime minister Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen was the night‚Äôs biggest loser, falling to third place behind the DPP with less than 20% of the vote, yet still looks set to form a government with Rasmussen as prime minister.
Despite becoming the new strongman of Danish politics, Kristian Thulesen Dahl, the DPP leader, held out the prospect that he would stay out of government, preferring to wield influence by propping up a minority coalition of the centre-right while maintaining his party‚Äôs independence, even at the expense of ministerial positions. Dahl is wary that the party‚Äôs image may be damaged by power, as has happened in Norway where the anti-immigrant Progress party has suffered a sharp loss of popularity since joining a coalition with the Conservatives. In Finland, the rightwing populist Finns party entered a coalition government in April. In a speech on Thursday night, Dahl listed four priorities for the DPP: cutting the number of asylum seekers; reintroducing border controls; reforming the EU, with Britain as a close ally, to prevent migrants claiming benefits; and raising welfare spending on sick and elderly people. In 2011, Denmark angered the European commission, which monitors compliance with EU treaties, when its centre-right coalition ‚Äì under pressure from the DPP ‚Äì reintroduced customs checks at its borders with Sweden and Germany in apparent breach of the 1995 Schengen agreement. In a measure of the DPP‚Äôs influence in Danish politics, Liberal leaders have described refugees as a threat to the cohesion of Danish society. On Thursday night, senior Liberals said they would welcome the DPP into government. However, the DPP and Liberals disagree in a number of areas such as health, policing and unemployment benefits. The DPP wants to increase public spending by DKr4bn (¬£380m) a year, while the Liberals have promised tax cuts. ‚ÄúThe coming days will show if there is basis for forming a foundation which can govern,‚Äù Rasmussen said late on Thursday night. ‚ÄúThere are many considerations to be taken.‚Äù Whatever happens, Denmark‚Äôs new government will be strongly Eurosceptic: all the rightwing parties share criticisms of the EU, although none wants to leave the union. Danish media have talked of the ‚Äúcapitulation‚Äù of the Liberals to the DPP on Europe after the four parties of the rightwing bloc last week announced their joint support for David Cameron‚Äôs plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain‚Äôs EU membership. After a cliffhanger election that was seen as too close to call on polling day, the rightwing bloc secured the slimmest of majorities in parliament, with 90 seats to the left‚Äôs 89. The results include votes from the autonomous Danish nations of Greenland and the Faroe Islands, which each have two seats. Thorning-Schmidt said in her resignation speech: ‚ÄúLeadership also consists of stepping back at the right moment, and that time is now.‚Äù Her Social Democrats had fought back from a yawning deficit in the polls, but the party‚Äôs attempts to appear tough on immigration backfired. Sweden‚Äôs Social Democrats have been sharply critical of their Danish sister party‚Äôs stance on immigration. The shift to the right in Denmark leaves Sweden as the only country in Scandinavia ‚Äì traditionally a stronghold of social democracy ‚Äì in which the centre-left holds power. In sharp contrast to Denmark, Swedish mainstream parties have treated the anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats as pariahs, though this has not prevented the far right from polling as high as 18%. During a calamitous night for the Danish left, a sliver of comfort came in the form of the new Alternative party, formed two years ago to champion a green agenda, which won nine seats with almost 5% of the vote. Turnout on Thursday was almost 86%, in keeping with a trend of high voter participation in Denmark.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T10:10:20Z,world,World news,China's Xi Jinping says poverty is 'nothing to fear' after pesticide deaths,"China‚Äôs president, Xi Jinping, has told villagers in one of the most deprived areas of the country, where four children killed themselves last week by swallowing pesticide, that poverty is nothing to fear. He made the comments in Huamao, a village in the south-western province of Guizhou, according to China‚Äôs official news agency. The president was quoted as saying: ‚ÄúA good life is created with one‚Äôs own hands, so poverty is nothing to fear. If we have determination and confidence, we can overcome any difficulty.‚Äù Xi‚Äôs three-day visit to Guizhou follows nationwide outrage over the deaths of the children, who were aged five to 14.
The ‚Äúleft behind‚Äù siblings, who lived in a rural area outside the city of Bijie in Guizhou, were abandoned when both parents left the village to look for work. Bijie is about 130 miles south-west of the area Xi had been touring. ‚ÄúI have truly failed them,‚Äù said their mother, who had been working in a toy factory in Guangdong province, after returning for her children‚Äôs cremation. The deaths provoked an outpouring of grief and criticism, with many blaming the authorities for failing to address issues such as entrenched rural poverty and deficient social services. Bijie witnessed a similar incident in 2012 when five young boys died after lighting a fire inside a bin in which they were sheltering from the cold. ‚ÄúWhy does [the government] only pay attention to this problem when terrible things like this happen?‚Äù one critic wrote on Weibo, the social media platform, according to the Global Voices website. They added: ‚ÄúThe houses of corrupt officials are brimming with cash, while people at the bottom of society suffer and starve.‚Äù China‚Äôs economic miracle has seen living conditions improve dramatically over the past three decades. About 680 million people came out of poverty between 1990 and 2010, according to the World Bank. Yet deprivation remains a major challenge in the countryside. Studies also show that althrough China is growing richer, it is also becoming more unequal, with a widening gap between the wealthier eastern regions and deprived inland areas such as Guizhou.
Hu Xingdou, an economics professor from the Beijing Institute of Technology, said: ‚ÄúGovernment spending on poverty-stricken areas is far from sufficient. More funds are needed to guarantee people‚Äôs livelihoods.‚Äù Speaking to Caixin, a current affairs magazine, in the wake of the children‚Äôs deaths, Ye Jingzhong, a scholar from the China Agricultural University in Beijing, said: ‚ÄúRural society is withering.‚Äù Xi‚Äôs trip to Guizhou appeared partly designed to address such concerns. The ruling Communist party of China ‚Äúcares a lot about farmers, particularly those in poverty, and has enacted various policies to boost rural development‚Äù, the president reportedly told villagers. Qiao Mu, an outspoken academic from Beijing‚Äôs Foreign Studies University, said he was disappointed Xi‚Äôs itinerary had not included the community where the four siblings died. He said: ‚ÄúIf he really wanted to solve the problem of poverty or other social problems he should probably have visited Bijie.‚Äù One step the president could take to protect China‚Äôs estimated 60 million left behind children would be scrapping the controversial household registration or hukou system, the academic argued. The system means migrant workers are forced to leave their children behind when they set off for the cities since they have no access to schools or other social services in their new homes. Qiao said: ‚ÄúThe children cannot go with their parents to be educated in the cities. They have to stay in their hometowns. Nobody cares about them.‚Äù Additional reporting by He Jiao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-19T10:01:01Z,world,World news,Rail passengers in Europe-wide protest against night train cuts,"Thousands of rail travellers are gathering across Europe for a weekend of protests to highlight the drastic phasing out of night trains across the continent. From Geneva to Madrid and Copenhagen to Vienna, train enthusiasts will hope to put pressure on European rail providers and politicians to reverse a decision they say will annihilate arguably one of the most efficient, environmentally sustainable and convenient ways of travelling. Protests kicked off on Friday morning in Geneva, where demonstrators turned up in their pyjamas at 7am, and will continue throughout the weekend at the central stations of Madrid, Berlin, Vienna, Paris, Dortmund, Copenhagen, Odense, Basel and Hamburg. The demonstrations are due to culminate in Berne on Sunday in a late-night pyjama party to which protesters will bring camp beds. Campaign group Back on Track is calling for more investment in a rail network that it says in the past epitomised the best of the European project ‚Äì efficient, accessible, cross-border traffic ‚Äì but has been neglected by rail operators who blame the rise of low-budget airlines for a fall-off in traffic. Night-time services cancelled last year included those running from Amsterdam to Copenhagen, Basel to Copenhagen, and Paris to Berlin, with more to follow.
Campaigners say the companies have failed to invest in the night services to offer an attractive alternative to flying. Features such as restaurant cars and comfortable sleeping quarters for all budgets have been cut. The Caledonian (London to Scotland) and the Night Riviera (London to Penzance) sleeper services, often praised for bringing some of the old-time romance back to rail travel in Britain, as well as Chinese and Russian rail operators, who have invested heavily in their night train services in recent years, are cited by campaigners as the role models for how European operators might make sleeper trains attractive alternatives to air travel. Additional challenges include the fact that sleeper carriages, once standardised and able to switch between multiple track gauges, are now largely incompatible with each other. Campaigners bemoan the lack of political will to scrap the VAT that applies to international ticket sales, from which airline operators are excluded, which rail services say puts them at an unfair disadvantage. Bernhard Knierim, from Bahn f√ºr Alle (Train for All), who is due to take part in Friday evening‚Äôs protest in Berlin, said the EU did little to encourage joined-up, cross-border rail travel across the continent.
‚ÄúTheir ideology is that all train companies should be in competition with each other, so none of them are incentivised to work together,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd within the companies themselves, night trains are seen as a niche market, rather than part of the whole integrated rail network.‚Äù Joachim Holstein, 53, who has worked as a night train conductor for the German state railway Deutsche Bahn for 20 years, blamed a lack of joined-up thinking between the various state railway companies for the night-train‚Äôs demise. ‚ÄúIt is astonishing that it was easier to travel in eastern and western Europe 40 years ago, despite the cold war, with all the visas and border controls involved, than it is today, with Schengen, and the lack of visas required,‚Äù Holstein, who will take part in a protest in Hamburg on Sunday, said.
‚ÄúYou used to be able to undertake train journeys of 2,000 kilometres without changing trains, from Munich to Athens, Warsaw to Brussels, Copenhagen to Paris. Now that is impossible and it‚Äôs getting ever more difficult to cross Europe by train, which seems so contrary to what Europe stands for.‚Äù On his regular routes from Hamburg to Zurich and Munich, Holstein said he regularly encountered passengers for whom flying was out of the question. ‚ÄúSome are scared to fly, others have health conditions and many just find it far more relaxing to get on a train in the centre of a city in the evening, and arrive refreshed at their destination the following day.‚Äù Holstein, a campaigner with Back on Track, said the loss of night trains would be most keenly felt in the summer of 2020 when the Uefa European football championship is due to be held in 13 European cities. ‚ÄúNight trains would be the most efficient, environmentally friendly way to transport the fans from Bilbao to Budapest, but that just isn‚Äôt possible today,‚Äù he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T09:05:44Z,world,World news,"No run on the banks in Athens, but Greeks now want compromise","It was not what anyone would call a panic. The banks were all open, the cashpoints were dispensing notes, the cafes were busy, the sesame-seed bagel stands doing a brisk morning trade. But as rumours swirled of multibillion-euro cash injections and possible bank closures by Monday, a steady stream of people ‚Äì though never enough to call a queue ‚Äì were withdrawing money from the National Bank branch on Athens‚Äôs central Syntagma Square. ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm worried,‚Äù said Dimitris, who works for an insurance company and, given that he had just taken out ‚Ç¨1,000 (¬£712) in ‚Ç¨50 notes, was understandably reluctant to supply a surname. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried because this is now starting to get really very uncertain indeed. The government is not telling us what it will do, how it intends to solve this thing. I am making sure I have enough for the first part of next week. Just in case.‚Äù With the headline in Friday‚Äôs Kathimerini newspaper warning that the Bank of Greece had asked the European Central Bank for ‚Ç¨3.5bn of emergency funding to shore up some ‚Ç¨3.2bn of deposits that have haemorrhaged from Greece‚Äôs largest bank since Monday, some customers were holding back out of principle.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel 100% secure, that‚Äôs certainly true,‚Äù said Giota Georgiades, who works for a timber and paper import agency. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want to take all I have out of the bank. If everyone did that, the whole banking system would collapse.‚Äù Like almost everyone at the cashpoint, Georgiades ‚Äì who had withdrawn just ‚Ç¨30, ‚Äúenough for today and maybe tomorrow‚Äù ‚Äì said she was confident a way out would be found from her country‚Äôs face-off with its creditors: its eurozone partners, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm optimistic,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey will arrive at a solution. It is in no one‚Äôs interests for Greece to fall over the edge. But it had better be found soon now. It had better be found really soon. Now there is almost no more time left.‚Äù A raft of recent opinion polls has shown that while the leftist Syriza-led government of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, still holds a commanding lead over its nearest rivals, there are signs of growing popular unease over the way it has handled the negotiations.
Tsipras is holding out against a number of key reforms demanded by the creditors in exchange for the release of Greece‚Äôs remaining ‚Ç¨7.2bn of bailout funds before the end of the month, when Athens is due to repay some ‚Ç¨1.6bn in IMF loans. The government argues that implementing the proposals, which include cutting pensions and raising some taxes in a bid to achieve a 1% budget surplus in the middle of deep recession, would mean breaking its campaign promises and aggravating Greece‚Äôs economic and humanitarian crisis. But polls indicate that as the on-off negotiations drag tortuously on and the country edges gradually closer to defaulting on its mountain of debts and possibly being ejected from the eurozone, more and more people would like their government to seek a compromise. Asked this week by the GPO polling firm to choose between a ‚Äúbad deal‚Äù and remaining in the euro, or no deal at all and a return to the drachma, more than 56% of respondents said they would prefer a bad deal. Some 70% also said they believed the standoff would end with the government climbing down.
‚ÄúFor me, to be honest, almost any kind of deal ‚Äì within limits ‚Äì would be better than no deal now, just as long as we stay in the euro,‚Äù said Vassili Michaelides, a systems analyst, who had just taken out six ‚Ç¨50 notes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right, the government has shown that they are prepared to stand up to the institutions. They have not gone down on their knees and signed the first piece of paper they were given, like previous Greek governments. That‚Äôs already progress.‚Äù But it was time now to make ‚Äúa few concessions ‚Äì not the biggest ones, perhaps, not the ones that nobody here will accept, but enough to seal a deal,‚Äù Michaelides said. ‚ÄúKeep their heads high, but come home with an agreement. Because really, nobody in Greece can take this for very much longer.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T08:41:10Z,world,World news,Chinese smartphone app adds new feature to dob in corrupt cadres,"China‚Äôs anti-corruption crusaders have added a new weapon to their armoury, launching a smartphone app that allows members of the public to snitch on thieving Communist party officials by uploading photos and videos of their crimes. Beijing‚Äôs Central Commission for Discipline Inspection ‚Äì the agency tasked with fighting corruption ‚Äì launched an ‚Äúanti-corruption app‚Äù, which can be downloaded for free from Apple‚Äôs App Store, in January. A new feature unveiled this week allows ‚Äúcitizen whistleblowers‚Äù to send compromising images of wayward officials straight to investigators. ‚ÄúIt aims to provide greater convenience for citizens to report officials who indulge in banquets or travel using public money ‚Ä¶ who take bribes and hold lavish weddings or funerals,‚Äù the commission‚Äôs website says. The involvement of ordinary Chinese people was key to the success of President Xi Jinping‚Äôs attempts to clean up the party, Gao Bo, the deputy secretary general of Beijing‚Äôs anti-corruption research centre, told state television this year. ‚ÄúTheir opinion and ideas ‚Äì no matter what ‚Äì can be beneficial to authorities,‚Äù Gao told CCTV. A reporter for the state broadcaster added: ‚ÄúAnyone can blow the whistle on any official.‚Äù Xi‚Äôs high-profile war on corruption led to more than 70,000 officials being punished last year, according to the government. The campaign reached a crescendo last week when Beijing announced that Zhou Yongkang, the former security tsar, had been jailed for life for taking 129m yuan (more than $2o.5m) in bribes and leaking secret files. ‚ÄúZhou‚Äôs case not only shows the party‚Äôs courage in facing up to weakness and disciplining itself, but is a strong warning to those in power,‚Äù an editorial by Xinhua, China‚Äôs official news agency, said after the sentence was announced. ‚ÄúOnly by staying alert to temptation can an official refrain from crossing the line of integrity.‚Äù But many observers see the crackdown partly as a pretext for a purge of Xi‚Äôs political rivals. Experts also ask whether Beijing really wants public participation in its drive against corrupt officials. Last year a respected human rights lawyer who had campaigned for officials to disclose their assets was jailed for four years on what supporters said were trumped-up charges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T07:33:38Z,world,World news,"Charleston shooting: vigils and prayers for the dead, and forgiveness for killer","The wooden noticeboard outside the Emanuel AME church still stated that Sunday service would start at 9.30am and be led by Pastor Clementa Pinckney, as hundreds of mourners proceeded to duck under yellow police tape to lay flowers. The horror of what unfolded on Wednesday evening, less than 24 hours earlier, was yet to settle. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just mind-boggling. I don‚Äôt have the right words to say it. Just shock,‚Äù said Marymargaret Givens, a 60-year-old housekeeper who works a few blocks away. ‚ÄúThe way it happened. They were just innocent people. They were godly people.‚Äù She gazed back towards the church, said a prayer for the dead and then walked away. Pinckney and eight others attending a prayer session were shot dead in a massacre that marked one of the most vicious attacks on a place of worship in modern US history. Police have described the murders as a hate crime and arrested 21-year-old Dylann Roof, who was pictured on his Facebook page with the flags of apartheid South Africa and white government-era Rhodesia adorned on his jacket.
‚ÄúIt was an evil that was incomprehensible,‚Äù said Pastor Cress Darwin, who had earlier led a prayer session at the Second Presbyterian church next door to Emanuel AME. As throngs of worshippers poured on to the streets, many in tears, Darwin went on: ‚ÄúBut this community is coming together. Because of it we will be more vigilant in terms of our security. But because of who we serve, we will not stop welcoming in the stranger, because death is not the last word.‚Äù Marilyn Martin, 57, had attended school with Myra Thompson and had known Tywanza Sanders, both of whom died. She described Sanders as a ‚Äústrong man with a good head on his shoulders‚Äù. The 26-year-old, she said, had just graduated college and ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt wait to be a productive citizen‚Äù. As mourners congregated, Roof was transferred to Charleston county jail, after he was arrested in Shelby, North Carolina, earlier in the morning. After waiving his extradition rights, Roof was taken back to South Carolina wearing a striped suit and bullet-proof vest, and placed in isolation at the county jail in Charleston. While the prayers outside Emanuel AME focused almost entirely on the victims, 49-year-old Avis Williamsgrant said a prayer for Roof as well. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just thinking that the devil stepped in,‚Äù she said as her children laid flowers behind the police tape. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm praying for the young man also. We‚Äôre all God‚Äôs children and even though he did what he did, he was just a little sick.‚Äù William Dudley Gregorie, a city councilman and trustee of Emanuel AME, sympathised with Williamsgrant. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not a church that hates,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a church that‚Äôs full of forgiveness. We feel that when you hate, you lose, and you let evil in.‚Äù Gregorie has worshipped at Emanuel all his life. He was born across the street. His 93-year-old mother and her ancestors worshipped all their lives there, too. He knew each and every one of those killed ‚Äúlike family‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt leaves a void, not just in church, but in our community. But we‚Äôll still have to heal. If the sore doesn‚Äôt heal it just festers and gets worse, and hopefully in time we‚Äôll be able to fill this void.‚Äù For others the deaths underscored a starker reality. McKayla Roberts, 21, who was wearing a #BlackLivesMatter T-shirt, said she was reluctant to leap to conclusions about Roof‚Äôs motives but felt the massacre, in a broader sense, had echoes of her city‚Äôs dark history. ‚ÄúThis is where slavery started, and that mindset is still here,‚Äù she said of Charleston, one of the early ports of entry for African slaves. ‚ÄúWhite man, black victims. But I‚Äôm not going to put racism in it. It is just wrong.‚Äù As the day turned to humid night, mourners dispersed quietly. The noticeboard outside remained unaltered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T07:09:43Z,world,World news,Charleston church shooting: suspect Dylann Roof in custody as community holds vigils,"I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m winding down this live blog now, but you can find all our ongoing coverage of the Charleston shooting here. Here is a round-up of the latest developments in this unfolding story: Suspect Dylann Roof is in custody in Charleston county jail. It is believed he will appear in court at 2pm on Friday. So far, there has been no confirmation that he has yet been charged. Interviews with friends and associates of the 21-year-old accused revealed their concerns that he had been √¢‚Ç¨≈ìplanning something like that for six months√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ, and his desire to ignite √¢‚Ç¨≈ìa civil war√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ. The nine people √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú six women and three men √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú killed in the historic black church of Emanuel AME church have been identified. They were Rev Clementa Pinckney, Tywanza Sanders, Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, Cynthia Hurd, DePayne Middleton-Doctor, Rev Dr Daniel L Simmons Jr, Ethel Lance, Myra Thompson and Susie Jackson. You can read more about all of them here. A Snapchat video apparently recorded at the church bible study group by Sanders shows the gunman sitting calmly alongside those he would go on to attack. Vigils have been held in Charleston, and across South Carolina and the US. Chris Singleton, the son of Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, gave a powerful speech in which he talked about how he would carry on after his mother√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s death: I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m probably going to push myself harder in everything I do. Every time I do something good I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll probably give her a little wink or something, in the sky. Love is always stronger than hate. We just love the way my mom did and the hate won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be anywhere close to what the love is.
Three people survived the attack, police said. Their condition has not yet been disclosed. Roof had earlier been captured without incident in North Carolina, after a local florist who was late for work alerted police to √¢‚Ç¨≈ìsuspicious activity√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ. He waived extradition to be returned to Charleston. Barack Obama said he felt both sadness and anger at the shootings and said America must come to grips with its record on gun violence. The shooting is being investigated as a hate crime. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere is absolutely no doubt in my mind that it is hate crime,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ police chief Greg Mullen said. The Department of Justice has launched a federal civil rights investigation into the shooting. Daily Show TV host Jon Stewart has won praise for opening his show with a monologue calling the shootings a terrorist attack and questioning whether the US was really prepared to take action against racism. That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all from this live blog today. Thank you for reading. The rest of our coverage continues here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T06:48:56Z,world,World news,Charleston shooting suspect Dylann Roof 'wanted to ignite civil war',"The 21-year-old accused of killing nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, had been ‚Äúplanning something like that for six months‚Äù, his roommate has revealed, as friends recalled Dylann Roof‚Äôs tirades against African Americans ‚Äútaking over the world‚Äù and his desire to ignite ‚Äúa civil war‚Äù. The killings have sent shockwaves across the US, as the nation confronts a breaking point over race and gun violence following yet another mass shooting. Hundreds of people gathered to pay their respects outside the Emanuel AME Church ‚Äì the scene of the shooting ‚Äì on Thursday evening, with more prayer services held throughout Charleston. A day after the massacre ‚Äì labelled a ‚Äúhate crime‚Äù by South Carolina police ‚Äì a portrait of Roof as an apparently committed racist is building from interviews with associates of the young man, shown in Facebook photos wearing a jacket bearing the flags of the former white-racist regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia.
Joseph Meek Jr, a childhood friend who saw Roof the morning before the shooting, said the pair had never discussed race growing up. But when they recently reconnected, Roof told him ‚Äúblacks were taking over the world [and] someone needed to do something about it for the white race‚Äù, he told the Associated Press. ‚ÄúHe said he wanted segregation between whites and blacks. I said, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs not the way it should be.‚Äô But he kept talking about it.‚Äù Meek said that when he woke up on Wednesday morning Roof was at his house, sleeping in his car outside ‚Äì its license plate bearing the Confederate flag. Later that day, Meek said he and some friends had gone to a nearby lake but Roof stayed behind, deciding he‚Äôd rather see a movie. The next time he saw Roof was in surveillance-camera photos distributed by police in the aftermath of the killing. ‚ÄúI knew it was him,‚Äù Meek said. A roommate, Dalton Tyler, said Roof had been ‚Äúplanning something like that for six months‚Äù.
‚ÄúHe was big into segregation and other stuff,‚Äù Tyler told ABC News. ‚ÄúHe said he wanted to start a civil war. He said he was going to do something like that and then kill himself.‚Äù He said Roof had been ‚Äúon and off‚Äù with his parents, but they had previously bought him a gun. He hadn‚Äôt been allowed to take it with him until this week, Tyler said. Roof‚Äôs uncle Carson Cowles said the gun, a .45-caliber pistol, had been a gift for the introverted young man‚Äôs 21st birthday. ‚ÄúI said he was like 19 years old, he still didn‚Äôt have a job, a driver‚Äôs license or anything like that and he just stayed in his room a lot of the time,‚Äù Cowles said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any words for it. Nobody in my family had seen anything like this coming.‚Äù
A high school contemporary, John Mullins, told the Daily Beast: ‚ÄúHe made a lot of racist jokes, but you don‚Äôt really take them seriously like that. You don‚Äôt really think of it like that.‚Äù But now, he said, it seemed that ‚Äúthe things he said were kind of not joking‚Äù. Richard Cohen, the president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said Roof was not known to his organisation, which tracks hate crimes across the US, but based on his Facebook page he appeared to be a ‚Äúdisaffected white supremacist‚Äù. Others expressed surprise at Roof‚Äôs crimes. ‚ÄúI never thought he‚Äôd do something like this,‚Äù a high school friend, Antonio Metze, told AP. ‚ÄúHe had black friends.‚Äù Meek‚Äôs mother, Kimberly Konzny, described him as a ‚Äúsweet kid‚Äù. ‚ÄúHe was quiet. He only had a few friends,‚Äù she said. Though police say Roof lived in Columbia, South Carolina, he apparently had ties to the nearby Lexington area. Roof had a mixed educational record in the Lexington school district, attending White Knoll high school in both the 2008-09 and 2009-10 school years. Roof previously had at least two run-ins with the law. The Lexington county district attorney‚Äôs office confirmed that Roof had been charged with possession of a controlled substance in March but the circumstances surrounding that arrest remain unclear. He was also arrested in April for misdemeanour trespassing in Lexington county. On Thursday, police released Roof‚Äôs mugshot and moved him from police custody in North Carolina on his way back to face charges in South Carolina. A bond hearing is pending on Friday, authorities said. Reuters reports that Roof had lived with his older sister Amber and their father part-time until his father and stepmother divorced. A profile on TheKnot.com shows that Amber Roof is scheduled to be married on Sunday in Lexington, South Carolina, according to Reuters.
After his capture in Shelby, North Carolina, on Thursday morning ‚Äì after a florist spotted and tailed his car ‚Äì Roof was extradited to Charleston, where he is being held in isolation at a detention centre facing nine counts of murder, according to Live5 news. On Thursday, President Barack Obama addressed the nation from the White House, expressing heartache at the killings and saying American communities have had to endure such tragedies too many times.
‚ÄúAt some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt happen in other places with this kind of frequency ‚Äì and it is in our power to do something about it.‚Äù The Charleston mayor, Joseph P Riley Jr, said at a press conference: ‚ÄúIn America, you know, we don‚Äôt let bad people like this get away with these dastardly deeds.‚Äù
The streets outside of Emanuel church were crowded with people on Thursday night who wished to pay their respects to the dead: Cynthia Hurd, 54; Susie Jackson, 87; Ethel Lance, 70; DePayne Middleton-Doctor, 49; Clementa Pickney, 41; Tywanza Sanders, 26; Daniel Simmons, 74; Sharonda Singleton, 45, and Myra Thompson, 59. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just mind-boggling, I don‚Äôt have the right words to say it. Just shock,‚Äù said Marymargaret Givens, a 60-year-old housekeeper who works a few blocks away. ‚ÄúThe way it happened. They were just innocent people.

She described Sanders as a ‚Äústrong man with a good head on his shoulders‚Äù. The 26-year-old, she said, had just graduated college and ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt wait to be a productive citizen‚Äù.
Vigils were also held across the US, including in Nebraska, New York and Florida. The African American community in Charleston and throughout the US is still reeling from the murder just 10 weeks earlier of Walter Scott, an unarmed black man shot dead by a North Charleston police officer just miles away from the site of Wednesday‚Äôs shooting. The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church traces its roots to 1816 and is one of the largest black congregations south of Baltimore. The Reverend Martin Luther King Jr addressed the church in 1962.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T06:00:07Z,world,World news,The Greek debt: what creditors may stand to lose,"Greece says it will run out of money at the end of the month if a deal with its creditors the European commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund cannot be reached.
The lack of an agreement before the IMF payment deadline of 30 June will not mean an automatic exit from the eurozone. If Greece were to default on the IMF and then also leave the currency union, pinning down the precise losses to creditors will not be a straightforward task. Any calculation will need to not only consider the size of the Greek debt (roughly ‚Ç¨320bn, which translates into 175% of its GDP) but also take into account possible contagion ‚Äì a market panic spreading to other countries ‚Äì and the amount Greece chooses to not pay.
Data detailing the world‚Äôs financial exposure to Greece give an indication of how a total breakdown between Greece and its creditors might play out. At the end of 2014 the three main creditors held more than 75% of Greece‚Äôs total debt, most of which lay in the hands of eurozone governments. These countries are directly exposed to the risk of Greece defaulting, through bilateral loans and the money they have put into the EFSF (the European Financial Stability Facility), which has dispersed loans to Greece.
The exposure from the bilateral loans and the EFSF alone amounts to ‚Ç¨195bn, or 61.5% of the outstanding Greek debt. But eurozone countries are also exposed indirectly due to interventions in the sovereign debt market such as the ECB-operated Securities Markets Programme, for which Greece still owes ‚Ç¨28bn. Those countries are also potentially exposed to Greek banks, which have borrowed more than ‚Ç¨80bn under the ECB‚Äôs Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) programme to counter capital flight. It is especially unclear how much individual states would lose under ECB-operated programmes if Greece were to default. The sum of all this debt exposure, according to Barclays Research, amounts to 3.3% of the eurozone‚Äôs GDP.
The eurozone‚Äôs largest economies, Germany and France, are nominally the most exposed. However, relative to the size of each nation‚Äôs economy, the hit would be greater on some of the area‚Äôs smaller members, such as Slovenia and Malta, and on Spain and Italy, whose economies are still fragile. In Spain and Italy political dissatisfaction is elevated as clearly shown by the recent local elections in both countries. But it is not only the government in Greece to which foreign investors are exposed. And though they would be the ones absorbing most of the losses, the three official creditors are not alone in the list of those who could potentially be hurt by a Greek default. There is also the private sector, led by the banks. After Greece came under market pressure and entered a bailout programme in 2010, foreign banks started to rapidly reduce their exposure to Greece. Euro area banks‚Äô exposure to Greece, which had peaked at about ‚Ç¨128bn in 2008, dropped to ‚Ç¨12bn in September 2013. UK banks‚Äô exposure was ‚Ç¨13bn in March 2008, and dropped to ‚Ç¨4.3bn by December 2012. US banks‚Äô exposure, which was about ‚Ç¨14bn in September 2009, was down to ‚Ç¨2.5bn at the end of 2012. However, data from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) reveals that the potential exposure of both US and UK banks has recently been increasing again. As of December 2014, US banks‚Äô total consolidated claims towards Greece tallied at ‚Ç¨10.2bn, while the UK has ‚Ç¨9.7bn tied up in the country. Even eurozone banks have been increasing their exposure compared to the low points of 2012. German banks‚Äô claims on Greece, which dropped to ‚Ç¨3.9bn at the end of 2012 after having peaked at above ‚Ç¨30bn just two years earlier, were back to ‚Ç¨10.6bn at the end of last year. Although at a reduced scale, Dutch and Italian banks have also seen their exposure increase over the same time period. The aggregate claims of French banks remain relatively low, compared with an exposure that was higher than ‚Ç¨50bn five years ago.
The composition of banks‚Äô exposure varies across countries and has changed significantly over time. In 2012, for example, exposure to the Greek private non-financial sectors accounted for the largest share of banks‚Äô exposure to the country. Exposure to Greek banks has increased both in nominal terms and as a share of total claims, according to analysis by thinktank Bruegel. Most of the US (‚Ç¨9.5bn) and UK (‚Ç¨6.7bn) current exposure is in fact to the banks. If Greece were to leave the eurozone, it is unclear what the process would be to recoup this money. In addition to all this there is the IMF. It holds about 10% of Greek debt. Although Greece is one of the fund‚Äôs biggest borrowers, the exposure is relatively modest within the context of its resources - and more importantly, as the most senior creditor, it would be the first to be paid back. Support the IMF provides is based on members‚Äô quotas. According to OpenEurope calculations, the UK has provided ¬£1.72bn to the IMF‚Äôs share of Greece‚Äôs bailout package. These of course are just the numbers. The cost of Greece exiting the euro goes beyond the currency union‚Äôs 3.5% of GDP. The danger of other risks ‚Äì the price for Greek society, possible repercussions beyond Greece‚Äôs borders, economic and political contagion, and the consequence of debunking the basic principle that the euro is irreversible ‚Äì is far more difficult to predict. Silvia Merler, an affiliate fellow at Bruegel, contributed to this article.

2015-06-19T05:43:50Z,world,World news,Charleston shootings: the apartheid era flags that have found new life with America's racists,"When the old orange, white and blue national flag that came to symbolise apartheid South Africa was hauled down for the last time from official buildings in April 1994 as the country held its first free election, the defunct banner immediately became a symbol of white resistance. For a while the flag made appearances at rugby matches in the hands of Afrikaners unhappy at the collapse of the world as they knew it and continued to hang in the offices of political groups which maintained a futile struggle to reinstate racial segregation.
But within a few years it became an embarrassment as even those who once voted for apartheid governments sought to distance themselves from a shameful past. Now the flag has found new life with America‚Äôs white supremacists alongside the green and white one of the short-lived republic of Rhodesia, another former racist state to South Africa‚Äôs north. Dylann Roof, the man accused of the Charleston church massacre, is seen wearing both on his jacket in a photo on his Facebook page. The two flags have become popular among groups such as the Aryan Nation, which have embraced a myth of the genocide of whites in southern Africa pushed by South Africans unhappy with their country‚Äôs liberation from racist domination.
The Anti-Defamation League lists the old South African flag in its database of hate symbols. The old South African flag was used for two decades before formal apartheid began in 1948. It was introduced as an alternative to the British flag a few years after the two Afrikaner republics defeated by Britain in the Boer war and former British colonies were forged into the Union of South Africa. But as the world‚Äôs revulsion at the brutality of apartheid grew, so the flag became inextricably tied to the system of racial segregation. It was sported by the armoured vehicles sent in to black townships to violently put down popular protests for racial equality. It flew over the prisons and police stations where black activists were tortured and murdered. And the country‚Äôs political leaders faced it as they sang a national anthem that exalted white settlers. But that history, and with it the old flag, has largely been pushed aside by a minority of unhappy whites to paint themselves as the victims today. They cast affirmative action in government jobs and education to give more opportunity to the black majority, in an attempt to offset the imbalance of apartheid, as anti-white discrimination. Most victims of rampant violent crime are black but attacks on white South Africans are more likely to get press coverage and to top up the fear levels in neighbourhoods where some see crime as a war on whites. But it was the murders of white farmers in rural South Africa in particular that stoked the talk of a ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù of white people. That idea has been carried to the US and happily embraced by white supremacists looking for any justification to portray their cause as moral. They feel no shame for the crimes of apartheid and so have no embarrassment about sporting the old South African flag or that of the former republic of Rhodesia, which existed for just 15 years after its white minority leaders unilaterally declared independence from Britain in 1965 rather than be decolonised under a government run by the black majority. The genocide myth has been given added life by the bloody seizure of white farms in the former Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, by the president, Robert Mugabe. The white regime that ran Rhodesia until 1979 was as brutal in its attempt to stave off black political equality as the apartheid government in South Africa. That history has largely been forgotten amid the violence of recent years in Zimbabwe. It was mostly directed against Mugabe‚Äôs black political opponents, but the killings and attacks on white farmers grabbed international headlines and shaped a myth that drove a young white man thousands of miles away and born long after Rhodesia died to sew its flag on to his jacket alongside the old South African banner as a perverse symbol of resistance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T05:32:10Z,world,World news,"Kangaroos are southpaws, showing left-hand preference 95% of time, says study","Kangaroos are left-handed, according to a new study. The finding challenges a prior assumption that the consistent favouring of one hand over the other is a characteristic unique to humans and certain primates. Wildlife ecologist Janeane Ingram said it was the first time a marsupial population had been shown to have such a strong preference for one hand, with the observed kangaroos showing a left-handed preference 95% of the time. The joint study was conducted by the University of Tasmania and University of New South Wales, along with researchers Andrey Giljov, Karina Karenina and associate professor Yegor Malashichev from Saint Petersburg State University, who had first observed the trait in red-necked wallabies kept in Russian zoos.
Follow-up research into wild red-necked wallabies and eastern grey kangaroos at Maria Island national park and Mount William national park in Tasmania, and red kangaroos at the UNSW arid zone research station at Fowlers Gap, New South Wales, was conducted in 2012 and 2013. Only kangaroos observed doing the same manual movement (such as grooming) at least 15 times were included. Researchers used special photo-recognition software to keep track of the kangaroos. Thousands of photos were taken. In 38 observed eastern grey kangaroos, all consistently used their left paw when grooming, bringing objects to their mouth and leaning on one paw while grazing or stepping first on one paw while moving forward.
The red-necked wallaby also showed a strong preference for the left paw, with one interesting exception. Ingram said there was a common presumption that kangaroos only graze, and do not pick things up. ‚ÄúBut at both national parks we saw red-necked wallabies always used their right paw for strength work, like pulling a branch down, but always brought the leaves to their mouth using their left paw,‚Äù she said. Studies into laterality, or the preference for one side of their body over the other, in animal species is a relatively new field. Laterality has been observed in animals such as jumping frogs, killer whales and four-legged marsupials such as gray short-tailed opossums and sugar gliders. However, such a consistently strong preference for one or the other as seen with humans, in which 90% of the population have a bias towards their right hand and 10% have bias towards their left, is relatively uncommon. The discovery marks the first two-legged animal other than humans or great apes ‚Äì both of which tend to be right-handed ‚Äì that has exhibited such a strong preference for one hand. Significantly, a study of the four-limbed Goodfellow‚Äôs tree kangaroo at Taronga zoo and several German zoos found no preference for either left or right paw. Ingram said this strengthened the link between posture and handedness. The finding could contribute to a greater understanding of how the left and right brain hemispheres control laterality, and lead to the discovery of new brain pathways in marsupials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-19T04:39:01Z,world,World news,Daily Show's Jon Stewart on Charleston shooting: 'This was a terrorist attack',"The Daily Show host Jon Stewart has slammed America‚Äôs response to the mass shooting in a South Carolina church, predicting that nothing would be done in the wake of a ‚Äúterrorist attack‚Äù that left nine people dead. In a sombre opening to a show he promised would contain no jokes, Stewart said some people were already working hard to discount the idea that racism was the motive behind the massacre. Dylann Roof, a 21-year-old white man, is currently in custody in Charleston. Prior to introducing his guest ‚Äì Nobel peace prize-winner Malala Yousafzai ‚Äì Stewart told viewers: ‚ÄúI have nothing other than just sadness that once again we have to peer into the abyss of the depraved violence that we do to each other, and the nexus of a just gaping racial wound that will not heal but we pretend doesn‚Äôt exist. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confident, though, that by acknowledging it, by staring into that and seeing it for what it is, we still won‚Äôt do jackshit. ‚ÄúYeah. That‚Äôs us.‚Äù The reluctance to label domestic shootings of this kind as terrorism, he went on, led to what he called a ‚Äúdisparity of response between when we think people that are foreign are going to kill us and us killing ourselves‚Äù. ‚ÄúIf this had been what we thought was Islamic terrorism ‚Ä¶ we invaded two countries and spent trillions of dollars and thousands of American lives, and now fly unmanned death machines over, like, five or six different countries ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúNine people. Shot in a church. What about that? Eh. What are you gonna do? Crazy is as crazy is, right?‚Äù
The media response had been too slow to acknowledge the culture that made such violence possible, Stewart said: ‚ÄúI heard someone on the news say, a tragedy has visited this church.

Debbie Dills was driving to work on Thursday through Shelby, North Carolina ‚Äì about four hours‚Äô drive from Charleston ‚Äì when she spotted a black Hyundai with a South Carolina plate and a confederate flag. ‚ÄúThere was just something inside of me that said it just didn‚Äôt look right to me,‚Äù she said.

2015-06-19T03:00:02Z,world,World news,"The football star, the run-down flats and the sky-high rent for homeless housing","A company owned by one of Europe‚Äôs most popular footballers has made more than ‚Ç¨500,000 from renting a run-down office building to Rome city council as housing for homeless people. Under the terms of the deal, the council is paying a firm owned by the Italian superstar Francesco Totti almost twice the going market rate. The arrangement was approved by an acquaintance of Totti who is to go on trial this year on unrelated charges of corruption. Luca Odevaine, a senior local authority official, is accused of being a pivotal figure in a web of corrupt links between the Rome council and an organised crime syndicate headed by a former neo-fascist gunman. There is no suggestion the deal between Totti‚Äôs firm and the council is illegal. And, since the footballer does not wield executive powers in the company, he may have been unaware of the contents of the agreement when it was signed. But several factors have made it intensely controversial. The origins of the affair go back to 2005 when the council approved the creation of a network of temporary housing assistance centres. Documents reproduced in a recently published book, I re di Roma (the king of Rome), by Lirio Abbate and Marco Lillo, show that two years later Odevaine was made chairman of a committee tasked with deciding on offers of suitable buildings for the scheme. Totti and the official already knew one another. When Odevaine‚Äôs father died in 2005, Totti, his wife and his personal trainer and assistant put their names to a notice in the daily L‚ÄôUnita expressing their condolences. Among the offers Odevaine‚Äôs committee received was one from Immobiliare Dieci, part of a chain of companies controlled by Totti and all bearing names that refer to the No 10 shirt he wears on the field. His firm proposed the upper storeys of a converted office block in Tor Tre Teste, a dormitory suburb on the desolate outskirts of Rome, and proposed an annual rent of almost ‚Ç¨1.3m (¬£930,000). The building has 35 apartments covering 2,430 square metres, so the suggested rent was equivalent to almost ‚Ç¨44 per square metre per month. The committee replied that it would pay ‚Ç¨15 per square metre per month in rent. With VAT and a recent 6% increase, the total comes to more than ‚Ç¨19 per square metre per month. Yet, according to the specialist property website Immobiliare.it, rents in the 00155 post code area in which the building is situated are among the lowest in Rome at around ‚Ç¨10 per square metre per month. In fact, the only parts of the capital where rents exceed ‚Ç¨19 are in the city‚Äôs historic centre. The website‚Äôs estimates suggest the council could put the homeless into accommodation overlooking the Colosseum for much the same rent it is handing over to Totti‚Äôs company. In addition to the rent, the local authority is paying more than ‚Ç¨350,000 a year for services including taking care of the common areas, 24-hour porterage, maintenance and the cleaning of apartments when there is a change of tenant. But Elisa Ferri, who lives in the building with her husband and three children, says conditions are frequently squalid. ‚ÄúA pipe burst in the floor above and it took more than a month to get a plumber to come round,‚Äù she said. In the meantime, paint had peeled off the ceiling, water dripped on to her children‚Äôs beds and mould formed in several areas. Earlier this year, the 33-year-old showed the damage to a video reporter from the newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano. Ferri, who said she earned ‚Ç¨700 a month as a cleaner and carer, told the Guardian the office block was never intended to be inhabited around the clock and that it was plagued by cockroaches. ‚ÄúWe have asked several times for disinfestation, but without getting any response,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI find the cockroaches more repulsive than the mould.‚Äù The Roma captain declined to respond to questions put to him by the Guardian through his personal trainer and assistant. In March, he also refused to give a response to a reporter from the television programme Servizio Pubblico who asked him about his relationship with Odevaine. A representative said merely: ‚ÄúTotti is a footballer. His professional advisers take care of these things.‚Äù Prosecutors claim Odevaine received ‚Ç¨5,000 a month to procure lucrative public contracts for an organised crime syndicate, which ‚Äì Italy‚Äôs highest court has ruled ‚Äì used mafia-like methods in its operations. In March, Odevaine voluntarily testified to the prosecutors. Reports based on his lawyer‚Äôs account of the closed-door proceedings quoted Odevaine as saying the money was compensation for his role as the gang‚Äôs ‚Äúfacilitator‚Äù and ‚Äúproblem tackler‚Äù in the local authority.
The charismatic Totti, 38, has captained AS Roma continuously since 1998, becoming the most prolific goalscorer in the history of the club. A revered figure in his native city ‚Äì his nicknames include that of Il re di Roma or ‚Äúthe king of Rome‚Äù ‚Äì he has patronised many good causes. He is a goodwill ambassador for the Italian branch of Unicef. When the mayor of the Italian capital, Ignazio Marino, was asked about his council‚Äôs dealings with the footballer‚Äôs companies in March, he replied: ‚ÄúTotti in Rome is untouchable, because Totti is Totti. I want him to carry on winning and scoring ‚Ä¶‚Äù Ownership of the property has since been transferred to Immobiliare Ten, a wholly owned subsidiary of Immobiliare Dieci, which is in turn owned by a firm called Numberten Srl. Totti has an 83.19% stake in Numberten Srl, with the remaining share divided between Totti‚Äôs mother, Fiorella Marrozzini, and his brother, Riccardo, who is also Immobiliare Ten‚Äôs chief executive. In the four years to the end of 2014 Immobiliare Ten made after-tax profits of ‚Ç¨573,996.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T23:53:31Z,world,World news,Denmark swings to the right as centre-left coalition accepts defeat,"Denmark‚Äôs first female prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, has conceded defeat and resigned as leader of her party after her coalition government lost the election to the centre-right opposition. Thorning-Schmidt told party members she will step down as prime minister and leader of the Social Democratic party on Friday after Denmark became the latest European nation to experience a surge in rightwing populism. In her resignation speech, she said: ‚ÄúEvery single day the responsibility has been mine. I stand by the decisions I have made ‚Ä¶ I am Denmark‚Äôs first female prime minister, but I won‚Äôt be the last.‚Äù The strong showing for rightwing parties in the Nordic nation also delivers David Cameron a potentially vital ally in Europe for his bid to renegotiate the terms of Britain‚Äôs membership of the EU. Finland and Norway already have rightwing populists in government. With more than 99% of the votes counted last night, the Danish People‚Äôs party emerged as the second biggest force in parliament, having nearly doubled its vote to 21%, up from 12% just four years ago. ‚ÄúWhat this suggests is that the Danish People‚Äôs party is becoming a real people‚Äôs party, for which we have fought for so many years,‚Äù its leader, Kristian Thulesen Dahl, told supporters. The DPP was still coy on Thursday night about joining a centre-right coalition in power. ‚ÄúWhat is important is not whether we join a government, the important thing is that we have influence,‚Äù Dahl said. But the party said it would back a centre-right coalition led by the liberal Venstre party of former prime minister Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen, which had a disappointing night, taking third place with fewer than 20% of the vote ‚Äì its lowest in quarter of a century ‚Äì after promising tax breaks and tougher immigration controls. Last night Rasmussen said he now had an opportunity to form a new government after Thorning-Schmidt‚Äôs concession. ‚ÄúTonight we have been given an opportunity, but only an opportunity, to take leadership in Denmark,‚Äù he told supporters in parliament. ‚ÄúWe take that upon ourselves and I take that upon myself.‚Äù The DPP supported a centre-right government from 2001 to 2011 without joining it ‚Äúand we had huge influence‚Äù, said DPP MEP Morten Messerschmidt. Up until polling day, the incumbent centre-left coalition had hoped to score a spectacular comeback ‚Äì Thorning-Schmidt‚Äôs government was trailing by 17 percentage points two years ago after unpopular reforms and broken campaign promises since taking office in 2011. On the eve of Thursday‚Äôs poll, the result was seen as too close to call, with barely a single percentage point separating the two blocs. But as the results came in on Thursday night, it became clear that Thorning-Schmidt‚Äôs gamble of trying to outdo the DPP on immigration had failed. With her eyes firmly set on the election, Thorning-Schmidt launched a tough policy on asylum seekers, announcing that they must work to get social security benefits. Her Social Democrats and the opposition Liberals fought the election on who could sound toughest on immigration, while the DPP itself went further and called for the reinstatement of border controls between Germany and Sweden. ‚ÄúWe need to see the movements of voter groups to understand the whole picture, but it seems that everyone has tried to match the Danish People‚Äôs party‚Äôs policies so much that it has vindicated the party ‚Äì and then the voters chose the real thing,‚Äù said political commentator Kasper Fogh Hansen. Dahl, 45, co-founded the DPP 20 years ago, and is seen as more moderate in some respects than its former leader, Pia Kj√¶rsgaard, from whom he took over in 2012, helping to broaden the party‚Äôs appeal. The DPP is the only member of the rightwing group of parties in the Danish parliament to argue for an expansion of the public sector and more spending on elderly care, helping it to take voters from both the Social Democrats and the Liberals. The party is staunchly Eurosceptic, although it does not argue for leaving the EU. With four seats from the autonomous Danish nations of Greenland and Faroe Islands still to be reckoned, the final result appeared to give 91 seats for the centre-right bloc, placing it out of reach of the centre-left. The DPP was set to take 37 seats. The victory for the right will be a boost to David Cameron, after Rasmussen said he would push for EU reforms against deeper integration. In what many saw as a concession to the DPP, the four parties of the rightwing bloc ‚Äì Liberals, DPP, Conservatives and Liberal Alliance ‚Äì last week announced their joint support for Cameron‚Äôs bid to renegotiate the terms of Britain‚Äôs EU membership of the EU, in particular with regard to welfare benefits for EU migrants. ‚ÄúWe will stand behind Great Britain and like-minded nations‚Äô efforts to ensure that the EU doesn‚Äôt turn into a social union,‚Äù said the statement, titled Danish Welfare in Europe. ‚ÄúWe want an EU where people can go wherever workers are needed, but we don‚Äôt want an EU where people go wherever the social benefits are good,‚Äù the statement said. Thorning-Schmidt called the election three weeks ago after signs of an economic revival in the Nordic nation that was badly hit by the global financial crisis of 2008. She portrayed her four years as prime minister as being divided into two periods, the first of tough reforms followed by the reward of economic growth. Timid economic expansion of 1.7% is forecast for Denmark this year and 2% in 2016, allowing Thorning-Schmidt to promise a boost in welfare spending. But differences between the centre left and right blocs were so slim that voters‚Äô attention often focused on their leaders‚Äô styles rather than their policies. ‚ÄúEspecially from a financial market point of view, there‚Äôs no difference ‚Äì both sides are in favour of our fixed exchange rate policy and conducting a responsible fiscal policy,‚Äù Danske Bank chief economist Steen Bocian told Reuters. During her four years in power, Thorning-Schmidt joined forces with the centre right to pass controversial reforms. A deal to sell a stake in the energy company Dong to the US investment bank Goldman Sachs last year almost brought down her government after a junior coalition partner, the Socialist People‚Äôs party, walked out, resulting in the loss of six cabinet ministers. But she won international plaudits for her statesmanlike handling of terrorist shootings in Copenhagen in February. The defeat for the centre left in Denmark marks a further setback for Social Democrats in Europe, who have had a miserable time in recent years, losing elections in the UK and Germany while facing disastrous poll ratings in France and Sweden. Sweden‚Äôs Social Democrats are now the only labour party to hold power in Scandinavia, a historical bastion of social democracy. Sweden‚Äôs Social Democrats were so unhappy with their Danish colleagues‚Äô position on immigration that the party broke with tradition and decided not to send top officials to Denmark for the elections, according to Swedish newspaper Expressen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-18T21:41:48Z,world,World news,Dylann Roof: the cold stare of a killer with a history of drug abuse and racism,"It was the menacing stare that horrified the world; it was the flags on his jacket that began to paint the portrait of a suspected mass killer. The Facebook profile picture of 21-year-old Dylann Storm Roof quickly emerged as a defining image of the aftermath in the shooting spree he is now accused of orchestrating, as it became clear the mop-topped man caught in surveillance footage at a South Carolina church was the same as the one in the jacket in the woods.
On one patch of the jacket, the flag of white-ruled Rhodesia, the African country that became Zimbabwe in 1980. On the patch above: a flag from apartheid-era South Africa.
Richard Cohen, the president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said Roof was not known to his organization, which tracks hate crimes across the US, but based on his Facebook page he appeared to be a ‚Äúdisaffected white supremacist‚Äù. Based on interviews with friends and family, plus a mixed educational record and a criminal record, a fuller picture was quickly forming of the man accused of shooting and killing nine people on Wednesday in Charleston, South Carolina. He is an introvert, but Roof also appears to have a history of racism and drug abuse ‚Äì and a family that reportedly gave him a gun as a gift.
Roof fled the church in his Hyundai sedan ‚Äì with Confederate flag license plates ‚Äì and was captured in Shelby, North Carolina, more than 240 miles away. Police pulled over Roof‚Äôs car after a tip from the public described the vehicle as suspicious. Police believe he was the lone assailant and described him as ‚Äúcooperative‚Äù during the traffic stop. Pinckney‚Äôs cousin Sylvia Johnson told NBC News a survivor of the mass killing had told her Roof said he ‚Äúhad to‚Äù keep shooting, as another churchgoer attempted to talk him out of firing his weapon while he reloaded. ‚ÄúHe just said, ‚ÄòI have to do it,‚Äô‚Äù she said. ‚Äú‚ÄòYou rape our women, and you‚Äôre taking over our country, and you have to go,‚Äô‚Äù she said.
Roof‚Äôs family members described the 21-year-old, who apparently received a .45-caliber pistol for his 21st birthday, as introverted. Roof‚Äôs uncle Carson Cowles told his sister, Roof‚Äôs mother, that the young man was overly withdrawn, Reuters reported. ‚ÄúI said he was like 19 years old, he still didn‚Äôt have a job, a driver‚Äôs license or anything like that and he just stayed in his room a lot of the time,‚Äù Cowles said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any words for it. Nobody in my family had seen anything like this coming,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI said, if it is him, and when they catch him, he‚Äôs got to pay for this.‚Äù Joey Meek, one of Roof‚Äôs childhood friends, said he alerted the FBI after recognising him in a surveillance camera image that was widely circulated by law enforcement agencies early on Thursday, Meek‚Äôs mother, Kimberly Konzny, told the Associated Press. Roof had worn the same sweatshirt while playing Xbox videogames in their home recently, she said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what was going through his head,‚Äù Konzny said. ‚ÄúHe was a really sweet kid. He was quiet. He only had a few friends.‚Äù A high-school contemporary, John Mullins, told the Daily Beast that the young Roof had been ‚Äúkind of wild‚Äù. ‚ÄúHe used drugs heavily a lot,‚Äù Mullins said. ‚ÄúIt was obviously harder than marijuana. He was like a pill popper, from what I understood. Like Xanax, and stuff like that.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúHe made a lot of racist jokes, but you don‚Äôt really take them seriously like that. You don‚Äôt really think of it like that.‚Äù But now, he said, it seemed that ‚Äúthe things he said were kind of not joking‚Äù. Another acquaintance said Roof had had black friends at school. ‚ÄúI never thought he‚Äôd do something like this,‚Äù said Antonio Metze, 19. ‚ÄúHe had black friends.‚Äù
Though police say Roof lived in Columbia, South Carolina, he apparently had ties to the nearby Lexington area. Roof had a mixed educational record in the Lexington school district, attending White Knoll high school in both the 2008-09 and 2009-10 school years. He repeated ninth grade both years, but was pulled and re-enrolled more than once. He also attended White Knoll elementary school for fourth grade in 2003-04. The Lexington school district said it was unable to find annual photos of Roof, and that it has no records of other schools he might have attended. Roof also had at least two run-ins with the law. The Lexington County district attorney‚Äôs office confirmed that Roof was charged with possession of a controlled substance in a 2 March incident, but the circumstances surrounding that arrest remain unclear. He was also arrested in April for misdemeanor trespassing in Lexington County.
On Thursday, police released Roof‚Äôs mugshot and then moved him from police custody in North Carolina, on his way back to face charges in South Carolina. Reuters reports that Roof lived with his older sister Amber and their father part-time, until his father and stepmother divorced. A profile on TheKnot.com shows that Amber Roof is scheduled to be married Sunday in Lexington, South Carolina, Reuters reported. The social media picture of the man also remains murky. A picture widely circulated in the media from a Facebook account identified as Dylann Roof shows him wearing a black jacket adorned with two flags associated with white supremacy: that of apartheid-era South Africa, and that of Rhodesia, the white-ruled country that later became Zimbabwe , scowling in front of a swamp. A number of his Facebook friends are black. There is little more personally identifying information on the page. The profile has not been independently confirmed by the Guardian, and media reports indicate that law enforcement may not be aware of the account.
It‚Äôs unclear what other social media Roof may have used ‚Äì at least one Instagram profile with Roof‚Äôs name and likeness exists, but is locked as a private user.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Below is information about each victim. Clementa Pinckney
Called ‚ÄúClem‚Äù by his friends, 41-year-old Pinckney (pictured above) was a well-respected pastor and South Carolina state senator, the youngest black representative ever elected to the legislature. He graduated from Allen University with a degree in business administration, and was described by the university as ‚Äúone [of] its most prominent alums‚Äù. ‚ÄúSenator Pinckney was a brilliant young pastor and leader who always possessed an empowering and healing message,‚Äù the university said in a press release. In his junior year of college, Pinckney was also selected as a fellow for Princeton University‚Äôs Woodrow Wilson summer research program. He received a graduate degree in public administration from the University of South Carolina. Pinckney began preaching at 13 years old, according to his biography on the Mother Emanuel AME website. At 18, he had received his first pastor‚Äôs appointment. In the state legislature, he had proposed strict gun-control legislation ‚Äì later failed ‚Äì to require background checks for gun purchases in South Carolina. He also campaigned for police to be equipped with body cameras, which he said ‚Äúmay not be the golden ticket, the golden egg, the end-all-fix-all, but [would help] to paint a picture of what happens during a police stop‚Äù. Mandatory body cameras became law in the state one week before Pinckney‚Äôs death. Tywanza Sanders
A 2014 graduate of Allen University‚Äôs business administration program, Sanders, 26, was the youngest victim of the church shooting. The school‚Äôs interim president, Lady June Cole, said that Sanders worked as a barber while attending the university, and that he was a Charleston native. Sanders also wrote poetry, and was attempting to have a series of poems published before his death. ‚ÄúHe was a quiet, well-known student who was committed to his education. He presented a warm and helpful spirit as he interacted with his colleagues,‚Äù Allen University said in a press release. Sharonda Coleman-Singleton
Coleman-Singleton, 45, was identified by her son‚Äôs school, Charleston Southern University. Her son, Chris Singleton, was described as a ‚Äúrising sophomore‚Äù baseball player at the university. ‚ÄúChris‚Äôs mother was just that parent that as a coach you are proud to have as part of your program,‚Äù baseball head coach Stuart Lake said about Coleman-Singleton. ‚ÄúWhat she brought to our team is immeasurable.‚Äù Coleman-Singleton was a speech therapist at Goose Creek high school in Berkeley County, South Carolina, and was also the head coach of the girls‚Äô track team there, specifically handling hurdles and sprints. She ran track herself at South Carolina State University. Goose Creek‚Äôs athletic director, Chuck Reedy, told the Post and Courier that Coleman-Singleton was ‚Äúvery professional in everything she did‚Äù. ‚ÄúShe was an excellent role model for all of our students, in the way she carried herself. She was just first class,‚Äù Reedy said, according to the Post and Courier. She was also listed as a reverend at Mother Emanuel AME, according to the church‚Äôs website. Cynthia Hurd
Hurd, 54, was the regional manager of the St Andrew‚Äôs library, part of the Charleston County library system, where she worked for 31 years. Hurd was also the sister of former North Carolina senator Malcolm Graham. The library has canceled events and closed the library following the massacre. Hurd, ‚Äúdedicated her life to serving and improving the lives of others‚Äù, the library said in a statement on the system‚Äôs Facebook. ‚ÄúCynthia was a tireless servant of the community who spent her life helping residents, making sure they had every opportunity for an education and personal growth,‚Äù the library said on its Facebook page. All 16 Charleston County libraries will close on Thursday in memory of the nine victims shot at the Mother Emanuel AME church, and the St Andrew‚Äôs location will be closed on Friday as well. She was a well-known woman in the community, and the Charleston county coroner Rae Wooten said that, ‚ÄúObviously, we‚Äôre all shattered by that, she‚Äôll be missed deeply.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is unimaginable that she would walk into church and not return,‚Äù Graham said in a statement. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs who she was ‚Äì a woman of faith.‚Äù DePayne Middleton-Doctor
Middleton-Doctor, 49, worked in Charleston county as director of the federal community development block grants, work that helps residents install things such as septic tanks, the Charleston county council chairman said on Thursday. ‚ÄúIn a very big way she was doing very human kinds of things in her role in government for others,‚Äù said J Elliott Summey, Charleston council chairman. Middleton-Doctor retired from her job in the county in 2005. Rev Dr Daniel L Simmons Sr The 74-year-old was a reverend at the Mother Emanuel AME Church, in addition to being a retired pastor, ABC News reported. Ethel Lance
Lance, 70, was a sexton who had worked at the church for more than 30 years, according to her family. ‚ÄúGranny was the heart of the family,‚Äù her grandson Jon Quil Lance told the local Post and Courier newspaper, as he waited outside the trauma center of Medical University hospital. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a Christian, hardworking; I could call my granny for anything. I don‚Äôt have anyone else like that,‚Äù he added. Myra Thompson Thompson, 59, was the wife of Anthony Thompson, a vicar at the Holy Trinity REC Church in Charleston. The Anglican Church of North America asked for prayers on her husband‚Äôs behalf, in a Twitter post. Susie Jackson
At 87, Jackson was the oldest of the victims of the Wednesday shooting. A child of the civil-rights movement, she witnessed South Carolina‚Äôs historic role in American race relations, up to and including the day of her death at a church that was home to a slave revolt, before being burned down by white supremacists, visited by Martin Luther King Jr, and now baring witness to another massacre.

2015-06-18T21:00:06Z,world,World news,Alan Johnson to head Labour yes campaign for EU referendum,"Alan Johnson, the former Labour cabinet minister, has agreed to head the Labour yes campaign during the referendum on Britain‚Äôs membership of the European Union, Harriet Harman, the Labour interim leader, has told the Guardian. Johnson, repeatedly courted by Ed Miliband and others to return to frontline politics, has agreed to head up the campaign which will be separate to any cross party pro-European organisation. Seen as one of Labour‚Äôs most persuasive communicators, he is regarded as the right man to carry a Labour pro-European message which would not leave a permanent rupture with the thousands of Ukip supporters that Labour needs to win back ahead of the 2020 election. His appointment suggests Labour is to run a full throated pro-European campaign, despite some shadow cabinet members previously hintingthat it might be advisable to take a low profile in an attempt to woo back those lost Ukip voters. Johnson told the Guardian: ‚ÄúThis is not a return to the shadow cabinet, but Harriet is always very persuasive. There will be a lot of different kinds of campaigns for a yes vote, but I don‚Äôt think there has ever been an argument that Labour should not have its own campaign. As a political party we have to be very clear where we stand on this issue. I see this as the most important political decision of my lifetime. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more important than the referendum decision in 1975 which almost felt like a decision to go in. I know we had been in the EU with six member states for a few years. But it would be much more momentous to leave an institution that is now 28 members strong and in which we have 40 years‚Äô active membership, all at a time when the world is more interdependent. It would be a much more important and profound decision to leave, having been in.‚Äù Harman said: ‚ÄúThis is a big moment of choice and he is prepared to play his part. Alan is well known. He is a gifted communicator. He is unequivocal in his pro-European views. It is part of his DNA. He reaches all parts of the country.‚Äù With his background as a former union general secretary and business secretary, he warned David Cameron not to try to interfere with existing social and employment rights, including the working time directive, as part of his renegotiation. His warning was backed up by a statement on Thursday from the GMB general secretary Paul Kenny saying: ‚ÄúIf what David Cameron brings back from the re-negotiations tilts the balance even further away from standards for workers, as the CBI wants, many organisations traditionally in favour will campaign for a no vote.‚Äù Johnson said: ‚ÄúIt would be very difficult for Cameron to bargain those rights away away. I don‚Äôt think other member states would wear that. He needs unanimity. People did not have the right to a day off until the working time directive came in.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúI also think there is only one person in Britain who wants a yes vote more than me, and this is David Cameron. When you are the prime minister, you see the full horror of Britain leaving the EU, and then it is no longer about rhetoric, debating societies, and party cliques. Of course he wants to stay in. So he would be mad quite frankly to put at risk the support of millions of people dependent on those social rights. If he bargained those rights away he might fill one hole in, but then he will only have dug a deeper one, so my advice would be not to go there, but he probably knows that.‚Äù He also insisted the party had to be straightforward in its pro-Europeanism. ‚ÄúMy clear view is that we do not play political games on this. Our policy and outlook is pro-European, so I am not interested in the game of saying one thing to people in the North because we have got Ukip issues there and then something else in the Midlands.‚Äù He said he doubted that every single person who voted Ukip wanted to leave the EU any more than every Labour voter supported the mansion tax. He said that what Ukip had traded on was immigration, and that he had met plenty of people who had issues about free movement of labour but accepted it as the price for being in the EU. ‚ÄúThe focus has to be on growth and jobs and the terrible damage it would do to the UK economy if we withdrew. Once people focus on the risk of leaving the EU I think it will be a yes vote.‚Äù He denied that his decision to take the job made a permanent return from rank politics saying this was a job ‚Äúuntil the end of 2017 and no more‚Äù. Harman said the reasons that made some voters desert Labour for Ukip were not all about Europe, but broader issues. She said: ‚ÄúWe are going to be very clear and straightforward in our arguments. There is not going to be any triangulation and Alan is not a triangulator.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T20:19:03Z,world,World news,UK to reject EU plans to combat multinational tax avoidance,"Britain will reject plans announced in Brussels this week to combat industrial-scale tax avoidance by the world‚Äôs biggest multinationals, the Treasury minister responsible for tax policy has said. David Gauke, financial secretary to the Treasury, told representatives from the European parliament that Britain would not adopt the measures to introduce certain common tax rules. ‚ÄúHe was very clear that the UK is insisting on tax competition,‚Äù said German MEP Michael Theurer, who met with the UK treasury minister on Thursday. ‚ÄúIt was really a shock from the minister.‚Äù Theurer is part of a committee of MEPs set up to examine how multinationals are avoiding tax in the EU and what can be done about it. The committee was set up in response to the LuxLeaks revelations of tax avoidance in Luxembourg and its members strongly support the reform plans announced on Wednesday by European commissioner for tax Pierre Moscovici. Moscovici‚Äôs proposals seek to resurrect a longstanding tax harmonisation policy, which has been blocked by hostile member states since 2011. Known as the common consolidated corporate tax base, or CCCTB, the policy would see countries adopt a common set of rules on where company profits arise ‚Äì removing many of the national differences that multinationals have been able to exploit to lower their tax bill. Aware of previous resistance, Moscovici has in recent weeks taken extensive soundings from EU members, prompting him to water down key elements of the CCCTB in an effort to make it more palatable. His calculations, however, appeared to have been wide of the mark as the UK Treasury signalled an emphatic rebuff. In the first phase of the European commission‚Äôs plan at least, the common framework would not allow companies to consolidate profits across Europe and file a single tax return. Moscovici had hoped removing the ‚Äúconsolidation‚Äù element of the CCCTB would make it acceptable to the likes of the UK and Ireland. Last month Gauke told the FT: ‚ÄúThe CCCTB has been around a very long time. It is a proposal still looking for a justification.‚Äù His opposition does not seem to have softened, though it is understood that the Treasury might not object to other EU member states developing a CCCTB alone. George Osborne has set great store by Britain‚Äôs tax competitiveness, slashing the headline corporate tax rate from 28% to 20%. But it is not just on the rate that Osborne has competed hard: new favourable tax regimes for multinationals with offshore financing subsidiaries as well as new tax breaks for patent-owning companies have also been central to aggressive tax competition policy. These and other measures have seen a wave of companies shifting their European headquarters or research and development arms to the UK ‚Äì much to the anger of other member states. The UK has seen an influx of multinationals ‚Äì among them Aon, Fiat Industrial, and Starbucks‚Äôs European operations ‚Äì looking to gain tax advantages through the optimal location of the often small number of headquarters staff. Last month the US seed and agrochemicals group Monsanto announced that, should it succeed in taking over Swiss firm Syngenta, it planned to move its headquarters to the UK. A mandatory common approach to setting the tax base for companies, as proposed by Moscovici, would remove many of these central elements to Osborne‚Äôs tax competition strategy. ‚ÄúThe current rules for corporate taxation no longer fit the modern context,‚Äù Moscovici‚Äôs plan claims, ‚Äúas corporate tax planning has become more sophisticated and competitive forces between member states have increased, the tools for ensuring fair tax competition within the EU have reached their limits.‚Äù The Treasury declined to comment on reasons for the UK‚Äôs prompt rejection of Moscovici‚Äôs tax reform proposals. It said: ‚ÄúDirect taxation is a matter for EU countries, and any direct taxation matters require unanimity across all EU countries. We‚Äôre fully involved in international discussions on tax issues and have consistently supported global measures, through the EU, G20 and OECD, which will strengthen international rules to prevent corporate tax avoidance.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T20:12:29Z,world,World news,Greece faces banking crisis after eurozone meeting breaks down,"Greece is facing a full-blown banking crisis after a meeting of eurozone finance ministers broke down in acrimony and recrimination on Thursday evening, bringing the prospect of Greek exit from the eurozone a step nearer.
Some ‚Ç¨2bn of deposits have been withdrawn from Greek banks so far this week ‚Äì including a record ‚Ç¨1bn yesterday ‚Äì triggering fears that a breakdown in talks would spark a further flight of funds. The German leader Angela Merkel, French president Fran√ßois Hollande and Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras agreed to stage an emergency EU summit on Monday as a last critical attempt to prevent Greece going bankrupt. A representative of the European Central Bank told the meeting it was unsure whether Greek banks would have the funds to be able to open on Monday. As thousands of pro-EU protestors gathered outside the Athens parliament building, leaders of the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund aimed bitter criticism at the leftwing Greek government, accusing it of lying to its own people, misrepresenting and misleading other EU leaders, refusing to negotiate seriously, and taking Greece to the brink of catastrophe. The Luxembourg talks broke down within an hour of discussions about the Greek crisis starting, indicating the bad blood between both sides. Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, said there was an urgent need for dialogue ‚Äúwith adults in the room‚Äù. She added: ‚ÄúWe can only arrive at a resolution if there is a dialogue. Right now we‚Äôre short of a dialogue.‚Äù
Lagarde has taken a tough line on debt talks with Athens over the past four months, since the radical leftist Syriza government took control and insisted creditors drop proposals for further austerity as the price of releasing the last tranche of bailout funds. At the talks in Luxembourg she reportedly introduced herself to Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis as ‚Äúthe criminal in chief‚Äù, in reference to Tsipras‚Äôs claim earlier this week that the IMF bore ‚Äúcriminal responsibility‚Äù for the situation in Greece. Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic affairs, who has been more sympathetic to the Greek case, said: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not much time to avoid the worst.‚Äù He appealed to the Tsipras government to return to the negotiating table, making it plain that Athens has been treating its creditors and EU partners with contempt. He said Athens had made no credible counter-proposals on the bailout terms and said that Varoufakis tabled no new proposals on Thursday, despite the session of Eurogroup finance ministers being billed as the last chance to secure a deal sending Greece a financial lifeline and keeping it in the euro. He called on the Greek government ‚Äúto avoid a fate that would be catastrophic‚Äù. The current bailout for Greece expires on 30 June when Athens is also due to repay the IMF around ‚Ç¨1.6bn. Lagarde said if the payment is not made on time, Greece will be declared to be in default and would disqualify itself from receiving any further IMF funds. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and president of the eurogroup, said: ‚ÄúNo agreement is yet in sight.‚Äù Varoufakis reiterated demands for debt relief as part of a deal. The creditors concede that this could be agreed in the future, but that first Greece has to meet the terms of the present rescue package which expires in 11 days. ‚ÄúWe are dangerously close to a state of mind that accepts an accident,‚Äù said Varoufakis. As the talks quickly broke down in Luxembourg, in Brussels, Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, promptly convened an emergency leaders‚Äô summit on Monday evening, putting the onus on both Merkel and Tsipras as the two key leaders to bend towards concessions to clinch a deal. A senior EU official taking part in the meeting told the Guardian that Monday‚Äôs summit was convened as soon as EU leaders learned of the collapse of the Luxembourg talks. The spectre of a Greek banking collapse under the weight of withdrawals prompted the meet, he said. The standoff is over what actions Greece has to take to access the remaining ‚Ç¨7.2bn in bailout funds. Dijsselbloem made plain that even if agreement is reached in the end, the rescue package would need to be extended beyond 30 June, as there simply was not enough time left to negotiate the fine print and get through the parliamentary procedures needed in several eurozone countries. At issue is just a ‚Ç¨2bn financing gap between what the Greeks are prepared to offer and what the creditors are demanding, but the problem goes deeper into questions of power and rules. Dijsselbloem said any deal that might be reached would need to maintain the credibility of the eurozone as a rules-based community. As the meeting degenerated into rancour, Greek banks stood on the brink of collapse after a flood of cash withdrawals on Thursday, raising the prospect of capital controls and temporary bank closures. The five major commercial banks saw around ‚Ç¨2bn of deposits withdrawn by customers anxious that Greece was nearing the end of its credit line with lenders and about to go bust. Dijsselbloem demanded that the Greek government act quickly to restore trust and stem the haemorrhaging of deposits. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a sign of great concern for the future,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt can be dealt with, but it requires quick action.‚Äù Top officials from the European Central Bank told the meeting that Greece might need to impose capital controls within days. They said the banks would be open on Friday. ‚ÄúOn Monday, I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Benoit Coeure from the ECB board was said to have told the ministers. The precarious situation, which has previously forced the ECB to regularly increase its credit line to Greek banks, formed the backdrop to intense negotiations between Athens and the troika of creditors ‚Äì the European commission, the International Monetary Fund and the ECB.
Lagarde said there would be ‚Äúno grace period or possibility of delay‚Äù to loan payments that are due on 30 June. The hardening of the IMF‚Äôs stance follows an admission by the debt-stricken Greek government on Wednesday that it would be unable to pay without a deal with Brussels and the IMF to provide extra funds. Lagarde said the Syriza administration would need to make further reforms to its pension system to get a deal, something prime minister Tsipras has refused to countenance. Writing in German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel, Tsipras said pensioners had become the main breadwinners in many families, meaning cuts in pension payments would increase poverty. ‚ÄúTraditionally, this solidarity has meant that young people, through their contributions, fund the pensions of their parents,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut during the Greek crisis, we‚Äôve witnessed this solidarity being reversed as the parents‚Äô pensions fund the survival of their children.‚Äù But the IMF and Brussels want further cuts to bring down the cost of pensions, which account for 16% of GDP, with further restrictions on early retirement and lower supplementary pension payments. The Greek government has maintained, throughout five months of talks, that it remains ready to join talks to secure an agreement, but could not accept the current proposals to cut pensions or the insistence it achieve a 1% budget surplus in the middle of a recession. Chief negotiator, Euclid Tsakalotos, warned on the BBC‚Äôs Today programme on Radio 4 that ‚Äúif Greece goes out, the euro might break down.‚Äù He said: ‚ÄúOnce one country has left, you change a monetary union into a fixed exchange rate system, where it‚Äôs a cost-benefit analysis whether another country leaves. ‚ÄúMy greatest fear is that the breakup of the euro will return [us] to the competitive devaluations, and the nationalisms, and the kind of politics we had in the 1930s. If we don‚Äôt [have a deal], we have to go to the Greek people, because we have no mandate to leave the euro, and that would be a very bad eventuality.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T20:08:22Z,world,World news,Charleston killings leave US reckoning with race and guns amid 'broken peace',"The killing of nine people by a young white man at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, has sent shockwaves across the United States, as the nation confronts a breaking point over race and gun violence following yet another mass shooting. Investigators described a suspected hate crime at the hands of Dylann Roof, whom they apprehended as reports emerged that he had been given a handgun by his father for his 21st birthday. Pictures also surfaced from a Facebook page depicting him with the flags of apartheid South Africa and white government-era Rhodesia emblazoned on his jacket. Six women and three men were killed during the stealth attack ‚Äì including a pastor and local politician who had been a vocal advocate for gun control and police reform, as well as more clergy and a librarian ‚Äì inside a prayer group meeting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church on Wednesday evening in this metropolis known as the ‚Äúholy city‚Äù of the American south. The suspect is said to have walked into the church ‚Äì a symbol of the American civil rights movement, having given birth to slave revolts and survived burnings by white supremacists ‚Äì and sat with the congregation for an hour before opening fire. President Barack Obama addressed the nation from the White House, expressing heartache at the killings and saying American communities have had to endure such tragedies too many times.
‚ÄúAt some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt happen in other places with this kind of frequency ‚Äì and it is in our power to do something about it.‚Äù The African American community in Charleston and indeed throughout the United States is still reeling from the murder just 10 weeks earlier of Walter Scott, an unarmed black man shot dead by a North Charleston police officer just miles away from the site of Wednesday‚Äôs shooting.
‚ÄòI have to do it‚Äô
Further chilling details of the shooting began to emerge on Thursday, as TV news quoted the relative of one of three survivors who claimed the gunman reloaded his weapon five times and stated: ‚ÄúI have to do it ‚Ä¶ You rape our women and you‚Äôre taking over our country and you have to go.‚Äù A sweeping, multi-agency manhunt for the shooter culminated in police arresting Roof in Shelby, North Carolina, nearly 15 hours after the attack. Police said a citizen reported the vehicle to law enforcement, citing ‚Äúsuspicious activity‚Äù. An officer with the Shelby police department pulled Roof over and arrested him during the traffic stop. Roof made a brief court appearance before being returned to Charleston.
Police say they believe Roof acted alone in the attack, and any motive remained unclear. Carson Cowles, who identified himself as Roof‚Äôs uncle, told Reuters that Roof‚Äôs father had recently given him a .45-caliber handgun as a birthday present and that Roof had seemed adrift. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any words for it,‚Äù the 56-year-old was reported to have said in a telephone interview. ‚ÄúNobody in my family had seen anything like this coming.‚Äù Joey Meek, one of Roof‚Äôs childhood friends, said he alerted the FBI after recognising him in a surveillance camera image that was widely circulated by law enforcement agencies early on Thursday, Meek‚Äôs mother, Kimberly Konzny, told the Associated Press. Roof had worn the same sweatshirt while playing Xbox videogames in their home recently, she said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what was going through his head,‚Äù Konzny said. ‚ÄúHe was a really sweet kid. He was quiet. He only had a few friends.‚Äù Police also released a mug shot of Roof, who had previously been arrested on drug and trespassing charges. ‚ÄòA sign of the times‚Äô
The US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, described the atrocity as a ‚Äúbarbaric crime‚Äù as the federal Department of Justice launched its own hate crime investigation into the mass killing, alongside local and state police. ‚ÄúActs like this have no place in our country and in a civilized society,‚Äù Lynch said in Washington on Thursday.
The youngest victim of the shooting was 26-year-old Tywanza Sanders, a 2014 graduate of Allen University. The school described him as a ‚Äúquiet, well-known student who was committed to his education‚Äù. Cynthia Hurd, 54, was a manager at the St Andrews regional library in Charleston, which will renamed for one if its hardest working librarians. Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, 45, was a speech therapist and high-school track coach. The Charleston County coroner, Rae Wooten, identified the other victims of the attack, as Reverend DePayne Middleton-Doctor, 49; Myra Thompson, 59; Ethel Lance, 70, and her cousin Susie Jackson, 87, both longtime members of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church. Daniel Simmons, a 75-year-old pastor, was the only victim who died at the hospital. All the other victims were pronounced dead at the scene. The Rev Clementa Pinckney, the pastor and state senator, was the first victim of the shootings to be identified. He had introduced legislation ‚Äì later failed ‚Äì to require background checks for gun purchases in South Carolina. He also campaigned for police to be equipped with body cameras, which he said ‚Äúmay not be the golden ticket, the golden egg, the end-all-fix-all, but [would help] to paint a picture of what happens during a police stop‚Äù. Mandatory body cameras became law in the state one week ago.
Thomas Dixon, a pastor who has been working with a local chapter of the Black Lives Matter movement, told the Guardian in Charleston that he had met Pinckney when the senator led prayer vigils in the aftermath of Scott‚Äôs death. Dixon said that in the wake of the latest shooting, he was ‚Äúdisheartened but not surprised‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt is a sign of the times,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhereas in the past we were able to say there were safe havens for people where they could be treated well and respected, unfortunately in today‚Äôs world we have no more safe havens.‚Äù Brokenhearted in the ‚Äòholy city‚Äô Politicians and religious leaders in this tight-knit community ‚Äì known as the ‚Äúholy city‚Äù for its deep Christian history ‚Äì responded to the shooting with overwhelming grief and increased security. ‚ÄúWe woke up today and the heart and soul of South Carolina was broken,‚Äù said the state‚Äôs governor, Nikki Haley, as she fought back tears during a press conference on Thursday. ‚ÄúWe allow ourselves to grieve, we allow ourselves to pray, we allow ourselves to question, and then we allow ourselves to heal.‚Äù One of several planned vigils on Thursday was evacuated following a bomb threat, as community leaders from Charleston to Washington came to grips with larger implications for race and violence. ‚ÄúEvents like this are further evidence that we need to be fighting for racial equality in our daily lives,‚Äù said Victoria Middleton, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of South Carolina.
The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church traces its roots to 1816 and is one of the largest black congregations south of Baltimore. The Reverend Martin Luther King Jr addressed the church in 1962. Muhiyidin d‚ÄôBaha, an organizer with the Charleston chapter of Black Lives Matter Charleston, said the mass shooting echoed church bombings from the civil rights era and followed a string of police shootings that has captivated the nation since the killing of an unarmed 18-year-old last summer in Ferguson, Missouri. ‚ÄúThere is a story being replayed, and it needs to be changed,‚Äù d‚ÄôBaha said at a Thursday meeting held next to a statue of Denmark Vesey, an accused slave insurrectionist from Charleston who was a member of the AME church. A crowd of more than a dozen gathered near the statue, including 75-year-old Paul Mack. He was there with his daughter and her family, and Mack said it was important for his grandchildren to learn the history of racism in the American south. ‚ÄúThese kids know nothing about their history, nothing,‚Äù Mack said. ‚ÄòA broken peace‚Äô: from religion to race and guns Jerod Frazier, minister of social justice at the predominately black Charity Missionary Baptist church in neighboring North Charleston, said he worried about the future of race relations in the region. ‚ÄúThe thing I hate about it is Sunday morning is the most segregated hour across America, but especially in the south ‚Äì you can clearly tell who‚Äôs a visitor and who‚Äôs not if someone of another race comes in,‚Äù Frazier says. ‚ÄúWe consider that to be a sacred time, and this threatens that peace. ‚ÄúIf someone black goes into a white church or someone white goes to a traditionally black church, heads are going to turn around and say, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs going on now?‚Äô It‚Äôs kind of a broken peace, if you will ‚Äì a disturbance of peace.‚Äù
Obama is estimated to have made 14 statements in response to mass shootings during his six years as president. He failed in his attempt to pass national gun control legislation after a 20-year-old shot and killed 20 children and six educators at a school in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012. He has also been criticised by some for failing to make a strong enough response to police shootings of unarmed black men, which have led to international protests. On Wednesday, Obama expressed hope that the latest American shooting might ‚Äúshift how we think about the issue of gun violence‚Äù. ‚ÄúI have had to make statements like this too many times,‚Äù the president said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T18:59:56Z,world,World news,Denmark election result too close to call as exit polls suggest no clear winner,"Denmark‚Äôs cliffhanger election was poised to go down to the wire as exit polls after voting ended on Thursday night predicted the tiniest of margins for the centre right, but no clear victor. Should the centre-right alliance oust the incumbent Social Democrats, the result would give David Cameron a vital ally in Europe for his bid to renegotiate the terms of Britain‚Äôs membership of the EU. It would also be likely to see the anti-immigration, Eurosceptic Danish People‚Äôs party (DPP) enter government for the first time. But all is still to play for. The centre-left prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt has been hoping for a spectacular comeback after making up a huge poll deficit to be at almost level pegging on the eve of the election. The knife-edge result puts the autonomous Danish nations of Greenland and the Faroe Islands in the role of potential kingmakers ‚Äì each have two seats, and three have traditionally gone to the centre left. Exit polls have been an unreliable guide to the final result at past elections. Just two years ago Thorning-Schmidt, Denmark‚Äôs first woman prime minister, was trailing by 17 percentage points just after unpopular reforms and broken campaign promises dogged her since taking power in 2011. But by Thursday‚Äôs poll the result had come to be seen as too close to call, with barely a percentage point separating the two blocs and one poll putting the centre-left marginally ahead. The centre-right opposition alliance, led by former prime minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen‚Äôs Liberal party, promised tax breaks and tougher controls on immigration. Thorning-Schmidt called the election three weeks ago after signs of an economic revival in the Nordic nation that was badly hit by the global financial crisis of 2008. She has portrayed her four years as prime minister as dividing into two periods, the first marked by tough reforms and the second by economic growth. Timid economic expansion of 1.7% is forecast for Denmark this year and 2% in 2016, allowing Thorning-Schmidt to promise a boost in welfare spending. During the campaign differences between the centre-left and -right blocs were so slim that voters‚Äô attention often focused on their leaders‚Äô styles rather than policies ‚Äì both were accused of extravagance, with nicknames of ‚ÄúGucci Helle‚Äù and ‚ÄúLuxury Lars‚Äù catching on. ‚ÄúEspecially from a financial-market point of view, there‚Äôs no difference ‚Äì both sides are in favour of our fixed exchange rate policy and conducting a responsible fiscal policy,‚Äù Danske Bank chief economist Steen Bocian told Reuters. On Tuesday, more than 1 million Danish households received a letter from Thorning-Schmidt claiming that the Liberals wanted tax breaks instead of spending more money on health and elderly care. Rasmussen called the letter ‚Äúa democratic low point‚Äù and urged voters to reject ‚Äúfalse scaremongering‚Äù. During her four years in power, Thorning-Schmidt joined forces with the centre-right to pass controversial reforms. A deal to sell a stake in the energy company Dong to the US investment bank Goldman Sachs last year almost brought down her government after junior coalition partner the Socialist People‚Äôs party walked out, resulting in the loss of six cabinet ministers. But she won international plaudits for her handling of terrorist shootings in Copenhagen in February. With her eyes firmly set on the election, Thorning-Schmidt launched a tough policy on asylum seekers, announcing they must work to get social security benefits. The two main parties fought the election on who could sound the toughest on immigration. The far-right DPP wants to go further and reinstate border controls with Germany and Sweden. Polls suggested the anti-immigration, Eurosceptic DPP was to see its vote increase to as much as 18%, up from 12.3% in 2011. In the past four years the party has prompted a shift in Denmark‚Äôs political landscape, with policies once considered extreme now in the mainstream. A strong showing for the DPP would cement the party‚Äôs position as Denmark‚Äôs third main party. Exit polls suggested the party would lag behind the Liberals by 3 or 4 percentage points, with the Social Democrats on 25%. A victory for the centre-right would be seen as a boost for David Cameron, after Rasmussen said he would push for reforms to the EU against deeper integration. In what many saw as a concession to the DPP, the four parties of the rightwing bloc ‚Äì Liberals, DPP, Conservatives and Liberal Alliance ‚Äì last week announced their joint support for Cameron‚Äôs bid to renegotiate the terms of Britain‚Äôs EU membership, in particular with regard to welfare benefits for EU migrants. ‚ÄúWe will stand behind Great Britain and like-minded nations‚Äô efforts to ensure that the EU doesn‚Äôt turn into a social union,‚Äù said the statement, titled Danish Welfare in Europe. ‚ÄúWe want an EU where people can go wherever workers are needed, but we don‚Äôt want an EU where people go wherever the social benefits are good,‚Äù Rasmussen said. A win for the centre-left in Denmark would be a much needed boost for Social Democrats in Europe who have had a miserable time in recent years, losing elections in the UK and Germany while facing disastrous poll ratings in France and Sweden. However, Sweden‚Äôs centre-left, which also holds power, were so unhappy with their Danish colleagues‚Äô position on immigration that the party decided to break with tradition and not to send top officials to the elections, according to Swedish newspaper Expressen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T18:52:57Z,world,World news,Euclid Tsakalotos: Greece's secret weapon in credit negotiations,"For those who thought the battle to save Greece was all about a rag tag bunch of leftists finally seeing the light, Euclid Tsakalotos has made many think again. At the eleventh hour, the Oxford-educated economist has emerged as Athens‚Äô secret weapon, sounding every inch the man he was raised to be: a public school member of the British establishment. ‚ÄúIt is rather surprising to the other side,‚Äù he says, the Greek parliament framed in the window of his eighth floor office. ‚ÄúBut so, too, is the fact that I understand their economic arguments.‚Äù Phlegmatic, professorial, mild-mannered, Tsakalotos has spent the best part of 30 years in the ivory towers of Britain and Greece ‚Äúengaging critically‚Äù with neoclassical economic thinking.
No other training could have prepared him better for his role as the point man in negotiations between Athens and the international creditors propping up its near-bankrupt economy. ‚ÄúThe fact that he also sounds like an aristocrat helps too,‚Äù said an insider in the Syriza party. ‚ÄúHe speaks their language better than they do. At times it‚Äôs been quite amusing to watch.‚Äù The son of a civil engineer who worked in the well-heeled world of Greek shipping, Tsakalotos was born in Rotterdam in 1960. When his family relocated to London, he was immediately enrolled at the exclusive London private school St Paul‚Äôs. A place at Oxford, where he studied PPE, ensued. The hurly burly world of radical left politics could not have been further away. ‚ÄúMy grandfather‚Äôs cousin was general Thrasyvoulos Tsakalotos who led the other side, the wrong side, in the Greek civil war,‚Äù he said of the bloody conflict that pitted communists against rightists between 1946-49. ‚ÄúHe expressed the fear that I might end up as a liberal, certainly not anything further to the left.‚Äù Tsakalotos, who has written six books including The Crucible of Resistance, an analysis of Greece at the forefront of Europe‚Äôs economic crisis, embraced the left at Oxford when he joined the student wing of Greece‚Äôs euro communist party. What goaded him more than anything else was the treatment of the Greek left ‚Äì who had led the resistance movement against Nazi occupation ‚Äì after the second world war. ‚ÄúGreeks have had a lot to resist, civil war, dictatorship, authoritarianism,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut perhaps the most terrible thing was the unfairness with which the left was treated in the postwar period. We were the only nation where people who had participated in what had been a very important resistance movement were treated like pariahs while those who had collaborated with the Germans had it good. It was just so wrong.‚Äù When he moved to Greece, with his Scottish wife in the early 1990s, he signed up with Synaspismos, the party that would become the central plank of Syriza. The anti-globalisation movement convinced him that there was a large segment of society that felt it was not expressed by political elites ‚Äì one of Syriza‚Äôs many mantras. Like many on the Greek left, he believes Athens‚Äô anti-austerity government speaks for the growing numbers across Europe who, subjected to the brutal vagaries of the market, feel excluded from decision-making. With the understatement of an English gentleman, Tsakalotos admits that in his new position he is losing sleep. On Wednesday he declared that it would be nigh impossible for Greece to keep honouring its debts without a new cash-for-reform deal. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve squeezed all sources of liquidity from the wider public sector. At some point very soon the money will come to an end,‚Äù he said insisting that precisely because it had sequestered funds, the government had proved it was sincere about wanting a deal. ‚ÄúSyriza does not have a mandate to take Greece out of the eurozone, nor does it have a mandate to apply unworkable austerity. What we need is a deal that is viable, a deal that is good for Europe and Greece.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T18:36:18Z,world,World news,Why Greece might now have the upper hand in crunch talks,"Greece knows it. The International Monetary Fund knows it. Every European finance minister knows it. After the latest failure to secure a deal at the meeting of finance ministers in Luxembourg, the crisis is coming to a head. The unescapable facts are that between Monday and Wednesday, some ‚Ç¨2bn (¬£1.43bn) left the Greek banking system ‚Äì more than the ‚Ç¨1.1bn in additional emergency financing provided by the European Central Bank this week. The banks are losing around 0.5% of their deposits each day and cannot sustain losses of this sort. They are on the brink of collapse. Greek public finances also look dire, with tax revenues 24% below target in May. The government is balancing the books ‚Äì but only by not paying its bills. There will be an emergency summit of eurozone leaders on Monday, but by then it may already be too late. Capital controls look inevitable to stem the outflow from the banks and could be needed before the weekend after the latest setback. Athens has already said it will be unable to pay the IMF at the end of the month unless it gets some immediate financial assistance. There was little evidence in Luxembourg of a deal, no sign even that either side was adopting a more emollient approach. The idea that Greece might be offered a grace period after its debts become due to the IMF was rejected by Christine Lagarde. The fund‚Äôs managing director could not have been clearer: ‚ÄúI have a deadline, which is 30 June, when a payment is due from Greece. If 1 July it‚Äôs not paid, it‚Äôs not paid.‚Äù
Meanwhile in Athens, the government said it was preparing for the return of the drachma. ‚ÄúIf we are forced to say the big no, the difficulties will last for a few months‚Äù, said the social security minister, Dimitris Stratoulis. ‚ÄúBut the consequences will be much worse for Europe.‚Äù This is a reasonable point. Throughout the crisis, the IMF, the ECB and the European commission have been negotiating from what they perceive as a position of strength. That‚Äôs because traditionally debtors do what creditors tell them. But not this time. There have been four big factors that have allowed Alexis Tsipras to run rings round Angela Merkel. The first is that being flat broke can sometimes help. When a country has suffered as much as Greece has in the past five years, telling it that life will be awfully bad outside the eurozone is not that much of a threat. Tsipras‚Äôs second big advantage is the risk that a Greek default followed by a Greek departure from the euro would cause collateral damage. For the past six months, the commission and the ECB has been insisting that Europe is in a much better position to cope with a Grexit than it was two or three years ago. The ECB has a mechanism for providing help if the financial markets threaten other eurozone countries seen as vulnerable. The eurozone economy has returned to growth. This, though, has always looked overoptimistic. Once one country has gone from the euro, there is no reason why another should not follow. As soon as one of the remaining members of the single currency ran into trouble, it would be dubbed the ‚Äúnext Greece‚Äù. And there are countries that would be contenders for that role: Italy is one ‚Äì where per capita incomes are no higher than they were at the end of the 1990s and the debt burden onerous.
Tsipras and his finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, have played this game of chicken with some skill. Sure, they have said to the troika, you can pull the plug on us. But by doing so, you are likely to cause damage to both the European and the wider global economy. Greece could be to 2015 what Lehman Brothers was to 2008. Are you ready for that? The way Greece has negotiated has been the third factor in their favour. Europe has always worked on a fairly consensual basis, with ministers from the centre right and the centre left getting together to do deals. Poses are sometime struck, but that is always a prelude to a bit of give and take. Tsipras and Varoufakis have played by different rules. They come from a different, radical left political tradition and have stuck to their argument that Greece has suffered enough punishment. They know that the Syriza coalition would be finished if it buckled to the demands of the troika. One comparison is with Ken Livingstone in the 1980s, a charismatic figure who took great delight in tweaking the nose of the Thatcher government.
In the end, Thatcher dealt with her Livingstone problem by abolishing the GLC. The fourth big thing Tsipras has going for him is that he knows Merkel is reluctant to do what would be the equivalent: kicking Greece out of the euro. She does not want to be the German chancellor who puts European integration into reverse. A deal is still possible, although the chances of an almighty mess are getting bigger by the hour. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup, said after the Luxembourg meeting that it was up to Greece to come up with credible proposals, but if anybody is going to blink on Monday the smart money should be on the creditors. As Bob Dylan once said: ‚ÄúWhen you ain‚Äôt got nothing, you got nothing to lose.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ This article was amended on 19 June 2015. An earlier version quoted Bob Dylan as saying: ‚ÄúWhen you have nothing, you have nothing to lose.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T18:22:20Z,world,World news,Charleston church shooting: Obama calls for gun control in wake of tragedy,"A frustrated Barack Obama appeared almost to run out of words to describe his reaction to the racially charged killings in Charleston, revealing that he personally knew the pastor of the church and calling again for gun control reforms.
‚ÄúTo say our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families, and their community doesn‚Äôt say enough to convey the heartache and the sadness and the anger that we feel,‚Äù said the usually loquacious president in a brief, six-minute White House statement. Though less visibly emotional than he had been after the Newtown school shootings in Connecticut, a numbed Obama also sought to differentiate the latest, racially charged, attack as an example of a ‚Äúparticular threat to our democracy‚Äù. ‚ÄúI have had to make statements like this too many times,‚Äù he said on Thursday, flanked by a sombre-looking vice-president Joe Biden. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have all the facts but we do know that once again innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun,‚Äù added Obama.
‚ÄúAt some point we will have to deal with the fact that this kind of mass violence doesn‚Äôt happen in other countries and it is in our power to do something about it.‚Äù The president said: ‚ÄúAny death of this sort is a tragedy ‚Ä¶ Any shooting involving multiple victims is a tragedy. There is something particularly heartbreaking about the death happening in a place in which we seek solace and we seek peace, in a place of worship.‚Äù Though saying he could not comment too much on the ongoing criminal inquiry, the president did not shy away from the political ramifications of the attack. ‚ÄúThe fact that this took place in a black church obviously also raises questions about a dark part of our history. This is not the first time that black churches have been attacked. And we know that hatred across races and faiths pose a particular threat to our democracy and our ideals.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe good news is I am confident that the outpouring of unity and strength and fellowship and love across Charleston today, from all races, from all faiths, from all places of worship indicates the degree to which those old vestiges of hatred can be overcome.‚Äù The president also quoted Martin Luther King‚Äôs response to the 1963 bombing of a church in Alabama in which the civil rights leader said: ‚ÄúWe must be concerned not just with who murdered them, but the way of life, the philosophy that produced the murderers.‚Äù Obama is estimated to have made 14 such statements in response to mass shootings during his six years as president but failed in his attempt to pass gun control legislation through Congress after Newtown and has also been criticised by some for failing to make a strong enough response to a spate of recent black police shootings. Later vice-president Biden and his wife Jill put out a joint statement, saying ‚Äúthe senseless actions of a coward have once again cut short so many lives with so much promise‚Äù. ‚ÄúOur hearts ache with sorrow with the entire Emanuel AME Church family as they seek solace and comfort in the shadow of a gunman‚Äôs act of pure evil and hatred,‚Äù the statement read. The Bidens said they last saw Clementa Pinckney, the pastor and state senator who was one of those killed in the attack, less than a year ago at a prayer breakfast in Columbia. ‚ÄúHe was a good man, a man of faith, a man of service who carried forward Mother Emaunel‚Äôs legacy as a sacred place promoting freedom, equality, and justice for all. We pray for him and his sister as we do for the seven other innocent souls who entered that storied church for their weekly Bible study seeking nothing more than humble guidance for the full lives ahead of them.‚Äù The statement also called for gun control. ‚ÄúWe have no doubt the coward who committed this heinous act will be brought to justice. But as a nation we must confront the ravages of gun violence and the stain of hatred that continues to be visited on our streets, in our schools, in our houses of worship, and in our communities.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T18:10:02Z,world,World news,Charleston church shooting: 21-year-old suspect captured as 'holy city' mourns,"The 21-year-old white man suspected of opening fire and killing nine people during a prayer service at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, has been taken into custody after one of the deadliest attacks on an American place of worship in years. Police said on Thursday that 21-year-old Dylann Storm Roof had been captured during a traffic stop in Shelby, North Carolina, about 250 miles north of Charleston, South Carolina, where he is alleged to have carried out a mass shooting that left ‚Äúa broken peace‚Äù at a moment of increased volatility over race and gun violence in America.
‚ÄúNow is the time for mourning,‚Äù Barack Obama said at the White House. ‚ÄúBut, let‚Äôs be clear: at some point, we as a country will have to reconcile the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn‚Äôt happen in other places with this kind of frequency.‚Äù The president said the massacre should ‚Äúshift how we think about the issue of gun violence‚Äù, as this southern ‚Äúholy city‚Äù once again found itself at the epicentre of international attention just weeks after a fatal police shooting in nearby North Charleston. ‚ÄúWe woke up today and the heart and soul of South Carolina was broken,‚Äù South Carolina‚Äôs governor, Nikki Haley, said as she fought back tears at a press conference. ‚ÄúWe allow ourselves to grieve, we allow ourselves to pray, we allow ourselves to question and then we allow ourselves to heal.‚Äù Roof was stopped by Shelby police officers because a suspicious citizen reported the vehicle, the Charleston police chief, Greg Mullen, said on Thursday at a press conference. He was arrested and taken into custody at about 11.30am on Thursday, Mullen said, after he allegedly opened fire on Wednesday at an evening prayer service at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church, after reportedly sitting through it for more than an hour. Law enforcement officials said they had no reason to believe there were other assailants involved.
Among the dead were the church‚Äôs pastor, Clementa Pinckney ‚Äì a Democrat in the South Carolina senate who had fought for gun-control legislation and body cameras ‚Äì as well as his sister. The youngest victim of the mass killing was identified as Tywanza Sanders, a 2014 graduate of the division of business administration at Allen University in Columbia, South Carolina, the school confirmed to the Guardian. Other victims fatally wounded in the attack include Cynthia Hurd, a manager at the Charleston County public library and Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, a speech therapist and high school track coach. Ethel Lance, and her cousin, Susie Jackson, both longtime members of the church, were identified by family members as victims of the attack, according to the local Post & Courier newspaper. Mullen said previously that Roof sat among the congregation at Emanuel AME for nearly one hour before opening fire on the other attendants, killing six women and three men. Authorities said they did not yet know the motive for the attack, but the US justice department‚Äôs civil rights division, along with the FBI and the US attorney‚Äôs office, launched a formal inquiry into a potential hate crime.
Mullen also said there were three survivors of the attack, but refused to discuss reports that the gunman had allowed one woman to escape. ‚ÄúWe want to make sure during our interview process we get real information from the suspect and not through something that has been posted online or through a story,‚Äù he said. Riley, the mayor, said at an earlier news conference that the community in Charleston was one that ‚Äúhonours our religious institutions and respects the different cultures and beliefs‚Äù. He referred to the town as ‚Äúthe holy city‚Äù, one where ‚Äúall the church spires reach out into the sky, including Emanuel AME church where this horrific crime occurred‚Äù. He said he had spent the night hugging as many victims‚Äô families as he could. ‚ÄúThis horrible, hateful person going to a church and killing people there to pray and worship with each other is something that is beyond incomprehensible and is not explained,‚Äù he said. He added that the Emanuel AME church and other African American churches had been important to the social fabric of Charleston society for hundreds of years. ‚ÄúWe can catch this no good, horrible person and see that he pays the price, and then we‚Äôll put our arms around that church and that church family,‚Äù he said.
On 26 April, during an event hosted by Emanuel AME, Pinckney introduced several speakers including US congressman Jim Clyburn. During an opening prayer, he asked for guidance to root out violence, bigotry and racism. ‚ÄúWe know that only love can conquer hate, that only love can bring all together in our name,‚Äù Pinckney said at the time. ‚ÄúIrregardless of our faiths, our ethnicities, where we are from, together we come in love. Together we come to bury racism, to bury bigotry and to resurrect and revive love, compassion and tenderness.‚Äù Pinckney helped lead a prayer vigil in April for Walter Scott, the unarmed black South Carolina man who was shot dead by a North Charleston police officer. He campaigned for police to be equipped with body cameras, which he said ‚Äúmay not be the golden ticket, the golden egg, the end-all-fix-all, but [would help] to paint a picture of what happens during a police stop‚Äù. Mandatory body cameras became law in the state one week ago. Thomas Dixon, a pastor who has been working with a local chapter of the Black Lives Matter movement, told the Guardian in Charleston that he had met Pinckney in the wake of Scott‚Äôs death. Dixon said that in the wake of the latest shooting, he was ‚Äúdisheartened but not surprised‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt is a sign of the times,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhereas in the past we were able to say there were safe havens for people where they could be treated well and respected, unfortunately in today‚Äôs world we have no more safe havens.‚Äù Area religious leaders in this tight-knit community responded to the shooting with overwhelming grief and increased security. Greg Surratt, founding pastor of the multi-campus Seacoast church, said pastors from his church would be be serving with the Charleston Coastal Chaplaincy and attending community prayer services for the city. ‚ÄúWe put our trust in [God] and are praying for the deliverance of the Lord,‚Äù Surratt said. Jerod Frazier, minister of social justice at the predominately black Charity Missionary Baptist church in neighboring North Charleston, said Emanuel AME has always played an important role in the black community in Charleston. He said his church would have a lookout posted at the door of the church on Sunday mornings ‚Äúuntil [the gunman] is apprehended and maybe even thereafter‚Äù. Frazier said he also worried about the future of race relations in the region. ‚ÄúThe thing I hate about it is Sunday morning is the most segregated hour across America, but especially in the south ‚Äì you can clearly tell who‚Äôs a visitor and who‚Äôs not if someone of another race comes in,‚Äù Frazier says. ‚ÄúWe consider that to be a sacred time, and this threatens that peace.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf someone black goes into a white church or someone white goes to a traditionally black church, heads are going to turn around and say, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs going on now?‚Äô It‚Äôs kind of a broken peace, if you will ‚Äì a disturbance of peace.‚Äù Eight of the victims were killed in the church. Another died on the way to hospital. Police have not named the victims. The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church traces its roots to 1816 and is one of the largest black congregations south of Baltimore. The Reverend Martin Luther King Jr addressed the church in 1962. Presidential candidate Jeb Bush has cancelled a planned trip to the state, and the South Carolina legislature has suspended a sitting planned for Thursday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T17:44:44Z,world,World news,Eurozone talks end without deal as Greek proposals rejected,"Talks to end the debt crisis that has engulfed Greece broke up early on Thursday, despite Athens presenting a raft of new reform proposals to eurozone finance ministers in a bid to secure a deal. A summit of eurozone leaders was immediately called for Monday in a bid to find a solution to the mounting crisis. The Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, talked for half an hour at the Luxembourg meeting and distributed a five-page memorandum of fresh policy changes, according to sources at the meeting, but failed to persuade the debt-stricken country‚Äôs creditors that they could form the basis for an agreement. The failure to find common ground at the eurogroup meeting of finance ministers will heap pressure on a summit of European leaders next week only days ahead of a debt repayment deadline that Athens must meet to avoid defaulting on its mountain of debts. A senior EU official taking part in the meeting told the Guardian that Monday‚Äôs summit was convened as soon as EU leaders learned of the collapse of the Luxembourg talks. The spectre of a Greek banking collapse under the weight of withdrawals prompted eurozone heads of government to meet on Monday, he said. Earlier, International Monetary Fund boss Christine Lagarde ruled out any further delay to ‚Ç¨1.6bn of loan repayments due from Greece by the end of the month, raising the pressure on Athens as eurozone finance ministers gathered in Luxembourg to discuss the growing crisis. Lagarde said there would be ‚Äúno grace period or possibility of delay‚Äù to loan payments that are due on 30 June. It follows a series of threats by the debt-stricken Greek government that it would be unable to pay without a deal with Brussels and the IMF to provide extra funds. Lagarde said the leftist Syriza administration would need to concede over making further reforms to its pension system to get a deal, something prime minister Alexis Tsipras has refused to countenance.
Writing in German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel, Tsipras said pensioners had become the main breadwinners in many families, meaning cuts in pension payments would increase poverty. Tsipras is under pressure to agree a compromise deal after Greek banks struggled to cope with the loss of ‚Ç¨2bn in deposits this week. Optimism that a deal could be forged began to evaporate last weekend, triggering a rush by customers to take out funds. But the IMF and Brussels want further cuts to bring down the cost of pensions, which account for 13% of GDP, with further restrictions on early retirement and lower supplementary pension payments. Greek negotiators have ruled out cuts in pensions, saying there is a reform plan that reduces costs dramatically over the next 10 years. The gathering of finance ministers from the currency bloc‚Äôs 19 member states was due to discuss the gulf between Athens and its creditors, officials in Brussels said.
The Greekchief negotiator, Euclid Tsakalotos, warned on the BBC‚Äôs Today programme on Radio 4 this morning that ‚ÄúIf Greece goes out, the euro might break down.‚Äù He said: ‚ÄúOnce one country has left, you change a monetary union into a fixed exchange rate system, where it‚Äôs a cost-benefit analysis whether another country leaves. ‚ÄúMy greatest fear is that the break-up of the euro will return [us] to the competitive devaluations, and the nationalisms, and the kind of politics we had in the 1930s.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúIf we have don‚Äôt [have a deal], we have to go to the Greek people because we have no mandate to leave the euro, and that would be a very bad eventuality.‚Äù EU commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, who has voiced some sympathy for Athens, said earlier: ‚ÄúToday is an important date and I have no desire to see us return to the age of Waterloo when the Europeans were all lined up against a single state.‚Äù The Greek stock market has slumped 17% in a week after the country reached an impasse with its troika of lenders ‚Äì the European commission, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and European Central Bank (ECB).
A war of words between the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, and the troika has become further inflamed after he accused the IMF this week of ‚Äúcriminal responsibility‚Äù for the situation and said lenders were seeking to ‚Äúhumiliate‚Äù his country. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, responded that he had ‚Äúsympathy for the Greek people but not the Greek government‚Äù. Juncker was until recently viewed as one of Tsipras‚Äôs few allies. Informal talks could take place over the weekend ahead of next week‚Äôs summit after the ECB threw Athens a lifeline by raising the maximum emergency funding that Greek banks can obtain by ‚Ç¨1.1bn (¬£790m). The increase, which brought the overall ceiling on emergency liquidity assistance to ‚Ç¨84.1bn, came after a stark warning from the Bank of Greece that the country could crash out of the eurozone in an ‚Äúuncontrollable crisis‚Äù unless it can conclude loan talks with its creditors by the end of the month.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-18T17:15:35Z,world,World news,US Catholics ready to follow Pope's 'marching orders' on climate change,"Leaders of the Catholic church in America took their ‚Äúmarching orders‚Äù from the pope‚Äôs encyclical on Thursday, fanning out to Congress and the White House to push for action on climate change. The high-level meetings offered a first glimpse of a vast and highly organised effort by the leadership of America‚Äôs nearly 80 million Catholics to turn the pope‚Äôs moral call for action into reality. ‚ÄúIt is our marching orders for advocacy,‚Äù Joseph Kurtz, the president of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Archbishop of Louisville, said. ‚ÄúIt really brings about a new urgency for us.‚Äù Representatives of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops said they would hold two briefings for members of Congress on Thursday and visit the White House on Friday to promote and explain the pope‚Äôs environmental message. Those efforts will get a new injection of urgency, when the pope delivers a much-anticipated address to Congress during his visit to the US in September, church leaders said. Church leaders rejected the accusations from some conservatives ‚Äì including the Republican presidential contender Jeb Bush ‚Äì that the pope had trespassed into the political realm. Within the US, the pope‚Äôs call for climate action brought an outpouring of support from religious leaders, environmental, social justice and public health groups, scientists, and Democrats.
Religious leaders said the message from an extremely popular Pope Francis would add new urgency to the church‚Äôs existing support for a number of environmental measures in Barack Obama‚Äôs climate plan ‚Äì including the new rules limiting carbon pollution from power plants, due to be finalised this summer. ‚ÄúI believe this is potentially the game changer we have all been waiting for,‚Äù said the Reverend Canon Sally Bingham, founder of Interfaith Power & Light, which campaigns for action on climate change. ‚ÄúI really think it will change enough minds to get the critical mass we need to get our house in order and cut greenhouse gas emissions.‚Äù The advocacy group, Presente.org, said the pope‚Äôs message hit close to home for Latinos in the US and elsewhere, who often live in poor and heavily polluted neighbourhoods. The pope‚Äôs message also resonated strongly among activist priests and nuns, who have lobbied oil companies and called on their own parishes to divest. The encyclical puts the Vatican‚Äôs stamp of approval on years of effort, often at the side lines, and that on its own had galvanised campaigners, said Sister Joan Brown, a Franciscan in New Mexico who has worked on climate change for more than 20 years. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything like this in the faith community or otherwise,‚Äù she said. The release of the much-awaited climate message puts a trigger on a series of events that were more than a year in the planning. In Atlanta, the archbishop‚Äôs office used the encyclical to sign up scientists and engineers to help parishes, and parishioners, reduce their carbon footprint. The bishop of Des Moines is planning to hold a press conference at a wind farm. Meanwhile, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Catholic Climate Covenant were producing primers to help parish priests incorporate the pope‚Äôs environmental message in their Sunday sermons, church officials said. Religious leaders deflected criticism from Bush that the pope had strayed too far from the pulpit. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he is presenting a blueprint for saying this is exactly a step-by-step recipe,‚Äù Kurtz said. ‚ÄúHe is providing a framework and a moral call as a true moral leader to say take seriously the urgency of this matter.‚Äù Richard Cizik, who was dismissed as lobbyist for the National Association of Evangelicals after calling for climate action, said the pope was simply doing his duty as a religious leader. ‚ÄúIt is our responsibility to do what is right, even if it is unpopular,‚Äù he said. Francis included a handwritten note on the embargoed copies of his letter that were distributed to bishops around the world ‚Äì putting a further weight on the sense of urgency. The text also began with scientific data. ‚ÄúIt saves the encyclical from being dismissed simply as an abstract impression,‚Äù said Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the archbishop of Washington. ‚ÄúWhat our holy father is lifting up is a series of acts that beg for some coherent moral analysis, some direction for the good of all on the planet and for the planet itself.‚Äù The push for the pope‚Äôs climate message ‚Äì as already defined by the US Conference on Catholic Bishops ‚Äì includes support for three specific policy measures. These include the Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs rules for new power plants, which are vigorously opposed by the fossil fuel industry and Republicans, the Green Climate Fund for developing countries, also opposed by Republicans, and an energy efficiency bill before Congress, which has bipartisan support. ‚ÄúThat there ought to be a national carbon standard we think is a good thing because it would help protect the poor people who live near the power plants,‚Äù said Stephen Colecchi, director of the office of international justice and peace at the US Conference of Bishops. Those efforts in the US could also boost prospects for the climate negotiations in Paris, he noted. ‚ÄúAdopting a national carbon standard and funding a Green Climate Fund are two things the US could put on the table which would help achieve a climate agreement,‚Äù he said. Erniz Moniz, the energy secretary, said the pope‚Äôs call to action would also spur other countries to act on the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. ‚ÄúPope Francis should inspire all countries to redouble the deployment of clean energy technologies and energy efficiencies and find the international will to significantly cut global emissions of heat-trapping pollution,‚Äù he said. The World Coal Association ‚Äì while refraining from the direct attacks on Francis made by coalmining companies in the US ‚Äì called on the pope to endorse research on cleaner coal technologies. Campaign groups said they hoped the pope‚Äôs intervention would reset the parameters of the discussion surrounding climate change, from narrow political agenda to broader morality. ‚ÄúThe pope‚Äôs message applies to all of us,‚Äù said Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ‚ÄúHe is imploring people of goodwill everywhere to honour our moral obligation to protect future generations from the dangers of further climate chaos by embracing our ethical duty to act,‚Äù she said. Andrew Steer, the chief executive of the World Resources Institute, said the message was a call to action for world leaders ahead of the Paris climate talks. ‚ÄúThe pope‚Äôs message brings moral clarity that the world‚Äôs leaders must come together to address this urgent human challenge,‚Äù he said. Ray Bradley, the climate scientist, said: ‚ÄúHe has no political agenda. He speaks from the heart. Who else can address this issue without the taint of politics.‚Äù The Evangelical Environmental Network also came out strongly behind the pope. More than 300 rabbis signed a letter calling on Jewish institutions and individuals to divest from ‚Äúcarbon Pharaohs‚Äù or coal-based electric power, and buy wind power instead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T17:00:12Z,world,World news,Iranian journalist launches project highlighting persecution of colleagues,"Most fathers do not have to escape the clutches of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards to be present at the birth of their first child. Arrested, tortured and imprisoned for months in Tehran‚Äôs notorious Evin prison, Maziar Bahari arrived home in London just two days before the birth of his daughter, Marianna, after a 118-day incarceration that saw Hillary Clinton campaign for his release. Bahari‚Äôs story has since become the subject of the feature film Rosewater, American comedian Jon Stewart‚Äôs directorial debut, in which Gael Garc√≠a Bernal reenacts the events of June 2009. Excruciatingly thrilling as Bahari‚Äôs story may be, it is certainly not unique. Jason Rezaian, a journalist for the Washington Post, is facing trial in an Iranian revolutionary court for charges including espionage and ‚Äúspreading propaganda against the regime‚Äù. His case is being heard by Abolghassem Salavati, known as the ‚Äújudge of death‚Äù for his notoriously severe punishments. Rezaian could face 20 years in prison if convicted.
Rezaian is among hundreds of journalists, bloggers and social media activists that are intimidated, imprisoned and tortured by the Iranian intelligence services, and Bahari is using his freedom to fight back. In an effort to hold Iran‚Äôs government to account for persecuting journalists, he has launched Journalism is not a Crime, an initiative that aims to document the history of human rights abuses against journalists since the modern Iranian state was created in 1905. The advocacy group also provides legal and psychological assistance to journalists targeted by the state. ‚ÄúI wish I could have done it five years ago when I came out of prison,‚Äù Bahari said. ‚ÄúI wish I could have started it a long time ago, but these things need money, a team.‚Äù Processing the agony of solitary confinement and blindfold beatings was made easier by the therapy and legal support he received after his return to London, but the award-winning journalist knows this is a luxury rarely afforded to the hundreds of persecuted journalists in Iran. Since its launch less than a week ago, Journalism is Not a Crime‚Äôs Persian-speaking support team has assisted about 20 people, adding many names to its database of persecuted journalists and bloggers. ‚ÄúWe are finding more people in remote areas of Iran who have been arrested since 2009. At least a quarter of the people we have listed on the site, people did not know about,‚Äù Bahari said.
He has formed a close relationship with Jon Stewart, the former Daily Show host, since they met when Bahari covered the controversial 2009 Iranian general elections. Bahari‚Äôs part in a sketch for the hit show was later used by Iran as proof that he was spying for the CIA, Mossad and MI6, a charge he was subsequently forced to admit on Iranian television. Despite international optimism about Hassan Rouhani‚Äôs government when it was elected in 2013, the arrests and prosecutions of journalists in Iran have continued. Failing to reinstate the 4,000-member Association of Iranian Journalists has drawn particular criticism, something Rouhani had promised to do while campaigning. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) highlights censorship of the internet as particularly prevalent, ranking Iran among the 10 most censored countries in the world, alongside China, Vietnam, Azerbaijan and Eritrea. It would not be a surprise if the authorities in Iran soon blocked access to Journalism is Not a Crime website. But the team behind it is confident people would find a way to bypass the filters, as they do with other blocked addresses. Through the use of proxys and VPNs, Iranians successfully circumnavigate state censors that have blocked sites such as Facebook and Twitter. ‚ÄúWe want to put names to faces, we want to give names to statistics and we want to show the world, specifically the Iranian government, that the journalists they arrest are mothers, fathers and sisters,‚Äù Bahari said. ‚ÄúThey are not just numbers.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T16:44:04Z,world,World news,Charleston shooting church has rich history from slave revolts to civil rights,"They call it Mother Emanuel. Home to the oldest black congregation south of Baltimore, the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston, South Carolina, has been a key part of the rich history of the American south, from slave revolts in the early 19th century to the civil rights movement.
‚ÄúWhere you are is a very special place in Charleston,‚Äù the Reverend Clementa Pinckney, who was killed in the attack on the church on Wednesday, told a group of doctoral students in 2013. ‚ÄúThis site, this area, has been tied to the history and life of African Americans since the early 1800s.‚Äù On Wednesday evening a new, bleak chapter in this rich history was written, when Pinckney and eight congregants were gunned down in cold blood at a basement Bible-study class. The attack, which police are calling a hate crime, carries troubling echoes of the past. ‚ÄúIf [the shooter] was a white supremacist then he‚Äôs picked a target that‚Äôs incredibly symbolic in the black community. He‚Äôs hit at the very heart of it,‚Äù said Tim Lockley, a professor of American history at Warwick University who specialises in race relations. Mother Emanuel was born into an era of violence. In 1822, just four years after the first church was built, a freed slave and carpenter named Denmark Vesey, one of the founders of the Emanuel church, was the ringleader of a vast planned slave insurrection known as ‚Äúthe rising‚Äù.
Vesey and his alleged co-conspirators were betrayed and rounded up by Charleston authorities. The city convened a secret kangaroo court, and he and 34 others were swiftly hanged. Thirty more were deported, and white supremacists burned the old wooden church to the ground. In 1834, the city of Charleston banned all-black churches. The congregation of Emanuel, which had been rebuilt since the Vesey trials, were forced to meet in secret until the end of the civil war. After reconstruction, the congregation began to grow, and its importance for the black Christian community in Charleston grew along with it.
Booker T Washington spoke there in 1909; Dr Martin Luther King‚Äôs gave a speech at Emanuel there urging congregants to vote in 1962. In 1969, almost exactly a year after King‚Äôs death, his widow Coretta Scott King led a protest to the church; 900 were arrested by the national guard. Barack Obama said on Thursdau that he and his wife Michelle knew members of the Emanuel congregation, and that they knew the Rev Pinckney. ‚ÄúMother Emanuel is in fact more than a church,‚Äù the president said. ‚ÄúThis is a place of worship that was founded by African-Americans seeking liberty. This is a church that was burned to the ground because its worshippers worked to end slavery.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is a sacred place in the history of Charleston, and the history of America,‚Äù he said. Mother Emanuel has seen death, cruelty and despair. In his speech to the doctoral candidates, Pinckney said that the church was a ‚Äúbeacon, and a bearer of the culture, and a bearer of what makes us people‚Äù. Like America, he said, it was about freedom. ‚ÄúFreedom to worship ‚Ä¶ freedom to be all God intends you to be,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSometimes you gotta make noise to do that. ‚ÄúSometimes,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúyou maybe have to die, like Denmark Vesey, to do that.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T16:22:22Z,world,World news,"UK invites Egypt's Abdel Fatah al-Sisi for talks, Downing Street confirms","David Cameron has invited Egypt‚Äôs president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi for talks in the UK, Downing Street has confirmed, despite widespread concern about the former army chief‚Äôs authoritarianism and human rights record. The prime minister‚Äôs official spokeswoman said No 10 was looking at opportunities for a meeting in the UK. On Wednesday an Egyptian court upheld a death sentence against Sisi‚Äôs predecessor Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood. Sisi led the coup that overthrew Morsi in 2013.‚ÄúWe have been looking at the possibility of President al-Sisi coming to have bilateral talks with the prime minister later this year,‚Äù the spokeswoman said.
Hassiba Hadj Sahraou, Amnesty International‚Äôs Middle East and North Africa deputy director, described the invitation as astonishing and short-sighted given the ‚Äúappalling‚Äù human rights violations taking place in Egypt. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a sharp rise in the number of death sentences and executions since Sisi came to power, some of which have taken place after grossly unfair trials. Thousands have been detained and many languish in jail, including journalists, in an apparent attempt to quash all dissenting voices,‚Äù Sahraou said. ‚ÄúWe want to see David Cameron personally raising human rights issues in any face-to-face talks with President Sisi, and we also want to see these issues addressed in public.‚Äù Asked about Sisi‚Äôs record on human rights, Cameron‚Äôs spokeswoman said: ‚ÄúI think the prime minister has talked before about how it is important that we engage with countries where there are issues which are important to the UK‚Äôs national interest and how we can work together. Where we engage with these countries of course we can raise matters of concern. No issues are off the table.‚Äù On Wednesday, Lady Anelay, a Foreign Office minister in the Lords, said Britain had raised its concerns about the situation in Egypt with the country‚Äôs ambassador in London. ‚ÄúWe raise our human rights concerns regularly with representatives of the Egyptian government,‚Äù Anelay said. ‚Äú[Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood] raised our concerns over the sentencing to death of over 100 individuals, including former President Morsi, with the Egyptian ambassador in London. Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials have also discussed this case and other human rights concerns with representatives of the Egyptian government.‚Äù Since coming to power, Sisi has outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, saying it poses a grave threat to national security. The group maintains it is committed to peaceful activism.
The UK government commissioned a report on the Muslim Brotherhood last year but it has still not been published. A spokesman said it would be released ‚Äúin due course‚Äù. Morsi became Egypt‚Äôs first democratically elected president in 2012, but was overthrown by the army in 2013 after widespread protests against his leadership. The current regime then launched a crackdown against Morsi‚Äôs supporters in which more than 1,400 people were killed and thousands detained. Restrictions were also introduced on freedom of expression, association and assembly. Legal specialists told the Guardian in December that Egypt was enacting authoritarian laws at a rate unmatched by any regime for 60 years. In Cairo, Mohamed Lotfy, the executive director of the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, said: ‚ÄúEgyptians have expressed multiple times their aspirations to live in dignity and freedom. This aspiration is not being met by the current government and was not met by previous governments either. ‚ÄúThe visit is an opportunity for the UK to remind the Egyptian president of his obligations toward these international human rights conventions and discuss how the UK could help Egypt get out of the human right crisis that it is in now. ‚ÄúAny EU government should keep in mind that its not about normalising with a government, it‚Äôs about normalising with a people who deserve to live in dignity like any people in the world.‚Äù Earlier this month, Egyptian security officials barred Lotfy from travelling to Germany, where he was set to address members of the Bundestag about human rights violations in Egypt ‚Äì a visit scheduled to coincide with Sisi‚Äôs own visit to Berlin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T15:53:37Z,world,World news,Chechen exile in UK fears explusion will mean extradition to Russia,"A prominent Chechen exile, who fled to Britain fearing assassination, has been ordered by the high court to be returned to Sweden, from where he could be forcibly removed to Russia. Masud Dudaev, a friend of the murdered Rusian exile Alexander Litvinenko, and son-in-law of a former Chechen president, arrived in the UK two years ago after Sweden refused to accept his application for political asylum. He and his family are living in London with Ahmed Zakayev, the exiled Chechen nationalist leader who has been granted leave to remain in Britain and who has himself been targeted by a Russian hitman. Dudaev, who held senior positions in the breakaway republic, fled Russia in 2000 following the second Chechen war, subsequently moving between Azerbaijan, Lithuania and Turke before entering Sweden. He left Turkey, the high court judgment said, ‚Äúbecause of assassinations of, and threats to, prominent Chechens‚Äù. The Swedes, however, refused to give the family permission to stay on grounds they had not sought asylum when they lived in Turkey and had been granted new Russian passports since then. The Swedish court doubted that the Dudaevs ‚Äúwould be of interest to Russian authorities if they returned‚Äù. Under the EU asylum rules known as Dublin II applicants usually have to apply for residency in the first EU country they enter. Giving judgment, Lord Justice Burnett said: ‚ÄúSweden is a highly developed democracy governed by the rule of law. This case demonstrates that it has a well functioning system for determining asylum claims ... There is a system which allows fresh applications supported if necessary with court orders preventing removal pending their resolution. Should it be necessary there is access to [the European court of human rights in] Strasbourg with every expectation that Sweden would abide by any interim measures indicated by the Strasbourg court.‚Äù The Home Office, the judge added, was, entitled to come to the conclusion that Sweden would honour its legal obligations to the claimants. Dudaev said: ‚ÄúI have spent my whole adult life working to realise the Chechen people‚Äôs dream of free and independent statehood. Many of my friends and colleagues have been killed, inside and outside Russia, for doing the same. As a result, my family and I have been living in exile for fifteen years. ‚ÄúWhile I respect the authorities of the UK and Sweden, I will exercise every legal possibility to prevent my return to Russia where I know my life, and the lives of my wife and children, would be in grave danger.‚Äù Daniel Furner, of the law firm Birnberg Peirce and partners, who represent Dudaev, said: ‚ÄúMr Dudaev and his family are very disappointed by the court‚Äôs judgment, and will be seeking to appeal. Throughout the long history of this case, in which even more clear evidence of how this family will be treated in Russia has emerged, Sweden has offered no assurance yet that it will reconsider the family‚Äôs asylum claim and give them a fresh right of appeal. My clients have no option but to believe they could be removed quickly from Sweden to Russia without a proper review of their case.‚Äù There was a growing body of evidence about the fate awaiting Dudaev and his family in Russia, Furner added, including a report by Amnesty International which concluded that ‚Äúshould [Dudaev] and his children be returned to the Russian federation they are at real risk of persecution, serious harm or other ill treatment, including enforced disappearance, torture and extrajudicial execution, on account of the [Dudaev‚Äôs] specific profile and past history‚Äù.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T15:47:23Z,world,World news,'A true friend': Ukraine president asks Tony Blair to take on advisory role,"Tony Blair has been offered a role advising Ukraine‚Äôs president after the pair met in Kiev on Wednesday. Blair, whose foundation has long-standing links with a Ukrainian oligarch, is said to be considering the role. ‚ÄúYou are now facing great challenges in the spheres of security and reforms,‚Äù Blair told Petro Poroshenko, according to the Ukrainian presidential website. Poroshenko called Blair a ‚Äútrue friend of Ukraine‚Äù and offered him an advisory role. A source close to Blair declined to comment, and it is unclear whether Blair has accepted the role. It is understood that Blair would not be paid. The former British prime minister attended a private dinner on Wednesday night in Kiev hosted by Ukrainian oligarch Viktor Pinchuk and attended by other Ukrainian business and political figures, in which he was briefed on the current situation in the country and asked how he could help. Blair has spoken a number of times at an annual summit hosted by Pinchuk in the Crimean resort of Yalta. He was the dinner speaker at the most recent event, hosted last September in Kiev because Crimea had been annexed by Russia. Pinchuk‚Äôs foundation paid $500,000 to Blair‚Äôs Faith Foundation in 2011 and 2012, $230,000 in 2013 and $330,000 in 2014 and a spokesperson for Pinchuk confirmed there is a long-term relationship between the two. Pinchuk has hosted several visits by the former prime minister to Ukraine. It would not be the first time Blair has advised the government of a post-Soviet state. While billionaire chocolate magnate Poroshenko says he wants advice on driving through difficult reforms, Blair has been criticised in the past for cosying up to authoritarian governments in the region. As part of his advisory role to Kazakhstan‚Äôs president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, Blair counselled the authoritarian ruler on how to handle criticism over the massacre of oil workers by riot police in 2011. Blair told Nazarbayev in a letter that the deaths, ‚Äútragic though they were, should not obscure the enormous progress that Kazakhstan has made‚Äù. Poroshenko has appointed a number of foreign officials to key roles in his government, most notably naming former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili as governor of Odessa last month. Saakashvili is known for the reforms he carried out in Georgia, but is also a controversial figure despised in Russia and wanted on criminal charges in Georgia. He claims the charges against him are politicised. Saakashvili also sits on Ukraine‚Äôs International Advisory Council for Reforms, the body which Blair has been asked to join, along with former Swedish foreign minister Carl Bildt. US senator John McCain turned down a role with the body, citing US Congress regulations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T14:25:04Z,world,World news,Can the Tbilisi hippo become the symbol of Georgia‚Äôs flood recovery?,"Scenes reminiscent of Noah‚Äôs ark emerged from Tbilisi at the weekend as heavy floods swept through the town and breached the walls of the Georgian capital‚Äôs zoo. Pictures of animals dominated the front pages ‚Äì a freshly tranquillised hippo wandering through the streets; a bear perching on top of an air conditioning unit ‚Äì and the world was gripped by the drama.
By Wednesday an escaped tiger had killed one person and wounded another before being shot by the authorities. Less talked about was the human cost of the disaster. The latest figures suggest 20 people died with several still unaccounted for, with significant damage to the city and an increasingly politicised situation on the ground. Tblisi residents are angry about alleged government incompetence in the aftermath of the floods, and on Wednesday many took to the streets in solidarity with the city‚Äôs zoo keeper, who had been questioned by the police over the tiger attack. Social media is also full of derision for Georgian politicians.
Meanwhile, the hippo has become a symbol for protesters and for fundraising efforts alike.
One of the campaigns adopting the mascot is the Tbilisi Hippo Fund, which will divide donations in half ‚Äì sharing the money between the zoo and the people affected by flooding. ‚ÄúWe thought that the hippo would work as a unifier for people to get behind,‚Äù said Adrian Scoffham, the founder of the fund. ‚ÄúAs often happens with natural catastrophes, infrastructure is damaged and can be repaired‚Äù but the victims are forgotten, he added. They are also planning a benefit concert with Georgian-born singer Katie Melua in London. Another campaign that has proved popular on the crowdfunding website Indiegogo is Help Tbilisi Recover from Flooding, which calls on ‚Äúfriends of Georgia‚Äù to lend their support. Donations will be routed through a local NGO, and founder Maka Meshveliani has promised regular updates on spending. Around a third of the $34,720 (¬£21,835) donated so far has come from the US, with Georgia and the UK in second and third, she said on Facebook.
Despite some rather sensationalist tabloid reporting, Tbilisi residents rallied behind their zoo animals. Photographs of people helping the hippo to safety have been widely shared, revealing significant public sympathy for their plight.
And expect collective sighs of relief after a tweet from an account named @Tbilisihippo showing the world‚Äôs most famous Georgian animal, finally, at rest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T14:00:00Z,world,World news,Mexican soda tax cuts sales of sugary soft drinks by 6% in first year,"A tax on Coca-Cola and other sugar-sweetened drinks in Mexico has succeeded in bringing down sales, which experts hope will help curb the nation‚Äôs obesity problem. The 10% tax was implemented on 1 January 2014 after a battle with the beverage industry. More than 30% of the Mexican population is obese and a love of Coca-Cola and other sugary drinks has been held at least partly responsible. The average Mexican drinks the equivalent of 163 litres of Coca-Cola a year, or nearly half a litre a day. The Mexican National Institute of Public Health and the University of North Carolina have now carried out an evaluation of the impact of the tax, which shows it cut purchases by an average of 6% across 2014, and by as much as 12% in the last part of the year. The effect was greatest on lower-income households, who cut their purchases by an average of 9% across the 12 months, and by 17% in the later months. The impact appears to be similar to that of taxes on tobacco and other goods that are hard to give up, where the drop in sales increases over time. ‚ÄúThis data is relevant given that in Mexico complications from diabetes can lead a family to bankruptcy,‚Äù said Fiorella Espinosa, nutritional health researcher at El Poder del Consumidor, one of the consumer and health groups that campaigned for the tax. ‚ÄúHealth expenditures due to the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages are greatest among the poorest families and can serve as a cause of impoverishment.‚Äù At 10% the tax was lower than campaigners wanted. The campaigners‚Äô umbrella group, the Nutritional Health Alliance, is now calling for an increase to 20%, in line with recommendations from public health experts. They also want VAT abolished on bottled water under 10 litres, to make it cheaper than sugary drinks. The alliance is calling on the government to make good its promise to use the tax revenues raised ‚Äì more than 18bn pesos (¬£745m) in 2014 ‚Äì to ensure there is free drinking water in schools and to introduce other anti-obesity measures. Dr Mike Rayner, of the department of public health at Oxford University, a leading authority on the likely impact of food taxes, said: ‚ÄúMy immediate reaction is that it is great that it is actually working, because we need more examples of this sort of evaluation of actual taxes to confirm what we know from the modelling about these taxes.‚Äù Few such food and drink taxes have been brought in and their critics argue they do not work. However, Rayner said, the Mexican results were in line with predictions. Modelling a tax of 20% or 20p per litre in the UK, Rayner demonstrated in a paper for the British Medical Journal that around 200,000 cases of obesity would be prevented or delayed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs about a 1% drop in obesity, but it makes a lot of difference because obesity is so prevalent across the country,‚Äù he said. France brought in a tax on all soft drinks after the industry objected to a tax on those that are sugar-sweetened. Berkeley in California recently voted to introduce the first soda tax in the USA, after a huge battle with opponents. Proposals to introduce soda taxes elsewhere, such as in New York, have failed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T13:55:16Z,world,World news,Theresa May: Isis luring women and children is pernicious new phenomenon,"The home secretary has said attempts to get women and children to go to Syria are a ‚Äúpernicious new phenomenon‚Äù and directly appealed to those tempted to go by saying: ‚ÄúDo not travel.‚Äù Speaking at a police counter-terrorism conference in London on Thursday, Theresa May said the deadliest threat came from Islamic State (Isis). ‚ÄúThey want to lure young women and families with false promises of starting a new life,‚Äù she said. Her comments came after it emerged that three sisters from Bradford were believed to have travelled to Syria with their nine children. Parts of the country are controlled by Isis. The home secretary said Isis used the ‚Äúpowerful allure‚Äù of propaganda to ‚Äúrecruit and brainwash‚Äù men and women and poison others against western values. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan police commissioner, used the conference to call for more research to understand why people were attracted to a regime many considered barbaric. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to understand more and come up with some structured way of intervening better,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere can never be any justification for a child being taken to a war zone.‚Äù Hogan-Howe described the apparent situation of children being taken to Syria as difficult to understand. ‚ÄúDo you need to tell a mother not to take a child to a war zone? That seems really difficult. It must be that they are getting overwhelmed by some passion for the things they are attracted to in terms of what they believe is happening in Syria,‚Äù he said. Hogan-Howe also said it was too early to conclude that new powers to seize passports should be broadened to cover situations where there might be a child safety issue: ‚ÄúWe have to look at some of these cases. There are powers available and we have to make sure we‚Äôve got enough information to use them.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T13:28:36Z,world,World news,Pope's climate change encyclical tells rich nations: pay your debt to the poor,"Pope Francis has called on the world‚Äôs rich nations to begin paying their ‚Äúgrave social debt‚Äù to the poor and take concrete steps on climate change, saying failure to do so presents an undeniable risk to a ‚Äúcommon home‚Äù that is beginning to resemble a ‚Äúpile of filth‚Äù.The pope‚Äôs 180-page encyclical on the environment, released on Thursday, is at its core a moral call for action on phasing out the use of fossil fuels. But it is also a document infused with an activist anger and concern for the poor, casting blame on the indifference of the powerful in the face of certain evidence that humanity is at risk following 200 years of misuse of resources. Up to now, he says, the world has accepted a ‚Äúcheerful recklessness‚Äù in its approach to the issue, lacking the will to change habits for the good of the Earth. ‚ÄúClimate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic, political and for the distribution of goods,‚Äù the papal statement says. ‚ÄúIt represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day.‚Äù The release of the statement was timed with the pope‚Äôs upcoming trip to the US, where he will speak before the United Nations and a joint session of the Congress. ‚ÄúThis is his signature teaching,‚Äù said Austen Ivereigh, who has written a biography of the pope. ‚ÄúFrancis has made it not just safe to be Catholic and green; he‚Äôs made it obligatory.‚Äù
Ivereign added: ‚ÄúIt captures his deep disquiet about the direction of the modern world, the way technology and the myth of progress are leading us to commodify human beings and exploit nature. This comes right out of his soul.‚Äù The encyclical, which can now be considered the church‚Äôs official position on the environment, includes practical guidance. Pope Francis rejects ‚Äúsimple solutions‚Äù to climate change such as cap and trade systems, which he says give rise to harmful speculation. He also dismisses any suggestion that population increases harm to the environment and should therefore be controlled, and resists making any judgment on genetically modified foods. The essay was released following months of intense speculation about how far the pontiff would delve into a scientific realm that, depsite the overwhelming agreement of scientists, is still considered controversial in some countries such as the US, where views on climate change are divided along political lines. Cardinal Peter Turkson, the pope‚Äôs top official on social and justice issues, flatly rejected arguments by some conservative politicians in the US that the pope ought to stay out of science. ‚ÄúSaying that a pope shouldn‚Äôt deal with science sounds strange since science is a public domain. It is a subject matter that anyone can get in to,‚Äù Turkson said at a press conference on Thursday.
In an apparent reference to comments by Republican presidential contender Jeb Bush, who said he did not take economic advice from the pope, Turkson said that politicians had the right to disregard Francis‚Äôs statement, but said it was wrong to do so based on the fact that the pope was not a scientist. ‚ÄúFor some time now it has been the attempt of the whole world to kind of try to de-emphasise the artificial split between religion and public life ‚Ä¶ as if religion plays no role,‚Äù he said. Then, quoting an earlier pope, he said the best position was to ‚Äúencourage dialogue between faith and reason‚Äù. ‚ÄúReason does have blind spots, but at the same time, reason can also challenge religion to become practical,‚Äù he said. Francis, who was elected in 2013 and has put social justice and reform of the church at the heart of his papacy, said on Thursday that his text should not be read as a green manifesto, but instead as a social teaching. ‚ÄúThe foreign debt of poor countries has become a way of controlling them, yet this is not the case where ecological debt is concerned,‚Äù Francis wrote. ‚ÄúIn different ways, developing countries, where the most important reserves of the biosphere are found, continue to fuel the development of richer countries at the cost of their own present and future. ‚ÄúThe developed countries ought to help pay this debt by significantly limiting their consumption of non-renewable energy and by assisting poorer countries to support policies and programmes of sustainable development.‚Äù The question now is whether the pope‚Äôs sweeping statement will shake-up climate talks. Turkson said on Thursday that the pope considered it imperative that ‚Äúpractical proposals not be developed in an ideological, superficial or reductionist way‚Äù. ‚ÄúFor this, dialogue is essential,‚Äù he said.
The release of the statement was timed with the pope‚Äôs upcoming trip to the US, where he will speak before the UN and seek to nudge climate change negotiators ahead of their December meeting in Paris. He will also speak before a joint session of the US Congress. While much of the encyclical is a spiritual reflection on the biblical story of creation and humanity‚Äôs God-given role in caring for the Earth, both the statement and the presentation preceding it were infused with science, representing a rare locking of arms between the church and scientific community. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, a top climate scientist and scientific adviser to the Vatican, said the impact of global warming would be ‚Äúabrupt, surprising, and irreversible‚Äù, and that it would shut down parts of the earth much in the same way that the body dies of a fever. ‚ÄúThe vital organ‚Äôs of the world‚Äôs body will collapse,‚Äù he said in opening remarks before a press conference. The encyclical ‚Äì a statement of papal teaching ‚Äì describes an ‚Äúecological crisis‚Äù and includes a section devoted to the latest scientific findings. It argues that climate change is not just a ‚Äúglobal problem with serious implications‚Äù, but has an impact felt disproportionately by the world‚Äôs poorest people. Francis writes: ‚ÄúThose who possess more resources and economic or political power seem mostly to be concerned with masking the problems or concealing their symptoms‚Äù. The failure to respond, he says, points to the loss of a ‚Äúsense of responsibility for our fellow men and women upon which all civil society is founded‚Äù. The question now is whether the encyclical will shake-up the climate debate, as Francis clearly hopes it will. ‚ÄúI really think it is a game-changer,‚Äù says Ivereigh, the papal biographer. ‚ÄúIn asking Catholics to reshape the market by changing their consumer habits, it could release a whole new form of people power.‚Äù The Argentinian pontiff heaps praise on efforts made by scientists to find solutions to man-made problems, and lashes out at those who intervene in the service of ‚Äúfinance and consumerism‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt is actually making our earth less rich and beautiful, even more limited and grey,‚Äù he says. The pope did not speak at the press conference on Thursday, but earlier in the week he said he hoped his message would be received with an ‚Äúopen spirit‚Äù. The pope has previously expressed disappointment over the lack of an effective global plan to tackle climate change. But he faces an uphill battle to convert those who doubt human influence. Even among Catholics in the US, views on global warming are sharply divided along political lines. A recent survey by Pew Research showed that Catholic Republicans view the nearly universally accepted scientific facts with deep scepticism. Overall, the survey found that 71% of US Catholics believe the earth is warming, and about half (47%) believe humans are the cause and that it is a serious problem. But while eight in 10 Catholic Democrats say that there is solid evidence that global warming is real, only about half of Catholic Republicans agree. Far fewer ‚Äì just one quarter of Catholic Republicans ‚Äì believe that global warming is caused by humans.
The UN climate chief, Christiana Figueres, said the church‚Äôs newly unveiled teaching on the environment underscored the ‚Äúmoral imperative for urgent action‚Äù. ‚ÄúThis clarion call should guide the world towards a strong and durable universal climate agreement in Paris at the end of this year,‚Äù she said in a statement. ‚ÄúCoupled with the economic imperative, the moral imperative leaves no doubt that we must act on climate change now.‚Äù Jim Yong Kim, the World Bank president, agreed: ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs release ‚Ä¶ should serve as a stark reminder to all of us on the intrinsic link between climate change and poverty.‚Äù He said the impact of climate change was most devastating for the ‚Äúunacceptably high number of people living in extreme poverty‚Äù. Extreme weather events had taken the lives of more than 2.5 million people and resulted in $4tn in damages, he said. ‚ÄúWe must now seize this narrow window of opportunity and embark on ambitious actions and policies to help protect people and the environment,‚Äù he added. Francis has been sending his encyclical to church officials around the world over the last few days, Federico Lombardi, the Holy See‚Äôs head of communications, said. The pontiff included a personal handwritten note in his communication, ending with a plea for help: ‚ÄúUnited in the lord, and please do not forget to pray for me.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-18T13:11:19Z,world,World news,Britons switch hotels in Cyprus after claims of child abduction attempt,"Police in Cyprus have denied that there was an attempt to abduct children from a resort where British holidaymakers were staying. Around 50 Britons were moved from the Anastasia Beach complex, near Protaras, by Thomas Cook after an incident on Tuesday, the holiday company said. Guests were quoted by the Daily Record as saying that police had been called after three people attempted to snatch children from the hotel. But police spokesman Nikoletta Tyrimou told the Cyprus Mail on Thursday that the incident involved one 19-year-old man who was arrested after holidaymakers called police but later released without charge. Tyrimou said: ‚ÄúPolice officers arrested a 19-year-old man from Bulgaria who holidaymakers said had been filming their children and was trying to abduct them. ‚ÄúWe questioned the suspect, went through his phone and also searched his home. Nothing we found suggests that he is part of a child-abducting gang or that he was stalking children. He has since been released while police take statements from all those present at the scene.‚Äù The hotel operator Tsokkos also denied the claims. ‚ÄúAccording to the police investigation, the claims of child abduction are completely unjustifiable and invalid as nothing was found to suggest that the person involved intended to carry out such an act,‚Äù it said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe 19-year-old man involved is not an employee of the hotel and is not a known person to either the management or staff.
‚ÄúThe safety and welfare of our guests is always our first priority and upon becoming aware of the incident, we immediately increased the security personnel at the hotel as well as deploying more management members throughout the property to offer all in-house guests assistance and any other support needed.‚Äù Thomas Cook earlier confirmed an incident had occurred and the Foreign Office said it was offering consular assistance. A Thomas Cook spokeswoman said: ‚ÄúCustomers who did not wish to stay at the property were immediately moved to alternative hotels of a similar or higher standard. While incidents of this nature are extremely rare, we would like to reassure all customers that this is being taken incredibly seriously.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T13:08:14Z,world,World news,French warn Britain: Brexit could be your Waterloo,"French politicians were notably absent from the 200-year commemoration of Napoleon‚Äôs defeat at Waterloo, but that did not stop the country‚Äôs biggest national newspaper using the symbolism of France‚Äôs bloody loss to warn Britain against a carnage of another kind: the Brexit. Le Monde, France‚Äôs paper of record, took the unusual step of publishing its daily editorial in English under the warning: ‚ÄúBritain beware, Brexit could be your Waterloo!‚Äù ‚ÄúThe country which cornered Napoleon cannot succumb to Nigel Farage,‚Äù the paper pleaded, urging ‚Äúour British allies‚Äù to ‚Äúresist the familiar temptation of splendid isolation‚Äù. ‚ÄúToday, we solemnly say to our friends across the Channel: beware, Brexit could be your Waterloo! And to make sure the message is really heard, we have gone as far as to convey it in English. Messieurs les Anglais, don‚Äôt let the sirens of a fake independence pull you away from the continent. Just as in 1815, your future is in Europe.‚Äù In France, the prospect of a no vote in a British referendum on whether to stay in the European Union has exasperated the majority of the political class, with the exception of the far-right Front National, which wants France to leave the euro and suspend the Schengen free circulation area.
The 1815 Battle of Waterloo was a watershed in European history that marked the end of Napoleon and French domination and the beginning of the British century. In a half-day battle, more than 10,000 were killed in fighting between French troops and an international coalition led by Britain‚Äôs Duke of Wellington. Wellington won but described it as ‚Äúthe nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life‚Äù. As le Monde pointed out, France‚Äôs snub of the commemorations is not because they are bad losers. Rather, the country still has a complex and uneasy relationship with what came to be seen as Napoleon‚Äôs toxic image. French leaders have always kept a distance from Napoleonic commemorations, even that of his greatest victory at Austerlitz. ‚ÄúIn France, the Napoleonic legend has lost much of its lustre,‚Äù le Monde wrote. ‚ÄúThe military genius, it turns out, was also a dictator. The image of the revolutionary, of the visionary of modern Europe is now tainted with the legacy of nepotism and slavery.‚Äù
Rather than travel to Belgium for the Waterloo re-enactment alongside British royals and officials, the French president, Fran√ßois Hollande, who is well known for his love of historic commemorations, was celebrating a more important anniversary. In France, 18 June is remembered not for Waterloo but as the day General de Gaulle launched his appeal from London in 1940, calling his fellow countrymen to resist the German occupation. Le Monde noted that one ‚Äúspectacular achievement‚Äù of Waterloo was ‚Äútwo centuries of Anglo-French peace‚Äù. It said: ‚ÄúNever again have we been at war with each other, except on rugby fields. Inevitable skirmishes have happened, at Fashoda and elsewhere, but from Suez to Libya, for better or worse, the Entente Cordiale has prevailed.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T12:36:57Z,world,World news,"Chinese officials used prostate problems to get 'confession', says ex-GSK sleuth","Chinese authorities told a jailed British investigator he had problems with his prostate but withheld diagnosis for months to pressure him to confess, he has said after his release. Peter Humphrey said his health was ‚Äúheld hostage‚Äù after he and his wife Yu Yingzeng, a naturalised US citizen, were detained in 2013. They had become embroiled in the fallout from a GlaxoSmithKline corruption scandal that their company was originally hired to investigate. ‚ÄúPrison officers deliberately obstructed my access to appropriate medical attention, for my prostate and other health problems,‚Äù Humphrey told the Guardian, adding that at times during his imprisonment he was handcuffed and held in a metal cage. ‚ÄúEvery week in captivity I raised requests for next-step procedures. I was always refused on the grounds that I had not signed an admission of crime.‚Äù
He was told he had a prostate problem after a checkup when he was first taken into detention, but only got a diagnosis on 28 April this year, according to a family friend. Yu also needs medical treatment for kidney problems, although it was not clear if she had also been denied access to doctors. The couple were found guilty of illegally obtaining 256 items of information on Chinese citizens, including IDs, mobile phone numbers and travel records, after a one-day trial last August. Although officially an open prosecution, only relatives and consular officials were allowed into court for what was widely seen as a politically driven case. Humphrey was sentenced to two and a half years in jail and fined 200,000 yuan (¬£20,260). His wife was sentenced to two years and fined 150,000 yuan. They were released early on medical grounds. The pair‚Äôs sentences appeared to be unusual compared to previous ones, said Prof Don Clarke, a specialist in Chinese Law at George Washington University, in a posting on China Law Prof blog. Shanghai court records for 20 earlier prosecutions for trafficking private data showed that at least two people convicted of selling millions of pieces of information got only a suspended sentence and a small fine, he wrote. In one of the lowest volume comparable cases, where 4,619 pieces of information had been sold, the defendant was given only a 3,000 yuan fine. ‚ÄúAt the very least, I think the burden is now on those who would assert that this case is not an outlier and possibly a case of selective prosecution,‚Äù Clarke wrote, caveating that his assessment was based on preliminary information.
The couple‚Äôs arrests sent chills through the foreign business community in China, as Humphrey and his wife were experienced and respected corporate investigators. He had been a Reuters foreign correspondent for nearly two decades and Yu was an accountant before they founded their company ChinaWhys in 2003. GSK had hired them to investigate why the company‚Äôs then head of China operations, Mark Reilly, had been surreptitiously filmed having sex with his Chinese girlfriend in his guarded luxury home, a video sent to the company along with a slew of corruption allegations. As the investigation continued, however, Humphrey began to suspect that the accusations of fraud might be true. In the summer of 2013, authorities raided the GSK office, confiscating documents and detaining employees. Over six years, they said, GSK may have spent ¬£285m on bribing doctors and hospital officials to sell its drugs. Weeks later investigators targeted ChinaWhys, but the drugmaker has kept Humphrey and Yu at arm‚Äôs length. GSK says the charges against Yu and Humphrey may not be related to GSK, and Chinese state media have never explicitly made the link. Throughout the fiasco, one figure has lurked in the background: Vivian Shi, GSK‚Äôs former government relations manager. Reilly suspected she was the whistleblower, although she has denied it. Shi spent four years at the company, but left in December 2012, shortly before GSK executives began receiving the emails. She is supposedly well-connected in public security, and her father was a senior communist in Shanghai.
Shortly after Humphrey‚Äôs detention, a video of him apparently ‚Äúconfessing‚Äù in a police station, was broadcast on national TV, an extremely unusual treatment of a foreigner. Humphrey said that despite the televised statement he had always refused to plead guilty in court to the offences he was charged with, frustrating his captors. ‚ÄúNeither I nor Ying have ever admitted any guilt as charged. We were not guilty of the offences with which we were charged and convicted, but my health was held hostage to signing such a confession. I never signed an admission of crime,‚Äù Humphrey said in response to Guardian questions that were passed on to him by a family friend. The couple are now seeking medical attention as soon as possible and are trying to piece their lives back together after nearly two years behind bars, with limited communication with the outside world and in cells so cramped and overcrowded they sometimes had to sleep on the ground. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very happy to finally get out of captivity,‚Äù Humphrey said. ‚ÄúWe have been absolutely shattered by what happened. It will take time to pick up the broken pieces.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T12:01:54Z,world,World news,Georgia zoo flooding: what to do if you encounter a tiger,"A white tiger that escaped from a zoo in Tbilisi after heavy flooding mauled a man to death on Wednesday, and on Thursday authorities in the Georgian capital said they were still looking for another tiger and a hyena. Heavily armed government officers were on constant patrol on Thursday morning, as jumpy residents called in at the slightest noise or strange movement outside. But what should they do if they find themselves confronted with a tiger? Based on the experiences of forest rangers in India‚Äôs national parks, Vicky Flynn, the campaign manager of TigerTime and a veteran of travels through tiger territory, has this advice: Do not run. Like all cats, tigers enjoy a chase. In Bandhavgarh national park, an elephant was startled by tigers in the long grass and threw its mahout (rider) to the ground before running away. Alone in the tall grass and knowing that there were at least three tigers in the grass nearby, the mahout fought his instincts and slowly edged backwards, one tiny step at a time, out of the grass. It took him two hours, but he lived to tell the tale. Do not approach the tiger. Tigers, especially captive tigers, will be scared by the unusual setting and will probably be highly agitated. Stay away. Get yourself somewhere high up. Tigers are not good climbers and will generally not follow you up a tree. Stand up tall. Tigers do not distinguish between a crouched human, a warthog or a deer. This is why so many villagers collecting wood from tiger reserves have been attacked. Do not antagonise the tiger. Upon finding a tiger in his home, an old man in Bandhavgarh died trying to hit it away with a stick. Tigers will defend themselves and very few will walk away when attacked. Do not urinate in a tiger‚Äôs territory. Tigers mark their territories and if you do the same, the tiger would see you as a threat. Stay away from injured or old tigers. They are more likely to attack and they come into contact with humans more regularly as they seek out easy prey, often domestic livestock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T11:42:12Z,world,World news,UK authorities seize almost √Ç¬£16m of illegal medicines in a month,"Narcolepsy drugs misused by cramming students and cancer drugs purchased by bodybuilders were among a record ¬£15.8m haul of illegal medicines seized by the UK‚Äôs healthcare products regulator over the course of a month. Operation Pangea, which was launched in the UK eight years ago and now involves 115 countries, recovered 6.2m illegal doses and devices ‚Äì the latter included in figures for the first time. Also among the haul were slimming pills, 60,000 fake Durex condoms and 2 million erectile dysfunction drugs. Only 0.15% of the haul was counterfeit, with traders finding that they could increasingly source low-cost generic drugs from overseas. The UK haul from the annual month-long operation that ended on 16 June accounted for more than 25% of the global haul and was up significantly on last year‚Äôs domestic seizures, which amounted to ¬£8.6m. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency‚Äôs (MHRA) head of enforcement, Alastair Jeffrey, said the high total in the UK was because authorities were ‚Äúahead of the game‚Äù but warned that the use of social media was making its task more difficult. ‚ÄúThe criminals use social media really, really effectively,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey get exposure to millions of potential customers and users. We need to use social media, we need to get the message across that buying medicine online, in a lot of circumstances, is dangerous.‚Äù The regulator shut down 1,380 websites, 339 of which were in the UK, during the operation and has been working with Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to try to get them to take down adverts for illegal medicines. Jeffrey said that organised gangs were increasingly becoming involved because they could hide behind the internet, police were not interested in the trade, profits were high and penalties lower compared with those for narcotics. ‚ÄúThe sanction, in my personal opinion, doesn‚Äôt reflect the seriousness of the crime,‚Äù he said. Overseas, concerns have been raised that terrorists may also be entering the market. The extent of the challenge the MHRA faces on the consumer side has been illustrated by a PWC survey that found 28% of 18-to-34-year-olds had bought counterfeit medicines. The regulator has been contacting universities to raise awareness of the fact that students are taking the narcolepsy drugs, also used by people with ADHD (Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder), the MHRA‚Äôs head of intelligence, Mark Jackson, said. Other areas of concern include breast cancer drugs, used by bodybuilders to destroy breast tissue, and slimming pills, which can cause cardiac events and strokes and have proved fatal in some cases. Jeffrey said that most of the drugs come from China and India, countries conspicuous by their absence from Operation Pangea. He said that efforts were ongoing to get them on board, which would make a big difference. The operation, coordinated through Interpol, concluded with a week of raids, which, in the UK, included 12,000 doses of Polish medicines recovered from a flat in Edinburgh and more from a shop in west London. Jeffrey said: ‚ÄúEmerging and new communities will probably feel more comfortable buying medicine in the language they understand and from people they understand but the bottom line is there is no doctor involved.‚Äù Seven people are under investigation for possible offences, following the operation, although Jeffrey said the number could increase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T11:39:04Z,world,World news,Ex Irish president: NYT should 'hang its head in shame' for balcony deaths story,"Former president of Ireland Mary McAleese has written a stinging critique of a New York Times article portraying a ‚Äúlazy, tabloid stereotype‚Äù of Irish students in the wake of the California balcony collapse that left six people dead. Two Irish students remain in a critical condition following the incident in Berkeley on Tuesday, in which five of their compatriots and a woman with joint American and Irish citizenship died. The paper has apologised for the feature, which detailed drunken Irish student antics in the San Francisco Bay Area and was published just hours after the collapse. But the diplomatic row it sparked has continued, with McAleese accusing the New York Times of ‚Äúheaping deliberate injustice on top of the most awful grief‚Äù.
In a letter to the paper, McAleese writes: ‚ÄúToday the New York Times should be hanging its head in shame at how outrageously and without the remotest evidence it has rushed to judgment on those deaths. ‚ÄúI was a J-1 visa student in California over 40 years ago. Tens of thousands of Irish J-1 students have spent happy summers there over the years since. By far the vast majority have been a credit to Ireland and only the very tiniest minority have not. ‚ÄúYet within hours of the most appalling tragedy in the history of the J-1 visa programme, when the one salient fact to speak for itself is the ludicrous collapse of a fourth floor balcony in a relatively new building, New York Times journalists reached for the lazy tabloid stereotype and heaped deliberate injustice on top of the most awful grief.‚Äù Meanwhile the New York Times public editor, Margaret Sullivan, said on Thursday she believed the paper‚Äôs management team were ‚Äúcouching their words very carefully‚Äù in their apology, but said she cannot ‚Äútell the Times what to do‚Äù. Sullivan told Irish radio station Newstalk: ‚ÄúI think the New York Times made some pretty bad mistakes with this story and, yes, I think it was insensitive and not handled properly. ‚ÄúI think the Times institutionally and the editors and reporters were couching their words very carefully [in the apology], I would like to go a step further myself and say that I agree it was insensitive and that the complaints are very valid.‚Äù
She continued: ‚ÄúI definitely know [the article] added to the great pain of this tragedy and that‚Äôs extremely unfortunate and I personally feel very sorry about that.‚Äù Sullivan confirmed that the paper has received around 400 complaints in relation to the article. In the piece, three New York Times journalists wrote about the thousands of Irish students who travel to the US every summer with special J-1 visas allowing them to work temporarily. The article said these students are ‚Äúnot just a source of aspiration, but also a source of embarrassment for Ireland, marked by a series of high-profile episodes involving drunken partying and the wrecking of apartments in places like San Francisco and Santa Barbara‚Äù. It also quotes a 2014 column by Cahir O‚ÄôDoherty, the arts and culture editor of the Irish Voice, expressing distress at ‚Äúthe callous destruction unleashed by these loaded Irish students‚Äù at a rental house in San Francisco. The Irish ambassador to the US, Anne Anderson, has also weighed in on the controversy, writing her own letter to the New York Times. She wrote: ‚ÄúThe implication of your article ‚Äì that the behaviour of the students was in some way a factor in the collapse ‚Äì has caused deep offence.‚Äù Anderson denied the J-1 visa scheme was a source of embarrassment for Ireland. She said: ‚ÄúWe are fully supportive of this programme and we know that it brings enormous mutual benefit ... Yes there have been isolated incidents of the type to which your article refers. But they are wholly unrepresentative.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T11:23:24Z,world,World news,Angela Merkel: UK needs to work out what role it wants to play in Europe,"Angela Merkel has urged Britain to remain an active member of the European Union, but said it also needed to consider the future role it wanted to play. In an address to the Bundestag, the German chancellor stressed that Brussels politicians would be paying ever closer attention to the question of Britain‚Äôs doubts over the union. While next week‚Äôs summit of EU leaders in Brussels would not focus on the Brexit issue, Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, would be tasked with examining Britain‚Äôs demands for reforms. But she repeated her insistence that the basic principles such as freedom of movement for workers from other EU countries, and anti-discrimination legislation, were not up for negotiation.
Merkel said it was not the first time that a member state had wanted clarification about its role in the union, citing the cases of Denmark in 1992 and Ireland in 2008, for whom ‚Äúcompromises were found‚Äù. She said she was therefore hopeful that Britain could be kept in. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confident we can achieve this this time,‚Äù she added. Expressing her hopes that Britain would decide to stay, calling it a ‚Äúnatural partner‚Äù in many issues, including how to improve Europe‚Äôs competitiveness, she said at the same time it needed to clarify its own position towards the club. ‚ÄúBritain obviously needs to work out itself what role it would like to play in Europe,‚Äù she said.
Cameron‚Äôs demands for renegotiation suffered a setback on Wednesday when the president of the European parliament, Martin Schulz, told the Guardian ahead of talks in London that the UK would fail to get an exception from ‚Äúever closer union‚Äù and said there was a ‚Äúmore or less unanimous‚Äù view among other EU leaders that the Lisbon treaty would not be reopened. Schulz held out the prospect of compromise after an hour-long working breakfast at Downing Street on Thursday but said some of Cameron‚Äôs demands were controversial. He said there were different views among member states on Britain‚Äôs proposals but that there were also areas of common ground. ‚ÄúDialogue is necessary. Solutions are always coming via dialogue and at the end via compromise,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere is a long list of common interests and I think common ground could be found by analysing and discussing content. That is what we did. ‚ÄúThere were some controversial items and it is not surprising that in the European parliament some views are different than here in London.‚Äù Cameron said the discussions got got off to a good start but added: ‚ÄúWe have got a long way to go in this reform and renegotiation, a lot of difficult issues to discuss, things that I believe fundamentally need to change, but it has been good to start these discussions today.‚Äù The prime minister‚Äôs official spokeswoman claimed Schulz had expressed a desire to work with Cameron on the renegotiation during their breakfast meeting. Asked whether Schulz had repeated in the meeting his view that treaty change was unrealistic, she said: ‚ÄúPresident Schulz‚Äôs approach was: let‚Äôs work through these issues and look at what the solutions might be.‚Äù On Schulz‚Äôs comments about the UK belonging to the EU, the spokeswoman suggested Schulz‚Äôs meaning may have been lost in translation as he was not speaking in his first language.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T11:06:02Z,world,World news,How the Observer reported the Battle of Waterloo,"The Battle of Waterloo took place on 18 June 1815 near Waterloo village in present day Belgium. Napol√©on Bonaparte‚Äôs defeat at the hands of the Duke of Wellington‚Äôs allied army brought to an end 23 years of warfare between France and the other powers of Europe. This was a big news event but as Brian Cathcart, author of The News From Waterloo, has noted, despite there being over 50 newspapers in London, ‚Äúnot a single British newspaper representative was on the battlefield.‚Äù As such, the Observer did not carry any major pieces of news reporting following the victory, although it did carry various reports from Parliament and the government and its agents. On 25 June 1815, the paper declared:
Every incident relating to the late battle is so interesting and honourable to the national character, and the source of so much commendable pride and exultation to every Englishman, and at the same time so much sought after, that we have been induced to collect them from every conceivable source and present them to our readers. But we cannot refer to these without expressing gratification that our pages are emblazoned with fresh proud records of British valour. Heaven has, indeed, smiled on the good cause of freedom and of loyalty, and victory has twined her brightest wreath to decorate the brows of Wellington. Dreadful has been the struggle, and awful indeed, the sacrifice, and even the splendid results of the 18th June have been dearly purchased at the expense of the rich blood shed on the memorable occasion; but in the successful issue of this arduous contest, we may confidently anticipate the speedy destruction of the cause of all the evils which have desolated the Continent for so many years, and the restoration of peace to Europe and the Universe, whose beams have been so sweet and transient. The paper also reported: Nothing could tempt the Duke from his ground till the proper moment presented itself. He did not fatigue and exhaust his men by unreasonable charges, or by experimental manoeuvres; he stood undaunted, and received repeated and resolute attacks, and only when he perceived the enemy to be in confusion and apparently exhausted, did he assume the offensive and turn the attack upon them. It was a battle, therefore, which was ably conducted as it was gallantly fought: and must ever greatly redound to the fame of the British in arms. One hundred years later, the Observer reprinted some of the Waterloo coverage, including an article from the Champion newspaper.
On 2 July 1815 the Observer carried several reports of events in Europe, as well as noting: This Gazette notifies that the Archbishop of Canterbury has been ordered, on 29th June, to prepare a Form of Prayer and Thanksgiving to the Almighty God for the Glorious Victory obtained over the French on Sunday the 18th June, at Waterloo, by the Allied Armies under the command of the Duke of Wellington and Prince Blucher. Copies of the prayer to be sent round and read in several churches throughout England and Ireland. - Another Order commands Prayers and Thanksgivings to be put to Almighty God in the churches in Scotland, on Sunday the 9th day of July. It also published the following proclamation by Wellington:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T11:03:37Z,world,World news,Pope puts sex aside and declares green living central to faith,"The first thing that strikes you about the pope‚Äôs latest slim volume is that there‚Äôs virtually no sex in it. And that is not to be facetious. Ever since the publication of another milestone encyclical, Paul VI‚Äôs Humanae Vitae, the Catholic leadership has become progressively more obsessed with sex: contraception, abortion, IVF, surrogate parenthood, homosexuality and, reluctantly, clerical sex abuse. The effect has been to sideline other, hugely important matters. To read 184 pages written by ‚Äì though, in reality, approved by ‚Äì a pope that deal almost solely with the fate of humanity, rather than what humans get up to in private, makes an immensely refreshing change. The part where sex does creep in will be, for many, the least convincing. It is the part where Francis addresses those who maintain that the Vatican cannot credibly deplore the desecration of the environment without recognising the effects of its aversion to birth control. In a passage that defines the term ‚ÄúJesuitical‚Äù, Francis, the first Jesuit pope, tries to convince us that the proponents of reproductive health are, unwittingly, working for the environmental bad guys. ‚ÄúTo blame population growth instead of extreme and selective consumerism on the part of some is one way of refusing to face the issues,‚Äù he writes. ‚ÄúIt is an attempt to legitimise the present model of distribution, where a minority believes that it has the right to consume in a way which can never be universalised, since the planet could not even contain the waste products of such consumption.‚Äù The International Planned Parenthood Federation as a tool of the rich? That really won‚Äôt wash, particularly since Francis goes on to acknowledge that ‚Äúattention needs to be paid to imbalances in population density, on both national and global levels‚Äù. Apparently, then, it is not a surplus of babies that is the real problem, but where they are born. The pope‚Äôs effort to sever the link between population growth and environmental deterioration should not, however, detract from the importance of what else he has to say. This is the first encyclical to be devoted entirely to environmental issues, though it is certainly not the first time a pope has spoken out on the destruction of the environment. As the encyclical notes, Paul VI first raised the issue as long ago as 1971, describing it as a ‚Äútragic consequence‚Äù of uncontrolled human activity. Saint John Paul II and his successor, Benedict XVI, inveighed against mankind‚Äôs ill-treatment of nature ‚Äì or as they viewed it, creation.
Far more explicitly than his predecessors, however, Francis heaps the blame on to the part of humanity that is rich. He accepts that the poorer nations should ‚Äúacknowledge the scandalous level of consumption in some privileged sectors of their population and ‚Ä¶ combat corruption more effectively.‚Äù They ought also to develop less polluting sources of energy. But his real target ‚Äì as in his apostolic exhortation Evangelii Gaudium two years ago ‚Äì is the rich world and the global economic order it has forged, which he argues tolerates vast differences in the wellbeing of nations and individuals ‚Äì a system characterised by ‚Äúspeculation and the pursuit of financial gain‚Äù, which ignores ‚Äúthe effects on human dignity and the natural environment‚Äù. Thus, says Francis, environmental degradation is intimately linked to an erosion of human and ethical values. That is the connection he needs to support the true originality of this encyclical. He writes that it is addressed not just to the Roman Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy (as were the earliest encyclicals) or to the faithful as well (as more recent ones have been), but to all of mankind. ‚ÄúFaced as we are with global environmental deterioration, I wish to address every person living on this planet,‚Äù he writes.
It is in the passages addressed to his own flock that Francis really breaks new ground. Using a phrase first coined by John Paul II, he says that Catholics, if they have not already done so, need to undergo an ‚Äúecological conversion‚Äù. This is not just because ‚Äúgreen is good‚Äù but because, he declares, green is central to their faith. ‚ÄúLiving our vocation to be protectors of God‚Äôs handiwork is essential to a life of virtue; it is not an optional or a secondary aspect of our Christian experience.‚Äù It is a call ‚Äì no, an instruction ‚Äì to the world‚Äôs Catholics to work for the protection of the environment and to save the planet. The potential effect hardly needs to be spelled out. One in every six human beings is baptised a Catholic. The question that has yet to be answered is whether Francis‚Äôs flock, especially in the United States, will pay any more attention to Laudato Si than it paid to the ban on artificial methods of contraception in Humanae Vitae.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T10:08:09Z,world,World news,South Carolina church shooting: police hunt gunman after 'hate crime' attack,"At least nine people have been killed after a gunman opened fire at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in what police have described as a ‚Äúhate crime‚Äù. Police released a image of the gunman and a car from video at a press conference on Thursday. The suspect, who is still on the loose, has been described as a clean-shaved, white male aged approximately 21, with a small, slender build, wearing a grey sweatshirt with jeans and boots.
Gunfire erupted on Wednesday inside the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church, whose pastor Clementa Pinckney, a Democratic member of the South Carolina Senate, was named as one of the dead. Eight of the victims were killed in the church. Another died on the way to hospital. Charleston police chief Greg Mullen said there were survivors, but declined to give more details. The gunman had yet to be caught hours after the attack and was considered extremely dangerous, he said.
Mullen said he believed the shooting was ‚Äúa hate crime‚Äù. He said: This is a tragedy that no community should have to experience ... It is senseless, unfathomable. We are going to do everything in our power to find this individual, to lock him [the gunman] up, to make sure he does not hurt anyone else. ‚ÄúThe primary emphasis is going to be us catching this individual before he hurts anybody else‚Äù. A reward would be announced on Thursday, he said. The city‚Äôs mayor, Joseph P Riley Jr, described the killing as an ‚Äúunspeakable tragedy‚Äù, pledging to ‚Äúbring this awful person to justice as soon as humanely possible‚Äù. ‚ÄúPeople in prayer on a Wednesday evening, a ritual coming together, praying and worshipping God. To have an awful person come in and shoot them is inexplicable, obviously the most intolerable and unbelievable act possible,‚Äù he said.
He said he had met victims‚Äô families in ‚Äúa heartbreaking scene I have never witnessed in my life before‚Äù. He added: ‚ÄúI told them that this community sends forth it love to them and we are all in this together.‚Äù Police have not named the victims but the Democratic party leader in the South Carolina state house confirmed pastor and state senator Pinckney was among the dead. ‚ÄúHe was always out doing work either for his parishioners or his constituents. He touched everybody,‚Äù minority leader Todd Rutherford told AP.
Pinckney helped lead a prayer vigil in April for Walter Scott, a black South Carolina man who was shot dead by a North Charleston police officer. He campaigned for police to be equipped with body cameras, which he said ‚Äúmay not be the golden ticket, the golden egg, the end-all-fix-all, but [would help] to paint a picture of what happens during a police stop‚Äù. Mandatory body cameras became law in the state one week ago. The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church traces its roots to 1816 and is one of the largest black congregations south of Baltimore. The Reverend Martin Luther King Jr addressed the church in 1962. South Carolina governor Nikki Haley said in a statement she and her family were praying for the victims. ‚ÄúWhile we do not yet know all of the details, we do know that we‚Äôll never understand what motivates anyone to enter one of our places of worship and take the life of another,‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúPlease join us in lifting up the victims and their families with our love and prayers.‚Äù Cornell William Brooks, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) said the organisation was ‚Äúoutraged‚Äù to be faced with another mass hate crime 106 years after it was founded to fight racial hatred. ‚ÄúThe senselessly slain parishioners were in a church for Wednesday night bible study. There is no greater coward than a criminal who enters a house of God and slaughters innocent people engaged in the study of scripture,‚Äù he said in a statement. Soon after Wednesday night‚Äôs shooting, a group of pastors huddled together praying in a circle across the street. Community organiser Christopher Cason said he felt certain the shootings were racially motivated. ‚ÄúI am very tired of people telling me that I don‚Äôt have the right to be angry,‚Äù Cason said. ‚ÄúI am very angry right now.‚Äù Even before Scott‚Äôs shooting in April, Cason said he had been part of a group meeting with police and local leaders to try to shore up better relationships. Presidential candidate Jeb Bush has cancelled a planned trip to the state, and the South Carolina legislature has suspended a sitting planned for Thursday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T10:00:03Z,world,World news,Mothers of Isis recruits find healing and resolve through support network,"Christianne Boudreau learned her son was dead when a reporter showed up at her front door with a link to a tweet announcing that he had been killed in Syria, fighting for the Islamic State. It had been more than a year since Damian Clairmont, 22, surreptitiously left his home in Canada and made his way to a jihadi training camp in Turkey. Boudreau spent the intervening months searching through militant videos online, scouring through often gruesome footage in the desperate hope of catching a glimpse of her eldest son. Eventually, Damian texted her from Syria, and Boudreau spoke to her son on the phone several times, pleading with him to come home, but she was unable to convince him. Then in January 2014, Isis supporters started sharing a tweet reporting Damian‚Äôs death. The link led to a statement attributed to Boudreau‚Äôs son, in which he rejected his family and ‚Äúworldly life‚Äù in Canada, and dedicated himself to ‚Äúan eternity in Paradise‚Äù. ‚ÄúI sat there, staring at the computer, reading it over and over,‚Äù Boudreau said.
Boudreau was unable to help her son, but she was determined that no other mother should suffer the same experience. She founded a group to help counter extremist propaganda in Canada, and earlier this month, she helped launch Mothers for Life, a network of mothers from seven European and North American countries whose children have gone to fight with jihadi groups. In an open letter, the mothers counseled youngsters contemplating joining the jihadi fight to think twice ‚Äì and pleaded for their children to come home. The group‚Äôs launch comes amid growing concerns that western countries at the forefront of the fight against Isis have failed to draw up effective strategies to stop their own young people from going to fight and die for the militant group. Over the past year, a steady stream of young Europeans and North Americans have made their way to the battlefields of Iraq and Syria. Conservative estimates put the numbers of westerners who have joined militant Islamist groups in the low thousands, with several hundred known to have emanated from Belgium and Denmark, 1,000 from France and ‚Äúat least 150‚Äù from the US. Earlier this week, reports emerged that a 17-year-old boy had become the UK‚Äôs youngest suicide bomber, after detonating an explosives-laden car in Iraq in the name of the Islamic State. In March, 18-year-old Australian Isis fighter Jake Bilardi also died in an Iraqi suicide attack, as did two German twins last month.
Isis has been particularly adept at targeting their propaganda and recruitment efforts at foreigners. But according to Daniel Koehler, a German expert on deradicalization ‚Äì and the co-founder of Mothers for Life ‚Äì families could play a unique role in preventing young people from signing up for violent jihad. The problem for many families is that they are simply unable to spot the warning signs. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even know what the word ‚Äòradicalization‚Äô was before I found out my son was dead,‚Äù said Karolina Dam, a Danish member of Mothers for Life. Like Boudreau, she heard the news from a stranger on her doorstep ‚Äì this time, a man with ties to Isis recruiters. Dam‚Äôs son Lukas was 18 when he was killed in a US-led coalition air strike in the Syrian border town of Kobani in December. Dam could only confirm reports of his death through social media posts.
Lukas had been diagnosed with Asperger‚Äôs and ADD before converting to Islam, and at first the religion appeared to give him the structure and motivation that he needed. ‚ÄúI saw him struggle his whole life, and he found a religion to give him what I couldn‚Äôt give him,‚Äù Dam said. ‚ÄúThat was the first time I saw my son at ease.‚Äù But, unbeknown to his mother, Lukas soon embraced an extremist vision of Islam, and in the summer of 2014 he made his way to Syria. For Dam ‚Äì who was a single mother ‚Äì the pain of losing one of her two sons was heightened by her feeling that nobody around her could understand what she was going through. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have anyone to talk to,‚Äù she said via Skype from Copenhagen. When she learned of Lukas‚Äôs death, Dam‚Äôs grief was compounded by Danish bureaucracy: without a body, she was unable to obtain a death certificate; without that, she was unable to close his bank account ‚Äì even though she feared other Isis fighters were still using it. ‚ÄúI am fighting to get over this, but I want the [Danish] authorities to do the right thing and stop these bastards from hurting other people,‚Äù Dam said.
As the parents of Muslim converts, Dam and Boudreau may perhaps find it easier to speak openly of their experiences than others in similar situations. The families of western jihadis are often afraid to describe what they are going through to anyone outside their immediate circle, let alone to speak out in public. According to Dam, many parents ‚Äì especially those from communities already under heavy scrutiny by the security services and the media ‚Äì are ashamed or fearful that they could lose their remaining children or even face prosecution. These parents experience a tragic catch-22, said Boudreau. ‚ÄúParents are afraid to come forward, and they‚Äôre afraid their children are going to get arrested,‚Äù Boudreau said. ‚ÄúAs a parent, you have that guilt complex if you turn them in. But if you don‚Äôt turn them in and they don‚Äôt get arrested, then they end up going overseas and dying.‚Äù The relative novelty of the foreign-born jihadi phenomenon has made it difficult for these families to find support. Boudreau‚Äôs biggest fear was that Damian would in turn recruit her younger son, Luke, 11, who desperately missed his elder brother. But she initially found no support from Canada‚Äôs social services and was left to carry out her own research online. That led her to Koehler, an academic and counsellor, who founded the pioneering German Institute on Radicalization and DeRadicalization in Berlin. Six months after Damian‚Äôs death, Boudreau flew to Berlin to meet the mothers of other jihadi fighters. ‚ÄúIt was quite intense emotionally,‚Äù she said. But ‚Äúit felt like we could start some kind of healing process‚Äù. The seed for what would eventually become Mothers for Life was planted at that first meeting. The group aims to help mothers find a stronger voice to counter those intent on radicalizing young westerners. Mothers hold a particularly important role in jihadi ideology, he said, presumably because Islamic theology holds them in such high regard: the prophet Muhammad is thought to have said that ‚ÄúParadise lies at the feet of the mother.‚Äù But jihadi recruiters systematically work to separate children from their families, he said. ‚ÄúThey need to build a wall within families to distance [would-be jihadis] from their mothers,‚Äù Koehler said. ‚ÄúThey know these voices are important.‚Äù Some members of Mothers for Life still have children fighting in Syria and Iraq and hope the group will help their efforts to get their children back home. But there are almost insurmountable practical and legal obstacles to doing so. Home countries often refuse to accept returning jihadis ‚Äì or allow them in only to arrest them. Just a few countries have established deradicalization programs to help reintegrate former fighters or repentent jihadis.
Koehler says that former militants should be given the chance to answer for their actions before the law ‚Äì but also offered psychological support to help them reconnect with their former lives. In almost every country in western Europe there are scores or even hundreds of former militants who have returned home, either because they are injured, traumatized or disillusioned with the brutal reality of life under Isis rule, Koehler said. Most of them have returned illegally and remain off the radar of the security services. That‚Äôs why Koehler argues that deradicalization programs are an essential component of national security policy. ‚ÄúDeradicalization programs like Mothers for Life help the authorities to be more effective, [and] they help communities be more resilient.‚Äù For parents of westerners who have already joined the ranks of Islamic State, and for those who fear their children may yet be recruited, programs like Mothers for Life can offer an ‚Äúemotional safe place‚Äù, said Boudreau. She hopes the group can ensure that no parent will have to suffer alone while their child turns to violent jihad. ‚ÄúIf I had known then what I know now,‚Äù Boudreau said, ‚Äúmy son might still be alive.‚Äù Correction: This story was amended on 19 June 2015 to reflect that Karolina Dam has two sons, not one, and that her son Lukas had ADD, not ADHD, as previously reported.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T08:06:16Z,world,World news,Hong Kong parliament defies Beijing's insistence and rejects 'democracy' plan,"Pro-democracy lawmakers in Hong Kong have defeated attempts to bring ‚Äúfake democracy‚Äù to the former British colony by voting down a controversial Beijing-backed plan that sparked mass demonstrations in 2014. The proposal ‚Äì which China insisted represented true universal suffrage ‚Äì would have seen Hong Kong‚Äôs five million voters granted the right to directly elect their future leaders ‚Äì but only after candidates had been screened by a pro-Beijing committee. The ‚Äúpolitical reform package‚Äù was rejected on Thursday with 28 legislators in Hong Kong‚Äôs parliament voting against it. Eight lawmakers voted for the proposal. There are 70 members in all but more than two dozen pro-government politicians walked out of the session without voting in an apparent attempt to halt proceedings. Pro-democracy lawmakers and activists celebrated the result, even though it means the current system ‚Äì under which Hong Kong‚Äôs chief executive is chosen by a 1,200-member pro-establishment ‚Äúelection committee‚Äù ‚Äì will remain in place. ‚ÄúIt is a victory for those people who refuse to accept fake universal suffrage,‚Äù said Martin Lee, one of Hong Kong‚Äôs most prominent democracy activists. ‚ÄúThis is good news for Hong Kong. Rejecting this fake universal suffrage puts the pressure back on Beijing.‚Äù Beijing lamented the defeat of its package. ‚ÄúSuch a result is a departure from the mainstream public opinion of Hong Kong. It is also not what the central government likes to see,‚Äù a spokesperson for China‚Äôs cabinet-like State Council told the South China Morning Post. An editorial published on the website of the pro-Beijing Global Times attacked Hong Kong‚Äôs pro-democracy legislators. ‚ÄúAll those who voted against the blueprint might be cocky today, but they will face the judgment of history and shoulder the responsibility eventually,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúWe are concerned that a Pandora box is being opened in Hong Kong and various devils are released to ruin the region‚Äôs future,‚Äù the editorial added. Victoria Hui, a political scientist who runs a blog about Hong Kong‚Äôs umbrella movement protests, said she expected an ‚Äúintensification of resistance‚Äù to Beijing following the proposal‚Äôs defeat. ‚ÄúWhat we are seeing is a very artificial calm. There is a lot boiling under the surface and it is really hard to say what is going to ignite the next bomb. Hong Kong people‚Äôs frustrations could explode again at any time.‚Äù Pro-democracy politicians would now attempt to restart the political reform process and squeeze concessions out of Beijing but the Communist party was unlikely to cave in, Hui added. ‚ÄúIf they had wanted to make compromises they would have done so already.‚Äù Michael Davis, a law professor from the University of Hong Kong, said Beijing had paid the price for its refusal to offer a single concession to those pushing for greater levels of democracy. ‚ÄúWhat they got through this hard line was the whole of civil society protesting and resisting Beijing. It really backfired on them. We would hope that there would be some lessons learned and some acts of contrition going forward. Will that happen? Right now one can‚Äôt be optimistic.‚Äù Hundreds of police had gathered in and around Hong Kong‚Äôs government headquarters and parliament this week amid fears that the highly contentious vote could spark renewed protests or even violence. Tens of thousands of pro-democracy activists spilled out on to the streets in 2014 as part of the student-driven ‚Äúumbrella movement‚Äù demonstrations. For 79 days large swathes of Hong Kong‚Äôs financial heart were transformed into a sea of tents and banners. Police eventually cleared the occupation in December. On Thursday Xinhua, China‚Äôs official news agency, warned that Hong Kong risked ‚Äúbeing torn further apart‚Äù if Beijing‚Äôs proposal was defeated. The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid, said ‚Äúreal chaos‚Äù could ensue. Speaking shortly before the vote around noon on Thursday, Carrie Lam, Hong Kong‚Äôs number two official, lashed out at pro-democracy politicians for opposing the government‚Äôs package. ‚ÄúI am sad and I am disappointed. I do not know how democratic development can be taken forward,‚Äù she said. Fanny Law, a pro-Beijing politician who is close to CY Leung, Hong Kong‚Äôs current chief executive, described the defeat as ‚Äúheart-wrenching‚Äù. ‚ÄúBut I think there was some misjudgment along the way and we really must sit down and mend the fences after the whole saga is over,‚Äù she told RTHK, Hong Kong‚Äôs public broadcaster. ‚ÄúWe must find a way forward and we must address some of the very deep-rooted problems in our society.‚Äù Martin Lee, the founding chairman of Hong Kong‚Äôs Democratic party, said ‚Äúa major change of policy‚Äù was now needed in the former colony. ‚ÄúIf you look at Hong Kong today all the important decisions are not made here but in Beijing or locally through the Beijing agents. The whole thing has gone wrong,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is a good way to persuade [Chinese President Xi Jinping] that he shouldn‚Äôt continue with this wrong policy of dismissing the democrats as troublemakers or even as traitors.‚Äù Since becoming Communist party chief in 2012 Xi had taken a hardline stance towards government critics, journalists, academics and bloggers, noted Davis, the law professor. To take a similarly tough stance on Hong Kong in the wake of Thursday‚Äôs defeat would be a mistake, Davis said. ‚ÄúOne would hope they‚Äôd cool it and not take the view to punish Hong Kong,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they have a desire to kill Hong Kong and being aggressive in their posture towards Hong Kong or interpreting this as indicating a need for them to interfere more rather than less would be a bad judgment on their part.‚Äù Compromise was now needed from Hong Kong‚Äôs leaders. ‚ÄúThe government‚Äôs credibility is really low ‚Äì if all they do after this vote is go back to their offices and do nothing ‚Ä¶ then I think the problems of crisis and conflict in Hong Kong will persist.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T07:50:28Z,world,World news,Charleston shooting: state senator Clementa Pinckney among victims,"Clementa Pinckney, a high-flying Democrat state senator who campaigned for police to wear body cameras, was one of those killed in the mass shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, on Wednesday. The 41-year-old was a pastor of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church where a gunman, believed to be white, opened fire in what officials are treating as a hate crime. Pinckney won election to the South Carolina senate in 2000 at the age of 27, becoming the youngest African American to do so. He had previously been elected to the state‚Äôs House of Representatives at 23. Reports said he met Hillary Clinton earlier on Wednesday at a fundraising event in Charleston.
In April Pinckney helped lead a prayer vigil for Walter Scott, a black South Carolina man who was shot dead by a police officer as he tried to run away. The veteran civil rights campaigner Al Sharpton, who was also involved in the vigil, tweeted on Wednesday night:
Pinckney campaigned for legislation to require police officers to wear body cameras while working. He said: ‚ÄúBody cameras help to record what happens. It may not be the golden ticket, the golden egg, the end-all-fix-all, but it helps to paint a picture of what happens during a police stop.‚Äù The Rev Joseph Darby, the presiding elder at Beaufort AME Church, described Pinckney as ‚Äúan advocate for the people‚Äù. He told MSNBC: ‚ÄúHe was a very caring and competent pastor, and he was a very brave man. Brave men sometimes die difficult deaths.‚Äù Pastor Thomas Dixon, who has been working with a local chapter of the Black Lives Matter movement, had met Pinckney in the wake of the April death of Walter Scott, the unarmed black man whose shooting by a white North Charleston police officer was caught on video. He said Pinckney was highly respected in the community as both a political and religious leader. In the wake of the latest shooting, Dixon said he was ‚Äúdisheartened but not surprised‚Äù. The Emanuel church website said Pinckney began preaching at 13 and was first appointed as a pastor at 18. He had a degree in business administration, and master‚Äôs degrees in public administration and divinity.
His profile on the church website included a quote from a Washington Post columnist, David Broder, who said Pinckney was a ‚Äúpolitical spirit lifter for surprisingly not becoming cynical about politics‚Äù. Pinckney is survived by his wife, Jennifer, and two children, Eliana and Malana.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T06:00:10Z,world,World news,Denmark election could seal centre-left comeback or boost David Cameron,"Denmark goes to the polls on Thursday in an election that will either seal a famous comeback for the incumbent Social Democratic prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, or give a boost to the British prime minister, David Cameron, in his quest for EU renegotiations. Thorning-Schmidt‚Äôs governing centre-left coalition, which campaigned on a resurgent economy, has consistently trailed in opinion polls since the last election in 2011, but in the past few weeks has pulled level with the blue bloc led by the Venstre (Liberal) party.
In what many saw as a concession to the Eurosceptic Danish People‚Äôs party (DPP), the four parties of the rightwing bloc ‚Äì Venstre, DPP, Conservatives and Liberal Alliance ‚Äì last week announced their joint support for Cameron‚Äôs bid to renegotiate the terms of Britain‚Äôs membership of the EU, in particular with regard to welfare benefits for EU migrants. ‚ÄúWe will stand behind Great Britain and like-minded nations‚Äô efforts to ensure that the EU doesn‚Äôt turn into a social union,‚Äù said the statement, titled Danish Welfare in Europe. ‚ÄúWe want an EU where people can go wherever workers are needed, but we don‚Äôt want an EU where people go wherever the social benefits are good,‚Äù the Venstre leader, Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen, said last week. Both Thorning-Schmidt and Rasmussen have promised to further tighten Denmark‚Äôs controls on immigration and access to welfare benefits, but the DPP wants to go further and reinstate border controls with Germany and Sweden. The DPP, which won the biggest share of the vote in last year‚Äôs European elections, looks set to increase its number of MPs in Denmark‚Äôs 179-seat parliament, the Folketinget, and close in on its coalition partner Venstre. With 90 seats needed for either coalition bloc to govern, the election result could come down to the four members elected from Greenland and the Faroe Islands. A new party, the environmentalist Alternative party, has entered the mix this year, and is expected to support Thorning-Schmidt‚Äôs bloc.
The two leaders vying for the premiership clashed in a series of tense TV debates during an election campaign that has been dominated by public spending, welfare and an increasingly harsh line on immigration. While Thorning-Schmidt‚Äôs government has been accused of breaking previous election promises, Rasmussen has been dogged by a series of expenses scandals that have hampered his personal credibility. He was accused last year of excessive spending on clothes and first-class plane tickets and, while the party defended him, was widely expected to step down. On Tuesday, more than 1 million Danish households received a letter from Thorning-Schmidt urging them to ‚Äúsay no‚Äù to Rasmussen and the DPP. ‚ÄúThe Liberals‚Äô key issue is zero growth [in the public sector],‚Äù read the letter. ‚ÄúRather than spending more money on health and care for our elderly, they want to give tax breaks. The Danish People‚Äôs party talks a lot about welfare. But if you vote DPP then you get Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen as prime minister.‚Äù Rasmussen said the letter was ‚Äúa democratic low point‚Äù in a Social Democratic campaign that had been focused solely on him and his party. In an add published in 15 newspapers, the Liberal party hit back: ‚ÄúWe say yes to welfare and using taxpaying citizens‚Äô money with care. We say no to false scaremongering.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oung Capitol Hill staffers. Their weekend starts on Thursday afternoon, when their bosses are on flights or trains home, and they get blind drunk en masse at the Place Luxembourg. Heath is treated like a minor celebrity at Place Lux, and it is a reciprocal thing. His goal, he says, is to ‚Äúmake them believe there is a community here, and then make them want to be part of that community‚Äù. If he treats his readers like they are a little sexier than they are, they will start to act the part; they are not really doing boring things, they are just accustomed to being terminally boring about them. This is a town where the instructions for handwashing in institutional bathrooms have nine steps in four languages. Heath‚Äôs column follows such figures as Martin Selmayr ‚Äì Juncker‚Äôs chief of staff, whom one reporter described, with a theatrical shiver, as the town‚Äôs ‚Äúdark overlord‚Äù ‚Äì as if grooming them to be played by Kevin Spacey. (They caught Selmayr following @JunckerLU, a parody Twitter account with only 37 followers.) This focus on personal lives bears an inverse relationship to the amount of actual meaning delivered by the various institutional representatives, and supports exactly the same informational levelling ‚Äì in which personal details are held to have news value ‚Äì that made DC Politico so popular in late Bush-era Washington. More than one person told me that the fastest route to total insignificance would be to cover issues of personal morality the way the US media does. Then again, a Dutch energy lobbyist told me his very high hopes for the publication have not been borne out: ‚ÄúThey had this lavish, American-style launch, so I expected an immediate expos√©. It‚Äôs been six weeks and they haven‚Äôt broken one big scandal.‚Äù There are limits to the salaciousness, and Heath does get edited. One Playbook draft I saw contained a reference to the nude appearance of a Danish politician in a campaign ad; the item was titled ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a schlong way to the top.‚Äù There was a picture. The email was sanitised before distribution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Heath grew up 600km north of Sydney, and started writing for the Sydney Morning Herald while at university; after working in London for the Blair government, he decamped for Brussels, where he found a job as one of the commission‚Äôs spokesmen. He was too honest to stand at the podium and not comment, though, so he convinced his superiors to let him do his job at large ‚Äì on Twitter, and out and about at events and panels and parties. He left that job to join Politico in part because there was such a vast gulf between what was being talked about in the cafes and bars and what was being written about by the local press. As an example, he referred to the story Palmeri had been working on, with French reporter Ma√Øa de la Baume, about the rumoured strife between the European parliament president, Martin Schulz, and its secretary general, Klaus Welle. When that story appeared the following week ‚Äì ‚Äúa recent series of political power plays between the two men have mushroomed into a full-fledged feud that is starting to have public repercussions‚Äù ‚Äì Heath tweeted a link: ‚ÄúThe invisible article: the one everyone in #EU Parliament is talking about but afraid to tweet about: Schulz vs Welle.‚Äù * * * One morning I went to see Heath present to a group of technology lobbyists. He was introduced as ‚Äúa reporter from Politico, the new shining star in the Brussels sky‚Äù. The presenter continued, in mock petulance that had the ring of actual pique: ‚ÄúBut in this morning‚Äôs Playbook I couldn‚Äôt find anything on our big party last night, just, ahem, the Google one.‚Äù Heath took only five minutes at the podium to make the related points that a) technological regulation and digital-market integration were not technocratic issues but political ones, and had to be treated as such; and b) that Silicon Valley companies, as evidenced by the Google party in question, were finally awakening to the necessities of soft power. We strolled back together in the uncharacteristic sun to the Politico office, along what Heath described as the ‚ÄúK Street‚Äù ‚Äì the main DC lobbying drag ‚Äì of Brussels. Heath is equal parts smalltown mayor and court jester of devious repute. A woman gave him a kiss on the cheek as she rushed past, and he turned to her long enough to purr: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre looking sexy in those Aviators!‚Äù Brussels can be a pompous place, and Heath thinks that by treating it as at once seductive and silly he might help to let some air out. He does not pretend that he can give the town a new sense of itself ‚Äì and its role in Europe ‚Äì without causing some friction. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to be in touch with someone suffering under austerity when you‚Äôre living here tax-free. This town needs to have a greater experience of discomfort. That‚Äôs how they‚Äôll know that they‚Äôre being taken seriously.‚Äù He broke off the conversation to point to an Italian restaurant. ‚ÄúMarine Le Pen and Martin Schulz like to eat there. Not together, of course. They go on separate nights.‚Äù A young blonde woman walked by us, and just as she passed Heath she turned around and yelled, loudly but sheepishly in a thick French accent: ‚ÄúI love ze Playbewk!‚Äù She hurried away before Heath could see if she might be cultivated as a source. I asked Heath if he had planned that for my benefit, and his face turned the rose of his shirt‚Äôs florid print. ‚ÄúI have no idea who that was!‚Äù He wiped away one tear of laughter. ‚ÄúI feel so embarrassed.‚Äù We walked through a rusty unlocked back door and went up to the office. Budoff Brown came by to talk to him about preparations for the trip they would be taking that weekend to cover the G7 in Bavaria, but was struck first by the audacity of his shirt. ‚ÄúHi, Ryan. So, where‚Äôs the luau?‚Äù Their newsroom coalition is a carefully rigged set of contrary affections, a little Brussels commune inventing itself and its audience as it goes along. If they succeed, what they might do for digital journalism, and perhaps in turn for Europe, will be a lot more interesting than the old Politico ‚Äì in most ways, it already is. Sheftalovich walked over to the desk Heath and Palmeri share and announced a holiday from her usual beat: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm interviewing a princess from the Netherlands!‚Äù Heath often flees, in his polka-dot socks, to the couch in the hallway to avoid precisely this stream of unceasing newsroom banter, but this was an item of interest. ‚ÄúWhich one, Laurentine, M√°xima, or Mabel?‚Äù Sheftalovich, somewhat less familiar with the old European houses, shook her head. ‚ÄúNot sure,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúShe works, doing something with a digital-poverty thing.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Palmeri looked up with renewed attention, ‚Äúso she married into her princessery?‚Äù Palmeri joked this was one of her aspirations in moving to Europe. A few days later, I got Heath‚Äôs morning Playbook at 1am New York time; I have got used to looking at it right before I go to sleep. That morning‚Äôs episode began with a comparative list of the day‚Äôs Greek headlines, in which the debt situation did not seem so dire, alongside hysterical European prognoses of doom. Just below that, a blind item caught my eye: ‚ÄúTHE PRINCESS AND THE Ps: P as in Princess, PR, Precious, POLITICO and Protocol Police. Which representative of European royalty approached POLITICO to ask us to cover the Princess‚Äôs admirable work with an educational charity? But then withdrew the offer, on the basis that we would not let the royal flack approve both the quotes and the context of the article before publication. Dear Princess, we‚Äôre still willing and interested to chat if you want ‚Äì we come in peace.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ Follow the Long Read on Twitter: @gdnlongread This article was amended on 18 June 2015 to correct an error regarding circulation figures for European Voice.

2015-06-18T05:00:08Z,world,World news,Pope's encyclical on the environment: key questions answered,"Q. Encyclicals. Are they the top level of papal declarations? A. Second from top. An apostolic constitution is the highest form of papal decree. Only one has been issued so far this century ‚Äì by Pope Benedict to give Anglicans a way of joining the Catholic church without having to forgo their liturgy and so on. Q. So what is an encyclical? A. Originally, it was a circular letter; the term comes from the Greek word for a circle. The earliest papal encyclicals were sent by the pope of the day to members of the Catholic hierarchy, and sometimes only to those in a particular country. So they could be about quite mundane issues of ecclesiastical organisation.
Q. When did encyclicals come into fashion? A. The man who first seems to have gone big on them was the genial and unpretentious Benedict XIV, who was pope in the mid-18th century. He wrote his first encyclical ‚Äì Ubi Primum, which was about the duties of bishops ‚Äì four months after being elected and issued the last of 44 in the year before he died in 1758. The all-time encyclical writing champion, though, was Leo XIII who sat on the throne of St Peter from 1878 to 1903. He penned more than 80, including one of the most influential, Rerum Novarum, published in 1891. Q. Why was it considered so important? A. It was the papacy‚Äôs ‚Äì long overdue ‚Äì response to a changed world of industrial conflict and class warfare. Rerum Novarum laid the foundations of Catholic social teaching, condemning both Marxism and unfettered capitalism.
Q. Other landmark encyclicals? A. Probably the one that has had the greatest impact on humanity is Humanae Vitae, the encyclical that reaffirmed the Catholic church‚Äôs ban on artificial birth control back in 1968. But Humanae Vitae is also probably the papal diktat that has been most widely ignored by Catholics themselves, notably in Italy, which nowadays has one of the world‚Äôs lowest birth rates. Q. Do encyclicals have to have Latin titles? A. No, though most do. There have been French and Italian titles. And one of the most famous encyclicals was written entirely in German. Q. Why? A. Mit brennender Sorge ‚Äì With Burning Anxiety ‚Äì was Pope Pius XI‚Äôs denunciation of the ideas of the Third Reich. It was smuggled into Germany and read out from the pulpits of Catholic churches on Palm Sunday 1937. Q. But wasn‚Äôt the pope a bit soft on the Nazis?
A. That‚Äôs the accusation levelled against Pius XI‚Äôs successor, Pius XII. Q. Are encyclicals really written by popes? A. Not these days. Leo XIII was said to have written his. But nowadays they are a team effort. In the case of Francis‚Äôs encyclical on the environment, much of the work was delegated to the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, the Vatican department that most closely resembles an overseas aid and development ministry in a secular government. Nevertheless, it is the pope who does the final editing.
Q. After which the encyclical goes to be translated ‚Ä¶ A. Yes, and that can be a story in itself. Because of the importance attached to the words used by a pope, it is crucial that what he says in each language should be understood in the same way. Publication of Pope Benedict‚Äôs third encyclical, Caritas in Veritate, was held up for a week because of the difficulties of reconciling certain passages. Q. Understandable if what the pope says is held to be infallible. No? A. No. Pronouncements held to be infallible are very rare and limited to matters of faith and doctrine. The last papal declaration indisputably regarded as falling into this category was in 1950. Whatever Pope Francis has to say about climate change or fossil fuels will carry great moral weight. But neither he nor the Vatican would claim his views on the environment are infallible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T05:00:08Z,world,World news,Ramadan in St Petersburg ‚Äì the city where the sun doesn't set,"When Ramadan starts on Thursday, the faithful in St Petersburg and elsewhere in northern Russia will face an obstacle that the prophet surely didn‚Äôt envision: in June, the sun never truly sets.
These are the celebrated ‚Äúwhite nights‚Äù, the period lasting from roughly late May to early July when a few hours of twilight is the closest it gets to true night. Although they are observed across the far north, white nights have the strongest association with St Petersburg, the northernmost city with a population of more than 1 million and Russia‚Äôs unofficial cultural capital. For the city‚Äôs Muslim population, it‚Äôs an exacting time. The Qur‚Äôan makes exceptions to the Ramadan fast for people suffering from illness, travellers and women who are menstruating or pregnant. But it does not give explicit instructions on observing the fast in the far north. According to some St Petersburg Muslim authorities, the long-lasting daylight in the city at this time of year is simply an extra challenge to their faith. ‚ÄúIn St Petersburg, Muslims see this as a test. In the time that is now starting they will observe the fast,‚Äù said an employee of the St Petersburg and Northwest Regional Muslim Spiritual Centre, who declined to give his name. ‚ÄúThose Muslims who are observing the fast will wait 21-22 hours to break the fast, they will eat for only three hours.‚Äù
When asked about the difficulty of keeping to this strict schedule, he said it was no burden for the faithful. ‚ÄúIslam is a way of life,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFor us, fasting is the same as getting up in the morning and brushing your teeth.‚Äù Yelizaveta Izmailova, an administrator at a local school who is originally from the largely Muslim region of Ingushetia, said her parents, brother, sister and husband all observed the Ramadan fast with her, following a schedule handed out each week at the central mosque. ‚ÄúThis month, the time for breaking the fast is really late. We don‚Äôt eat or drink from the morning prayer, at about two in the morning, until the sun goes down at around 10pm,‚Äù Izmailova said, explaining that twilight typically arrived as late as 10.30pm in June. ‚ÄúOf course, this is a heavy burden for the human body, but every Muslim makes this choice consciously.‚Äù Although there are no exact figures on how many Muslims live in St Petersburg, last year‚Äôs Eid al-Fitr festivities, which mark the end of Ramadan fasting, drew 42,000 worshippers to the city‚Äôs two main mosques, according to the interior ministry. As often happens on major holidays, most could not fit inside and had to take part from the street. Some Muslim scholars have written that residents of northern regions can forgo the fasting ritual, which is meant as a way to strengthen the will and rule over desires. ‚ÄúAccording to the instructions of the Holy Qur‚Äôan, fasting in regions [near the poles] is never obligatory, for it is established as such only for a set amount of days, that is, in those places where night and day are comparable in length,‚Äù Russian Tatar scholar Musa Bigiev wrote in a text on fasting. Other religious literature suggests that Muslims living in the far north can observe the Ramadan fast according to the time of sunrise and sunset in Mecca or the nearest Muslim city.
In many cases, those performing hard manual labour don‚Äôt fast for safety reasons. Many of the Muslims in St Petersburg are migrants from former Soviet republics in central Asia and the Caucasus working in construction and other low-wage industries. The labour ministry approved a quota of 164,000 migrant workers in St Petersburg in 2014, but the actual number is likely to be much higher. Shakir, a metal-worker originally from Tajikistan, said generally only the elderly and those without work followed the fast in St Petersburg. ‚ÄúI have a hard job, I can‚Äôt observe it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe day is long, and you can‚Äôt drink water or eat before the sunset. For that reason not everyone observes it ‚Ä¶ There aren‚Äôt any white nights where [most] Muslims live.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-18T03:26:58Z,world,World news,Former PNG police chief faces jail for failing to arrest country's prime minister,"The former police commissioner of Papua New Guinea is facing five years in jail after being convicted of failing to act on an arrest warrant for the country‚Äôs prime minister. A court has been told Geoffrey Vaki wilfully disobeyed when he refused to arrest the prime minister, Peter O‚ÄôNeill, in June last year after a PNG anti-corruption taskforce, Sweep, linked him to allegedly fraudulent multimillion-dollar payments by the government to a Port Moresby law firm. O‚ÄôNeill has long denied the accusation. After the 2014 arrest warrant was issued, O‚ÄôNeill refused to present himself for questioning then sacked numerous law enforcement and government officials, including the attorney general and police commissioner, Tom Kalunga, who had signed off on the warrant. In a move described by police unions at the time as highly suspicious, Kalunga was replaced with Geoffrey Vaki, who then delayed acting on the warrant, saying the case needed further investigation. Within days Vaki was arrested by two senior police officers for attempting to pervert the course of justice after it emerged he and the new attorney general had appointed a new police lawyer and instructed him to agree to O‚ÄôNeill‚Äôs request for a stay of the warrant. He later held a press conference telling the media he wanted to wait until the investigation was ‚Äúwater tight‚Äù and any arrest would be ‚Äúa long way down the road‚Äù, the ABC reported. O‚ÄôNeill was never arrested and won an injunction while he challenged the warrant in a separate court case. On Wednesday Vaki was convicted of contempt for not acting on the warrant. In his ruling, the chief justice, Sir Salamo Injia, said Vaki‚Äôs conduct ‚Äúpresented a real risk of interference with the due administration of justice or interfered with the due administration of justice‚Äù. Injia said he was satisfied Vaki‚Äôs disobedience ‚Äúbrought public respect for the justice system into question and disrepute and undermined the rule of law‚Äù. Vaki was sacked from the police commissioner role in May after reports of police brutality and delays in investigating a January police shooting. While the warrant of arrest for O‚ÄôNeill remains subject to the injunction, Wednesday‚Äôs ruling means it is still ‚Äúvalid for all intents and purposes‚Äù, according to the head of the Sweep taskforce, Sam Koim. ‚ÄúThe case has been meticulously analysed and addressed ‚Ä¶ and the court ruled that the warrant of arrest was a court order and that court order is not defective,‚Äù he told Guardian Australia. In July last year the national court permanently stayed an order by the PNG parliament to disband Sweep, but the anti-corruption body ‚Äì which was launched by O‚ÄôNeill ‚Äì was defunded instead. ‚Äú[The taskforce] exists by operational court order, it exists legally,‚Äù Koim said. ‚ÄúBut for operational effectiveness we need funding and that funding has not been forthcoming. ‚ÄúIt is a political decision not to fund us but it‚Äôs also a decision that is personal in nature. It is not a decision isolated from the arrest warrant we recommended against the prime minister. It‚Äôs a position triggered by the arrest warrant.‚Äù Vaki faces sentencing next Thursday and Koim said the prosecutors and the taskforce were pushing for a jail term of five years, but the decision was for the court. O‚ÄôNeill‚Äôs office has been contacted for comment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T23:29:52Z,world,World news,Computer visa glitch leaves migrant workers stranded at US-Mexico border,"A US government computer glitch has left hundreds of migrant farm workers stranded at the Mexican border, as their would-be employers now search for replacements to harvest their summer crops and combat further economic losses on both sides of the border. Farms across the US rely on the H-2A visa program to hire temporary workers for each harvesting season. But the computer failure has prevented the government from issuing these visas to the predominantly Mexican workforce since last Wednesday. ‚ÄúThe longer it goes on, the more it is going to back up and cascade and be a bigger problem for more and more people,‚Äù said Kerry Scott, program manager at Mas Labor, a Virginia-based agency that acts as a middleman between would-be workers in Mexico and farms in the US. On Tuesday, the agency had 357 Mexican workers trapped at various points along the border. Scott said that the level of damage it could cause for harvesting varied ‚Äúfarm by farm‚Äù ‚Äì as some crops ripen more quickly, depending on the time of year. ‚ÄúThis process is always slow and cumbersome, and by the time the workers are arriving, on a normal basis, they are usually already late or about to be late so this just exacerbates the problem,‚Äù said Scott. The majority of seasonal workers come from poor rural villages in states as far flung as Chiapas, Yucat√°n and Guerrero, which can mean bus journeys of up to two days just to reach the border. Some US employers reimburse basic transport and accommodation costs, others only pay for the work visa. None will cover the unforeseen costs resulting from the visa crisis. While US farmers are concerned about the rotting orchards and the potential for prices to rise as a result, Mexicans are losing money as they won‚Äôt be paid for the days missed stuck at the border waiting for the visa system to be repaired. Temporary legal workers are paid an hourly rate, set by the Department of Agriculture, which currently varies from $10 in Alabama to just over $13 an hour in South Dakota. Farm workers typically toil 10 hours a day during the harvest, earning at least $100 a day ‚Äì 10 times what many can earn in Mexico. Most will wire home the vast majority of their salaries to support their families. Zazyl Moreira runs an agency based in Monterrey, Mexico‚Äôs third-largest city in the border state of Nuevo Le√≥n, which helps seasonal workers sort out their temporary visas. On Tuesday, a group of 13 men from Michoac√°n contracted for six months to harvest vegetables by one farm in Indiana arrived at the agency after a 16-hour journey. When they arrived at the consulate in Monterrey for the scheduled interview, they discovered that the office was closed, with no one available to speak to them. These men had given up their farm jobs at home to travel to Indiana, where they‚Äôd been contracted for six months for the third year in a row. Francisco Javier S√°nchez, 26, told the Guardian: ‚ÄúWe cannot afford to stay in Monterrey, so we‚Äôre probably going to have to return home as it‚Äôs too dangerous to cross the border with a coyote. No one will help us pay for this wasted journey. I have a wife and seven-year-old daughter at home, I need to start working.‚Äù
The dangerous, expensive wait for a visa The visa glitch is affecting all seasonal workers, not just farm hands. Activists believe this glitch is showcasing the need for comprehensive immigration reform. Rosalinda Guillen, executive director of Community to Community Development, said that there are enough workers in the US that farmers should not have to rely on the H-2A program. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been extremely easy for the agriculture industry to bring in guest workers to do the work that US-based farmworkers can do,‚Äù she said. She said that the H-2A program leaves immigrant workers at the mercy of the farmers who sponsor them to come over. ‚ÄúWorker rights and civil rights are very difficult to enforce because they are basically tied to the employer and they can be easily deported,‚Äù she said. Because the visa system is down, Guillen said she hopes farmers will turn to skilled workers who are already in the US, but are passed over because they demand higher wages and better protections. ‚ÄúFor us, it means some of the local domestic workers may actually get jobs ‚Äì at least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping,‚Äù she said. Adrienne DerVartanian, director of immigration and labor tights at Farmworker Justice, echoed Guillen‚Äôs concerns that the H-2A program only offers modest worker protections to a vulnerable workforce. ‚ÄúIronically, there wouldn‚Äôt be a problem here if Congress passed comprehensive immigration reform,‚Äù she said. Her group believes such reforms would offer protections for farmers and workers who are suffering from the delay. ‚ÄúThe debt that H-2A workers carry to the United States ‚Äì from illegal recruitment fees and travel costs ‚Äì increases their desperation to work,‚Äù DerVartanian said. ‚ÄúBecause of their dependence on their employer for their continued ability to work in the United States, it also increases their vulnerability in the workplace.‚Äù Jos√© Mario Salda√±a, 25, also from Michoac√°n, was due to start a six-month contract with a landscape gardening company in Maryland last week. He travelled 12 hours from his home to Monterrey last Wednesday. He completed the biometric test but his visa interview was cancelled. He returned back home two days later, having spent $200 on travel, accommodation and food. Salda√±a told the Guardian from his home in Michoac√°n: ‚ÄúHere, I can only find two or three days‚Äô farm work a week which pays $10 a day, I cannot support my family on that, but in Maryland the company is going to pay me $10 an hour. I‚Äôve been told to wait here until they call me with a new appointment, I hope it is soon, I have four children to support, so I need to get to Maryland as soon as possible.‚Äù Moreira said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve just been told by the consulate that interviews will not be rescheduled until at least 25 June, so lots of workers will lose almost a month‚Äôs work in the US. This means their kids will have to go without tennis shoes or they won‚Äôt be able to afford a birthday party, it‚Äôs a big deal, they really need these jobs.‚Äù Professor Rodolfo Casillas, a migration specialist at the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences (Flacso) in Mexico City, said that the current crisis reveals a much wider conflict within US migration policies. ‚ÄúThe technical problem will be resolved in a few weeks, but the immediate aftermath for the US agricultural economy, the search by agricultural companies to find enough labor illegally and the need for workers to work, will without doubt encourage the smuggling of migrants, and increase the costs and the risks of crossing the border undocumented,‚Äù Casillas said. ‚ÄúAll this means more tension, more conflict and more profits for those operating outside of the migration scheme.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T19:42:30Z,world,World news,Luxembourg avoids tax haven blacklist as Brussels announces reform plans,"A blacklist of the world‚Äôs 30 worst-offending tax havens, published on Wednesday by the European commission, includes the tiny Polynesian island of Niue, where 1,400 people live in semi-subsistence ‚Äî but does not include Luxembourg, the EU‚Äôs wealthy tax avoidance hub. Niue, situated east of Tonga in the Pacific Ocean, has appeared on tax haven lists before. But the island, which has an economic output estimated at just $10m (¬£6.3m) a year, has rarely been cast as a major threat to the tax receipts of Europe‚Äôs largest economies. The list also includes various well-known havens ‚Äî among them the Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands and Guernsey ‚Äî but other jurisdictions that are commonly labelled as offshore tax avoidance hubs were notably missing. Jersey and Switzerland, for example, were not named. Within Europe, Monaco, Lichtenstein and Andorra made it onto the blacklist. The commission explained, however, that the list of 30 ‚Äúnon-cooperative jurisdictions‚Äù was designed only to assess non-EU members. As a result, the new register does not include countries such as the Netherlands, Ireland, or Luxembourg ‚Äî all of which are under investigation by the European competition authorities, suspected of offering ‚Äúsweetheart‚Äù tax deals to multinationals. The industrial scale on which Luxembourg ‚Äî one of the richest per capita countries in the world ‚Äî was facilitating the tax avoidance ploys of large corporations was laid bare last year in the LuxLeaks scandal. Many years earlier, Luxembourg‚Äôs aggressive tax policy had been shaped by the Jean-Claude Juncker. Juncker is now president of the European commission, having served as prime minister of the Grand Duchy for 18 years. In March, the commission responded to the LuxLeaks scandal by insisting EU tax authorities share with one another the tax rulings they privately grant to multinationals. Six of the 30 tax havens named by the commission were British overseas territories ‚Äî Anguilla, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and the Turks and Caicos Islands ‚Äî but only one crown dependency, Guernsey, made the list. Twenty-one were small island economies, mostly in the Caribbean Sea, Pacific Ocean or Indian Ocean. Each country on the blacklist had been suggested by at least 10 EU member states as problematic. The UK did not make any suggestions, nor did Germany. Brussels hopes that the list will help member states put pressure on commonly recognised pariah jurisdictions. The register was announced alongside more substantive plans for reforming the way in which multinationals are taxed across the EU, a framework proposal known as the common consolidated corporate tax base, or CCCTB. Pierre Moscovici, European commissioner with responsibility for tax, said: ‚ÄúOur current approach to corporate taxation no longer fits today‚Äôs reality. We are using outdated tools and unilateral measures to respond to the challenges of a digitalised, globalised economy.‚Äù The CCCTB measure will look to harmonise corporate income tax rules among member states in a further effort to combat aggressive tax avoidance. As expected, Moscovici conceded that ‚Äî in the first instance at least ‚Äî the controversial ‚Äúconsolidated‚Äù element of the tax reforms would have to be delayed. His more politically palatable compromise plan seeks to find common ground for the tax treatment of multinationals, making it harder for corporations to build complex structures and transactions between member states that artificially depress tax liabilities. Tax campaigners, however, were quick to raise concerns that the compromised proposals, rather than clamping down on corporate tax avoidance, risked opening up a major new front for tax planners to exploit. In particular, they noted that, in its watered down form, the CCCTB proposal permitted multinationals to offset losses in one EU jurisdiction against profits in another ‚Äî a tax break that is currently unavailable. John Christensen, director of the Tax Justice Network, said: ‚ÄúThe European commission is offering multinational corporations the best of both worlds, and the public will be the losers: the commission proposes to allow cross-border offset of losses without preventing intra-group profit shifting. This widens the possibilities for tax avoidance.‚Äù The commission is understood to be alive to campaigners‚Äô concerns and remains confident of warding against such avoidance strategies by ensuring any directive is tightly drafted. Moscovici conceded that the compromise proposal was not ideal, but had been necessary due to fierce opposition from some member states to the full, consolidated version of CCCTB. Asked if he felt there was sufficient political will among all member states ‚Äî including those such as Ireland, Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands, which are associated with more controversial tax treatments ‚Äî for substantive measures to tackle corporate tax avoidance, Moscovici pointed to parallel crackdowns and national level and at the level of the G20. ‚ÄúI am tempted to quote Bob Dylan,‚Äù he said. ‚Äú‚ÄòThe times they are a-changin‚Äô‚Äô‚Äù.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T19:34:43Z,world,World news,Greece says bailout deal is up to troika amid speculation over exit from EU,"Greece has put the onus on its creditors to prevent it being forced out of the single currency, warning that an economic collapse on a par with the Great Depression of the 1930s had left it broke and unable to pay its debts. Athens announced on Wednesday that it had run out of money, and would not be able to pay ‚Ç¨1.6bn (¬£1.15bn) owed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) at the end of this month, on the eve of a meeting of eurozone finance ministers. The meeting is seen as the last realistic chance of striking a deal before Greece‚Äôs current bailout runs out in 12 days‚Äô time. The warning came as the governor of the Greek central bank said that Greece was on the brink of an ‚Äúuncontrollable crisis‚Äù and warned that leaving the eurozone would also mean ‚Äúexit ‚Ä¶ most likely from the European Union‚Äù. But the chances of a breakthrough on Thursday‚Äôs talks, in an increasingly hostile negotiating environment, were seen as remote. Greece‚Äôs Eurogroup partners have said it would be up to Greece to offer concessions at the meeting, but they think it unlikely that Athens will cross any of its ‚Äúred lines‚Äù despite its desperate financial plight. ‚ÄúThings will not be so lengthy,‚Äù said one official in Brussels. ‚ÄúThe ball, ministers will conclude, is very firmly in the Greek camp. I honestly believe this will be pretty short.‚Äù Greek shares fell sharply for a fourth successive day as the UK government said it was making contingency arrangements to minimise the impact on the economy from a default, which the head of the European parliament said would result in Greece having to leave the European Union, not just the single currency.
Euclid Tsakalotos, the chief Greek negotiator in the talks, ruled out any further cuts to pensions and increased the pressure on the IMF, the European commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) ‚Äì the so-called troika of lenders ‚Äì to soften their approach to a country that has seen its economy shrink by a quarter in five years. Earlier this month, Greece said it would bundle up three payments due to the IMF in June and pay them at the end of the month. But Tsakalotos admitted: ‚ÄúAt the moment we haven‚Äôt got the money.‚Äù The troika has been withholding the last tranche of money from Greece‚Äôs second bailout ‚Äì ‚Ç¨7.2bn ‚Äì until Athens agrees to changes to its economy, but they have deemed unacceptable and counter-productive by the Syriza-led government headed by the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras. Tsakalotos, in an interview with Reuters, said that without help Greece could not pay the ‚Ç¨1.6bn to the IMF: ‚ÄúThere is no financing. We haven‚Äôt got access to the markets, we haven‚Äôt got money that hasn‚Äôt been paid since the summer of 2014, so obviously we won‚Äôt be able to pay that.‚Äù He suggested that Athens could be offered debt relief if the European bailout fund ‚Äì known as the European Stability Mechanism ‚Äì took over Greek bonds held by the ECB. Tsakalotos said that option would not increase debt for Greece or its partners. Asked how confident he was that a deal could be done, he added: ‚ÄúI think that question is mostly for [our] European partners now.‚Äù Martin Schulz, president of the European parliament, told the Guardian in an interview that there was no legal avenue for expelling a country from the eurozone and that dropping out of the 19-country eurozone would mean no longer being in the 28-country European Union. The Lisbon treaty, he said, stipulated that ‚Äúa member of the European Union is vowed to the euro. All the countries have to introduce, sooner or later, the euro and once you are a member of the eurozone there is nothing legally foreseen to leave the eurozone and to stay in the European Union.‚Äù Schulz is on the centre-left and was the first senior EU politician to visit Athens after Tsipras won the election in January. He accused the Greek leader of misrepresenting his sole allies in Brussels, such as Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, who has been trying to mediate in the crisis. ‚ÄúJuncker made far-reaching proposals. Tsipras was not fair in what he said.‚Äù He accused the Greek leader of putting ideology before pragmatism but insisted the Greeks had to meet the terms of the bailout package that expires in a fortnight. Schulz‚Äôs comments about a Greek exit from the EU were echoed by the country‚Äôs central bank governor, Yannis Stournaras. In remarks that infuriated Tsipras, Stournaras, who was appointed by the former centre-right administration, said: ‚ÄúFailure to reach an agreement would ‚Ä¶ mark the beginning of a painful course that would lead initially to a Greek default and ultimately to the country‚Äôs exit from the euro area and ‚Äì most likely ‚Äì from the European Union.‚Äù Whitehall contingency planning meetings have focused on the immediate impact of capital controls in Greece ‚Äì limits on bank withdrawals ‚Äì that could be introduced to avoid a bank run if Greece appears to be moving towards a default on its debts. There is a particular focus on the tens of thousands of British holidaymakers who travel to Greece during the summer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T19:30:44Z,world,World news,'This isn't human': migrants in limbo on Italian-French border,"The beaches of southern France and Italy are dotted with sun-bathing tourists this week, and for a moment Mostafa Ali talks like he‚Äôs one of them. ‚ÄúDo you like my kitchen?‚Äù asks the 20-year-old Sudanese refugee as he shows a passerby around his new seaside home on Italy‚Äôs western-most beachfront. ‚ÄúDo you like my bedroom?‚Äù It‚Äôs a cruel joke, made by Ali at his own expense: his holiday-home is in fact a khaki tarpaulin, his bedroom a slab of rock shared with two other refugees. On the opposite side of the bay, many of the beachcombers would have arrived on cheap flights. But Ali arrived in the hold of a packed fishing boat, one of more than 100,000 migrants to be smuggled across the Mediterranean so far this year. From time to time, he and his friends lower themselves into the sea again, but not to swim; they just want to wash. Around 100 migrants have slept on this rocky strip for the last five days, and the scene has quickly become an emblem of Europe‚Äôs worsening migration crisis. The location helps explain why: the beach lies immediately east of the border with France so this is where the French police dump the migrants they catch trying to enter their country by train. ‚ÄúWe try everything ‚Äì hiding under the seats, in the toilets,‚Äù says Ali, who learnt colourful, colloquial English by watching films such as the Italian Job and Ocean‚Äôs Twelve. ‚ÄúThe only thing I didn‚Äôt try was sitting next to the driver.‚Äù
Ali has been dumped here countless times, trapped in an Escherian loop of aborted train journeys and subsequent arrests. After arriving in Italy in late May, he wanted to move quickly through France to Germany and then Sweden. But every time he reached Menton, the first station inside France, he was caught and taken here instead. One day he was caught four times, walking back each time to Ventimiglia, the last Italian station before the border, and trying again. It was an exhausting series of back-to-back hikes that took him almost a day in total. ‚ÄúI already survived the dangerous desert, the war in Libya, the sea,‚Äù Ali says, alluding to the journey from his war-torn village in Sudan to the shores of Europe. ‚ÄúWalking for 20 hours on foot is nothing. But now I‚Äôm out of money and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still here.‚Äù But there is more than refugees‚Äô individual hopes being dashed on the rocks in Ventimiglia. For some, the scene is a symptom of the failure of the European dream. The reason this makeshift campsite has sprouted in recent days is, the argument goes, because Italy and France have stopped acting like members of the same European Union.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a test of the values of the EU, of bigger countries helping smaller countries,‚Äù says Claude Moraes, a British MEP who has long focused on migration. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very deep test of what the EU means.‚Äù To understand why is to delve into a Europe-wide debate about where migrants should live after they land on Italian and Greek shores. According to regulations, migrants arriving in Italy and Greece are supposed to stay there. But neither country wants to become home to thousands of newcomers it can‚Äôt afford to look after, and who themselves want to move on. So their governments have asked wealthier European countries to take responsibility for 40,000 of the migrants currently in Italy and Greece. So far most other EU states won‚Äôt agree to the plan, and as a result Italy turns a blind eye to migrants leaving for France. In some cases, officials even drive them closer to Italy‚Äôs northern borders. It‚Äôs a situation that infuriates the French government, which faces a strong far-right movement, and doesn‚Äôt want the problem either. So France increased border patrols last week, arresting many more migrants, and leading to the growing camp on the beach in Ventimiglia. On Tuesday, Italian police dispersed 50 of them, forcing the remainder further on to the beachfront. But it is France‚Äôs actions that have caused most anger. ‚ÄúJ‚Äôai honte (I am ashamed),‚Äù reads a sign dangling from the neck of Georges Faye. A retired French diplomat who says he was a cultural attach√© to several countries in Africa, Faye has come to the roadside next to the beach to show solidarity with the migrants.
‚ÄúI am ashamed to be French,‚Äù Faye elaborates, a cigarillo hanging from his mouth, and a wiry goatee stretching around it. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt human. All these people are from places like Eritrea and Darfur. Eritrea is a jail, and we all know what happened in Darfur.‚Äù Faye gestures at the beach. ‚ÄúThese people should be given political asylum. We are 740 million in Europe, and even if we let in 200,000 ‚Äì it‚Äôs nothing.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T19:08:44Z,world,World news,Britain to send intelligence officers to Sicily to 'disrupt' human traffickers,"David Cameron has offered to deploy an extra six British officers from the National Crime Agency to a special Europol intelligence cell in Sicily to ‚Äúdisrupt the trafficking and smuggling gangs‚Äù, Downing Street has announced. In an attempt to deflect criticism that Britain is refusing to take its fair share of refugees rescued from flimsy boats in the Mediterranean, the prime minister made the offer of the extra agents to his Italian counterpart, Matteo Renzi. The two prime ministers agreed over lunch in Milan that Europol needs to redouble its efforts to establish the intelligence cell in Sicily, which was given the green light at an emergency summit in April after the loss of as many as 950 lives in the Mediterranean boat tragedy. Cameron‚Äôs offer of the extra officers came as George Osborne confirmed that HMS Bulwark, which has rescued more than 2,900 migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean over the past six weeks, is to be withdrawn from the role. The chancellor insisted Britain will continue to play ‚Äúour full part‚Äù in search-and-rescue operations in the Mediterranean, but what exactly will replace the 19,000-tonne warship, which is capable of carrying two helicopters, is unclear. Defence sources confirmed HMS Bulwark‚Äôs temporary deployment was only for an initial 60 days, which will expire in three weeks. Downing Street said there was no definitive date yet for the withdrawal of the former Royal Navy flagship. The Ministry of Defence has said it is ‚Äúplanning for a seamless transition of assets‚Äù. In their talks in Milan, Renzi made clear to Cameron that he expected Britain and other EU leaders to do more to take in some of the 60,000 refugees that have crossed, or attempted to cross, the Mediterranean to Italy. He said that Europe as a whole faced a crisis that merits an EU response. Britain says that it is not obliged to take the refugees because it is outside the EU‚Äôs visa-free Schengen travel area. But this is causing the prime minister some political embarrassment in EU capitals where other leaders say that one of the EU‚Äôs largest and richest member states should step up. The prime minister therefore moved to change the focus from housing the refugees to disrupting the smugglers. He told Renzi that the Europol cell in Sicily should be up and running well before the current target date of September. Britain has already deployed one NCA officer to Sicily to help set up the cell. The NCA, which has one officer at Europol‚Äôs headquarters in The Hague, is prepared to deploy an additional intelligence analyst to the Netherlands. Cameron told Renzi that Britain is also prepared to deploy six additional NCA officers to Sicily. The prime minister‚Äôs spokeswoman said: ‚ÄúWe think that the EU needs to be looking at what else we are doing to tackle the root cause of the problem and not just treat the symptom when people arrive here. It is something that was agreed at the April emergency European Council and it is an area where we feel there has been little progress since. Renzi agreed that this is an area where we can seek to make progress together.‚Äù The spokeswoman added: ‚ÄúThe prime minister agreed that the EU needed to do much more to tackle the crisis. He underlined that we thought the focus should be on the other shores of the Mediterranean and on breaking the link between getting in a boat and then getting settlement in Europe. As part of that, he said that one particular area we think the EU should be looking to do more is how we disrupt the trafficking and smuggling gangs that are operating in Africa. The first step in being able to successfully disrupt those gangs is gathering intelligence about them.‚Äù The next step could involve armed force to destroy the smugglers‚Äô boats on the North African coast. But this is seen in Whitehall as a remote prospect in the absence of a national government in Libya.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T18:29:02Z,world,World news,Burden of debt to IMF and European neighbours proves too much for Greece,"Everybody knew it, but Athens‚Äôs stark admission on Wednesday that it simply does not have the money to make a ‚Ç¨1.6bn (¬£1.14bn) repayment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) at the end of the month underlined just how close the country has come to bankruptcy. For all its defiant swagger, the radical Syriza government simply cannot pay the hefty debts Greece incurred when it was bailed out by the IMF and its European neighbours. Central bank governor, Yannis Stournaras, warned that without an imminent deal ‚Äì which must include debt relief ‚Äì Greece could rapidly find itself, ‚Äúrelegated to the rank of a poor country in the European south‚Äù. But the country‚Äôs desperate scrabble for cash is also reminiscent of the fate that faced many countries thousands of miles south of Europe‚Äôs borders ‚Äì the 36 nations, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa, that eventually received debt relief from the west in the 2000s, after fierce campaigning from anti-poverty charities. Notwithstanding the soup kitchens and the lengthening dole queues, living standards on the streets of Athens or Thessaloniki are a world away from the subsistence existence scratched out by the average citizen of Ethiopia or Niger. But the arguments used to support what became known as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries programme (HIPC) absolutely apply. When debt repayments reach a certain level, they undermine social solidarity because governments struggle to afford investment in schools, health and public services. And they undermine economic growth, because the state has to divert resources that could be spent on infrastructure, training and export support towards its foreign creditors. The burden of debt was far from the only reason per capita GDP in sub-Saharan Africa stagnated for two decades from 1980 but the west agreed that growth would not get off the ground without large-scale forgiveness. There‚Äôs no magic point at which debt becomes ‚Äúunsustainable‚Äù but in order for countries to qualify for help under HIPC, they had to have debt repayments that swallowed up 20% of government revenues. Calculations by the Jubilee Debt Campaign suggest the figure for Greece has hit 30%. Yet the European commission and the European Central Bank are continuing to hold out against a write-off. That‚Äôs why Olivier Blanchard, the IMF‚Äôs chief economist, became so infuriated with the air of unreality surrounding the Greek talks that he issued a public statement at the weekend insisting debt relief will have to be an essential part of any sustainable deal. The IMF‚Äôs role in the scores of debt crises that have erupted across the global economy in the past half-century has been deeply controversial, with the stringent conditions it attaches to aid often blamed for exacerbating the plight of crisis-hit countries. But that very experience means its experts ought to know a country drowning in debt when they see it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T17:53:14Z,world,World news,'Making us poorer won't save Greece': how pension crisis is hurting its people,"Five years ago, Sissy Vovou‚Äôs pension was ‚Ç¨1,330 (¬£953) and landed in her back account 14 times a year: you used to get, she wistfully recalls, a full extra month at Christmas, plus a half each at Easter and for the summer. Now it is a monthly ‚Ç¨1,050 ‚Äì and there are only 12 months in the Greek pensioner‚Äôs year. ‚ÄúIn all,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lost 30% of my income. And I‚Äôm one of the lucky ones. I‚Äôm in the top fifth; 80% of Greek pensioners are worse off than me.‚Äù Vovou, 65, who began work at 17 in the publishing industry and ended her career at the state broadcaster, ERT, is also lucky because her son, now 40, has a good job and a regular salary. She does not need to help him out. Eleni Theodorakis, on the other hand, retired in 2008 from her job as an administrative assistant in a regional planning service, aged 55. ‚ÄúMy pension is ‚Ç¨942 euros a month ‚Äì not too bad, really,‚Äù she said, almost shamefacedly, fishing the statement out of her handbag.
‚ÄúFortunately my son is all right, just about, though sometimes he gets paid late. And once or twice, not at all. But my daughter‚Äôs husband has been unemployed for four years now. They have a baby ‚Ä¶ I give them what I can. It isn‚Äôt easy. Thankfully, my sister has a big garden. We grow things.‚Äù There are many like Theodorakis among Greece‚Äôs 2.65 million pensioners. According to a study last year by an employer‚Äôs association, pensions are now the main ‚Äì and often only ‚Äì source of income for just under 49% of Greek families, compared to 36% who rely mainly on salaries. With a jobless rate of about 26% ‚Äì youth unemployment is at 50% ‚Äì and out-of-work benefits of ‚Ç¨360 a month generally paid for no longer than a year, pensions have become ‚Äúa vital part of the social security net for many, many people,‚Äù said Vovou. ‚ÄúRetired parents are having to help their adult children everywhere. And now they‚Äôre demanding we cut them even more? It‚Äôs just so very wrong.‚Äù Pensions have become arguably the biggest hurdle in the tortuous, on-off negotiations between the leftwing government of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, and Greece‚Äôs creditors: its eurozone partners, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
Before they will release ‚Ç¨7.2bn in aid that Greece needs to pay public-sector salaries and pensions and repay ‚Ç¨1.6bn in IMF loans, those lenders want further reforms to the pensions system, including penalties to put people off taking early retirement and more cuts to even the lowest pensions. Tsipras is so far refusing to implement the measures, aimed at shaving the equivalent of 1% of GDP off the country‚Äôs pension bill, arguing they will do nothing to help Greece emerge from a slump that has seen the country‚Äôs economy shrink by 25%, and may only deepen its humanitarian crisis. There is little doubt Greece‚Äôs pensions system needed reform. The EU‚Äôs most expensive, at about 17.5% of GDP, it was made up of more than 130 different pension funds and hid widespread abuse: a pension census ordered in 2012 as part of the country‚Äôs bailout conditions turned up more than 90,000 entirely bogus claimants ‚Äì mostly the relatives of long-dead pensioners ‚Äì and 350,000 more inconsistent claims. Greece also had a remarkable 580 professions deemed hazardous or strenuous enough to qualify for early retirement: firemen and construction workers, certainly, but also hairdressers (because of the chemicals), wind instrument players (gastric reflux) and radio presenters (microbes in microphones). But some reforms are under way: those 130 funds have shrunk to 13, the standard retirement age for men has been lifted to 67, and, above all, since 2010 public and private sector pensions have been severely pruned, on a scale ranging from a 15%-cut for the very lowest (under ‚Ç¨500 a month) to as much as 44% for highest (more than ‚Ç¨3,000).
Greek pensions are now, on the whole, far from exorbitant: social security ministry figures show the average main pension is ‚Ç¨713 a month, and the average top-up pension ‚Äì typically funded by an industry retirement scheme ‚Äì ‚Ç¨169 per month. Some 60% of pensioners get less than ‚Ç¨800 gross a month, and 45% live on less than the monthly poverty limit of ‚Ç¨665. The problems the system faces now are closely related to the country‚Äôs particular plight ‚Äì and Athens is not alone in arguing that further flat, across-the-board pension cuts of the kind envisaged by its creditors are unlikely to accomplish much beyond hurting pensioners even more. The record-high unemployment rate, for example, means the pensions system is running a big deficit: contributions coming in are forecast, this year, to be roughly ‚Ç¨2bn less than benefits going out. That shortfall has widened further because of the large number of older Greek workers seeking early retirement: demand is up 14% in the private sector and 48% in the public sector since 2009.
With unemployment among the over-55s at about 20%, compared to just 6% five years ago, ‚ÄúI felt it was the wisest thing to do,‚Äù said Ioannis Konstatinidis, who retired four years early from a large, now privatised bank in 2012. ‚ÄúPeople were losing their jobs, salaries were being cut, and there was so much uncertainty I just thought it was better to be sure of getting at least something.‚Äù Konstatinidis has ended up getting nearly 40% less than he had counted on, however. ‚ÄúOur retirement will not be quite as comfortable as we‚Äôd thought. But we‚Äôre luckier than lots of people.‚Äù They are. Among the pension cuts being proposed is the abolition of the EKAS, a variable supplementary payment made to nearly 200,000 Greek pensioners to bring their monthly income up to ‚Ç¨700 a month. (Other suggestions made by Greece‚Äôs creditors would hit people like that particularly hard: a hike in the tax on electricity, for example, from 13% to 23%). Few Greeks think further pension cuts will achieve anything. They may also be illegal: the country‚Äôs highest court has already ruled that the private-sector pension cuts pushed through in 2012 were unlawful because they ‚Äúdeprived pensioners of the right to decent life‚Äù. Unsurprisingly, the country‚Äôs pensioners‚Äô unions have called for a major demonstration against further cuts on 23 June. ‚ÄúThe government must absolutely not give in,‚Äù said Anastassios Georgiadis, of the retired postal workers‚Äô association. ‚ÄúAnd Europe has to understand that it is not by making us even poorer that Greece will emerge from this crisis.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T17:43:35Z,world,World news,Former US military personnel urge drone pilots to walk away from controls,"Forty-five former US military personnel, including a retired army colonel, have issued a joint appeal to the pilots of aerial drones operating in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria and elsewhere, calling on them to refuse to carry out the deadly missions. In a joint letter, the retired and former military members call on air force pilots based at Creech air force base in Nevada and Beale air force base in California to refuse to carry out their duties. They say the missions, which have become an increasingly dominant feature of US military strategy in recent years, ‚Äúprofoundly violate domestic and international laws‚Äù. ‚ÄúAt least 6,000 lives have been unjustly taken by US drone attacks in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, the Philippines, Libya and Syria. These attacks are also undermining principles of international law and human rights,‚Äù the authors write. Among those who signed the letter are retired US army colonel Ann Wright, who resigned in 2003 over the invasion of Iraq. She is joined by several anti-war veterans and former members of diverse ranks from the air force, army, navy and marines. The new protest comes as the US military is facing a crisis in its armed drone program as a result of a steady decline in the numbers of trained pilots available to fly the missions. The New York Times reported on Wednesday that the air force was planning to cut the number of its daily drone flights from 65 to 60 as a result of the drain of pilots. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) first sounded the alarm in April 2014 when it said that more drone pilots were quitting the armed forces than were being recruited and trained. Though the air force has set a target of 1,700 drone pilots to fly the desired 65 missions a day, overall numbers are now down to 1,200. The pressures being faced by drone pilots are a little-understood facet of modern remote-control warfare. Though they experience none of the personal danger that is routine for pilots in the cockpits of manned fighter jets, they nonetheless appear to suffer high levels of stress. As the GAO report noted, drone pilots spend hours in the day or at night sitting in front of banks of computers controlling Predator and Reaper drones. Though they are thousands of miles away from the war zone, they do have to press the trigger that launches devastating and deadly bombing strikes. At the end of their shifts they leave the secure mission control centers and minutes later find themselves a short drive across base back in their homes and with their families. ‚ÄúThe Air Force has not fully analyzed the effects on morale related to being deployed-on-station, and thus it does not know whether it needs to take actions in response,‚Äù the GAO said. The letter of the 45 former military members is part of a campaign dubbed ‚Äúrefuse to fly‚Äù coordinated by the website KnowDrones.com. The campaign has also aired 15-second TV commercials urging air force pilots to quit their desks at drone mission control, which have been shown in the regions of Beale and Creech air force bases and are currently airing near Hancock air national guard base and the air guard base near Niagara Falls in upstate New York. The graphic ads show footage of the aftermath of drone attacks and say ‚Äúno one has to obey an immoral law‚Äù.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T17:04:01Z,world,World news,Nato shows its teeth to Russia with elaborate Baltic training exercise,"Dozens of Nato landing craft churned through the Baltic‚Äôs grey waters. Further out at sea, huge warships ‚Äì the US‚Äôs San Antonio, Britain‚Äôs Ocean and Poland‚Äôs Lublin ‚Äì filled the horizon. On the beach, DVs ‚Äì short for distinguished visitors ‚Äì including the UK defence secretary, Michael Fallon, were watching. The landing craft, especially the mega hovercraft of the Americans, were monstrous, on a scale that would have awed D-day veterans. Eurofighter Typhoons flew overhead. Marines raced out to disappear into the woods. A reminder that even the most carefully planned operations can go wrong came when a Polish transport vessel sank, ignominiously, about 100ft from shore. The mock landing at Ustka, Poland, on Wednesday was the climax of a two-week Nato exercise called Baltops. Forty-nine naval vessels from 17 countries and 5,900 personnel were involved in this major show of strength.
It was a dangerous game. One of Russia‚Äôs most important naval bases, Kaliningrad, is just over 100 miles to the east, and the Kremlin may view such exercises as a provocation at a time of heightened tension over the Ukraine crisis.
Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, this week announced plans to buy 40 intercontinental ballistic missiles this year. The US, two years after pulling all its armour out of Europe, is preparing to send 250 tanks, armoured vehicles and artillery to bases in eastern Europe. On Wednesday journalists from around the world were invited to witness Natio‚Äôs elaborate exercise in the Baltic. The US-led alliance wants to show that it is doing something, that it is not feeble in the confrontation with Putin. Fallon, when asked about Baltops, said: ‚ÄúIt is absolutely not a game.‚Äù Asked whether it was provocative to be conducting such exercises so close to Russia, he told the Guardian: ‚ÄúIt is not Nato threatening Russia. This is Russia directly trying to intimidate the eastern and northern members of Nato through these flights, through its submarine activity and talk of renewing its ballistic missiles. Nato is not threatening anyone. ‚ÄúNato has no quarrel with the Russian people. We do have a quarrel with Putin, or Russia, trying to change borders by force.‚Äù Asked about the danger of a renewed arms race in light of Putin‚Äôs pledge on ballistic missiles ‚Äì though Russia is talking about updating existing missiles rather than adding more ‚Äì Fallon said: ‚ÄúRussia is clearly modernising its nuclear defence as well as its conventional arms. Nato likewise is committed to increasing defence spending and increasing the percentage of defence spending that goes on new equipment. Nato is ready to match this kind of sabre-rattling from Russia.‚Äù In recent days, Russian planes have been buzzing low over Nato ships, one just 500ft above the destroyer USS Jason Dunham, according to the US defence department. On Wednesday, Eurofighter Typhoons based in Estonia intercepted Russian military aircraft, bringing to 11 the number of interventions since they were deployed six weeks ago. Five of these have been in the last 10 days, coinciding with Baltops. A US naval officer reported that Russian ships, too, had come ‚Äúuncomfortably close‚Äù ‚Äì less than a mile from the Nato flotilla. It is in international waters and the Russians have as much right as Nato to be there.
Lt Gen Ben Hodges, commander of the US army Europe, briefing journalists in London this week, said: ‚ÄúI am sure the Russians have no desire to go into a head-to-head fight with Nato. But what is a little worrisome is the airspace violations, without transponders, the big exercises right on the border. All of these things heighten the chance and risk of an accident or something unintended happening.‚Äù The response of Nato to the crisis in Ukraine has been feeble: there is no desire on the part of the US to go to war with Russia over a country that is not even a Nato member.
But it wants to send a clear message to Russia that the Baltic states are Nato members and they will be defended. The increased frequency and size of Nato exercises in the Baltic are meant to send that message and Kaliningrad, Russia‚Äôs gateway to the west, is a good place to make the point. During the cold war, Kaliningrad was regularly described as the most militarised place on Earth. Afterwards, that started to change, but against the present crisis it has regained some of its former prominence, with about 50 vessels, almost the same number as those in the Nato exercise, stationed there. The US and the UK devote much of their intelligence capability to monitoring vessels going in and out. Hodges said: ‚ÄúOne of the things that concerns me is the amount of capability that the Russians have put into Kaliningrad. They have the ability to deny access up into the Baltic Sea through anti-ship missiles. They recently did an exercise where they put in an Iskander missile there. That is a range of 300km, a nuclear-capable system which could easily range Riga.‚Äù The importance of Kaliningrad to Russia is that Russian ships from St Petersburg would be vulnerable passing between Estonia and Finland: Kaliningrad has no such vulnerability.
Scandinavian and Baltic countries have reported an increase in Russian naval activity close to their waters, especially involving submarines. The Kremlin has responded by pointing to similar tests of its airspace by Nato planes, and exercises such as Baltops. Nato may say it is ready to match the Kremlin‚Äôs sabre-rattling, but reality is different from the rhetoric. The US is cutting back on defence spending and the size of its forces. A Jane‚Äôs report this week said Russia, suffering an economic downturn due partly to sanctions from the US and European nations, is scaling back plans for big rises in defence spending next year, but there will still be an increase. Even with that, Russia‚Äôs defence spending is dwarfed by that of the US, which is about 10 times bigger.
Igor Sutyagin, a Russian military specialist at London‚Äôs Royal United Services Institute, said the standoff in the Baltics is complicated, with both sides using exercises to send messages. ‚ÄúFor Nato, the message is: ‚ÄòWe will defend the Baltic states, don‚Äôt mess with us, we will defend our interests, we mean business,‚Äô‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe messages have become more confrontational. ‚ÄúNato has made a mistake lagging behind Russian moves. To recapture the initiative, it has to be more aggressive. That is why it is confrontational. It is that Nato recognises that it is necessary to regain dominance and that means being more aggressive than its opponent. It is dangerous.‚Äù One of the contentious issues between Nato and Russia is a pact not to have permanent bases in eastern Europe. Nato has tried to get around this by stationing ‚Äúrotational‚Äù troops in the Baltic states and Poland. They are there all-year round but Nato claims they are not permanent. Russia views this as semantics. ‚ÄúRussia would be left with no other option but to boost its troops and forces on the western flank,‚Äù said Gen Yuri Yakubov, responding to US plans for increased troops and equipment in eastern Europe. Among Russia‚Äôs options, Yabukov said, would be to deploy its new Iskander missiles in Kaliningrad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T17:01:04Z,world,World news,Ebola genetic code analysed to show evolution of worst ever outbreak,"Scientists have analysed the genetic code of Ebola viruses from patients across west Africa and pieced together the evolution of the worst ever outbreak of the killer disease. Experts from Public Health England at Porton Down in Britain, the World Health Organisation (WHO), and other leading labs, used genetic material from 179 Ebola samples to reconstruct the spread of the virus from Guinea into surrounding countries last year. The study found that the initial outbreak had been dying out in Guinea in early 2014 and might have been contained had the international community diagnosed Ebola just one month earlier than it did. The outbreak has so far recorded 27,000 cases and killed more than 11,000 people.
The analysis shows that the original circulating strain in Guinea died out in July 2014, but not before it was taken to Sierra Leone in May, perhaps by someone who became infected when they visited Guinea for a funeral. In Freetown, Sierra Leone, the virus mutated as it spread, before being re-imported back into Guinea as a new strain that tore across the country. ‚ÄúThe initial containment was nearly successful. If we‚Äôd been out there not at the end of March, but in February, maybe this would never have happened,‚Äù said Miles Carroll, head of microbiology research at Public Health England. ‚ÄúWe could have stopped a lot of health workers and patients from becoming infected.‚Äù
Many researchers trace the origins of the Ebola outbreak back to a two-year-old boy called Emile, who died from the infection a few days after Christmas, in 2013. The boy may have contracted the virus from fruit bats that were roosting in trees near Meliandou, a village in southern Guinea. The latest analysis, reported in Nature, supports that account, but does not prove it. The virus leapt from an infected animal into a human some time between December 2013 and February 2014, the study found. Doctors at M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res in Gu√©ck√©dou, a town in southern Guinea near the borders of Sierra Leone and Liberia, sent the first samples of what turned out to be Ebola to labs in Hamburg and Lyon in March 2014. The labs confirmed the identity of the virus and alerted the WHO, which dispatched a rapid response unit called the European Mobile Laboratory to the scene. Tens of scientists travelled with diagnostic equipment to Guinea‚Äôs capital, Conakry, and onwards in four-by-fours to Gu√©ck√©dou. The unit they set up ensured patients with Ebola were not sent to the main hospital, where the infection would easily spread to health workers and patients.
For the latest study, the scientists analysed about 15 Ebola samples taken each month of the outbreak from March 2014 to January 2015. Because the virus mutates over time, the genetic code can reveal how the infection spread from one place to another. According to the study in Nature, the initial outbreak grew around Gu√©ck√©dou, Macenta and Kissidougou in Guinea in March 2014. By the end of May a new strain of the virus had been carried to Sierra Leone, and also into Liberia. The virus spread rapidly in those countries, before being carried back into Guinea from June 2014 onwards. This second wave was far worse than the first outbreak. In the autumn, the virus crossed twice from Guinea into Mali, from Beyla district in October and from the Siguiri district one month later. Beyond the light it casts on the way Ebola spread, Carroll said the study shows how, with present technology, we cannot predict where the next outbreak will occur. ‚ÄúWhat we need is an early warning system that uses real time genetic sequencing, and an effective and rapid response plan,‚Äù he said. ‚Ä¢ This article was amended on 18 June 2015.

2015-06-17T16:49:55Z,world,World news,"US struggling to recruit Iraqi troops to fight Isis, Pentagon chief admits","The US defense secretary Ash Carter has painted a bleak picture of the country‚Äôs efforts to train fighters in Iraq and Syria, revealing the military has trained fewer than a third of the Iraqi troops it expected would lead the fight against the Islamic State. He described the Iraqi-led ground campaign as ‚Äúa work in progress‚Äù and conceded there were also serious difficulties in identifying fighters who could be trusted to fight Isis in Syria. ‚ÄúWe simply haven‚Äôt received enough troops,‚Äù Carter said on Tuesday, stating the US has only trained around 7,000 Iraqi security forces, at four specialist sites it had anticipated would be used to train 24,000 soldiers by the fall.
Training Iraqi fighters for the foundering ground campaign to seize back territory controlled by Isis is a central pillar of the Pentagon‚Äôs strategy. Military chiefs have repeatedly said they believe local forces on the ground, combined with US-led air strikes in Iraq and Syria, can degrade and ultimately defeat the militant group. Carter told told a House armed services committee hearing that Isis could still be defeated, despite the series of military setbacks experienced by the Iraqi army. He acknowledged a failure to recruit local security forces, particularly Sunnis who have so far proved reluctant to join the fight, and said pressure was being placed on the Iraq government to ramp up effort to recruit paid fighters. Last week President Barack Obama approved sending 450 extra troops to bolster the Iraqi army in Anbar province. As with other deployments, the White House insists these are non-combat personnel. The US has been incrementally increasing its presence in Iraq with troops it describes as advisers and facilitators in the year since Isis took control of large sections of the country. More than four years after the US officially pulled its troops out of Iraq, the total number of its military personnel deployed in the country now stands at 3,550. Despite that, the Iraqi government has seemed unable to rein in the insurgents; last month Isis took Ramadi, in Anbar province and the Iraqi army has failed to retake Mosul, lost to Isis last year.
Republican hawks in Washington are pushing for a deployment of thousands of ground forces in Iraq, arguing the country‚Äôs army is incapable of defeating the militants. Others on Capitol Hill are asking whether the US should redirect support currently going to the Iraqi government directly to Kurdish forces, which are showing more promise. Carter said that both the US and other allies were equipping the Kurds, ‚Äúwho really know how to fight‚Äù, and insisted there were some signs of progress in the effort to recruit Sunni troops for the Iraqi army. While efforts to train Iraqis had been ‚Äúslowed by a lack of trainees‚Äù, Carter said, last week‚Äôs deployment of a further 450, to be based at Taqaddum, in Anbar province, would accelerate the training of Sunni fighters, he said. Carter added that efforts to train and arm rebel groups in Syria were proving considerably more complicated than in Iraq. The defense secretary said it was proving difficult to identify the rebels in Syria that had the ‚Äúright mindset and ideology‚Äù and the capacity to fight the militants. ‚ÄúWhen we equip them and set them loose, what responsibility do we have to them thereafter?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúI think we have some obligation to support them and protect them, including supply them.‚Äù That raised the risk, he added, of US military equipment being ‚Äúdiverted‚Äù to fighters and other extremists in Syria. ‚ÄúWe have enough training sites,‚Äù he said of the operation to train Syrian-based fighters, ‚Äúfor now we don‚Äôt have enough trainees.‚Äù The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Martin Dempsey, who also appeared at the hearing, echoed concerns about the difficulty in recruiting and retaining suitable fighters in Syria as well as Iraq. He said there would be a decision ‚Äúwithin the next couple of months‚Äù about suitable rebel fighters the Pentagon could support in Syria with command and control assistance. ‚ÄúWe have had some challenges recruiting and retaining. We‚Äôre trying to work through those,‚Äù he said. Asked if it was worth continuing with the policy of training and equipping Syrian rebels, given the inability so far to identify suitable partners, Dempsey replied: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just literally at the first iteration or trance of this, so it is a little too soon to give up on it.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T16:15:01Z,world,World news,Greece says it will run out of money by end of month without bailout deal,"Greece‚Äôs radical government has confirmed that it will run out of money by the end of the month unless its creditors agree to release ‚Ç¨7.2bn (¬£5.1bn) in bailout funds. As Athens prepared to meet its lenders on Thursday amid an increasingly sour atmosphere of claims and counter-claims, lead negotiator Euclid Tsakalotos conceded that the country does not have the funds to make a ‚Ç¨1.6bn payment to the International Monetary Fund due on 30 June. Athens delayed a payment to the IMF earlier this month, saying it would take advantage of a technical loophole, allowing it to ‚Äúbundle‚Äù three tranches into a single ‚Ç¨1.6bn payment. But Tsakaolotos has now admitted that Greece simply does not have the money. He also underlined the fact that while Greece is still willing to make concessions to its lenders, it will not make pensions cuts ‚Äî a key point of contention in the negotiations. Tsakalotos‚Äôs intervention came after Yannis Stournaras, governor of Greece‚Äôs central bank, warned that his country is on the brink of an ‚Äúuncontrollable crisis‚Äù. Stournaras used his annual report to the Greek parliament to warn that failure to reach a deal would ‚Äúmark the beginning of a painful course that would lead initially to a Greek default and ultimately to the country‚Äôs exit from the euro area and ‚Äì most likely ‚Äì from the European Union‚Äù. His remarks came amid growing fears that Greece may be unable to avoid leaving the euro. In the UK, a spokeswoman for David Cameron said the government was ‚Äústepping up‚Äù its preparations for a possible ‚ÄúGrexit‚Äù, which she said was a serious economic risk to the UK. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt go into the specifics of these plans but of course they will be looking at how we make sure we have looked at the impacts on business, the banks and the financial sector and tourists,‚Äù she added. Stournaras warned that failure to reach a deal would result in a deep recession and soaring unemployment in Greece, and force it to be ‚Äúrelegated to the rank of a poor country in the European south‚Äù. He also called on Greece‚Äôs creditors to honour their promise to offer debt relief, as part of the second bailout of the country in November 2012. Any new deal must be ‚Äúbased among other things on our European partners‚Äô delivery on their commitments in November 2012 to Greek debt relief, which now need to be specified in greater detail‚Äù, he argued. Hopes of a deal have been severely tested in recent days by the increasingly bitter war of words, with the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, accusing the country‚Äôs creditors of ‚Äúpillaging‚Äù Greece, while European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, previously seen as sympathetic to Greece‚Äôs cause, said the government was misleading the Greek public about the negotiations. However, Greece received public support on Wednesday from the Austrian chancellor, Werner Faymann. Austria has tended to take a hard line in previous rounds of Greek debt talks but Faymann, a social democrat who has toured Greek schools and hospitals, criticised some of the measures being demanded by Greece‚Äôs creditors: the European Central Bank, the European commission and the International Monetary Fund. ‚ÄúI know there were a number of proposals, also from the institutions, that I also don‚Äôt find in order. High joblessness, 30-40% [with] no health insurance and then raising VAT on medicines. People in this difficult situation cannot understand that.‚Äù Separately, the European Central Bank is due to decide later on Wednesday whether to raise the ceiling on the amount of funding ‚Äì known as emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) ‚Äì that Greece‚Äôs central bank is allowed to offer to its struggling private sector banks. The limit has repeatedly been increased in recent weeks to ‚Ç¨83bn, to prevent Greek banks from collapsing amid fears of capital flight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T15:49:27Z,world,World news,Students killed in Berkeley balcony collapse mourned in Ireland,"Flags are flying at half-mast across Ireland for the Irish students who were killed in a balcony collapse in California, as it emerged that two of the dead were cousins. Families of the five Irish citizens have begun arriving at the scene of the tragedy, at the Berkeley campus of the University of California. Thirteen people are believed to have been on the fourth-floor balcony when it collapsed during a birthday party early on Tuesday morning.
A sixth student from California, who held joint US-Irish citizenship, was also killed; seven others were injured. Ireland‚Äôs prime minister said the tragedy had resonated with every family, and parents especially, across Ireland. Speaking in the Dail (Irish parliament), Enda Kenny said: ‚ÄúWhen you look at the newspapers this morning, don‚Äôt you see the photographs of your own children?‚Äù The taoiseach then read the names of the six young people who died into the D√°il record as a memorial to them. He also told the Dail that he was sending Ireland‚Äôs minister for the diaspora, Jimmy Deenihan, to San Francisco as soon as possible as a gesture of solidarity to bereaved families and the injured. A safety expert in Berkeley said those attending the birthday party were ‚Äúpacked like sardines‚Äù on the balcony. The city of Berkeley said it had ordered the property owner to immediately remove the collapsed balcony and to perform a structural assessment of the remaining balconies within 48 hours. Grace Kang, a structural engineer and spokeswoman for Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center at Berkeley, said the balcony‚Äôs dimensions looked to her to be 4ft by 6ft.
That would mean the balcony should hold at least 1,440 pounds (653kg) ‚Äì a total that likely would have been exceeded by 13 adults, she said. ‚ÄúThey were packed like sardines, and then they were moving,‚Äù Kang said. When people are moving on the structure it could ‚Äúfurther exacerbate‚Äù the strain. Kang pointed out that the Library Gardens apartment house was a wood-frame construction, and the balcony was cantilevered out from the building, with no additional support beneath. Both can make a balcony more vulnerable to dry rot and weathering in general, she said. The dead were named as Olivia Burke, 21; Eoghan Culligan, 21; Niccolai Schuster, 21; Lorc√°n Miller, 21; and 21-year-old Eimear Walsh ‚Äì all Irish citizens studying at the University of California on J1 visas ‚Äì and Ashley Donohoe, 22, from Rohnert Park, California. Burke and Donohoe were first cousins. The area where the accident took place is traditionally popular with Irish students, whose specialist visas allow them to work legally in the US over the summer. At the Church of Our Lady in Foxrock in south Dublin, a vigil was held on Tuesday night for parishioners Walsh and Burke. Fr Frank Herron, the parish priest, said: ‚ÄúThe tragedy is that they were heading out full of life and full of the joys of summer, they had the whole summer to look forward to and it‚Äôs the last thing anybody would be expecting that something like this would happen,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI was talking to one of the families whom I know well and they of course are distraught,‚Äù he added. In south Dublin a former headteacher of Miller described him as ‚Äúa sportsman and he was an academic but above all he was an exceptionally lovely young man‚Äù.
Retired headmaster Arthur Godsil told Irish radio: ‚ÄúHe was such a personality. Looking back over his career in St Andrews he would have given so much more back to the school than he took from it. He was an engaging and an exceptional young man.‚Äù Meanwhile counselling services have been set up at University College Dublin, where three of those killed in the accident were students. Flags will also be flown at half-mast around the South Dublin campus on Wednesday. Marcus O‚ÄôHalloran, president of UCD‚Äôs student services said: ‚ÄúI would just like to reiterate to all the students at home and abroad that UCD students are here for them. We have a number of services, we have a welfare services and advisory service, we have a 24-hour hotline here at the moment.‚Äù A Gaelic football club in Dublin where Culligan was a player paid a warm tribute to the young student. In a statement on the club‚Äôs website, it said: ‚ÄúIt is with great regret and sadness that we inform you that Ballyboden St Enda‚Äôs member Eoghan Culligan was one of the six people who tragically lost their lives in Berkeley, California. ‚ÄúEoghan has been a member of Ballyboden St Enda‚Äôs since childhood and was part of the Minor A championship team that were beaten by Castleknock GAA in the county final of 2011. He continued to play football with both the intermediate and junior teams. ‚ÄúEoghan was very popular with his team-mates and this tragic news is keenly felt by all members of our club, but especially by those players and mentors who knew him well.‚Äù The mother of one Irish student who was out celebrating the same 21st birthday has spoken of her relief that he did not go back to the apartment where the balcony collapsed. Ann Travers‚Äô son Conor knew several of the victims and was drinking with them in the bars of Berkeley, but did not go with them to the apartment. Travers said she would give Conor ‚Äúthe biggest hug of his life‚Äù when he returned from California to her home in Co Wicklow. ‚ÄúYesterday afternoon was the worse experience of my life,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMy family and I never want to go through it again. I eventually heard Conor was safe through a friend of his, who sent a message to my eldest son. Conor then sent me a brief message after about a further hour‚Äôs wait. ‚ÄúI managed to speak properly to him late last night. He had been out celebrating but was not in the apartment when the tragedy happened. He knows two of the young men who passed away and two of the injured. His thoughts are with the friends and families of the deceased and injured. He rightly says this isn‚Äôt about him and he is in deep shock. He says everyone over there is.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis morning my heart is bursting for all of the families affected and for all the young people still on their J1‚Äôs who are dealing with this shock, far away from home and I‚Äôm looking forward to giving my son the biggest hug of his life when he returns home.‚Äù Meanwhile, two of the Irish students injured in the accident are said to be in a critical condition, with one young man suffering injuries including a broken back and smashed legs. Ireland‚Äôs foreign minister Charles Flanagan said on Wednesday that extra diplomatic staff have been deployed from other parts of North America to help provide support for the families of the dead and injured arriving in San Francisco.
Flanagan said: ‚ÄúTwo officers from Embassy Washington have arrived in San Francisco to provide further support to the consulate team today, while our consulates in New York and Boston are on standby to assist families travelling via those cities. ‚ÄúFamily members of the deceased and injured are travelling to San Francisco today, where they will be met on arrival by a team from our consulate in San Francisco. A consular team from my department provided support to them at Dublin airport before they travelled.‚Äù Since news of the accident broke, Flanagan said his department had received more than 500 calls from anxious parents and family members about their loved ones working and studying in the San Francisco Bay area. The lord mayor of Dublin, Christy Burke, has opened up a book of condolence at his residence, the Mansion House in the Irish capital, from 10am on Wednesday. ‚ÄúIt will be a chance for the people of Dublin to express their sympathies to the families involved,‚Äù Burke said. The American ambassador to Ireland, Kevin O‚ÄôMalley, said on Wednesday that his embassy has made all the resources available to the Irish government to enable families to travel to the west coast, and that he has been in touch with Flanagan and the taioseach, Enda Kenny. Kenny said: ‚ÄúMy heart breaks for the parents who lost children and I can only imagine the fear in the hearts of other parents.‚Äù Additional reporting by Amanda Holpuch in New York",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T15:32:39Z,world,World news,Berkeley Irish student deaths: minister hits out at New York Times coverage,"An Irish government minister has denounced a New York Times article detailing the ‚Äúdrunken partying‚Äù lifestyles of Irish students in California as disgraceful, coming so soon after the death of six young people in a balcony collapse in Berkeley. The feature, written by three NYT journalists, makes reference to the thousands of Irish students who travel with special J-1 visas allowing them to work in the United States every summer.
The article says these students are ‚Äúnot just a source of aspiration, but also a source of embarrassment for Ireland, marked by a series of high-profile episodes involving drunken partying and the wrecking of apartments in places like San Francisco and Santa Barbara‚Äù. The article quotes a 2014 column by Cahir O‚ÄôDoherty, the arts and culture editor of the Irish Voice, expressing distress at ‚Äúthe callous destruction unleashed by these loaded Irish students‚Äù at a rental house in San Francisco‚Äù. ‚ÄúThey ripped chandeliers from the ceilings, they broke doors and they smashed windows; they even punched holes in the walls,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúThen they abandoned the place without a heads-up or a word of apology.‚Äù Five Irish students and one student with dual Irish-American citizenship, all aged 21 or 22, were killed when the apartment balcony they were gathered on during a 21st birthday celebration collapsed. Seven others were injured.
More than 150,000 Irish students have used the programme for J-1 visas to work in the US over the last 50 years, including 8,000 who crossed the Atlantic last summer. Ireland‚Äôs junior minister for new communities, culture and equality, Aodh√°n √ì R√≠ord√°in, condemned the NYT article‚Äôs references to wild Irish student behaviour in the context of the death toll in Berkeley.
The Labour TD tweeted a message to the New York Times on Wednesday telling the paper: ‚ÄúYour newspaper‚Äôs reporting of the Berkeley tragedy is a disgrace‚Äù. He later added to his criticism of the New York Times, calling the paper‚Äôs coverage of the tragedy crass and insensitive. Irish citizens have also taken to social networks to denounce the article‚Äôs publication so soon after the accident, with many describing it on Twitter as a ‚Äúshameful article‚Äù.
Ireland‚Äôs equality minister challenged the New York Times on Wednesday to take down an article about the drunken antics of Irish students in California and apologise for using it in its coverage of the Berkeley balcony tragedy. Aodhan O‚ÄôRiordhan said the paper had focussed on a ‚Äúnational stereotype‚Äù of wild hard-drinking Irish young people in the feature. The Dublin Labour TD told The Guardian: ‚ÄúIf that had been victims from any other nation would they have written an article like that? To do so in your early coverage of this tragedy is well, quite frankly disgusting. ‚ÄúIn the past I have gone to America like other Irish students to work hard and when work is over to enjoy myself. This tragedy could have happened to anyone from any country so I cannot understand why a paper of such repute would publish something like this. They should remove it and apologise.‚Äù New York Times spokesperson Eileen Murphy said in an email that the article was ‚Äúintended to explain in greater detail why these young Irish students were in the US‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe understand and agree that some of the language in the piece could be interpreted as insensitive, particularly in such close proximity to this tragedy,‚Äù Murphy said. ‚ÄúIt was never our intention to blame the victims and we apologize if the piece left that impression. We will continue to cover this story and report on the young people who lost their lives.‚Äù The New York Times public editor, Margaret Sullivan, acknowledged the furore over the article on Twitter. She said that she ‚Äúmay post on it‚Äù in her column, where she responds to reader comments about the newspaper‚Äôs coverage as a person outside of its reporting and editing structure.
Later on Wednesday morning, Sullivan added to her earlier comment. ‚ÄúSincere sympathy to all affected by Berkeley tragedy,‚Äù Sullivan wrote on Twitter. ‚ÄúPlease know that I am aware of reaction and will look into it today.‚Äù Meanwhile, the Irish Daily Star also came under fire over its coverage of the accident. The paper ran photos of the victims superimposed on an image of body bags being taken from the scene of incident in Berkeley. One shop in Galway city removed all copies of the tabloid from its shelves. Paul O‚ÄôBrien, the shop‚Äôs owner, said: ‚ÄúI felt it was in very poor taste so I took the copies of the paper down from the shelves when I became aware of the front page. ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt stop selling the Star in the future or anything but for today, it won‚Äôt be for sale in this shop.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-17T14:52:07Z,world,World news,Sudan reacts to Omar al-Bashir's brush with international law,"For a moment on Sunday it seemed like Sudan‚Äôs president Omar al-Bashir‚Äôs had finally lost control of his destiny: while visiting South Africa for an African Union summit, the country‚Äôs high court issued an interim order to prevent him leaving the country in order to answer international criminal charges. He is the world‚Äôs only sitting leader to have been indicted by the international criminal court (ICC) for crimes against humanity over the government‚Äôs role in the Darfur conflict. But by Monday ‚Äì in clear defiance of both national and international law ‚Äì he was on a private jet back headed for Sudan‚Äôs capital, Khartoum.
Bashir is the autocratic ruler of a country that routinely stifles free speech, meaning that the voices of Sudanese citizens ‚Äì especially those caught up in violence ‚Äì are overlooked in international debates about their country. Here‚Äôs how Sudanese citizens reacted to the week‚Äôs dramatic events, and the implications for what many have decried as a failure for international law. Refugees: ‚ÄòBashir will face justice‚Äô Darfur-based news site Radio Dabanga spoke to Darfuri refugees living in eastern Chad who expressed gratitude at the attempt of the South African high court, a move which they say has given them fresh hope in international justice. For the refugees, the blame lies with South African president Jacob Zuma for letting the president escape, but ‚Äúthey believe that Bashir will face justice, no matter how long it takes,‚Äù Haidar Gardia, head of the Touloum camp said. Abdel Wahid Mohamed Ahmed El Nu, of the Sudan Liberation Movement (SPLM) told the radio station the events would serve to remind the world about ‚Äúthe genocide the regime committed‚Äù.
Ahmed El Nu also made an appeal to the Rapid Support Forces, a militia group linked to the government, to: ‚Äúrefrain from Bashir‚Äôs crimes and join the Sudanese people in their march to change, and building a state of equal citizenship.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf Bashir, who enjoys immunity, is chased in this way, you are not immune,‚Äù he reminded them. Voices from Sudan As news first filtered through of his possible arrest #Bashir was trending on Twitter with human rights campaigners sharing images of the devastation and destruction in Darfur using #arrestBashir. According to tracking service Topsy the hashtag had been used 4,600 times since Sunday. Twitter account Voices of Sudan (@Sudan_Voices), which is curated by a different Sudanese Twitter user every week, asked their followers to share their thoughts as events unfolded. One complaint was that the ICC disproportionately targeted Africans ‚Äì a criticism voiced by many African leaders, ‚Äúand to some extent the general public‚Äù in Africa, according to the Washington Post. One Twitter user, Walid Ibrahim (@waleedib83), said that whilst he believed that Bashir should be put to justice this was not the right course of action, leaving fellow Twitter user Getachew A. Woldie, to question exactly what the right mechanism should be. Others raised questions, and fears, for the future of Sudan. The president has been in power since 1989, and in April extended his 26-year with a 94.5% landslide win in a general election that was boycotted en masse by opposition groups on the grounds that it was a ‚Äúpolitical charade‚Äù. Responding to a later question about where people saw Sudan in 15 or 20 years time, Twitter user @AayahOsama said: ‚ÄúMy vision is so dark for this place. I have no hope whatsoever.‚Äù Media reaction On Monday, New York Times journalist Nicholas Kristof was tweeting from ‚Äúremote Sudan‚Äù claiming that people were ‚Äúthrilled by news that South Africa tried to block Pres. (sic) Bashir from leaving.‚Äù The ambiguity of his location drew the ire of some on Twitter, but he had stated that he was unable to reveal his location due to ‚Äúsecurity reasons‚Äù. The general feeling, he tweeted, was that it was time for Bashir to leave.
This mood wasn‚Äôt not reflected in the nation‚Äôs papers on Tuesday morning. The BBC reported that Al-Watan newspaper led with ‚ÄúBashir returns to the country, is welcomed by large crowds‚Äù with al-Taghyir carrying similar scenes on their front page. Sudan‚Äôs independent media is has been severely weakened by government crackdowns, including news blackouts and print seizures which are common ways the government tries to stifle any form of dissent. Watchdog Freedom House have also reported similar crackdowns on the use of the internet. South Africa‚Äôs constitutional crisis? For some South Africans the incident has sparked a constitutional crisis. Political analyst Justice Malala said it hailed the death of South Africa‚Äôs reputation as a human rights leader and lamented a worrying tendency of Zuma‚Äôs government to side with Africa‚Äôs tyrants. Brooks Spector, associate editor at the Daily Maverick website, raised concerns about South Africa‚Äôs legitimacy. ‚ÄúAt the minimum it says that South Africa doesn‚Äôt value international law‚Äù, he told Eye Witnesss News, warning of a ‚Äúpenalty clause‚Äù the next time South Africa needs international support.
Writing for Africa is a Country, Oumar Ba said Bashir‚Äôs arrest would have had significant political implications across the continent. ‚ÄúHad South Africa arrested Bashir, that would have sent shockwaves throughout the African Union that may well have been fatal to the organisation‚Äôs survival‚Äù. Elsewhere Twitter users, including BBC correspondent Fergal Keane, pointed to the irony of a national border that allows Bashir to go free but refuses to let the Dali Lama attend a summit of Nobel peace laureates. ‚ÄòThe ICC unwelcome in Africa‚Äô Never one to miss out on controversy, this year‚Äôs chair of the AU, 91-year-old Robert Mugabe‚Äôs said that the ICC was ‚Äúunwelcome in Africa‚Äù, further highlighting the tension between the international body and African leaders. The Zimbabwean president is considered a hero by some for speaking out against western imperialism, but others have raised questions about the legitimacy of an African Union led by an autocratic leader who has become increasingly isolated on the international stage. The summit also saw Mugabe deride African presidents for ‚Äúfinding any excuse‚Äù to stay in power. Without naming names it‚Äôs widely assumed that he was talking about Burundi‚Äôs president Pierre Nkurunziza, whose decision to stand for a third term sparked violent protests and a failed coup.
A video of the speech was met with laughter from the audience at the AU, but was received with mass-scepticism online. The 91-year-old has been in power since 1980.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T14:12:48Z,world,World news,David Cameron says he is losing patience over Iraq inquiry report delay,"David Cameron has written to Sir John Chilcot warning he is ‚Äúfast losing patience‚Äù with the Iraq inquiry, amid reports the report might not appear for yet another year. The inquiry has now been running for six years, but Chilcot told the prime minister in a letter that responses submitted by individuals and organisations who have been criticised have ‚Äúopened up new issues‚Äù, while others have yet to reply. Following reports of further delays, the government released a letter from Chilcot making clear that he could not yet give a timetable for publication. ‚ÄúIt is now essential that all remaining responses are received so that the process can be completed,‚Äù the letter from Chilcot said. ‚ÄúOnly when all responses are in our possession and have been evaluated will I be able to write to you with a realistic timetable for completion.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúI and my colleagues understand your concern that it has not been possible to publish our conclusions before now. I am sure you will also share my desire to ensure that those conclusions ‚Äì covering a period of nine years ‚Äì hold firm once published.‚Äù Cameron, who wanted the report to be published last year, expressed his disappointment and reminded Chilcot of the public and that those who have lost loved ones were ‚Äúawaiting the results of your work‚Äù. ‚ÄúThey, and I, had hoped for publication of your report by now and we are fast losing patience,‚Äù he added. George Osborne, the chancellor, was also pressed on the issue by the SNP as he stood in for Cameron at prime minister‚Äôs questions. The SNP‚Äôs Westminster leader, Angus Robertson, said ministers have a ‚Äúmoral or political responsibility‚Äù to find out why the report keeps being delayed, after noting that both Cameron and Osborne joined Labour in voting to go to war in Iraq. Osborne replied with a call for those involved in the inquiry to ‚Äúget on with it‚Äù and publish the report but argued the government could not interfere with the timing by ordering its immediate publication. ‚ÄúThe Chilcot inquiry is of course completely independent of government and we do not determine when it publishes its conclusions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut where I agree with you is this ‚Äì it has been a long time coming and people I think are running out of patience, they want to see that report. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd make a broader observation that of course there was a cross-party alliance between the Scottish Nationalists and the Conservative party when we called for that inquiry to be set up earlier than it actually was. If it had been we‚Äôd have the conclusions now.‚Äù Pressure on Downing Street to hurry up the publication is not just coming from the SNP. Jake Berry, a Conservative MP, is urging Cameron to ensure that no former MPs are given peerages until the Chilcot inquiry has been published, which he believes would enable members of the Commons to ‚Äúscrutinise the inquiry and also the appointments commission to have all information before anyone is sent to the House of Lords.‚Äù Lord Morris of Aberavon, a former attorney general, has even called on the prime minister to consider sacking Chilcot. The Labour peer said Cameron should look at ‚Äúthe case for discharging the chairman and members of the Chilcot inquiry, and inviting the cabinet secretary to set out a mechanism for an interim report to be produced on the basis of the evidence gathered‚Äù. Asked about this suggestion, a senior Number 10 source said it was Chilcot to make the decision to publish.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T13:12:09Z,world,World news,Republican abortion bans ignore the dangers ‚Äì and anguish ‚Äì of premature births,"Republicans have long sought to ban abortions after 20 weeks ‚Äì 10 US states already have such bans in effect in effect, one more may be on the way, and conservatives in Washington have been consistently pushing 20-week restrictions for the better part of a decade. Earlier this year, as Republicans took control of Congress, they introduced a bill considered so restrictive ‚Äì rape and incest exceptions were allowed only if victims reported their assaults to police ‚Äì that Republican women revolted against the vote.
Now the ban is back: Senator Lindsey Graham reintroduced federal legislation limiting abortions after 20 weeks, saying he was ‚Äúdying‚Äù to debate the issue in Congress and that he would ‚Äúinsist‚Äù his bill reach a vote this time. Graham‚Äôs move represented just the latest creative strategy Republicans have attempted to get around a Democratic filibuster in taking the successful anti-abortion politics of the states and making them national. But they‚Äôre doubling down this time: thanks to a new study that looks at the health outcomes of babies born at 22 weeks gestation, conservatives in Washington have zeroed in on premature babies as ‚Äúproof‚Äù that abortion after 20 weeks needs to banned. To pro-choice activists and organizations, these bans represent a constant assault not just on science ‚Äì doctors say there is no proof a fetus can feel pain at 20 weeks, and Hillary Clinton called it ‚Äúmalpractice‚Äù ‚Äì but on hard-fought gains for abortion rights. To some moms, though, the Republican onslaught is little more than cynical ignorance from male politicians refusing to confront the realities faced by pregnant women outside the Beltway. ‚ÄúPlacing abortion bans at 20 weeks seems downright cruel to me,‚Äù says 30-year-old Sarah Orsborn. ‚ÄúTwenty weeks is often the point at which ultrasound and other diagnostic measures reveal devastating news about fetal or maternal health.‚Äù A new Republican meme meets science When Roe v Wade made abortion legal in 1973, the US supreme court ruled that states couldn‚Äôt place restrictions on abortions before 28 weeks because at the time, that was widely considered the earliest a fetus could be viable outside the womb. The question of when a fetus can survive subsequently became paramount to an abortion debate that has never subsided ‚Äì so much so that some states like Ohio and Missouri have laws mandating abortion providers give ‚Äúviability tests‚Äù after 20 weeks before they go ahead with procedure. One problem: there is no such test. For Republicans, however, that was never really the point. Samuel Lee, a former lobbyist for Missouri Citizens for Life who wrote part of the Missouri bill mandating viability tests, told Mother Jones earlier this year that the 20-week cut-off was ‚Äúdesigned as an opportunity to attack [Roe]‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe 20-week gestational age was chosen to push the envelope on when the state‚Äôs interest in protecting the life of the unborn could take place,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt was chosen because it was earlier than the earliest limits of viability at the time, but not so early that the unborn child could never be viable.‚Äù When the new study on ‚Äúpreemies‚Äù surfaced in the New England Journal of Medicine last month, questioning fetal viability at 22 weeks, Republicans saw it as an opportunity to pounce on the issue ‚Äì a major part of a broader strategy to restrict abortion across the board. The research actually shows that only a small number of 22-week preemies are able to be saved, many with long-term and severe disabilities. One of the study‚Äôs authors, Dr Rosemary Higgins, of the NICHD Neonatal research Network, said many 22-week fetuses ‚Äúmay be too premature for treatment to even be effective‚Äù. ‚ÄúEven if they do survive, a lot of them have lifelong disabilities and some are profoundly disabled,‚Äù she told the Guardian. But the science is of less value to Republicans than the chance to reframe fetal viability ‚Äì even if they‚Äôre incorrect. So when the GOP was pushing their latest sweeping ban on abortion, Texas representative Diane Black, the bill‚Äôs sponsor, said: ‚ÄúKnowing that premature babies are being saved as early as 22 weeks into fetal development, there is no legitimate reason to oppose this [legislation].‚Äù ‚ÄòI truly believed I was dying‚Äô
Three years ago, Orsborn was at her 20-week ultrasound appointment when the Arkansas-based writer found out that one of her twins had spina bifida. ‚ÄúIt was my 27th birthday, and we were sitting in an ultrasound room ready to find out if our twins were boys or girls,‚Äù she said in an interview. ‚ÄúWe found out that we were having two girls, and that one of them had a serious disability.‚Äù
After Orsborn delivered her girls a month prematurely, she had what she calls her ‚Äúfinal surprise‚Äù: on the brink of being released from the hospital, Orsborn started to get short of breath. As nurses gathered around her, her breathing got worse and worse. ‚ÄúI truly believed I was dying, lying in that bed, surrounded by people bustling around to save me, with my husband watching,‚Äù she wrote after the ordeal. Orsborn had developed peripartum cardiomyopathy, a condition that caused ‚Äúcatastrophic‚Äù heart failure. She spent 24 hours on a ventilator in the ICU before waking up. Her daughter, who required surgery to close her exposed spine, spent two weeks in the neonatal ICU (NICU). ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy to see these issues as black and white if you haven‚Äôt been through them,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúK‚Äù, a 45-year-old mom from Brooklyn who wished to remain anonymous, was 41 years old when her daughter was born. K was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia and HELLP syndrome and was sent to the hospital when she was 25 weeks pregnant for bedrest. ‚ÄúIt was a day-to-day decision for the doctors about whether or not the baby needed to be born. They were weighing which of us was in more danger and making the call based on that. I almost died every single day for six weeks,‚Äù K told the Guardian. At 33 weeks, K‚Äôs health was in too much danger and she was given a C-section ‚Äì her daughter was born at 2.5lb. ‚ÄúShe was in an isolette, with tubes and wires everywhere. I was allowed to reach through a hole in the side and stroke her head,‚Äù K says. ‚ÄúI spent hours that first day singing to her, confused about what her situation was and terrified she would die.‚Äù K says she saw all sorts of preemies during her daughter‚Äôs stay in the NICU, and spoke to their mothers who were ‚Äúutterly traumatized‚Äù. Of the Republican effort to use research on premature birth and earlier viability as a cudgel to limit women‚Äôs reproductive choices, she said she was ‚Äúappalled‚Äù. ‚ÄúWomen have to be able to decide for themselves if they want to risk those things in order to deliver a baby under any circumstances,‚Äù she said. As Orsborn said: ‚ÄúThose of us who have survived the agony of a pregnancy and birth experience that didn‚Äôt go according to plan, that almost killed us and our children ‚Äì we know people need compassionate choices.‚Äù No science, no medicine, nothing but limits
Compassionate choices appear at a minimum in the House‚Äôs 20-week legislation, which contains no exceptions for women‚Äôs health or fetal abnormalities. During floor debate last month, Democrat Louise Slaughter, of New York, called the bill ‚Äúdisgustingly cruel‚Äù and Democrat Jackie Speier, of California, talked about how it felt to ‚Äúcarry around a dead fetus for two days‚Äù while waiting to obtain an abortion. And while the legislation has exceptions for rape and incest victims, women who have been sexually assaulted must get counseling ‚Äì not from an abortion provider ‚Äì within 48 hours of obtaining an abortion. (Two doctor‚Äôs visits can mean increased cost and days off from work, prohibitive mandates for many women.) Minor rape victims must report their assault to the police, and there is no exception for adult incest victims. ‚ÄúThere is no science or medicine behind 20 week bans ‚Äì just politics,‚Äù Planned Parenthood Cecile Richards said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe vast majority of abortions occur in the first trimester ‚Äì but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the only time a woman might need an abortion.‚Äù As Richards pointed out in an interview with Democracy Now, abortions after 20 weeks are extremely rare: ‚ÄúThis is usually a situation where you have a very much-wanted pregnancy go wrong and where doctors and women and their families need the best medical care possible.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T11:30:11Z,world,World news,"Greek crisis: as bailout deadline nears, is anyone in control?","Thirteen days before its access to vital bailout funds end, Greece is in a defiant mood. In the corridors of parliament this morning ‚Äì where the debt truth committee will announce its findings in the presence of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras ‚Äì almost everyone agrees: a deal to keep Athens solvent and in the eurozone has never been ‚Äúas near or as far away‚Äù. It is there, almost within reach ‚Äì and behind all the bluster a deal is certainly what Tsipras and most of his radical left Syriza party wants ‚Äì and yet one day before eurozone finance ministers gather for what may well be their most crucial meeting since the crisis erupted five years ago, it is still far from being sealed. Greeks are experts in drama, and in their modern incarnation tragedy in particular. What seems like insanity abroad ‚Äì the tactics of a suicide bomber on a grand scale ‚Äì are being brushed off here as the crescendoing of a drama now reaching its climax.
‚ÄúI would say that now the real negotiation is beginning,‚Äù Tsipras told Syriza MPs on Tuesday. The anti-austerity government is drawing a line in the sand not because it believes it has nothing to lose but, say insiders, because it believes it has everything to gain. On Wednesday morning, the tone is conciliatory ‚Äì with the minister in charge of revenues, Dimitris Mardas, saying Greece will do its best to meet its debt obligations, starting with the ‚Ç¨1.6bn (¬£1.1bn) it owes at the end of the month to the IMF (a far cry from what Tsipras had insinuated on Tuesday). But later in the afternoon, it could well turn ugly again. Brinkmanship has no rules. It‚Äôs very hot in Athens . Out on the streets people walk around semi-dazed and in slow motion ‚Äì partly to conserve their energy in this, the summer‚Äôs first mini heatwave. The government‚Äôs negotiating tactics are playing well: thousands will descend on squares around the country in a display of support tonight. Those who gather in Syntagma Square, outside the Greek parliament, at 7.30pm will do so under the banner ‚ÄúWe take negotiations in our hands ‚Äì we demolish austerity‚Äù. And those who gather, a little later at 8pm, will do so under the slogan ‚ÄúWe are staying in Europe‚Äù. Both will take place against a backdrop of fears that Grexit could come by Graccident ‚Äì an act in the drama that no one has foreseen. Is anyone in control? No one, not even the protagonists, really know.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-17T10:17:42Z,world,World news,Indonesia accuses Australia of bribing people smugglers,"Indonesia and Australia are embroiled in a diplomatic row over allegations that people smugglers were bribed at sea by Australian officials to turn their boats around. In a dramatic few days of revelations, the Indonesians have put on display tens of thousands of US dollars that it alleges Australia paid to smugglers in May and paraded a smuggler captain who detailed how Australian spies bribed him at sea to turn back.
Australia‚Äôs foreign minister, Julie Bishop, rejected the accusations on Monday by suggesting that Indonesia was to blame for failing to secure its borders in the first place. Indonesian police then released photos of what they say is US$31,000 (¬£19,600) that they accuse Australian authorities of using to persuade smugglers to turn around a boat carrying 65 migrants. A police interview was conducted on Wednesday in front of media with Yohanis Humiang, the boat‚Äôs captain. Humiang said an Australian navy warship and an Australian customs ship intercepted his boat, the Andika, on 19 May, according to excerpts from the interview published in the Sydney Morning Herald.
Humiang was quoted as saying that an Australian official called ‚ÄúAgus‚Äù paid him and five other crew members thousands of dollars not to continue their voyage, which he said was to New Zealand, after he pleaded that he was trying to earn a living. If his claims are proven, experts believe Australia will have broken international, Indonesian and Australian law. Gen Endang Sunjaya, police chief of Nusa Tenggara Timur province in Indonesia, told reporters on Wednesday that the man who paid the smugglers was a plainclothes Australian spy.
The boat was was escorted to Greenhill Island in the Northern Territory, the smuggler said, and the asylum seekers were photographed. The crew and the asylum seekers then spent a night on the customs ship. They were given two wooden boats, with some fuel and a GPS, and told to head back, he said. One boat ran out of fuel and the second crashed into a reef before those on board were rescued near Rote Island by Indonesian authorities at the end of May, police and the smuggler said on Wednesday. The Australian government has invoked its ‚Äúon-water matters‚Äù secrecy rule to defend its failure to comprehensively answer the claims. Pressed in parliament to respond to the allegations, the Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, on Wednesday accused the opposition Labor party of asking ‚Äútawdry‚Äù questions. ‚ÄúNot only is what this government has done legal, it is moral; it is absolutely moral, because the most moral thing to do is to stop the boats and save lives,‚Äù he said. The reports have renewed tensions between Australia and Indonesia. Australia‚Äôs ambassador, Paul Grigson, returned to his post in Jakarta only last week, five weeks after being pulled out in protest over the execution of two Australians who were among eight convicted drug smugglers. Abbott said last Wednesday that executions of the two citizens would not permanently damage relations with Indonesia. Indonesia‚Äôs foreign ministry has launched an investigation into the allegations of using cash to turn around smugglers. ‚Äú[IF] it turns out to be true, it would be a new low for the way the government of Australia handles the situation on irregular migration,‚Äù Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman, Armanatha Nasir, said. Vedi Hadiz, professor of Asian Societies and Politics at Murdoch University in Australia, said that following public outrage from Australia at the execution of its citizens in Indonesia, Jakarta has used reports of Canberra collaborating with people smugglers to hit back. ‚ÄúIndonesia is genuinely annoyed that its own national sovereignty is being breached by people smugglers who are financed by Australian tax money,‚Äù he told the Guardian on Wednesday. ‚Äú[But] it is an opportunity for the Indonesians to say: ‚ÄòLook, it is the Australians who are turning back boats, are putting people in detention centres and are actually paying criminals. Which one of us is actually the transgressor of international norms?‚Äù he said. Abbott has neither confirmed nor denied the allegation. He has said he was ‚Äúconfident that at all times Australian agencies have acted within the law‚Äù.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs really only one thing to say here, and that is that we‚Äôve stopped the boats. That‚Äôs good for Australia, it‚Äôs good for Indonesia and it‚Äôs particularly good for all those who want to see a better world,‚Äù he told reporters in Canberra on Sunday. These comments further enraged Jakarta, Hadiz said, in so far as Abbott was ‚Äúbasically ignoring Indonesian concerns about state funding criminal activity within their waters‚Äù. Elaine Pearson, Australia director at Human Rights Watch, told the Guardian that the allegations show ‚Äúan utter disregard for Australia‚Äôs obligations under international law‚Äù. ‚ÄúAlthough we do not have the facts about what exactly transpired at sea, cash payments to boat crews could facilitate people-smuggling, which would violate Indonesian, Australia and international law,‚Äù she said in an emailed statement. ‚ÄúIn the past, the Australian prime minister has talked about taking sugar off the table for people smugglers, but if such payments were made, the government is pouring more sugar on the table for people smugglers by creating cash incentives for people to come to Australian waters.‚Äù Mark Getchell, the International Organisation for Migration‚Äôs chief of mission in Indonesia, told the Guardian that Australia‚Äôs Operation Sovereign Borders, which aims to stop maritime arrivals of asylum seekers by enforcing a policy of zero-tolerance, has had some success. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt really seen boats leaving since December 2014 because word has gotten around that they are being turned back.‚Äù he said on Wednesday. He said the IOM has noticed that very few boats are now leaving Indonesia. He said human smuggling boats are stopped by Australian authorities, given life jackets, fuel and food and told to return to Indonesia. Under Operation Sovereign Borders, asylum seekers who try to enter Australia are turned back or moved to detention centres offshore across the Pacific and are told that they will never be resettled in Australia. Getchell said he had not heard of other smugglers being paid to return and that if the allegations are proven correct, it would be an ‚Äúisolated incident‚Äù. ‚ÄúThis is a rare instance of people smugglers testing the waters again,‚Äù he said on the telephone from Jakarta. The asylum seekers on board were mostly from Sri Lanka, but also Bangladesh and one from Burma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T08:21:56Z,world,World news,Europe has much to learn from the Battle of Waterloo,"As Thursday‚Äôs 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo approached, an old pal of impeccably leftwing views gave me a copy of Andrew Roberts‚Äôs new biography of Napol√©on. In doing so he apologised because Roberts, though a talented and successful historian, is also a boisterous cheerleader for rightwing causes. ‚ÄúBut he writes well.‚Äù And so he does. Mark Mazower‚Äôs Guardian review is one on many lauding Napol√©on the Great. But Roberts is a Tory of Napoleonic physique who can comfortably embrace great man theory. What still puzzles me is why lefties like my pal (does he remember giving me another Bonaparte biography 20 years ago?) still nurture an approving soft spot for Boney? The superficial affirmative answer is obvious. Emerging from obscurity in Corsica, the young general swept all before him, overthrew ancient and despotic regimes, put a reactionary Catholic church in its place, liberated the oppressed and imposed a modern legal code on vast swathes of Europe, albeit at the point of a sword. His legacy lives on in the lives, as well as the imaginations, of men and women (though his civil codes did not treat the latter well). The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall are marking the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo by visiting one of its key sites on Wednesday. Charles and Camilla, alongside Belgium‚Äôs Princess Astrid, will tour Hougoumont Farm, a complex of buildings that played a crucial role in Wellington and the allies‚Äô victory over Napol√©on. It was this Bonaparte to whom Beethoven dedicated his Third Symphony. But, as everyone knows, the composer also got it right when he later withdrew the dedication after the first consul of France made himself emperor (‚Äúso he is no more than a common mortal‚Ä¶‚Äù a tyrant in the making). And so it proved. You can variously apportion blame for 25 years of warfare following the French revolution of 1789, but 5 million Europeans died ‚Äì here‚Äôs one summary of the butcher‚Äôs bill ‚Äì including at least a million Frenchmen. France‚Äôs demographic profile has never recovered: twice the size of Britain, but roughly the same population today, as had never been the case before 1800. Bonaparte‚Äôs genius for war and, increasingly, his addiction to it as his central strategy was a major contributory factor. As we constantly see in our own times, knowing when to stop is a vital component of military, political and commercial affairs. Oliver Cromwell, the only republican military dictator this country has experienced, is also admired on the left (I admire him myself), but was a more reluctant ruler, one with a good handbrake, both at home and abroad. Voters can often keep autocrats in check as Turkey‚Äôs President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan has just been reminded. Tyrants can only discipline themselves.
At this point the contrast with Napol√©on‚Äôs nemesis on the pastures south of Brussels on 18 June 1815 is instructive. The Duke of Wellington was an Anglo-Irish Tory, colourful enough as a character (his robust selection of quotes in the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations stand the test of time very well), a consistently successful commander, but lacking Bonaparte‚Äôs multi-faceted brilliance. I like to regard his victory in what was their first direct encounter as the triumph of character over genius. Napol√©on dismissed Wellington as ‚Äúa bad general‚Äù. Wellington did not reciprocate the error and, besides, he had Bl√ºcher‚Äôs Prussians closing in. But Wellington was also a politician, not such a successful one. As prime minister (our only general to occupy No 10) during turbulent times from 1828 to 1830, he carried Catholic emancipation, an important modernisation (he fought a duel over it), but resisted urgent parliamentary reform, what became the Great Reform Act of 1832. Yet, as Bertrand Russell once wrote ‚Äì to illustrate progress in human affairs ‚Äìthe greatest soldier of his day did not lift an unconstitutional finger against it when the popular will finally prevailed. So Wellington had a handbrake, as Napol√©on did not. The emperor‚Äôs reckless return from exile on Elba ‚Äì the Hundred Days‚Äô campaign that ended at Waterloo ‚Äì gave final proof. It cost France lives and hard-won territory since 1792 (peace negotiators at the congress of Vienna had been quite generous up to then). It also condemned much of Europe to decades of paranoid political reaction. Before the onset of the reformist 1830s, even in relatively liberal Britain the Manchester massacre at Peterloo (1819) followed Waterloo (and led to the founding of the Guardian). But if the left sometimes indulges Napol√©on the warlord, the Euro-phobe right is making a complete shambles of the meaning of Waterloo two centuries on. Just as the jingoists annually turn the evacuation at Dunkirk in 1940 into a sentimental mish-mash (‚Äúwars are not won by evacuations,‚Äù Churchill dryly observed at the time) so it currently presents Waterloo as a purely British victory, copyright Daily Mail. It duly hopes that David Cameron‚Äôs ill-judged ‚Äúrenegotiations‚Äù will deliver another Waterloo to the EU tyranny located 10 kilometres up the Waterloo road at its Brussels HQ . But such talk is not the lesson of Waterloo, far from it. The flight from Elba had galvanised the stalled Vienna conference (‚Äúwhat we need is Bonaparte to escape‚Äù someone joked until he did) where the great powers each agreed to commit large armies to his defeat. Napol√©on planned to divide and defeat them one by one, starting with the British and Prussians in what is now Belgium. Having pushed back both armies in prior skirmishes he attacked Wellington on 18 June. There are thousands of accounts of the most famous and decisive battle of the 19th century ‚Äì including those by Victor Hugo and Thackeray. Here‚Äôs Wiki‚Äôs basic summary. By the end of the century, when Bismarck‚Äôs Prussia was shaping up for its own bid for domination of the continent, it became fashionable in Germany to call Waterloo a ‚ÄúGerman victory‚Äù. Wellington had later been ungenerous to the late afternoon intervention by the Prussians in his own day. And, of course, as every Frenchman still believes deep down, Napol√©on really won. The battleground souvenir shop reflected that view the last time I was there. We could argue for ever about such things. Wellington was the allied commander who chose to offer battle on terrain of his own choosing at Waterloo and won, though it was touch and go. Only when the French imperial guard‚Äôs attack finally faltered, then retreated before a British general advance, came the rightly famous moment that marked the end of the first empire and the revolutionary era. Not only was Bl√ºcher‚Äôs Prussian intervention on Wellington‚Äôs left pretty important, but the French advance was stopped in the centre of the battleground for most of the day at the farmhouse and orchard known as La Haye Sainte by other Germans. Cambridge historian Prof Brendan Simms has just issued a short account, The Longest Afternoon, arguing that the 400 men who held the farm ‚Äúdecided the battle of Waterloo‚Äù. They were mostly Germans, members of King George III‚Äôs Hanover-based King‚Äôs German Legion (KGL). Their role was acknowledged at the time, though later succumbed to Anglo-German rivalry. In fact, if we set aside the 50,000 Prussians, Wellington‚Äôs army was only 36% British ‚Äì including lots of Irish ‚Äì with 13% Dutch and almost half Germans of one kind or another, including 6,000 men (10%) of the KGL. No wonder former defence chief Lord Bramall called Waterloo ‚Äúthe first Nato operation‚Äù. Even more remarkable is the fact that Byron refers to the ‚Äúunited nations‚Äù in the Waterloo passage of Childe Harold‚Äôs Pilgrimage, a point picked up by well-read Winston Churchill when discussing the allied war aims after Pearl Harbor. They became the Declaration of the United Nations of January 1 1942, forerunner of the UN. That‚Äôs the real lesson of Waterloo. Not national chauvinism, however tempting, but international cooperation to keep the peace. Far from being the Napoleonic tyrant of Fleet St oligarch imaginings, the EU is rather fragile. It doesn‚Äôt have an army, has a struggling currency and hesitates to knock the skin off a Greek rice pudding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T08:13:47Z,world,World news,UK starts planning for 'serious economic risks' of Greek exit from euro,"The British government is stepping up contingency planning to prepare for the ‚Äúserious economic risks‚Äù posed by a Greek default and a possible exit from the euro, Downing Street has confirmed. As David Cameron prepares to discuss the Greek crisis with the prime ministers of Italy and Luxembourg on Wednesday, No 10 confirmed the government was planning for the impact on businesses, banks, the financial sector and tourism. The chancellor said on Tuesday the UK government was taking ‚Äúall steps‚Äù to protect Britain. Whitehall officials, who held contingency planning meetings on the implications of a possible Greek exit from the euro in February, have stepped up their preparations in recent weeks amid fears that Greece could be on the verge of a debt default. Eurozone finance ministers are due to discuss the crisis on Thursday, but there is little sign of a breakthrough after the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, denounced its creditors‚Äô demands on Tuesday. He accused the International Monetary Fund of having ‚Äúcriminal responsibility‚Äù for the damage caused to Greece, and insisted the country needed debt relief to help it recover. Greece has just a few days to reach an agreement before its current bailout expires on 30 June. Without a deal, Athens cannot access about ‚Ç¨7.2bn of loans, which have been frozen while negotiations over pension reforms and tax rates have ground on. Later on Wednesday, the European Central Bank must decide whether to keep providing the emergency liquidity that allows Greek banks to keep operating. The ECB has already pumped about ‚Ç¨82bn into the system. Worried savers have been withdrawing hundreds of millions of euros each week, sending deposits levels down to their lowest level in over a decade. Austria‚Äôs chancellor, Werner Faymann, expressed support for the Greek people on Wednesday morning before travelling to Athens to meet Tsipras. He criticised some of the measure demanded by Greece‚Äôs lenders, declaring: ‚ÄúI stand on the side of the Greek people, who in this difficult position are being proposed more things detrimental to society.‚Äù The prime minister‚Äôs official spokesman said on Wednesday: ‚ÄúThe chancellor was talking in the house [of Commons] yesterday about the potential exit of Greece and how that presents serious economic risks and of course as part of that we take all steps to protect ourselves from such eventualities ... You will expect we are continuing to make sure we have the right plans in place and stepping up operations given where discussions have got to. We don‚Äôt go into the specifics of these plans but of course they will be looking at how do we make sure we have looked at the impacts on business, the banks and the financial sector and tourists .... ‚ÄúThis is about making sure we are as prepared as we can be. Of course, the potential default does present some serious economic risks, so alongside contingency plans it is about making sure we have an economy that is growing and that our public finances are in good order.‚Äù Asked whether the contingency plans covered just British exposure to Greece or the risk of wider contagion, she said: ‚ÄúYou would expect us to have plans in place that look at a range of potential consequences.‚Äù She said she was not aware of any change in the Foreign Office advice for people travelling to or living in Greece. The Whitehall contingency planning meetings have focused on the immediate impact of capital controls in Greece ‚Äì limits on bank withdrawals ‚Äì that could be introduced to avoid a bank run if Greece appears to be moving towards a default on its debts. There is a particular focus on the tens of thousands of British holidaymakers who travel to Greece during the summer. The Whitehall officials, from the Treasury, the Foreign Office and other government departments, have also examined the longer-term impact on the British financial system on the instability that would be triggered across the eurozone by a Greek default. This could be followed by a Greek exit from the euro, which would plunge the single currency into its greatest crisis, threatening a financial crisis in Britain‚Äôs main trading partner. A Greek exit from the euro would have an immediate impact on companies and banks owed money in Greece. A convulsion in the eurozone - the UK‚Äôs largest trading partner - would have a detrimental impact on the UK economy. Exporters fear the shock would spread way beyond Greece at a delicate time for the world economy, leaving them struggling to find new markets to sell their goods. Osborne told MPs: ‚ÄúOut in the real world there are some serious economic risks, not least the risk that we see growing in Greece of a potential default and exit from the euro. People should not underestimate the damage that that would do to financial confidence. ‚ÄúOf course, in the UK we take all steps to prepare for and protect ourselves from such eventualities, but the best thing that a government can do is to ensure that it is living within its means, that it has a productive economy and that its public finances are in good order. That is what we are going to deliver in this parliament.‚Äù Cameron will discuss the Greek crisis when he meets his counterparts from Italy and Luxembourg, founding members of the euro, in separate meetings. The prime minister will meet Matteo Renzi in Milan before flying to Luxembourg for dinner with Xavier Bettel, who takes over the EU‚Äôs rotating presidency on 1 July. The meetings are the latest phase of the UK prime minister‚Äôs talks with fellow EU leaders on his desire to restructure the union before a European summit on Thursday and Friday next week. But the talks risk being overshadowed by the looming Greek crisis. Downing Street confirmed that the Greek crisis would be discussed. ‚ÄúIt will be an opportunity to hear from Renzi about how he views the Greek situation and the prospects for resolving that before the end of June deadline,‚Äù Cameron‚Äôs spokeswoman said. European leaders are making plans for an emergency summit on Sunday if eurozone finance ministers fail to reach a deal at a meeting in Luxembourg on Thursday over a ‚Ç¨1.6bn (¬£1.15bn) debt repayment Greece is due to make to the IMF by the end of June. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, reflected the anger in Brussels at the way Tsipras has been approaching the deadlocked negotiations by saying he had ‚Äúsympathy for the Greek people but not the Greek government‚Äù. Juncker was until recently rated as one of Tsipras‚Äôs only allies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T07:00:01Z,world,World news,What we talk about when we talk about Iran,"It is hard to do justice to Iran. So much is left unsaid amid arcane disputes about the number of centrifuges spinning in a fortified bunker, or an assumed threat that may or may not one day endanger others. It is a country too often misunderstood and taken out of context. Yet, digging deeper into its intriguing realities never disappoints. This week, Tehran was the scene of a familiar funeral procession held for the victims of the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. Whenever newly unearthed bodies are returned it brings back excruciating memories from some three decades ago. Such events are always close to the heart of those families who have lost their loved ones in that futile, eight-year war. It is not so much for the general public, or the younger generation at least, who are wary of the state‚Äôs usual hijacking of these funerals for its own propagandistic purposes. But something about this occasion was different: among the bodies paraded were those belonging to 175 Iranian divers who were captured by Saddam Hussein‚Äôs forces nearly 30 years ago and buried alive while handcuffed, according to Iranian officials. The divers are believed to have been captured in 1986, after the failure of Iran‚Äôs secret offensive Karbala-4 ‚Äì helped by US intelligence provided to the Iraqis. During the war, the US extended vital support to Saddam and later turned a blind eye to the Iraqi leader‚Äôs use of chemical weapons. Huge numbers of people in Iran, youth included, reacted with outrage in the past month to the 175 divers‚Äô death and wrote extensively in their honour online. It is easy to forget that the people who were in charge in Iran during the Iran-Iraq war are still at the helm. The current president, Hassan Rouhani, once served as the deputy military commander, even being involved in the secret Iran-Contra affair that created a huge scandal for the Reagan administration (when it emerged that the US was covertly shipping arms to Tehran to secure the release of hostages). Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, was then the country‚Äôs president. Mir Hossein Mousavi, now an opposition leader under house arrest, was the prime minister. But those involved in the US in the 1980s are now part of history. Reagan is dead and Robert McFarlane, his national security adviser, has dropped out of the spotlight, while many of today‚Äôs big names in the US were barely known at the time of the war. It is no surprise why a tragedy that took place three decades ago still fuels mistrust between Iran and the US. (Americans may be quick to cite the infamous hostage crisis in return.) That was about this week, but around this time of the year six years ago, something totally different happened. In June 2009, as the results of what was widely believed to have been a stolen election were announced on TV, Mousavi, a dark horse presidential candidate, said: ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt yield to this dangerous foul scenario.‚Äù And he didn‚Äôt. Today, unrepentant as ever, Mousavi, his wife, Zahra Rahnavard and another opposition leader, Mehdi Karroubi, remain under house arrest in Tehran without being put on trial. Their supporters, many of whom are among those who expressed sympathy for the 175 divers this week and others who rallied behind Rouhani in 2013 elections, are still yearning for change. Mousavi and Karroubi have proved to be worthy opposition leaders, even though Rouhani, who was elected on promises of ending their house arrest, has not achieved much on the home front despite his achievements in the foreign domain. Reform, not revolt, is what many believe is the answer. If a free election is held in Iran tomorrow, my bet would be on the likes of Mousavi or the former president Mohammad Khatami, who is facing immense restrictions and ban on using his name and picture in the local media. So much has changed since those bloody days in 2009. A new president has put an end to the acrimonious years under Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Meanwhile, the former president‚Äôs close allies are being arrested and put on trial almost one by one. Ahmadineajd has become sidelined, though there are suggestions he is eyeing a comeback for next year‚Äôs parliamentary elections. Good things have happened in between, bad things too. Despite improvements made by Rouhani, the country‚Äôs hardline judiciary has been deaf to the message Iranians sent by voting for a president who promised to open up the country and improve relations with the west. The country‚Äôs intelligence apparatus is carrying out a campaign of harassing and jailing anyone who dares to differ in public. We are so overwhelmed that we are failing to keep up with violations in Iran. News of new activists receiving hefty jail sentence (read 8, 12 or 14 years) has become so normal that it barely registers as a news story. As if domestic pressure was not enough, Iranians are constantly bombarded from abroad. Blanket sanctions imposed by the US and its European allies continue to disrupt life for ordinary people in Iran, from anything such as access to high-quality medicine to the ever-increasing prices of staple foods. Thanks to sanctions, the young, aspirational people of Iran ‚Äì the most pro-western nation in the Middle East ‚Äì are isolated from the outside world. In the latest showdown over sanctions, the US is threatening to confiscate nine used but newly bought passenger planes Iran obtained after bypassing the punitive international measures to renew its old air fleet. So many innocent Iranians have died in recent years because of that ageing fleet, yet the US is trying to stop the new handful of planes. How disgraceful. As Laura Secor once delicately put it in a New Yorker article in 2012: ‚ÄúOur options are bad, our objectives are ambiguous, and the Iranian people stand as hostages between their government and ours.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T07:00:01Z,world,World news,Tim Hunt's findings in lab disproved as stress expert says men cry more at work,"He was cited by Boris Johnson as the world‚Äôs leading expert on crying, whose evidence supports the claim that female scientists were more likely to weep at work than their male colleagues. But Prof Ad Vingerhoets has told the Guardian that his only comprehensive and completed study of crying in a work environment showed that men were more likely to break down. His words appear to puncture the claims of the mayor of London, who had written in the Daily Telegraph that Vingerhoets‚Äôs research proved that it was ‚Äúa scientific fact‚Äù that women cry more readily than men. Johnson was defending comments made by Prof Tim Hunt, a Nobel laureate and senior scientific adviser who was forced to stand down last week after claiming that female colleagues cry when criticised.
Vingerhoets, speaking from his office in Tilburg University, said it was true that much of his work had shown that in general women were more likely to cry than men. But he added that he had only completed one analysis of crying within the workplace, which surprisingly had found the complete opposite. ‚ÄúThree years ago we completed a survey about crying among psychotherapists. In that study, we found that male therapists seem to cry more often than their female counterparts,‚Äù he said. His study found that as many as 87.4% of the therapists questioned admitted that they had cried at least once during a therapy session. Contrary to expectations, this concerned more male than female therapists, he said. ‚ÄúThat was our last and only completed work examining men and women in the workplace,‚Äù he added. Hunt resigned from the Royal Society and University College London after his remarks sparked a backlash online. The renowned scientist reportedly described himself as a ‚Äúchauvinist pig‚Äù at the World Conference of Science Journalists in Seoul and argued in favour of single-sex laboratories. He said: ‚ÄúLet me tell you about my trouble with girls. Three things happen when they are in the lab: you fall in love with them, they fall in love with you, and when you criticise them they cry.‚Äù Hours later, he attempted to justify his words in comments to Radio 4‚Äôs Today Programme. The scientist told the Observer that he had been hung out to dry over the comments, prompting a campaign for his reinstatement. In his column for the Daily Telegraph on Monday, Johnson claimed that it was a scientific fact that women cried more readily than men. ‚ÄúThe world‚Äôs leading expert on crying, Professor Ad Vingerhoets of Tilburg University, has shown that women on average cry 30-64 times a year, while men cry only between six and 17 times a year; and the Dutchman also claims that women cry for an average of six minutes, while men cry for only two to three minutes,‚Äù he said. Vingerhoets, who has been studying weeping for 25 years, added that he was currently working on more research that may help to bolster Hunt‚Äôs claims. He has examined whether doctors and nurses cry in the workplace and is likely to conclude that females in medicine are more likely to cry than men, he said. In general, Vingerhoets said that his work had found that women did find it easier to cry than men. He claims that this was because many women were exposed to art and literature that was meant to move them and they could be affected by hormonal changes. Social expectation was also a major factor, he said. ‚ÄúOverall, men and women cry over the same major things, like the death of a loved one, romantic break-ups and homesickness. Remarkably, men cry relatively more often in reaction to positive events,‚Äù he said. Chi Onwurah, a Labour MP who worked for 20 years in a male-dominated sector as a chartered electrical engineer, said the mayor of London‚Äôs intervention was unhelpful. ‚ÄúOnce again, Mr Johnson has made it abundantly clear he is not a scientist as he uses research to mislead rather than enlighten,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI would argue strongly that both male and female employees benefit from honest, constructive criticism without reference to lachrymose stereotyping,‚Äù she said. A spokesman for Johnson did not reply to requests for a comment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T06:19:38Z,world,World news,Did Australia pay people-smugglers to turn back asylum seekers?,"Has Australia paid people smugglers to return asylum seekers? Explosive claims have been lobbed in the last week that the Australian government has taken a further step in its ‚Äústop the boats‚Äù policy and begun paying people smugglers to turn those boats around. A boat ferrying around 65 asylum seekers from Indonesia, aiming for New Zealand, was reportedly intercepted by Australian authorities in May and forced to turn back. Nazmul Hassan from Bangladesh ‚Äì who said he was on board the boat ‚Äì told Radio New Zealand that officials made payments to the captain and crew to take the passengers back to Indonesia. Now Indonesian police authorities have backed the allegations, showing off money seized from people smugglers that they say was paid by Australian officials.
General Endang Sunjaya, police chief of Nusa Tenggara Timur province, said the cash ‚Äì $31,000 in US dollars ‚Äì was given to six crew members by an Australian official, who, he told reporters, was reportedly a spy, in civilian clothing, aboard a customs vessel. Australian sailors then transferred the 65 asylum seekers ‚Äì who had come originally from Bangladesh, Burma and Sri Lanka ‚Äì to two smaller boats and sent them back to Indonesia, said Endang: ‚ÄúWe have given you the evidence. It‚Äôs now up to you and other organisations to demand an answer from the Australian government.‚Äù In an interview conducted in front of international media in Indonesia on Wednesday, Endang quizzed the purported captain of the boat, Yohanis Humiang, who said the two wooden boats were unseaworthy, unsanitary and short on fuel. Yohanis said the crew members were interrogated by an Australian official he called Agus: Agus then came from the navy ship and told us, to our surprise, that we have to go back by boat to Indonesia. We were very scared, some of the crew said they can‚Äôt do it, and I said I can‚Äôt work alone, I can‚Äôt do it, we can‚Äôt do it. But he said there‚Äôs no other option, you have to go back. Mentally we were so helpless, we can‚Äôt do anything else. On the return trip, he said, one of the boats ran out of fuel and the 65 asylum seekers and six crew were forced to continue their journey on one small boat. They were rescued off Rote island, Indonesia, at the end of May.
What does the Australian government say? Officially: not much. The Australian immigration minister Peter Dutton initially denied the payment claims ‚Äì as did foreign minister Julie Bishop ‚Äì before defaulting to what has since been the stock government line: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a longstanding policy of the government not to comment on on-water matters.‚Äù Australian prime minister Tony Abbott has refused to rule out the tactic, saying his government would do ‚Äúwhatever we need to do‚Äù and was determined to ‚Äústop the boats, by hook or by crook‚Äù: I am proud of the work that our border protection agencies have done. I really am proud of the work that they‚Äôve done and they‚Äôve been incredibly creative in coming up with a whole range of strategies to break this evil trade ‚Ä¶ There are all sorts of things that our security agencies do that they need to do to protect our country and many of those things just should never be discussed in public. Operational matters, when it comes to national security, are never discussed in public and that‚Äôs the way it should be.
Is it legal to pay people smugglers? Abbott said he was ‚Äúconfident that at all times Australian agencies have acted within the law‚Äù. He said government actions were not only legal, but ‚Äúabsolutely moral‚Äù. But others have pointed out that payments to people smugglers ‚Äì if this has taken place ‚Äì could have contravened Australian and international law. Madeline Gleeson, of the Kaldor Centre for Refugee Law, told Guardian Australia: If a state were to give money to smugglers and instruct them where to take people, it is possible that the state itself could be engaged in, or an accomplice to, a people smuggling operation. Whether or not such a payment would amount to a criminal offence would depend on the particular facts of the case. At the very least, though, it would be inconsistent with the general duty to prevent and combat people smuggling, which Australia has committed itself to as a state party to the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air. A complaint under the protocol would need to be lodged by Indonesia. Any investigation into a possible breach of Australia‚Äôs Criminal Code outlawing people smuggling would have to be given the green light by the attorney general, George Brandis, who has already said that the government ‚Äúhas at all times complied with the law‚Äù. Australian Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said the government needed to be open about whether payments were made: Payments to individuals to turn a boat around and take asylum seekers to Indonesia may be highly illegal. The trafficking of people against their will is a serious crime. The Australian government must give a full and accurate account of what has occurred. And Labor‚Äôs immigration spokesman, Richard Marles, said such payments could create a ‚Äúpull factor‚Äù for people traffickers. Where are the asylum seekers coming from? The boats come mainly from Indonesia, which serves as a transit country from where migrants from various countries attempt to leave for Australia or New Zealand. Many ‚Äì as in the case reportedly involving payment ‚Äì come from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Burma. The latter, in particular, has witnessed an exodus of Muslim Rohingya people ‚Äì not recognised as citizens in Burma ‚Äì and it is estimated that as many as one in 10 of the 1.1million Rohingya has fled by boat (though not all will head to Australian waters). Others come from conflict-riven countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria.
And where do they go? The Australian government says its ‚Äústop the boats‚Äù policy has worked and boatloads of asylum seekers are no longer making it to the country‚Äôs shores. Some of those intercepted are sent to detention centres on Manus Island and Nauru, which have been beset by allegations of sexual assault and other abuses against detainees. An agreement with Phnon Penh established a scheme to resettle some asylum seekers in Cambodia, but so far just four people have been moved there, at a cost of around $A40m. The occupants of the boat reportedly turned back in May are now in a detention centre in Kupang, Indonesia. So, has ‚Äòturn back the boats‚Äô been a success? The current Australian government says 1,200 people died attempting to cross the ocean under the previous Labor administration and claims it has put a stop to those deaths with its ‚Äúwhatever it takes‚Äù policy. Abbott has said the rest of the world ‚Äì particularly Europe, which is facing its own migrant crisis ‚Äì could learn from Australia‚Äôs hardline policies: boats of asylum seekers at sea will be turned away; they will be forced to live in detention centres offshore across the Pacific; and they are told that they will never be resettled in Australia.
If the measure of success is the number of asylum seekers making it to Australian shores, Abbott is probably right. But critics point to the ongoing crisis in south-east Asia ‚Äì including desperate asylum seekers left adrift at sea, refused safe haven by any country; and the grim discovery of dozens of gravesites in Malaysia in people-smuggling camps ‚Äì to argue that a more holistic solution needs to be found.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T06:00:01Z,world,World news,Ramadan: a guide to the Islamic holy month,"Muslims around the world are preparing for the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. From waking up in the early hours for a quick bite and sip of water, to the waiting ‚Äì date in hand ‚Äì for the seconds to tick by until the call to prayer at sunset, why do Muslims fast and what is Ramadan? What is Ramadan? Muslims ‚Äì there are 1.6 billion in the world ‚Äì believe Ramadan is the holiest month in the year , when the Qur‚Äôan, the holy book of Islam, was revealed to the prophet Muhammad. Ramadan is the ninth month in the Islamic calendar, or the Hijri calendar based on the lunar cycle, which began in AD622 when Muhammad migrated from Mecca to Medina. When is Ramadan? Depending on the sighting of the crescent moon, or hilal, the month begins this year on the evening of the Wednesday 17 June, which means Muslims will begin their first day of fasting at dawn on Thursday 18 June. The month of fasting will end on either Friday 17 July or Saturday 18 July, as there are either 29 or 30 days in a lunar month. As Ramadan begins about 11 days earlier each year, it sometimes falls in winter months when the fasts are short, and in summer months when the fasts are long. Why do Muslims fast? During this month, observant Muslims do not eat or drink during daylight hours. This is because fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam. The other acts of worship are the shahadah, which is the declaration of faith; salat, the five daily prayers; zakat, or almsgiving; and the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca. Fasting in Ramadan is obligatory for Muslims, and in the Qur‚Äôan it states: O you who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may attain Taqwa [God-consciousness]. ‚Äì The Qur‚Äôan, Al-Baqarah:183 You can hear the recitation of this verse in Arabic:
Fasting, or sawm in Arabic, literally means ‚Äúto refrain‚Äù ‚Äì and not only is it abstaining from food, drink and sex, but also actions such as smoking cigarettes, talking about others behind their backs, or using foul language. Fasting does not mean Muslims retreat from their daily routine, rather they are encouraged to continue as normal in their work and usual activities. In fact, this is where the challenge of patience and endurance comes in. Muslims believe fasting is not merely a physical ritual, but is primarily a time for reflection and spiritual recharging. During the fast, Muslims believe that their desires are curbed and that they can gain understanding of how those who are less privileged than them feel. It is considered to increase one‚Äôs patience, closeness to God and generosity towards others. The month is also a time of community; it is the custom for Muslims to invite their neighbours and friends to share their evening meal ‚Äì iftar ‚Äì and recite special Tarawih prayers in congregation. It is also a time when Muslims try to reconnect with the Qur‚Äôan, which they believe is the word of God.
Who fasts? Healthy Muslim men and women are required to fast during the month according to Islamic teachings. Who is exempt from fasting? Children, people who are sick or who have mental illness, elderly people, travellers and women who are menstruating , postnatal , pregnant or breast-feeding do not have to fast. People exempt from fasting during Ramadan can make up the missed fasts later. But if a person is not able to fast at all ‚Äì particularly if that is for health reasons ‚Äì can compensate by feeding a needy person for each day they do not fast.
Is it healthy? Muslims do not fast continuously throughout the month: they eat before dawn and break their fast at sunset each day. Scientists have found that short periods of fasting ‚Äì if properly controlled ‚Äì can have a number of health benefits, as well as potentially helping overweight people. Health advice from the NHS includes keeping hydrated and having the right proportion of carbohydrates, fat and protein in between fasts, and not bingeing on oily feasts ‚Äì however tempting. This may, in fact, lead to gaining weight. During fasting, the body uses up glucose and then starts to burn fat, which can lead to weight loss. So with prolonged fasting of many days or weeks, the body starts using protein for energy. After a few days of the fast, higher levels of endorphins ‚Äì hormones related to mood ‚Äì appear in the blood and can make a person more alert and give an overall feeling of general mental wellbeing, according to the NHS website. Dr Razeen Mahroof, an anaesthetist from Oxford, said in a statement about fasting to the NHS: ‚ÄúA detoxification process also occurs, because any toxins stored in the body‚Äôs fat are dissolved and removed from the body.‚Äù
Some traditions Muslims have varying Ramadan customs across the world, depending on their culture. Islamic traditions include: Eating and drinking at sahoor, the pre-fast meal, just before dawn Not delaying breaking the fast at sunset, which is iftar time Breaking the fast with an odd number of fresh dates, or dried dates if none are available, or a few sips of water Searching for the ‚ÄúNight of Power‚Äù or Laylat al-Qadr. According to Islamic tradition, this is when the first verses of the Qur‚Äôan were revealed to the prophet Muhammad by God. This falls within the last 10 nights of Ramadan.
Why do Muslims start Ramadan on different days? Muslims often joke that they start fasting on different days. The most likely reason for differences over the start and end dates of Ramadan, from one country to another, is variations in the sighting of the moon. In places where it is not possible to see the crescent moon, Muslims may begin fasting according to the closest place where the moon has been sighted, while other scholars rely on the calculations of astronomers. However, some Islamic scholars have called for Muslims to be united in fasting, and to start the month of fasting based on the sighting of the moon in the holy city of Mecca. As Muslims across the globe have no institutionalised leadership, there is no single edict on which approach should be followed.
How do Muslims fast in places with no sunset? It‚Äôs a good question. How does a Muslim in Juneau, Alaska, fast? The sun remains visible at midnight in the Arctic Circle, and in northernmost Finland, it does not set at all for 60 days during summer. As a result, local scholars have said it is permissible to follow more reasonable dawn and sunset times of another country. The Islamic Centre of Northern Norway, issued a fatwa ‚Äì a ruling by a scholar of Islamic law or Muslim judicial authority ‚Äì that gives local Muslims the option of following the fasting hours of Mecca, when the fasting day in Norway exceeds 20 hours. The Assembly of Muslim Jurists of America made a similar ruling that Muslims living in the most northerly regions of Alaska can use the dawn and sunset times of another part of the country where ‚Äúday is distinguishable from night‚Äù. Where is the longest fast in the world? In Reykjavik, Iceland, the fast will be about 21 hours 57 minutes long in the beginning of the month, with a fast starting at 2:03am and finishing at midnight. Where is the shortest fast in the world? In Sydney, Australia, a fasting day will be about 11 hours 24 minutes long at the start of Ramadan, when a fast starts at 5.29am and finishes at 16:53pm. What happens at the end?
Muslims worldwide celebrate Eid al-Fitr, the festival of breaking of the fast, which marks the end of Ramadan. According to tradition the angels call it the day of prizegiving because all those who fasted are rewarded by God on this day, and so it is common to hear Muslims greet each other with Eid MubƒÅrak (Happy Eid). It falls on the first day of the new Islamic month of Shawwal and it is forbidden to fast on this day. It is Islamic custom to celebrate Eid with a small sweet breakfast, and to give charity before Eid prayers in congregation. Many Muslims celebrate by giving gifts, wearing new or clean clothes, and visiting friends and family. In Malaysia it is called Hari Raya Aidilfitri, in Urdu it is Cho·π≠ƒ´  øƒ™d meaning smaller Eid, while in Turkey it is ≈ûeker Bayramƒ± or sugar feast. Do people of other faiths fast? Jews fast for about 25 hours on Yom Kippur, or the Day of Atonement, to ask for God‚Äôs forgiveness. Orthodox Christians can spend up to half a year in various forms of fasting, which they believe brings them closer to God. ‚Ä¢ This article was amended on 18 June 2015. References to ‚Äúsunrise‚Äù in an earlier version have been changed to ‚Äúdawn‚Äù, to clarify that fasting during Ramadan begins at dawn (the beginning of the twilight before sunrise) and not at sunrise (when the sun appears above the horizon).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T05:29:15Z,world,World news,Nauruan opposition MP taken off flight and prevented from leaving country,"A member of the opposition in the Nauruan parliament has been removed from a flight to Australia and prevented from leaving by Nauruan authorities. In an extraordinary intervention likely to further exacerbate tensions on the island, Roland Kun was removed from a flight on Wednesday that was bound for Australia. The move comes a day after protests occurred outside the Nauruan parliament and the arrest of another opposition MP, Mathew Batsiua.
Kun told Guardian Australia Nauruan authorities had removed him from the plane after raising concerns about his passport. Kun arrived on the island last Sunday with a Nauruan passport that was valid until October 2016. But Nauruan authorities told him he needed to apply for a new one and confiscated his passport. His application for a new passport was then refused. Kun was then given back his old passport but with a reduced expiry date to October 2015. Kun said he successfully sought approval from the Australian high commissioner for entry into Australia. But he was then pulled off the flight that was scheduled to leave Nauru on Wednesday. ‚ÄúI was on the aircraft when an official came up. They went to check my passport and said it had now been cancelled,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI asked how. They said by directive from upstairs. Meaning either the minister directly or the secretary for justice. ‚ÄúThe aircraft was then offloaded. I had to disembark with the rest of the passengers. While I was speaking with border control officials the aircraft took off.‚Äù It is not clear when Kun will be able to leave the island. He has a wife and three young children in New Zealand, who he is now separated from. There are also concerns he may be arrested by the Nauruan government. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm concerned they don‚Äôt have any legal basis right now to do what they are doing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn the mean time I‚Äôm living away from my family. There is always be the possibility that I will be locked up for speaking to foreign media.‚Äù Nauruan‚Äôs have become increasingly disenchanted with the government in the past two years, with former magistrate Peter Law saying it had led to a serious breakdown in the rule of law. In 2014 all opposition MPs were suspended from the Nauruan parliament.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T04:00:09Z,world,World news,"As Ramadan approaches, the moon-spotting arguments begin","The chairman of the Qasim Ali Khan mosque in Peshawar has little doubt why it regularly throws a spanner into the timings of Pakistan‚Äôs most important religious festivals. ‚ÄúIt is because we are experts in spotting the moon!‚Äù he declares.
Hamood-ur-Rehman is head of the management committee at the mid-sized mosque, which sits in a crowded bazaar in Peshawar‚Äôs old city. It is gearing up for the start of the fasting month of Ramadan, when Muslims avoid food from dawn to sunset. But precisely when it starts depends on whether the start of the Islamic lunar month can be confirmed by the sight of a slender crescent moon hanging in the sky ‚Äì something Rehman claims people living in the Pashtun-dominated north-western region near the regional capital of Peshawar are peculiarly adept at detecting. ‚ÄúIt is because people here are farmers who organise their whole livelihoods around the moon,‚Äù he said. He also puts particular store in the region‚Äôs higher elevation and the quality of the its spring water, which he says enhances eyesight, giving the locals an edge over the official committee tasked by the government with deciding when Ramadan should begin. It frequently leads to key religious festivals starting a day early for millions of people in the Pashtun north-west who follow the mosque‚Äôs lead.
Whether for reasons of sharper eyes, or what critics claim is sectarian disdain for some of the scholars running the official committee, the mosque‚Äôs leader, Mufti Shahabuddin Popalzai, nearly always calls the start and end of Ramadan a day early, forcing Pakistanis to choose between rival dates for marking two of the most important festivals in the Islamic calendar. Millions of Pashtuns in the north-west, who adhere to the Deobandi form of Islam practised by Popalzai, follow his lead. On Wednesday night, he will chair a gathering of dozens of religious leaders at the mosque, who will scrutinise claims of moon sightings from the public. ‚ÄúIt is very confusing because in some mosques people are fasting while in others they are not,‚Äù said Rahimullah Yusufzai, a well-known journalist in Peshawar. ‚ÄúThe situation at the end of Ramadan is particularly difficult because people are tired and weak and just want to celebrate Eid as soon as possible.‚Äù Last year, the festival of Eid-ul-Adha, when animals are sacrificed, was celebrated on three separate dates in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province due to the long-running split between the two moon committees and the decision by the large population of Afghan refugees to follow the date decreed by the government in Kabul.
Interest in the deliberations of the Peshawar clerics is intense. Banks of video cameras from the country‚Äôs television networks crowd the mosque‚Äôs courtyard to film eyewitnesses rushing in from miles around to present their claims to have seen the crescent moon. They are normally accompanied by their local mullah who is expected to attest as to whether the witness is a good Muslim. ‚ÄúPeople say we just have our own people who make the same claims every year, but 95% of eyewitnesses have never given evidence before,‚Äù insists Rehman. Mufti Muneeb-ur-Rehman, head of the Central Ruet-e-Hilal committee, which will also be holding deliberations on Wednesday night, said Peshawar‚Äôs rebel moon gazers were ‚Äúchallenging the writ of the state‚Äù and must be stopped. ‚ÄúIf the government is unable to stop these people setting the wrong date then how are they able to manage the security situation and other issues under their control?‚Äù The authorities have taken action in the past, and even once attempted to block the religious scholars from assembling at the mosque. This year, Pakistan‚Äôs religious affairs minister has merely called for the two sides to cooperate. ‚ÄúThis is not a problem of religion but a problem of egos,‚Äù said Tahir Ashrafi, a high-profile cleric. ‚ÄúThe solution is to demolish these moon committees and give it to scientists to decide.‚Äù Islam and the moon The Islamic calendar is a lunar system, with each month beginning at the start of a new cycle of waxing and waning by the moon. Because it is shorter than the solar calendar, the dates of key religious festivals, such as the fasting month of Ramadan, move by about 11 days each year.
The belief that the start of the month can only really be determined if the thin crescent of the ‚Äúhilal‚Äù moon is visible has created problems for Muslim communities around the world. The lunar cycle means dates inevitably must vary around the world, but normally by just a day. However, cloud cover, or the difficulty of spotting the moon in some locations, can lead to different groups starting major festivals on separate days, even in the same country. Adding to the confusion is the argument of some that the entire Muslim world should take its lead from the official moon-sighting decrees of Saudi Arabia, home to Islam‚Äôs holiest places. Others have argued the whole matter should be decided by astronomers who can project whether or not a new moon has been born, regardless of whether it can be spotted from the ground.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-17T04:00:09Z,world,World news,Why Iranians are lapping up Shah memorabilia,"Near the grand bazaar in Tehran, over the entrance to the complex housing the ministries of foreign affairs and information, the national museum and the Islamic era museum, is a colourful mural, dating to the time of Reza Shah, depicting symbols of Iranian nationalism including a dignified soldier, a Maxim machine-gun, and crossed Iranian flags. The flags, sporting the distinctive horizontal bands of red, white and green, have been more recently altered than the rest. On all the flags, the white band in the centre has been painted over with a fresh coat of eggshell white. On the green band below you can see, cut off at the ankles, the paws of a lion and on the red band above you can see the rays of a rising sun. These are remnants, spared a literal-white washing, of the Shir o Khorshid, or Lion and Sun, a coat of arms that graced the Iranian flag from the mid 19th century until the 1979 Revolution when it was replaced by a stylized version of the word Allah (‚ÄúGod‚Äù) written in Arabic script.
The Shir o Khorshid, a popular Iranian symbol since at least the 12th century, has since the revolution become associated with the deposed monarch Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi and his dynasty. After the revolution, the new government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini systematically eradicated it from public spaces and government buildings, replacing it with Islamic iconography. Today in Iran nostalgia for the Shah and his government, like the paws of the lion, peeks out from under a coat of white paint. When I visited the Vakil bazaar in Shiraz or the Jomeh bazaar in Tehran, I saw mountains of Shah-related memorabilia at almost every stall. Vintage Iranian rial notes and postage stamps emblazoned with his face, brass busts of him and his infamously fabulous wife Empress Farah, coffee-table books with full-colour photos of the royal family, countless pendants, rings, and wall hangings depicting the Shir o Khorshid, some vintage and some obviously mass-produced more recently. Displaying or selling the Shir o Khorshid is technically illegal in Iran, but many shopkeepers told me the police aren‚Äôt enforcing the law as much as they used to. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs definitely much safer now,‚Äù said Mohammad, 68, who owns shops in the grand bazaar in Tehran, and the Vakil bazaar in Shiraz. ‚ÄúThere was a time when you couldn‚Äôt have that symbol anywhere.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou can sell them and they won‚Äôt bother you,‚Äù said Reza, 39, another shopkeeper in Tehran‚Äôs grand bazaar. ‚ÄúAs long as you don‚Äôt make a big deal out of it. You can‚Äôt put a flag right out in front of your shop. ‚Äù I bought a Shah-era five-rial coin, engraved with the lion and sun, and I wear it on a silver chain around my neck. It constantly draws comments from people during my daily commute. Once, a man selling socks on the metro came up to me when he saw it. ‚ÄúGod bless his soul,‚Äù he said, pointing to my necklace, ‚ÄúI was 11, I remember. The first 11 years of my life were great, the rest have been terrible. I ate good food for the first 11 years and then crap.‚Äù He grabbed my collarbone with the firm nerve pinch that some Iranian men use to show affection. ‚ÄúGod bless his soul. Don‚Äôt lose that.‚Äù Another time, in Shiraz, a bus driver when he saw it delayed everyone 15 minutes so he could expresses in verbose, glowing terms, his love of the Pahlavi family, ‚ÄúThey were strong, they came from good blood, from a good tribe, ‚Äù he said to me, raising his extended index finger higher and higher into the air as he spoke. ‚ÄúThey were powerful, they were able to get things done.‚Äù I was taught in my history classes that the Shah was a tin-pot dictator installed by the CIA to subdue Iran‚Äôs leftists and secure American access to the country‚Äôs oil. That he was extravagant and capricious. That his secret police, the Savak, tortured and spied with impunity. Much of this is probably true. Mohammad Reza was definitely the intended beneficiary of an at-least-attempted CIA coup in 1953. And he was definitely a dictator (though whether he was benevolent or tyrannical is debatable).
But I must admit to ambivalent feelings towards the Shah and his government. Under the Shah my grandmother gained the right to vote and to divorce her emotionally abusive, opium-addicted husband. My relatives benefitted from his land redistribution and industrial profit-sharing programmes. My father learned to read from the Shah‚Äôs literacy corps and received government-subsidised meals and textbooks. So who am I to tell them that he was a lousy guy, that he was a despot, that his policies were too pro-western? They don‚Äôt care about that. They were starving and he gave them food, that‚Äôs all they need to know. In my household I was always taught that Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and his father were the greatest leaders Iran ever had. My family loves the man like a grandfather, or even a god. Growing up, we always had a Shir o Khorshid in our house. ‚ÄúEvery aspect of life was better then,‚Äù my father loves to say, ‚Äúeveryone was happier.‚Äù When he comes to visit Iran he blames every imperfection personally on Khomeini. The teller at the bank is rude? Khomeini. The metro is late? Khomeini. The internet is slow? Khomeini. When he was growing up, people were nicer, food tasted better, the Azadi Tower looked bigger.
When I try to introduce any nuance into his interpretation of history, to suggest that perhaps life wasn‚Äôt better for everyone under the Shah, for instance those who were having their eyes pulled out by the Savak in Evin prison, he completely shuts down. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt talk to you about it, because you weren‚Äôt there.‚Äù The appeal of the Shir o Khorshid pendant for me is complex and multilayered. On the one hand, the lion and sun motif is perhaps the only symbol that has ever encapsulated the many facets of the Iranian identity. In its design you can find Zoroastrian, Islamic, Jewish, Turkic, and Zodiacal influence. It was used by every dynasty for 800 years, including the Safavids, Qajars and Pahlavis. On the other hand, the necklace is a simple tribute to my father and his singular, uncompromising view of the world. There‚Äôs also of course a stylistic appeal: I mean, what‚Äôs cooler than a lion holding a sabre standing before the rising sun? And of course I must admit to an intrinsic love of things that are vaguely subversive. I love walking around knowing that I‚Äôm wearing something illegal. I love the raised eyebrows and knowing winks I get when people see it. I love asking a soldier for directions knowing that I‚Äôm displaying the standard of the vanquished on my chest. It just appeals to my contrarian ethos. Recently I was at my uncle‚Äôs apartment in Tehran. He was watching a documentary about the Shah on illegal satellite TV from Turkey. The narrator was talking over stock footage of how the Shah‚Äôs health corps eradicated malaria in the countryside, of how he modernised Iran‚Äôs rail infrastructure, of how he took its natural resources back from foreign interests.
‚ÄúEverything that is functioning in this country today is because of him and his father!‚Äù my uncle said to no-one in particular. He turned to me: ‚ÄúBefore the Shah, your grandfather used to have to go fight people, with guns and knives, just to get a bucket of water for his family to drink. The Shah made sure that everyone had clean water.‚Äù A presenter in suit and tie appeared on the screen, sitting in front of the pre-revolutionary flag and a statue of a lion. ‚ÄúIn the Shah‚Äôs time, when I went to Italy, they stood up for me, they talked to me with respect,‚Äù the presenter said, slamming his fist on the table. ‚ÄúWhen I went to France they respected me as an Iranian. Now when I go anywhere in the world they think we are terrorists, they think we are barbarians.‚Äù Pictures of the Shah came across the screen, set to a triumphal march. Pictures of him with the royal family, of him attending state dinners with Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter, surveying a public works project somewhere. ‚ÄúFor 37 years during his rule,‚Äù the presenter said, ‚Äúthe price of the dollar didn‚Äôt change at all. In 1979 the exchange rate was 70 rials to a dollar, now it is 33,000 rials to a dollar.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe was a great man,‚Äù said my uncle, ‚Äúthese stupid mullahs have set us back 1500 years.‚Äù Nostalgia for the shah among those who actually remember him is at least intelligible. What took me entirely by surprise is that even among those born after the revolution, the Shah has taken on almost mythic status. I was hanging out in front of the Artists‚Äô Forum near the old American embassy - a popular place for hipsters, artists and intellectuals. I was talking to a guy in his mid to early twenties who was selling bootleg Lars Von Trier DVDs. He noticed my necklace and got very excited. He called it mashti, an old Farsi word for someone who has made the pilgrimage to Mashhad but which young Iranians use to mean cool. ‚ÄúHe was a great man,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúit was a much better time for everyone.‚Äù
Another time I struck up a conversation with a skate boarder in Laleh Park and he noticed it. ‚ÄúThese fucking mullahs man, they don‚Äôt give a fuck about us,‚Äù he said. He had a septum piercing and tattoos up his right arm. ‚ÄúThe Shah cared about his people. He was a real leader. ‚Äù ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say anything for sure, but what I know is that he was far better than the current government,‚Äù said Amir, a 26-year-old English teacher who was arrested and tortured for participating in the Green Movement protests after the disputed 2009 presidential election. ‚ÄúAll governments are dictatorships, but you can judge them based on the situation of society and the country during their rule. Most of the development that happened in Iran happened under him and his father. And least he was Iranian, I know that much. He wasn‚Äôt Arab, now Arabs control the government.‚Äù Revisionist history in an oppressive theocracy is not surprising. What‚Äôs unusual about this zeal for the Shah is that it‚Äôs revising in favour of the government that lost, the government that was called decadent and corrupt and swept into oblivion by a wave of populist fervour. What‚Äôs more, admiration for the Shah is almost always expressed to me in diametric opposition to the current regime in Tehran. No one ever seems to calls the Shah good, they call him better than. Better than now. Richer than now, fuller than now, more comfortable than now. More fun than now. The Shah drove around in luxury Cadillacs, in tailored suits and Ray Ban sunglasses. His wife was the Jackie O of the east. When he celebrated the 2500th anniversary of the Persian empire, he flew in the finest chefs from Paris to prepare breast of peacock for royalty and world leaders. He pedalled an intoxicating fantasy.
In his time, Lalezar Street was filled with cabarets, night clubs, bars. Packed most nights until morning. Googoosh, Ebi, Dariush, all the greats played there. The women wore tight skirts and let their hair flow and get tussled. Today Lalezar is filled with shops selling expensive chandeliers and it‚Äôs dead by 10pm. The Crystal Cinema still sits there, boarded up and laconic - a constant reminder that the party is over and no one‚Äôs cleaned up the mess. Iranians don‚Äôt seem to remember the Shah as he was, but as they need him to have been. They need to remember a time when everyone was drunk and in love, cruising the streets on the backs of Vespas, with Serge Gainsbourg wafting through the air and the bar not closing for hours. It‚Äôs a seductive dream and a potent antidote to the creeping malaise of life in the Islamic republic. People need to believe that there was some time better than now. Better than bootleg arak out of a water bottle with the same five people every Wednesday night. Better than constantly worrying about breaking one of the arbitrarily applied rules that govern every part of life in Iran. Better than hijab in the summer time, and the morality police, and being afraid to dance in the street. The Shah‚Äôs main appeal is that he‚Äôs the exact opposite of everything the Islamic republic represents, he‚Äôs all for rock and roll and miniskirts and stiff drinks. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi has become a repository for people‚Äôs pent-up anger and frustration, a canvas on which to paint a better version of Iran ‚Äì even if it‚Äôs one that never really existed. It‚Äôs nostalgia as subversion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-16T19:11:56Z,world,World news,Death of al-Qaida leader masks reality of drone strikes: they don't bring stability,"Nearly 3,000 miles separate Ajdabiya in Libya from Mukalla in Yemen, but they have been linked by two events which demonstrate a US policy of fighting jihadi terrorism in the midst of chaos, violence and state collapse whose causes Washington is unable or unwilling to address. Reports of the death of the Algerian militant Mokhtar Belmokhtar in a US air attack on Saturday ‚Äì denied by supporters ‚Äì are still being being checked pending DNA tests. But al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (Aqap) was quick to confirm the ‚Äúmartyrdom‚Äù of its leader, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, in a drone strike on 9 June. Both cases illustrate the effort by the US to target al-Qaida and like-minded groups alongside the more high-profile international campaign against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Belmokhtar‚Äôs history encapsulates the trajectory of the global jihadi movement over the past quarter of a century: starting with the Armed Islamic Group fighting the Algerian military in the 1990s, through combat with al-Qaida in Afghanistan to his return to North Africa to join al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqim) and other organisations in the grey area between fanaticism and criminality.
Yet killing him smacks more of vengeance for the 2014 In Amenas attack on an Algerian gas installation than any comprehensive strategy. Belmokhtar‚Äôs death, if confirmed, ‚Äúwill do little to address the broader chaos in Libya‚Äù, commented the Soufan Group, a security analysis firm. Aqim, Islamic State and Ansar al-Sharia will continue to destabilise Libya, experts suggested. ‚ÄúNeither North Africa nor Yemen will be more stable for these hits,‚Äù commented the historian Vijay Prashad. The US, which is seen in many Middle Eastern capitals as disengaging from the region, has been criticised for focusing narrowly on the war on Aqap to the detriment of Yemen‚Äôs long-running crisis. The group has attracted close attention because of its capacity to hit western targets, but it is seen at home as merely one of many symptoms of state dysfunction and collapse. High-grade intelligence is crucial to track and identity targets but that depends to a significant extent on the collaboration of local partners. The difficulties of confirming whether an air strike or drone attack has been successful ‚Äì to say nothing of the high risk of killing innocent bystanders ‚Äì underline the limits of even the most sophisticated spycraft without a presence on the ground. In Yemen, now facing Saudi-led air strikes in an effort to restore the legitimate government and defeat Houthi rebels backed by Iran, the US effort was thought to have been damaged by the collapse of the friendly government in Sana‚Äôa earlier this year because it lost some of its ability to gather intelligence and find targets. Still, Wuhayshi was certainly a significant figure ‚Äì a secretary to Osama Bin Laden and deputy to his successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt count Aqap out yet,‚Äù noted the jihad-watcher Aron Zelin, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs probably in its weakest phase‚Äù since 2009, when it came into existence with the merger of the Saudi and Yemeni branches of the organisation. The White House said his death ‚Äústrikes a major blow to al-Qaida‚Äôs most dangerous affiliate‚Äù. Nevertheless, Wuhayshi‚Äôs swift replacement by his deputy, Qassim al-Raymi, reinforced the familiar criticism that assassinating terrorist leaders may only have a short-term disruptive effect. Obama famously declared in 2013 that the ‚Äúwar on terror‚Äù launched by George Bush was over. US policy has plenty of critics at home as well as abroad. On the right he has been lambasted for a ‚Äúlethally desultory approach‚Äù and on the left for continuing to target jihadis on the ‚Äúundeclared battlefields‚Äù of Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan.
‚ÄúWe are constantly told that US drones are surgically precise,‚Äù said Cori Crider of the human rights charity Reprieve. ‚ÄúBut any weapon ‚Äì especially a remote-controlled one ‚Äì is only as accurate as the intelligence behind it. At least 38 people died before a CIA strike finally killed this man. Who were the rest? How many lives did we take in the effort to assassinate al-Wuhayshi? How many have we driven into the arms of militants with the 38 others we killed? The secret drone war conceals a mountain of hidden costs, and the idea we can bomb our way out of the problem of terrorism is short-sighted and, ultimately, false.‚Äù The US has carried out over 106 drone strikes in Yemen since Obama took office and killed more than 800 individuals identified as militants and roughly 80 civilians, according to the New America Foundation. It retains the ability to launch drones from outside Yemen, including Djibouti and presumably from Saudi Arabia. Attacks on Libya are likely mounted from bases in Italy. Earlier this year Obama responded to charges that he was downplaying the dangers of terrorism to the US, and argued that it must be kept in perspective. Terrorist groups, he insisted, do not pose an existential threat to the US or the world order. But Wuhayshi‚Äôs demise, the White House said on Tuesday, ‚Äúremoves from the battlefield an experienced terrorist leader and brings us closer to degrading and ultimately defeating these groups‚Äù. Congressman Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, has sought to introduce a degree of transparency to the CIA‚Äôs drone operations. Responding to news of Wuhayshi‚Äôs death, he warned that such strikes alone would not be enough to achieve that goal. ‚ÄúAs significant as the loss of key leadership is in the disruption of plots against the United States, counter-terrorism operations ‚Ä¶ must always be considered as only one element in a multi-pronged approach that includes building capacities of local and regional authorities, countering the flow of resources to terrorists, and working with partners in the Islamic world to defeat the ideology that attracts new recruits to replenish the ranks of those removed from the battlefield,‚Äù he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-16T18:47:23Z,world,World news,"'It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s going to be bad, whatever happens': Greece on edge as eurozone exit looms","‚ÄúEverybody‚Äôs doing it,‚Äù said Joanna Christofosaki, in front of a Eurobank cash dispenser in the leafy Athens neighbourhood of Kolonaki. ‚ÄúOur friends have all done it. Nobody wants their money to be worthless tomorrow. Nobody wants to be unable to get at it.‚Äù A researcher in the archaeology department at the Academy of Athens, Christofosaki said she knew plenty of people who had ‚Äú‚Ç¨10,000 somewhere at home‚Äù and plenty of others who chose to keep their stash at the office. Was she among them? ‚ÄúIf I was, I certainly wouldn‚Äôt tell you.‚Äù It was not too hard, in central Athens‚Äô plushest district on Tuesday, to find people worried that the latest breakdown of talks between Greece and its creditors over a new aid-for-reforms deal may have implications for the security ‚Äì and accessibility ‚Äì of their savings.
With time fast running out to secure a desperately needed ‚Ç¨7.2bn in new rescue funds before the end of the month, when Athens is due to repay ‚Ç¨1.5bn in loans to the International Monetary Fund, anxious Greeks have begun withdrawing money from their country‚Äôs banks at an unprecedented rate. Bank deposits have been falling steadily since October and now stand at their lowest level since 2004. Withdrawals in recent weeks have averaged ‚Ç¨200-250m a day, but on Monday ‚Äì after the shock collapse of last-ditch talks between the Greek government and its eurozone and international lenders ‚Äì withdrawals surged to ‚Ç¨400m. ‚ÄúPeople are very concerned,‚Äù said the owner of a small company who asked not to be named. ‚ÄúI think those who could, have already transferred some money abroad. And lots of others have taken out a few thousand, enough to see them through any immediate crisis. I have.‚Äù Sofia, who runs a boutique in one of Athens‚Äô wealthier suburbs, said she and her husband had ‚Ç¨15,000 in a safe in the garage, ‚Äújust to be sure we‚Äôre not caught out.‚Äù
Elsewhere, an anonymous car concessionaire confessed to ‚Äúgetting into gold a little bit. Not much. But it‚Äôs safe, isn‚Äôt it? That‚Äôs what they say.‚Äù Nikos Grigoriou, who runs a software consultancy, said the possible introduction of capital controls ‚Äì as happened two years ago in Cyprus ‚Äì was the big worry now. ‚ÄúIf they fail to reach a deal and Greece defaults, there‚Äôll be a lot of panic. Anything could happen.‚Äù Governments use capital controls to stop banks haemorrhaging deposits and to avert insolvency. They can involve setting ceilings on foreign transfers, taxing particular kinds of withdrawal, performing physical checks at borders ‚Äì but also limiting cash withdrawals from banks and ATMs. In Cyprus that limit was set at ‚Ç¨300 a day, but many observers believe Greece might well need to set a considerably lower daily limit. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that going to be like ‚Äì no one allowed to take out more than, I don‚Äôt know, ‚Ç¨100 a day?‚Äù asked Christos Ekonomou, a hairdresser.
As Greece‚Äôs choice comes ever more sharply into focus ‚Äì between opting to stay in the eurozone and experiencing yet more austerity, or defaulting on its repayments and possibly returning to the drachma ‚Äì some economists have also suggested, as an interim measure, a halfway house parallel currency that would involve government IOU notes and tax credit certificates. On Tuesday, for every wealthy Kolonaki resident fretting about their cash, there was a less well-off state or company employee convinced it would not come to that. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried, sure, for my job, my kids, my future. But not about my money at the bank, said Nancy Parlakidi outside the Alpha Bank on Stadiou Street. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the least of my worries right now. The bank‚Äôs the safest place for it.‚Äù Withdrawing a couple of ‚Ç¨10 notes from the Piraeus Bank near Syntagma Square (‚Äúbut only so I can go shopping‚Äù) Georgios Votskaris, a junior office worker, suggested that ‚Äúolder people and richer people are withdrawing money because they‚Äôre frightened. ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôm not frightened, I think there‚Äôs going to be a deal. But mainly I don‚Äôt really have any money to take out. I‚Äôm 33 years old; what kind of savings do you think I could have built up over the past five years?‚Äù
At the Eurobank on Voukourestiou Street, Dimitrios Barpakis, a 40-year-old software engineer, said much the same. ‚ÄúI have no money to speak of that I could actually get worried about. I‚Äôve lost a lot of money during this crisis; I‚Äôve had to spend my savings, not put them under the bed. And I think there‚Äôll be a last-minute deal. It‚Äôs in no one‚Äôs interest for there not to be.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be bad and it‚Äôs going to be hard, whatever happens. No one‚Äôs kidding themselves about that,‚Äù said Kristina, a lawyer. But despite deep concerns about the their country‚Äôs economic future, few Greeks see any benefits to be had from leaving the eurozone. A recent opinion poll for the news website Newsit showed as many as 74% of Greeks back the euro ‚Äì with fully 50% saying they would be prepared to accept ‚Äúmajor concessions‚Äù by the country‚Äôs Syriza-led government if it would help break the deadlock with bailout lenders. ‚ÄúWe have to stay in,‚Äù said Votskaris. ‚ÄúIf we leave, things will only get far, far worse.‚Äù Barpakis concurred: ‚ÄúWe should definitely stay in ‚Äì as long as the eurozone is prepared to be what it really should be, which is to say a genuine union whose members help, not punish, each other.‚Äù Christofosaki, though, while also convinced Greece‚Äôs future had to be inside the eurozone, was less sure how things would pan out. ‚ÄúThe big problem in this country is a mental one,‚Äù she said. Even if we do get concessions and there is a deal, a majority of people don‚Äôt really want to reform. Greeks are a recalcitrant lot.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ This article was amended on 30 June 2015 to remove personal details.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-16T18:38:53Z,world,World news,Orange boss launches legal action after death threats over Israel boycott,"The head of the French telecoms group Orange has begun legal action after allegedly receiving death threats for suggesting the company would cease conducting business in Israel. St√©phane Richard apologised for his comments, made in Egypt earlier this month, and travelled to the Jewish state last week to explain himself in a meeting with Israel‚Äôs prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. He had been accused of bowing to Palestinian pressure to boycott the country.
A lawsuit ‚Äúagainst X‚Äù (persons unknown) was announced on Tuesday after Richard‚Äôs personal details were published on the internet and he received ‚Äúrepeated death threats‚Äù and ‚Äúthreatening calls‚Äù. A police spokesperson said: ‚ÄúSt√©phane Richard has received death threats on his telephone and his personal details have been put online after the controversy about the presence of Orange in Israel.‚Äù They said he and people close to him had received hundreds of menacing calls. Gr√©gory Chelli, an Israeli hacker known by his pseudonym Ulcan, who describes himself as a militant Zionist, revealed Richard‚Äôs telephone number on his Facebook page. He said: ‚ÄúIf you want to say bonjour to the head of Orange ‚Ä¶‚Äù Both Richard and Orange representatives have insisted it was never the company‚Äôs intention to pull out of Israel and said it was a commercial decision to withdraw from its partnership with the Israeli operator Partner Communications while retaining other operations in the country. They insisted the decision was nothing to do with politics. In Israel, however, the remarks were interpreted as a call to boycott. Richard told Netanyahu he deeply regretted the controversy caused by his statements.
He said: ‚ÄúI have been personally and profoundly shaken by the effect caused by the misunderstandings and distortions caused by my recent declarations regarding our operating strategy here. I profoundly regret the impact given the context and intepretation of those statements. ‚ÄúFor me, this meeting is a chance to say, clearly and without ambiguity, that Orange is not taking part in any boycott of Israel or anywhere else.‚Äù Orange is linked by contract to Partner Communications, which has paid to use the Orange name and logo since 1998. The contract is due to last until 2025. At the end of May, five NGOs and two trades unions lambasted Partner Communications for its activities in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel and demanded that Orange ‚Äúpublicly state its willingness to distance itself and criticise the attacks on human rights committed by Partner‚Äù.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-16T18:23:25Z,world,World news,UK adds to condemnation of Bahrain over jailing of Shia opposition leader,"Bahrain is facing criticism from human rights watchdogs and from Britain, normally a supportive ally, after a court jailed the country‚Äôs main Shia opposition leader for four years on charges of trying to change the political system by force. Sheikh Ali Salman, secretary general of the al-Wefaq national Islamic movement, was arrested last December after calling for political reform and accountability in the small Gulf island state, where the Sunni Al-Khalifa monarchy rules over a restive Shia majority. He was charged with ‚Äúincitement to promote change of the political system by force, threats and other illegal means‚Äù as well as ‚Äúincitement to loathing and contempt of a sect‚Äù and ‚Äúpublicly insulting the interior ministry‚Äù. Salman was acquitted of a more serious charge of attempting to overthrow the regime. Bahrain, home to the US navy‚Äôs fifth fleet, has faced sporadic unrest since a largely Shia-led uprising in 2011 demanding a constitutional monarchy and more representative government. At least 89 people have been killed in clashes with security forces. Hundreds have been arrested and put on trial. Unusually, the US issued a warning at the time that Salman‚Äôs arrest could ‚Äúinflame tensions‚Äù. But in recent weeks there have been signs that Washington is quietly working to lift a four-year ban on delivering weapons that was imposed because of the crackdown. Bahrain, which is a very close to Saudi Arabia, is a member of the Arab coalition fighting Islamic State. Britain, which ruled Bahrain until independence in 1971, has been criticised for maintaining business as usual with Manama. This week it opened a new naval base there. ‚ÄúThe message to Bahrainis is that the UK cares only about its arms business, and its talk of human rights is just empty,‚Äù said Sayed Alwadaei, of the opposition Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy. Tobias Ellwood, the UK foreign office minister, issued the mildest of rebukes. ‚ÄúI am concerned by the verdict and the sentence handed down to Sheikh Ali Salman and I raised this case with the Bahraini authorities during my visit last weekend,‚Äù he said in a statement. He did not call for Salman‚Äôs release. The Manama government has said it is following recommendations for changes made by an independent commission, but key proposals have never been implemented. Bahraini sources say the reform-minded crown prince has been sidelined by more hardline elements in the aftermath of the Arab spring. Amnesty International said: ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs verdict is shocking. It is yet another clear example of Bahrain‚Äôs flagrant disregard for its international obligations. Sheikh Ali Salman has been sentenced solely for peacefully expressing his opinion.‚Äù Bahraini government officials often accuse Iran of backing the opposition, though there is little evidence of its direct involvement. Bahrain features prominently in Iranian propaganda. Ali al-Aswad, a former Wefaq MP, said: ‚ÄúThe message from Bahrain is crystal clear: for at least the next four years there will be no dialogue in Bahrain. Locking away the leader of the main opposition party, a figure who has done nothing but promote peacefulness, means the door to reform is firmly locked. ‚ÄúWhere Bahrain heads to now is determined by the reaction this decision provokes internationally. If it is not met with widespread disapproval, the authorities will feel emboldened that this decision was correct and continue to shut out the opposition.‚Äù Human Rights First said: ‚ÄúSending the leader of the main opposition group to jail for peaceful protests only encourages those pushing for violent change. How the US government responds is a major test of the Obama administration‚Äôs vision for the region.‚Äù Al-Wefaq boycotted Bahrain‚Äôs elections last November on the grounds that promised reforms had not taken place. Critics accuse it of pursuing a radical agenda and encouraging violence, but it insists its methods are peaceful and its sole interest is democracy. Unlike other Bahraini opposition groups that have demanded the overthrow of the Al Khalifa, al-Wefaq wants a constitutional monarchy. Brian Dooley, of HRF, said: ‚ÄúSilencing peaceful dissent is a script we‚Äôve seen before, from Egypt to Guatemala to Zimbabwe. It never ends well.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-16T17:40:56Z,world,World news,EU ministers fail to agree on migrant quotas,"European Union governments have failed to reach agreement on how to divide up the tens of thousands of refugees pouring into southern Italy from north Africa, increasing Rome‚Äôs fears that it will be left to cope with the Mediterranean migrant crisis. Interior ministers from the 28 member states met in Luxembourg and shelved any decisions on proposals from Brussels for a new system of sharing the refugee load through a mandatory quotas system. The proposals put forward by the European commission last month were modest, calling for the distribution among EU countries of 40,000 asylum seekers arriving in Italy and Greece. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a divergence of views,‚Äù said Latvia‚Äôs interior minister, Rihards Kozlovskis, who chaired the meeting. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no common view on voluntary and mandatory.‚Äù The proposed policy would have made refugee-sharing mandatory, but opponents, mainly in eastern Europe, want the scheme left voluntary.
There is tension between Italy on the one hand and France and Austria ‚Äì which have closed their borders to stop migrants moving north ‚Äì on the other. As the ministers met in Luxembourg, hundreds of migrants were camped out on the French-Italian border, unable to cross out of Italy. Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European commissioner in charge of the issue, sought to put a brave face on the results of a meeting that included up to five hours of argument and produced no agreement. ‚ÄúIn my eyes, it was a success,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere is no room for criticism.‚Äù The immigration issue, one of the most toxic in the politics of many of the countries concerned, will now be passed up to an EU summit in Brussels next week. The summit will order further discussions at the end of July. This week Italy threatened retaliatory measures against its EU partners unless they agreed to quotas, warning that it would give arriving migrants three-month temporary visas that would allow them to travel further in the EU‚Äôs passport-free Schengen zone.
The French and German interior ministers came out in favour of the quotas system but linked their backing to commitments from Rome that it would register and fingerprint arriving migrants so they could be sent back there under EU rules that stipulate that an asylum seeker must lodge a claim in the first EU country he or she enters. Paris and Berlin also want to ‚ÄúEuropeanise‚Äù the registration and deportation of migrants, handing the powers to EU agencies, because they do not trust the Italian authorities to carry out the proper procedures. The European commission is in charge of policing EU observance of the rules governing the passport-free Schengen zone. Avramopoulos suggested that Austria and France were breaking the rules. ‚ÄúMember states cannot introduce systematic border checks at internal borders,‚Äù he said.

2015-06-16T17:37:45Z,world,World news,"Tsipras does want a deal, as the alternative is unthinkable","Hard though it is to believe sometimes, Alexis Tsipras does want to strike a deal. The increasingly abrasive language used by the Greek prime minister is a front for a politician who still thinks it is possible to negotiate his way out of the sticky situation he finds himself in. That has to be the assumption. The alternative to a deal would appear to be a Lehman Brothers-style moment sometime in the next 72 hours, when the Greek banks haemorrhage money and capital controls are introduced. At that point, support for Tsipras and his Syriza coalition is likely to dissipate rapidly, especially if Greece‚Äôs eurozone partners say capital controls are incompatible with membership of the single currency.
Tsipras came into power as the man who could do a deal. Even now, he believes he can strike one ‚Äì not least because he thinks the desire to keep the euro intact will trump the desire to inflict more austerity on Greece. Put simply, he is sure Angela Merkel does not want to go down in history as the chancellor who undid all the work towards European integration of Konrad Adenauer, Helmut Schmidt and Helmut Kohl. The sort of agreement Athens envisages was just about detectable, as Tsipras and his finance minister launched their latest denunciation of the way Greece is being treated by its creditors: debt relief in exchange for accepting more painful economic reforms. This has a certain logic to it. Greece‚Äôs debt is currently around 175% of its annual national income, most of it owed to official creditors such as the European Central Bank or the International Monetary Fund. It would take unachievable levels of growth to make a dent in this debt burden, which will hobble the country for years to come.
The IMF accepts this. It thinks that Greece‚Äôs debts need to be reduced to 120% of GDP to be sustainable, and that debt relief will need to be part of a third bailout package that would follow the successful completion of the current negotiations. Thus far, the IMF has failed to convince the European commission or the ECB that Greece needs debt relief, providing an opening for Tsipras. He wants to drive a wedge between the IMF and the two other bodies that make up the troika. Ideally, he would like the US ‚Äì alarmed at the potential geopolitical consequences of Greece being driven into the arms of Russia ‚Äì to use its influence to put pressure on Merkel to strike a debt relief for reform deal. The compromise would involve cutting pensions and increasing VAT in return for reducing Greece‚Äôs debt to GDP ratio. This might be amenable to the Greek parliament, particularly with safeguards to protect the poorest pensioners and VAT exemptions for sensitive products.
There is though one flaw in this seductive plan. Taking the axe to Greece‚Äôs debt would be expensive and it would be taxpayers in other eurozone countries ‚Äì Germany is particular ‚Äì that would pick up the tab. The value of Greece‚Äôs debt is currently ‚Ç¨320bn, so a cut to 120% of GDP would mean a writeoff of around ‚Ç¨100bn. The rest of the eurozone might consider this a price worth paying to keep Greece in the single currency. Given the poisonous atmosphere, though, it will be a hard sell.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-16T16:47:33Z,world,World news,Dominicans of Haitian descent fear mass deportation as deadline looms,"Yesenia Origin√© has never been to Haiti and has no interest in going. She was born in the Dominican city of San Pedro de Macor√≠s to Haitian parents. But because she has no papers to prove it, she, like thousands of other people of Haitian descent in the Dominican Republic, risks being rounded up and deported to the neighbouring country. Many people in Origin√©‚Äôs situation are fearing the worst ahead of the Wednesday deadline for an estimated 500,000 undocumented persons living in the Dominican Republic to register with government authorities. The country‚Äôs authorities have reportedly lined up a fleet of buses and established processing centres on the border with Haiti, prompting widespread fears of mass roundups of Dominicans of Haitian descent. ‚ÄúIf they send me there, I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do,‚Äù says 22-year-old Origin√© who lives in a batey ‚Äì a company town for sugarcane workers ‚Äì in the south-west of the Dominican Republic.
A 2013 court ruling stripped children of Haitian migrants of their citizenship retroactively to 1930, leaving tens of thousands of Dominican-born people of Haitian descent stateless. International outrage over the ruling led the Dominican government to pass a law last year that allows people born to undocumented foreign parents, whose birth was never registered in the Dominican Republic, to request residency permits as foreigners. After two years they can apply for naturalisation. However, many have actively resisted registering as foreigners because they say they are Dominican by birth and deserve all the rights that come with it ‚Äì for example a naturalised citizen cannot run for high office. Beneco Enecia, director of a community development group called Cedeso that works with Haitian immigrants and Dominicans of Haitian descent in the town of Tamayo, says his organisation does not recommend those born in the Dominican Republic to apply for residency. ‚ÄúWe tell people to resist and we will continue to press for their recognition as citizens,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThey are Dominican, not Haitian.‚Äù But that means that after the 17 June deadline, people in Origin√©‚Äôs situation could be picked up and sent to the border. ‚ÄúThere are rumours that on the 18th there will be a roundup at the batey,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid to go out on to the street.‚Äù The interior minister, Ram√≥n Fadul, has denied there will be mass roundups. But Major General Rub√©n Dar√≠o Paulino, the country‚Äôs director of migration, told local press that 2,000 police and military officers and 150 inspectors had received special training for deportations. ‚ÄúThings will happen slowly at first,‚Äù predicts Wade McMullen, a lawyer with Robert F Kennedy Human Rights, a US-based advocacy centre. ‚ÄúThe Dominican government will likely be very careful about taking any action that can be deemed massive,‚Äù he says. Under the regularisation programme, non-citizens who could establish their identity and prove they arrived before October 2011 are also eligible for residency. But for many Haitian migrants ‚Äì born in Haiti but living undocumented in the Dominican Republic ‚Äì getting passports or identity cards from their country‚Äôs embassy has proven slow and costly. Many cannot show they have been in the country for more than five years because employers refuse to admit they have been hiring illegals. Fadul said 250,000 people have started the application process for residency but that only 10,000 had met all the requirements. So far, only about 300 have actually received permits. Those with proof of application, however, will not be deported, he said. Throughout the year during which the regularisation plan has been implemented, recent immigrants continue to be picked up and expelled under a programme known as the Shield. In the first quarter of 2015 some 40,000 people have been deported to Haiti. Human rights groups have also documented numerous incidents in which people on their way to apply for residency were swept up and taken to the border.
Haiti and the Dominican Republic share a long history of tension and mistrust, since Haiti occupied its neighbour militarily three times in the early 19th century with the intent of unifying the island under a single rule. In the early 20th century, tens of thousands of migrant workers from Haiti were hired to work in Dominican sugarcane fields and often stayed after the harvest, while others have crossed the porous border to escape political violence or seeking better economic opportunities. Today Haiti is the poorest country in the western hemisphere and remains crippled after a devastating earthquake in 2010. It‚Äôs the last place Ogorin√© wants to go. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm desperate, I may have to go into hiding,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWhenever I see the military or police now I tremble with fear.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-16T16:41:59Z,world,World news,A cross to bear: the vanishing Christians of the Middle East,"Father Iyad Twai is the Roman Catholic parish priest of the village of Beit Sahour, a mile or so away from Beit Lechem ‚Äì or Bethlehem, as it is better known ‚Äì in the Palestinian West Bank. Last month, we met for a coffee and a smoke at Bethlehem University and chatted about our respective parishes. It‚Äôs a golden rule that, when two clergy get together to talk, they start comparing numbers. He has about 350 families in his parish ‚Äì about 1,200 people ‚Äì as well as involvement from the Orthodox and Arab Maronite communities. And his was the village where the shepherds of the gospel of Luke first proclaimed the good news of Jesus‚Äôs birth. This is where Christianity began. Some of his parishioners are descendants of those first shepherds, he said. I raised a sceptical eyebrow. Nonetheless, in the game of ecclesiastical top trumps, he had blown me away on all counts. But, for all of this, Father Iyad is fighting an uphill battle. His community is shrinking, with many younger Palestinian Christians leaving Beit Sahour to find jobs elsewhere in the world. The Israeli occupation has left them with little prospects in their home town. Soon, he says, there won‚Äôt be any Christians left. People will come here on air-conditioned coaches to look at buildings like the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, but what he calls the ‚Äúliving stones‚Äù, ie the local Christian community itself (a reference to 1 Peter, chapter 2), are ignored, as if they don‚Äôt exist.
This book from photographer Linda Dorigo and journalist Andrea Milluzzi, Italians working in the Middle East, give faces to these living stones, away from touristic locations. Their new book ‚Äì poignantly titled Rifugio (‚Äúrefuge‚Äù or ‚Äúshelter‚Äù) ‚Äì is a visual record of those who have, through poverty or defiance, refused to become a part of the Christian diaspora and now struggle to live out their faith in an increasingly inhospitable land. ‚ÄúDuring New Year‚Äôs evening Mass in 2011, an explosion destroyed the Saints Church in Alexandria [in Egypt]. Twenty-one Christians died. The story appeared in western newspapers and on television, but, after a few days, the media‚Äôs attention faded. We felt the need to know more. So we left to discover stories, families and villages in their everyday lives. We were looking for the heirs of the evangelists and the first pilgrims,‚Äù they explain. When the US launched its invasion of Iraq in 2003, there were 1.5 million Christians living in the country. Saddam Hussein‚Äôs foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, was a Christian ‚Äì demonstrating the relative religious tolerance under that regime. But, by igniting sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shias, the US invasion was a disaster for indigenous Christians, who Muslims associated with the hated crusaders. Now Christians are being slaughtered by Islamic State. Between 2003 and now, three quarters of Iraq‚Äôs Christians have been driven from their homes or killed. It‚Äôs a story that has repeated itself throughout the Middle East, although, to be fair, it long pre-dates the US invasion. When, a century ago, the Ottomans drove Armenian Christians from Turkey into the Syrian desert to die of starvation, there was a 13% Christian presence in Turkey. Now, they have been all but wiped out. In Egypt, some 600,000 Christians have left during the past 30 years.
Father Iyad is right to be worried. And Dorigo and Milluzzi have done important work showing us their faces and giving us an emotional connection to their struggle for survival. Many of these communities have existed since the first century. Some of them still pray in Aramaic, the language that Jesus himself prayed in. Now they are approaching extinction. Christianity is being driven from the place of its birth. Rifugio: Christians of the Middle East by Linda Dorigo and Andrea Milluzzi (Schilt Publishing, ¬£29.95, Amsterdam).

2015-06-16T16:23:33Z,world,World news,Vladimir Putin opens Russian 'military Disneyland' Patriot Park,"Lunch consists of army rations, shopping is mainly for Vladimir Putin accessories, and instead of riding rollercoasters children can play with grenade launchers and clamber over heavy weaponry. Welcome to Patriot Park: fun for all the family, with a militaristic twist. This vast military theme park at Kubinka, an hour‚Äôs drive from Moscow, was officially opened by Putin on Tuesday at a time of heightened patriotism and military rhetoric in the wake of Russia‚Äôs annexation of Crimea last year and subsequent confrontation with the west. Putin used the event as an opportunity to announce the addition of 40 new intercontinental missiles to Russia‚Äôs nuclear arsenal this year. He said the theme park would be ‚Äúan important element in our system of military-patriotic work with young people‚Äù. As well as being a ‚Äúmilitary Disneyland‚Äù, Patriot Park is also a conference and exhibition venue, and Tuesday marked the start of Army 2015, a Russian military exhibition showcasing the latest equipment, attended by delegations from dozens of countries. The president arrived at Kubinka by helicopter and spoke in front of a military choir and balalaika orchestra, who belted out a patriotic number. Putin said in a short speech that the Russian military was developing several new pieces of hardware that had ‚Äúno equivalents in the world‚Äù, including the next-generation Armata tank, first displayed publicly during a military parade in Moscow last month. He said the 40 new nuclear missiles that Russia‚Äôs strategic forces would receive this year were ‚Äúcapable of overcoming even the most technically advanced missile defence systems‚Äù.
Russia‚Äôs deputy defence minister, Anatoly Antonov, said at the conference that the west was ‚Äúprovoking an arms race‚Äù with Russia. Jens Stoltenberg, secretary general of NATO, responded by accusing Moscow of unjustified scare mongering. ‚ÄúThis nuclear sabre-rattling of Russia is unjustified,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs destabilising and it‚Äôs dangerous.‚Äù Alexander Zaldostanov, better known as the Surgeon, leader of the pro-Putin biker group the Night Wolves, who was touring Patriot Park on its first day, said: ‚ÄúWhen I look at all this stuff it makes me feel proud of Russia and realise that we have something to answer the Americans with. They wouldn‚Äôt dare to press the button.‚Äù A pack of a dozen Night Wolves were visiting partly for inspiration for a similar ‚Äúpatriotic park‚Äù they are building on the outskirts of Sevastopol, in newly annexed Crimea. ‚ÄúIn Soviet times the army was a distant, faraway thing, but now we all feel closer to the army. The army is being romanticised and I see that as a good thing,‚Äù Zaldostanov said. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt educate our own children then America will do it for us ‚Ä¶ like we have seen in Ukraine.‚Äù When the Kubinka park is functioning at full capacity it will be able to host tens of thousands of visitors per day. There will be battle reconstructions of some of the most famous victories in Russian and Soviet history, and regular displays of military hardware and training opportunities. Hotels and entertainment centres will be opened on the grounds, which should allow families to visit for several days and make a holiday of it, according to promotional literature distributed at the launch. The park is due to be fully completed in 2017, and will cost the defence ministry 20 billion roubles (¬£236m), according to the Kommersant newspaper. Visitors will be able to ride tanks, shoot guns and play extreme sports. ‚ÄúI think this park is a gift to Russian citizens, who can now behold the full power of the Russian armed forces. Being here gives you a sense of internal self-sufficiency and makes you confident we can defend our territory,‚Äù said Sergei Privalov, a Russian Orthodox priest who attended the opening ceremony. ‚ÄúChildren should come here, play with the weaponry and climb on the tanks and see all the most modern technology, which they would not have known about before.‚Äù
Rows of tanks, armoured personnel carriers and missile launching systems were on display in the grounds of the park, as well as period pieces. At the Army 2015 forum inside Patriot Park, dozens of huge marquees showcased everything from secure fingerprinting equipment to armoured riot control vehicles and police watchtowers. A naval commander from Saudi Arabia was perusing firefighting equipment and said a delegation of around 20 had come from his country to ‚Äúcheck out the latest offerings‚Äù. There were delegations from dozens of other mainly non-western countries. A stall sold fridge magnets depicting Russian and Soviet figures including Putin, Joseph Stalin and Lavrenty Beria, one of Stalin‚Äôs most notorious henchmen. Vending machines dispensed army-branded water, and shops sold iPhone cases, T-shirts, sweatshirts and bomber jackets branded with either Putin‚Äôs face or slogans extolling victory in the second world war. Putin has stressed that Russians should not dwell on the dark pages of the country‚Äôs history and instead focus on the military victories of both Tsarist Russia and the Soviet Union. The victory over Nazi Germany has been elevated to a national rallying idea, with huge celebrations last month to mark the 70th anniversary. However, there was no place at the forum for any mention of the Russian military‚Äôs latest tactics of ‚Äúhybrid war‚Äù, the term used to refer to Russia‚Äôs intervention in east Ukraine using a mixture of mercenaries, subterfuge and intelligence work, augmented with regular military units during key moments. Officially, Moscow has denied any military involvement and has tried to cover up the deaths of serving soldiers in the conflict zone. The emphasis at Patriot Park is on the glory of war, and the government believes the theme park should help instil a new sense of patriotism in Russia‚Äôs youth. At one stand, Vladimir Kryuchkov was demonstrating the computerised training system for various missile and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. The systems are used to train the Russian army as well as foreign armies who buy Russian weapons. Kryuchkov said the training systems were on display only as part of the forum, but he hoped they would remain permanently for visitors to the park to use, and was especially keen that children receive training. ‚ÄúBoys are geared towards the army from birth by genetics,‚Äù he said. While the Igla surface-to-air missile launcher was probably too heavy for very small children, smaller rocket-propelled grenade launchers were perfect for kids of all ages. Kryuchkov added: ‚ÄúAll males of all ages are defenders of the motherland and they must be ready for war, whether war comes or not.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-16T15:00:15Z,world,World news,Airlines urged to carry defibrillators after death of woman on Ryanair flight,"A coroner is urging airlines to carry defibrillators after a 47-year-old woman collapsed and died of an undiagnosed heart condition while on a Ryanair flight. Davina Tavener, who had two children, was travelling to the Spanish resort of Lanzarote with her husband, Andrew, when she fell ill about three hours into the journey, an inquest heard. Andrew Tavener became concerned for his wife after she did not return from the toilet. Members of the cabin crew opened the door to find Davina Tavener had collapsed. A consultant breast surgeon at the Royal Bolton hospital who was on the flight tried to help cabin crew and other passengers save her but they were unable to do so. Airlines are not currently required to carry a defibrillator, which can shock the heart back into action after an arrest. Andrew Tavener told Bolton coroner‚Äôs court that as far as he was aware, his wife, a businesswoman, was healthy, other than complaining of a minor stomach ache in the week before the flight. Consultant surgeon Clare Garnsey told the inquest she could not feel a pulse and believed that Davina Tavener had died while on the plane. On arrival at Lanzarote airport, paramedics entered the aircraft and took her to hospital. Coroner Alan Walsh ruled that the cause of death was unknown ‚Äì and that she Tavener died of a naturally occurring disease. Garnsey told the court she was surprised that there was not a defibrillator on board, describing them as critical to survival in cardiac events. She said: ‚ÄúI did ask for a defibrillator, because if it‚Äôs a cardiac issue that‚Äôs the best chance of survival, and it was quite a surprise this wasn‚Äôt there.‚Äù Two representatives of Ryanair who appeared at the inquest, Chris Grube, regional air base manager, and Eva Roharikova, chief instructor of safety, both said they could not comment on the possibility of introducing defibrillators on the airline. The court was told that Davina Tavener worked for HSBC and frequently travelled abroad, and had visited Hong Kong, China and Thailand in the weeks running up to her death. She was born in Burnley but moved to Bolton as a child, and graduated from the University of Birmingham with a degree in foreign languages and business. She was described as a very intelligent and successful woman. Walsh said Ryanair staff had followed all safety protocols and paid tribute to Garnsey and others who helped. ‚ÄúI cannot speak more highly of the involvement of Ms Garnsey and those others who participated in the resuscitation process. I include in that comment members of Ryanair cabin crew. ‚ÄúIn relation to Mrs Tavener‚Äôs death, it is difficult to know whether any equipment would have assisted, because there was a five- to 10-minute period when she was in the toilet, and it‚Äôs not known for how long she was unresponsive.‚Äù Walsh said he would be writing to the European Aviation Safety Agency, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Irish Aviation Authority about the possibility of installing defibrillators on board, as well as a bag valve mask, airway adjuncts and suction equipment, to provide more dignity to people being treated on an aircraft. As Ryanair is based in Ireland, its safety policies are overseen by the Irish Aviation Authority. Walsh added: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe there is any difference between short-haul flights and long-haul flights. It takes a second to have a cardiac event and sadly cardiac events don‚Äôt choose whether they are 10 minutes into a flight or 10 hours into a flight. ‚ÄúIf you are, by the nature of air travel, trapped in aircraft without access to any other facility, the authorities need to consider the equipment to be carried on those airlines, whether it‚Äôs short haul or long haul.‚Äù Following the hearing, Philip Chadbond, Davina Tavener‚Äôs brother, said: ‚ÄúShe died in very unfortunate circumstances, but if there is any chance that the airlines could make this change, which could save someone‚Äôs life, that would be a positive outcome.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-16T14:30:24Z,world,World news,"France in denial over alcohol abuse, says health minister","France must do more to tackle alcohol abuse and smoking, the country‚Äôs health minister has said. Marisol Touraine said France was renowned for its healthcare but needed to do more in terms of preventing diseases. She said there was a very French form of denial over the hazards of alcohol, which is believed to cause an estimated 50,000 premature deaths a year in France. Touraine also said the number of French women who smoke ‚Äì and particularly those who continue to do so in the last three months of pregnancy ‚Äì as well as the number of young and poor who light up was worrying.
Touraine said figures from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development showed the French consume an average 12 litres of pure alcohol a year, equivalent to about 120 bottles of wine, compared with a European average of 9.1 litres. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm French, I like to drink a glass of wine ‚Ä¶ but the wine and alcohol lobby in France is powerful and has got into people‚Äôs heads that wine is good for the health, which remains to be proven,‚Äù she told journalists from the Anglo-American Press Association in Paris. ‚ÄúWe drink less than 30 years ago, but still above the European average.‚Äù The French government is battling attempts to water down a 1991 law that imposed restrictions on alcohol advertising. Touraine said the new challenge was ‚Äúdisguised advertising‚Äù, citing a 2013 ruling that fined Paris Match for an article on the Hollywood actor Scarlett Johansson‚Äôs deal with a celebrated French champagne house.
‚ÄúSo we see Mademoiselle Scarlett Johansson stretched out on a red sofa looking every bit the star she is, with a bottle in front of her on which we can see the brand label. The judges decided this was disguised advertising and should not be in a magazine, and it‚Äôs claimed this threatens France‚Äôs champagne industry,‚Äú Touraine said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just crazy. I‚Äôm not trying to harden the law, I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt touch it.‚Äù Touraine, 56, whose broad portfolio in Fran√ßois Hollande‚Äôs Socialist government covers social affairs, health and women‚Äôs rights, said: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a form of denial over this. In all my political career, I‚Äôve never known such passion over a subject. There will be a debate about wine in parliament at 4am and you think all the MPs will be at home asleep, but no, they turn up. It‚Äôs a very French debate.‚Äù
France is to force tobacco companies to use plain packaging from 2016 in attempt to reduce the number of smokers. After successful campaigns to discourage smoking in the 1990s, the proportion of the adult population using tobacco rose to 30% between 2000 and 2013, Touraine said. She cited the success of Britain in reducing smoking levels to around 20% of over-15s.
‚ÄúThere are three categories we have to tackle: women, because there is an increase in the number of female smokers, and France has the highest number who smoke in the last trimester of pregnancy; the young and the poor. I don‚Äôt like introducing bans, but sometimes they are necessary,‚Äù she said. Touraine is trying to push through health reforms but there have been protests by GPs, hospital doctors and other health workers. The minister said France‚Äôs much-admired but costly health and social security system ‚Äì the latter is deeply in the red ‚Äì needed reorganising not just to make savings but to respond to changing public needs and demands. ‚ÄúThere is a great malaise among GPs but that‚Äôs not my fault. I‚Äôm just the one who is uncovering it, the one saying you have to change the way you work,‚Äù Touraine said. ‚ÄúI think much of the opposition is based on the conservatism and opposition to change that is sometimes characteristic in France.‚Äù She said she was shocked by the virulence and ‚Äúextreme violence‚Äù of the personal attacks, and claimed that ‚Äúinsidious sexism‚Äù lay behind it. ‚ÄúWe have to fight against it permanently but I have never played the [female] victim card and I will not do so. I do think some people believe I will give in more easily because I‚Äôm a woman, and the fact I am determined and strong annoys them even more. But I am not afraid. ‚ÄúI stand up to my responsibilities and I believe that makes me respected in my dealings with the medical unions and even in political circles. People may like me or they may not, but at least I am respected.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-16T14:02:19Z,world,World news,Qatar Airways urged to scrap policy allowing it to sack pregnant cabin crew,"The International Labour Organisation has called on Qatar Airways to scrap contracts that allow it to sack cabin crew members for being pregnant. Following a year-long investigation sparked by complaints by workers at the state-owned airline, the labour arm of the United Nations ruled it discriminated against women by including in employment contracts a clause stating: ‚ÄúThe company reserves the right to automatically terminate your contract as a flying cabin crew member should you become pregnant.‚Äù The ILO said on Tuesday the contract breaches its 57-year-old convention against discrimination at work, which has been ratified by 172 countries. It has also demanded the Doha-based airline review a ban on female cabin crew being dropped off or picked up from work by men other than their brother, father or husband, which Qatar Airways insisted was ‚Äúa cultural norm‚Äù. It has also asked the Qatar government for more evidence about the impact on women of a clause in Qatar Airways workers‚Äô contracts that they must ‚Äúobtain prior permission from the company in case [he or she] wishes to change marital status and get married‚Äù ‚Äì a requirement the airline says has now been dropped. Asked to respond to the ILO‚Äôs findings, Akbar Al Baker, the chief executive of Qatar Airways, accused the organisation of having a ‚Äúvendetta‚Äù against both Qatar and its national airline. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a damn about the ILO ‚Äì I am there to run a successful airline,‚Äù he told Reuters in Paris. ‚ÄúThis is evidence of a vendetta they have against Qatar Airways and my country. My country has responded to the ILO accusations in a very robust way. We clarified the clauses in our contract.‚Äù Eighty per cent of Qatar Airways‚Äô cabin crew are women and about 90% of its staff are migrant workers. The airline said on Monday it made a $103m (¬£66m) profit in the last financial year and announced an order for 14 new Boeing 777 planes valued at almost $4.8bn (¬£3bn). It employs 9,000 cabin crew and sponsors Barcelona, the European club football champions. The case was brought against Qatar by the International Transport Workers‚Äô Federation and the International Trade Union Confederation. The ILO said that since the rights groups reported the allegations of discrimination at Qatar Airways in June 2014, the airline had made changes to contracts but these had not gone far enough.
An earlier contract said women must notify the airline as soon as they know they are pregnant and Qatar Airways would then be free to terminate the contract. Failure to admit to pregnancy or attempts to conceal it would be a breach of contract. The current contract maintains the airline‚Äôs right to terminate pregnant women‚Äôs contracts, but says they can apply for a ground position if available, and the government said it is company policy for its managers to ‚Äúdiligently search for alternative jobs on the ground for pregnant cabin crew. The ILO ruled: ‚ÄúThe provisions ... providing the company with the possibility to automatically terminate the employment of women cabin crew on the sole basis of pregnancy are discriminatory under convention no 111, and should be removed.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis decision is a game-changer,‚Äù said the ITF president, Paddy Crumlin. ‚ÄúA year ago we put Qatar and Qatar Airways in the dock and today it has been proved that we were right to do so. The changes made to the rules for staff failed to fool the ILO. Now the airline must make them for real. It‚Äôs time to make Qatar Airways free from fear.‚Äù Sharan Burrow, the general secretary of the ITUC, said: ‚ÄúThe gaze of world opinion is locked on the behaviour of the Qatari government ‚Äì over Qatar Airways, over its abhorrent treatment of migrant workers, and over the World Cup. In Geneva today, Qatar has been proved wanting. The nation is on trial. It cannot evade its responsibilities. It has to begin to do the right thing.‚Äù The ITF and ITUC told the Geneva-based organisation that since September 2013, serving and former cabin crew have come forward to complain of discrimination by the airline. They said the right to fire pregnant workers has been used on many occasions and that many women felt compelled to resign to avoid the humiliation of dismissal and the right to repatriation assistance by the company. They claimed that in practice there was a bar on marriage during the first three to five years of employment and after that it was at the discretion of the company with any refusal resulting in the employee having to resign in order to get married. The complaints included allegations that mandatory 12-hour rest periods before flights included staff being confined to company premises, restricted from moving from assigned accommodation and a ban on overnight stays away from that accommodation, even when off duty. There were also reports of fire escapes and windows being sealed to prevent employees leaving. Crew members said they were reluctant to submit complaints due to fear of retaliation, possible termination of their contracts and deportation from Qatar. The Qatari government responded by claiming the allegations came from a small group of anonymous people and were based on the earlier contract which has been replaced by new terms, in force since December for all new staff. It said half of the existing crew had already transferred to the new contract and the other half would do in the coming months. It said since the new contract came in, no pregnant cabin crew had left except for personal reasons and a few had taken jobs on the ground. It said there was now no contractual demand that workers request permission to marry. It still insists the prohibition on women being accompanied by men other than their father, brother or husband, was compliant with a Qatari cultural norm.

Speaking in the Greek parliament Alexis Tsipras called on creditors to reassess the IMF‚Äôs insistence on tough cuts as part of the country‚Äôs bailout. ‚ÄúThe time has come for the IMF‚Äôs proposals to be judged not just by us but especially by Europe,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúRight now, what dominates is the IMF‚Äôs harsh views on tough measures, and Europe‚Äôs on denying any discussion over debt viability.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúThe fixation on cuts ... is most likely part of a political plan ... to humiliate an entire people that has suffered in the past five years through no fault of its own.‚Äù Earlier it emerged Greece was threatening to miss this month‚Äôs ‚Ç¨1.6bn debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund this month, in a move that would bring it closer to default and ejection from the euro. ‚ÄúThe government will not pay the IMF, if by the end of the month an agreement hasn‚Äôt been achieved with lenders,‚Äù Alexis Tsipras is reported to have told opposition party leader, Stavros Theodorakis, during talks between the two in Athens today. Eurozone finance ministers meet in Luxembourg on Thursday for what has been billed as the latest ‚Äúlast-chance‚Äù for an agreement, but the negotiating atmosphere is at a nadir since Tsipras came to power in January, talks are at stalemate and hopes of a breakthrough are slim. The eurozone and the European commission said they will only negotiate if Greece tables serious new proposals on fiscal targets, including pensions reforms and liberalisation of the labour market. But Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, said he would not take any new proposals to Luxembourg and challenged the legitimacy of the negotiations. The Greek politician‚Äôs threat of default now raises the game of poker a notch further. ‚ÄúIt was said in the manner of ‚Äúcan‚Äôt pay, won‚Äôt pay,‚Äù a senior member of Theodorakis‚Äô centrist Potami party told the Guardian. ‚ÄúIf there isn‚Äôt an agreement the money simply won‚Äôt be there.‚Äù Other aides quoted Tsipras as saying that in the event of an agreement not being achieved non-payment would be the ‚Äúonly route‚Äù Greece could take. Talks ground to a halt in Brussels last weekend when the Greek team showed up at the commission but no negotiations took place because of irreconcilable positions. Both sides say they are willing to negotiate but are waiting for offers from the other side. Earlier this month, Greece became the first country after Zambia ‚Äì and the first-ever advanced western economy - to miss an IMF payment, resorting to legislation that allows members to ‚Äúbundle up‚Äù loans by paying them in full at the end of the month. Greece‚Äôs current bailout expires on 30 June, the same day it is due to repay the IMF. Without agreement extending the rescue package and freeing up to ‚Ç¨19bn in bailout funds tied to Greek reforms, Athens will run out of cash. The German tabloid Bild reported that the Greek government had discovered a way of deferring the IMF payment until the end of the year. Greek officials denied the report. With the chances of a deal on Thursday fading fast, there was talk in Brussels of convening an emergency eurozone summit between Friday and next Monday. That would suit Tsipras who regularly insists that the crisis should be resolved by political leaders, not technocrats. There is an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday next week. The summit has to grapple with major issues such as David Cameron‚Äôs in/out referendum on the EU, sanctions on Russia, and the Mediterranean refugee emergency. Leaders, especially Angela Merkel, do not want next week‚Äôs summit hijacked by Greece. But that appears inevitable without a breakthrough. Refusing to pay the IMF would not formally put Greece in default on its huge government debts ‚Äì since the IMF is not a commercial lender ‚Äì but it would represent a big step towards that eventuality and open the question as to whether Greece, without an agreement with the eurozone, will be able to redeem more than ‚Ç¨3bn of bonds at the European Central Bank next month. EU leaders are for the first time talking openly about Greek default and its ejection from the euro. Valdis Dombrovskis, vice-president of the European commission, said eurozone leaders were discussing ‚Äúless favourable scenarios‚Äù for Greece, while the Finnish prime minister, Juha Sipila, said an agreement with Greece now would require a miracle. ‚ÄúThe possibility of (Greek) insolvency was discussed in the sidelines of the EU summit last week. Several countries have mentally prepared for it,‚Äù she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-16T13:39:40Z,world,World news,Egyptian court confirms Morsi death sentence over jailbreak during uprising,"An Egyptian court has upheld a death sentence against the ousted president Mohamed Morsi in a trial stemming from his escape from prison during the 2011 uprising that forced Hosni Mubarak from power. Tuesday‚Äôs ruling reaffirms an initial decision in the case in May, in which Morsi and more than 100 others were sentenced to death. In keeping with Egyptian law, the ruling was referred to the grand Mufti, a top religious authority, in advance of Tuesday‚Äôs session. The verdict can still be challenged in Egypt‚Äôs highest appeals court. The outcome underlines the reversal of Egypt‚Äôs political tide since the 2011 revolution that ended Mubarak‚Äôs 30-year rule. Morsi was detained without charge during the initial days of the uprising and fled Egypt‚Äôs Wadi Natroun prison after it was stormed and the guards overpowered. Morsi announced the incident in a call to al-Jazeera and faced no legal consequences for leaving the prison either before or during his tenure as president. If carried out, the death sentences against Morsi and other senior leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood would enrage their supporters who regard the charges and trial as a farce. However, no execution is likely to take place before the appeals court rules on the case. The Muslim Brotherhood described the sentences as ‚Äúnull and void‚Äù and called for a popular uprising on Friday. Before issuing the ruling, the judge Shaban El-Shamy read a lengthy series of remarks detailing what he described as a litany of ills committed by the Muslim Brotherhood, including ‚Äúspreading chaos and seeking to bring down the Egyptian state‚Äù. Prosecutors alleged that Islamist leaders conspired with militants to escape prison. The ruling was issued in a makeshift courtroom in the grounds of a police academy on the outskirts of Cairo. In television footage, Morsi and other defendants appeared inside a metal and glass cage in the courtroom, dressed in colour-coded prison uniforms: white for those awaiting judgment, blue for those sentenced to prison, red for those sentenced to death. In a separate ruling, El-Shamy sentenced Morsi to life in prison, understood in Egypt‚Äôs legal system to mean 25 years, for espionage and colluding with foreign armed groups to commit attacks. The Egyptian military removed Morsi from power in July 2013 following days of mass protest. The military-backed government that followed embarked on a crackdown on Morsi‚Äôs supporters and other political opponents. Tens of thousands have been detained and more than 1,000 killed in the clampdown. The Muslim Brotherhood has been declared a terrorist organisation and most of the group‚Äôs top leaders arrested. Morsi was tried separately on charges of inciting the killing and torture of opposition protesters outside the presidential palace in Cairo during his time in power in 2012. He also faces separate charges of fraud and insulting the judiciary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-16T12:13:58Z,world,World news,Syrian doctors to show the US evidence of Assad√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s use of chemical weapons,"A network of Syrian doctors is due to tell the US Congress that Bashar al-Assad‚Äôs regime is systematically weaponising chlorine to spread fear among civilian populations, in defiance of a recent UN security council resolution. The testimony on Wednesday will be accompanied by a dossier of evidence compiled by the Syrian American Medical Society (Sams), a charity that runs 95 medical facilities inside the country. It documents 31 separate chlorine attacks between 16 March and 9 June. The charity says all the attacks were conducted by launching barrel bombs from helicopters and many targeted civilian areas, leaving 10 dead and at least 530 people seeking medical treatment.
The dossier, which has been seen by the Guardian, provides US lawmakers with data, photos and videos that Sams says were taken in the aftermath of chlorine bombings in a province of Syria recently overrun by militants, including the al-Qaida-affiliated al-Nusra Front. The Guardian has been unable to verify the material, which includes videos and photos of adults and children struggling to breathe, often wearing oxygen masks. Some are retching, while others are being stripped and hosed down to remove chemical residue. Sams also provided the Guardian with a redacted list of basic patient information for 221 people treated for chlorine exposure. According to that list, 57 were under 18.
The lead medical coordinator for Sams in Idlib province, Dr Mohamed Tennari, has flown to Washington DC and has been invited to testify in front of the House foreign affairs committee on Wednesday morning. Tennari will say that although chlorine is less likely to kill than conventional weapons, it has created a ‚Äúnew type of psychological torture‚Äù for the Syrian people. He told the Guardian: ‚ÄúWe would like to see a no-fly zone and increasing help being provided to refugees.‚Äù The Sams data only reflects attacks that have been confirmed by the charity‚Äôs own facilities, and only those taking place in Idlib province. Other activists, including the White Helmets, a volunteer rescue service who will also testify at the hearing, have reported further incidents in the adjoining Hama province. Recent reports suggest that militant forces in Syria, including Isis, are developing a chemical weapons capability of their own. Isis are understood to have used chlorine in Iraq. However, Sams said that all the attacks in their data were launched from helicopters, which are only operated by the Assad regime.
The Syrian president has denied that his forces have deployed chlorine. Although the chemical is widely available, its weaponisation is strictly banned under international law. In an interview with France 2 on 20 April, Assad said there was no proof of chlorine use in attacks on Idlib city. ‚ÄúThis is another fake narrative by the western governments ‚Ä¶ The regular armaments that we have are more influential than chlorine, so we don‚Äôt need it anyway,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt use it. We don‚Äôt need to use it. We have our regular armaments, and we could achieve our goals without it. So, we don‚Äôt use it. No, there‚Äôs no proof.‚Äù Tennari, who set up a field hospital in Sarmin four years ago, will tell US lawmakers that the vast majority of chlorine attacks identified by Sams occur at night. The barrels do not explode. Instead the vapour seeps silently into houses and sinks down into basements where residents are likely to be sheltering from conventional explosives. There the toxic gas can choke its victims as it reacts inside the lungs to produce liquid hydrochloric acid. Tennari told the Guardian that chlorine attacks were being used by the Assad regime to push people out of areas it no longer controlled. ‚ÄúThis is a form of collective punishment by the government,‚Äù he is expected to tell US lawmakers.
He will describe chaotic scenes following the first and largest attack recorded in the dossier, which took place on 16 March, as scores of patients had to be treated with atropine and oxygen. Shortly before the attack, he says he heard helicopters. ‚ÄúAn announcement blared through my walkie-talkie and through mosque speakers of Sarmin that explosive barrel bombs had been dropped. They said that the barrels were filled with poisonous gas; it was a chemical attack.‚Äù As he left his house to head to the hospital, he could smell bleach. ‚ÄúWhen I arrived at the hospital, a wave of people had already begun to arrive. They were all experiencing symptoms of exposure to a choking agent like chlorine gas. Everyone was decontaminated with water before coming into the hospital, and their clothes were taken off of them. Dozens of people had difficulty breathing, with their eyes and throats burning, and many began secreting [fluid] from the mouth.‚Äù He said as he treated those victims, helicopters dropped two further chlorine-filled barrels. Sams reports chlorine bombs landing in both Sarmin and Qaminas that night, leaving 120 people needing treatment. The hospital also recorded that Waref Taleb, a local electrician, was killed along with his wife, 65-year-old mother and three young children when one barrel exploded in their home. Human Rights Watch independently investigated this attack and corroborated these findings. It reported that 30 civilians and 40 rebel fighters were affected in the Qaminas attack alone. Chemical weapons expert Hamish de Bretton-Gordon said he and others working alongside him in Syria had separately confirmed chlorine use from samples taken from the destroyed Taleb family home on 16 March. ‚ÄúI have absolutely no doubt, it was chlorine,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt smelt like chlorine, it looked like chlorine and three different tests said it was chlorine.‚Äù
He added that although chlorine wasn‚Äôt itself considered to be a particularly toxic chemical of war, its psychological impact was devastating. ‚ÄúPeople I know and speak to in Syria are still absolutely terrified by chlorine. I tell them that it is not really that poisonous, but their line is always that ‚Äòwe can hide from bombs and bullets ‚Ä¶ but we can‚Äôt hide from gas‚Äô. And that psychological weapon is I think the key thing why Assad still uses it.‚Äù In recent months there has been increasing momentum within the international community to tackle the issue of chemical weapons use in Syria. On 6 March, the UN security council passed a resolution condemning the use of chlorine as a weapon and threatening action, including possible military action, if such attacks occurred. But it is not clear what steps the security council will take if the regime is found in breach. Although the international body for monitoring chemical weapons, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), is understood to be investigating this latest alleged spate of chlorine attacks, its current mandate from the UN does not allow it to assign blame for such attacks. However, speaking from Camp David a month ago, the US president, Barack Obama, said if the US itself managed to confirm further chlorine use it would ‚Äúonce again work with the international community‚Äù and ‚Äúreach out to patrons of Assad like Russia to put a stop to it‚Äù.

2015-06-16T11:16:46Z,world,World news,Brazil divided over how to deal with its teenage criminals,"Last July, Patricia fatally stabbed a female relative of her then-partner in a confrontation, provoked by what she described as continuous, poisonous innuendo. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt stand it any more,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI took the life of another person.‚Äù She was just 17. A heated debate over whether teenagers who commit violent crimes can be rehabilitated, or should be tried as adults and incarcerated in the country‚Äôs packed and dangerous prisons, has split Brazil. High-profile violent crimes involving adolescents have inflamed the issue and polarised opinion around a controversial measure in congress to lower the age of criminal responsibility from 18 to 16. A vote is planned this month. Elisa Rodrigues, director of the Aldaci Barbosa Mota youth detention centre in Fortaleza where Patricia ‚Äì whose name has been changed for legal reasons ‚Äì is jailed, said Patricia understands the damage she caused and is suffering with the separation from her two-year-old son, Nicolas. ‚ÄúThe person she killed had a serious involvement in drugs,‚Äù Rodrigues said.
Although economic growth in Ceara, a state in Brazil‚Äôs north-east, outperforms that of the country as a whole, murder rates in Fortaleza more than doubled in the 10 years ending in 2012, reaching 76.8 per 100,000 people, according to the Violence Map produced by the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences. Fortaleza was listed as the eighth-most violent city in the world in 2014 in a report by Security, Justice and Peace, a Mexican nongovernmental organisation. Under current Brazilian law, teenage offenders like Patricia are detained for a maximum of three years at ‚Äúeducational centres‚Äù to be ‚Äúre-socialised‚Äù. ‚ÄúNo one can change what has passed. But I can change my tomorrow,‚Äù said Patricia, now 18, who takes academic, school, beauty and dance classes. ‚ÄúI can become a better person.‚Äù In an April poll by the Datafolha polling institute, 87% of respondents supported the proposal to reduce the age of criminal majority. Pepper spray was used on protesters demonstrating against it in congress last week. ‚ÄúOur primitive leftists think that murder is the eve of redemption,‚Äù rightwing columnist Reinaldo Azevedo wrote in the Folha de S Paulo newspaper. Opponents counter that throwing teenagers into Brazil‚Äôs notoriously brutal and overcrowded adult prisons, where criminal gangs rule, riots are common and decapitations are not unheard of, is no solution ‚Äì even if convicted adolescents serve time in separate prisons or units. ‚ÄúReducing the age of penal majority will not resolve the problem of juvenile delinquency,‚Äù President Dilma Rousseff wrote on her Facebook page in April. Her government may support a counterproposal to increase the maximum adolescent detention to 10 years. Black-clad police Swat teams patrol Fortaleza streets in groups of four: three ride motorbikes, and one with an automatic rifle rides on the back of one of the bikes. On a recent afternoon they arrested two teenage boys on a motorbike who had just held up a motorcycle shop.
The battered .38-caliber revolver used in the holdup was dropped on to officer Rachel Moreira‚Äôs desk at the city‚Äôs Child and Adolescent Police Station. ‚ÄúThe most everyday infractions are robberies with the use of weapons,‚Äù she said, locking it in a filing cabinet. She said that reducing the penal age alone would not have an impact on crime levels and that wider changes to the law are needed. ‚ÄúThese people of 16, 17 years are aware of the crime,‚Äù countered her deputy, officer Emerson de Sousa, who supports the age reduction. Soldier Xavier, one of the arresting officers, said that more education, not reduction, is what‚Äôs needed. In Ceara, about 31% of violent crimes are committed by adolescents, the Folha de S Paulo newspaper calculated from state government figures. ‚ÄúThe motivation is drugs,‚Äù said Manuel Cl√≠stenes, chief judge at Fortaleza‚Äôs childhood and juvenile court. Brazil‚Äôs crack cocaine epidemic has hit Fortaleza hard. Marijuana is cheap and widely used. Adulterated cocaine has flooded poorer neighbourhoods. Offenders are generally from the lowest social classes. ‚ÄúThere is always the criteria of [abandonment]. Rarely does an individual come who has a mother and father, from the middle class,‚Äù Cl√≠stenes said. Casa do Menor is a nongovernmental organisation that houses teenage boys with drug problems in one of its centres in Ceara. Pablo, 12, whose name has been changed for legal reasons, was its only resident on a recent morning. He said his mother, a crack addict, had died with a ‚Äúlung full of ashes, sick‚Äù. She was pregnant. ‚ÄúThe majority of my family is of this world,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFor someone to enter is easy, you can go in, you can buy drugs. But to get out? You stay.‚Äù Pablo had lived on the street, dealt drugs, and used a knife and gun in assaults at a Fortaleza beach, he said. Now he wanted to clean up. ‚ÄúI cried when I came here,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEveryone received me well.‚Äù The Rev Renato Chiera, an Italian priest, founded Casa do Menor in Nova Iguacu, near Rio de Janeiro, in 1986 to shelter local homeless children threatened by vigilantes. Adolescents such as Pablo need psychological and spiritual treatment, Cheira said, not jail. ‚ÄúThe narco-traffic has become the refuge for these kids,‚Äù he said. But rehabilitating teenage drug users is a long, difficult process. In April, the centre‚Äôs other five residents escaped to buy crack, cocaine and marijuana. They assaulted a bus using weapons they had fashioned out of metal and wire. Afterward, they sought out one of the centre‚Äôs workers, frightened of the consequences of what they had done. Four are back with their families. The fifth was killed by a dealer. Cl√≠stenes advocated changes in the law applying to children and teenagers, with longer detention for serious crimes and older and repeat offenders. In a letter to congressional leaders and Rousseff, Human Rights Watch said that reducing the age of criminal majority would violate international treaties signed by Brazil, such as the UN convention on the rights of the child. The letter quoted a US justice department bulletin citing research suggesting that trying teenagers as adults in the United States had led to higher levels of re-offending. ‚ÄúThe solution is not to send them to adult prison,‚Äù said Maria Laura Canineu, Human Rights Watch‚Äôs Brazil director. ‚ÄúThis will give them a certificate in crime.‚ÄùOn a recent afternoon, 187 boys were locked in their cells at Fortaleza‚Äôs S√£o Miguel educational centre, which has a capacity of 60. Cells with concrete beds for four housed up to a dozen on grubby mattresses on the floor. Inmates shared more stories of the violence sweeping Brazilian society ‚Äì an armed mugging, a knifing death the perpetrator said was self-defence. According to government estimates, fewer than 8% of Brazil‚Äôs homicides are solved ‚Äì a fundamental problem that reducing the age of criminal majority is unlikely to change.

2015-06-16T11:14:19Z,world,World news,"'By letting Omar ‚Äãal-‚ÄãBashir escape, ‚ÄãSouth Africa‚Äã had sided with tyrants'","Something much greater than just South Africa‚Äôs reputation as a human rights leader on the African continent died on Monday. When Sudan‚Äôs President Omar al-Bashir was allowed to escape the country in a private jet ‚Äì in defiance of a domestic court order and international law ‚Äì Nelson Mandela‚Äôs democracy stood in solidarity with the Big Men of the African Union, who have declared the international criminal court (ICC) a racist organisation that targets Africans for trial. The events unfolded like a John le Carr√© novel: just minutes before South Africa‚Äôs president Jacob Zuma delivered his opening address on Sunday to the African Union summit in the glitzy Sandton Convention Centre in Johannesburg, the Pretoria High Court ordered that the government should ensure that Bashir could not leave the country. But incredibly, the government managed to ‚Äúlose‚Äù the Sudanese president, insisting for hours after he took off at 11.46am on Monday that it did not know whether he had left or not, claiming that he may have gone shopping.
Bashir was indicted in 2009 by the ICC for alleged genocide and war crimes in Darfur. Allowing him to escape was a kick in the face of the 400,000 people who have died in the ongoing conflict ‚Äì and the 2.5 million who have been displaced. Over the past few years pressure from African leaders criticising the ICC has grown, with many claiming its cases target African leaders only. In December Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power since 1986, said the ICC was a ‚Äútool to target‚Äù Africa. Rwanda‚Äôs president Paul Kagame has accused the court of ‚Äúselective‚Äù justice. This is in some sense true: since its establishment in 2002, the ICC has heard 22 cases and indicted 32 individuals. All of them are African. South Africa, though a signatory to the Rome Statute through which the court was established, has lately joined this chorus, with the governing ANC saying on Saturday: ‚ÄúThe ICC is no longer useful for the purposes for which it was intended ‚Äì being a court of last resort for the prosecution of crimes against humanity.‚Äù While this stance may have endeared the country to the rest of the African Union ‚Äì where it seeks to be a significant player ‚Äì it reveals a troubling contradiction: signatory to the Statute on the one hand, while flirting with those who seek to defy its precepts on the other. But this isn‚Äôt the first time the country has displayed its ambivalence towards the ICC: in 2010 South Africa invited Bashir to the now scandal-mired World Cup, attracting plaudits from some on the continent and gaining street cred for shaking its fist at the west.
Big men Many South Africans aren‚Äôt surprised by the weekend‚Äôs events. Over the past seven years the country has sided with the dodgiest leaders in the world in the name of ‚Äúthe national interest‚Äù. The authorities have refused the Dalai Lama a visa to enter South Africa at the invitation of Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other Nobel laureates at least three times at the behest of China, with whom we have signed a 10-year agreement pledging ‚Äúpolitical mutual trust and strategic co-ordination‚Äù, while President Zuma is having a full-on bromance with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, remaining silent about the Kremin‚Äôs alleged assassination of opposition politicians. Robert Mugabe, accused of the murder of thousands of his own citizens in the 1980s and the torture of many more in the 2000s, was wined and dined on a state visit here a few months ago. And Bashir? South Africa has defended him since the ICC issued its first warrant for his arrest in 2009, under the guise of building ties with the African Union. In effect, the South African government has broken its own laws and acted in defiance of a court order. A government lawyer, William Mokhari, told the court that Bashir‚Äôs departure will be fully investigated. But that is academic. The government did nothing to arrest him. Politically, this much we know: by protecting Bashir and letting him escape, our country has openly taken sides with the Africa‚Äôs tyrants, and not their victims.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-16T11:08:33Z,world,World news,Ex-Ukip Janice Atkinson joins Le Pen-led EU group,"A former Ukip MEP has defected from Nigel Farage‚Äôs European parliamentary group to join a new far-right alliance led by the French Front National (FN) Marine Le Pen. Janice Atkinson, who represents the south-east of England, praised the ‚Äúgreat courage and leadership‚Äù of Le Pen as she became vice-president of the new group, Europe of Nations and Freedom, enabling it to qualify for millions of euros in public funding.
Atkinson was expelled from Ukip before the election over allegations that a member of her staff tried to inflate an expenses bill, less than a year after she was elected for the party. She had previously got into hot water for referring to a Thai Ukip supporter as a ‚Äúting-tong from somewhere‚Äù, forcing Farage to apologise and make a personal visit to the constituent. However, Atkinson was still allowed to remain a member of Farage‚Äôs Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD) group, until the news broke on Tuesday that she was switching to Le Pen‚Äôs new alliance. In a statement, Atkinson said it was a ‚Äúhistoric day for all in Britain and across Europe who stand opposed to the European superstate‚Äù. ‚ÄúOur co-president Marine Le Pen, leader of the first party of France, has shown great courage and leadership in advancing this movement across Europe,‚Äù Atkinson said. ‚ÄúShe now takes her rightful place at the front of the European Parliament in opposition to the Brussels cartel.‚Äù The move will be embarrassing for Farage, who last year stressed that he would not take Ukip into any alliance with the FN, despite their common anti-EU cause, because of ‚Äúprejudice and anti-Semitism‚Äù in the French party.
A spokesman for Farage‚Äôs EFDD group said: ‚ÄúFormer Tory Janice Atkinson has been expelled from Ukip in March and suspended from the EFDD Group in the European parliament. Whatever she does is beyond our control.‚Äù The new group is expected to be formed of 36 MEPs, mostly from Le Pen‚Äôs FN, but also from the Dutch anti-Islam Party for Freedom, led by Geert Wilders, the Freedom Party of Austria, Lega Nord from Italy and Vlaams Belang from Belgium. Catherine Bearder, the Liberal Democrat MEP, said it was a ‚Äúdisgraceful decision‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe people of the south-east region she represents will undoubtedly be shocked by this move,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúJanice Atkinson should do the honourable thing and resign, not prop up a group of Europe‚Äôs most hateful and far-right parties.‚Äù According to research by think tank Open Europe, based on 38 MEPs, the new group could apply for funding worth around ‚Ç¨17.5m over the remaining four years of the parliament.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-16T09:33:47Z,world,World news,US drone strike kills Yemen al-Qaida leader Nasir al-Wuhayshi,"Al-Qaida‚Äôs most powerful franchise has announced the death of its leader, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, in a US air strike in Yemen, the latest blow to the global jihadi organisation. The killing of Wuhayshi, nicknamed Abu Basir and one of al-Qaida‚Äôs most charismatic leaders, was confirmed in a video statement by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). The group, which is engaged in fierce fighting in Yemen with domestic opponents, is under relentless pressure from US drone strikes. Its influence appears to be waning in terms of global jihad with the advances of its rival Islamic State.
‚ÄúOur Islamic nation, this was one of your champions and leaders,‚Äù said AQAP official Khaled Batarfi in the statement, which said Wuhayshi was killed along with two other militants. ‚ÄúIn our time ‚Ä¶ the leaders of jihad have been killed. But the blood of these leaders has only increased the insistence on jihad.‚Äù Arab media reports earlier said three suspected al-Qaida members were killed on 9 June in an apparent US drone strike in Mukalla, a south-eastern port city in Yemen.
Batarfi said Qassim al-Raimi, nicknamed Abu Hurayra and a military commander in AQAP, was elected by the group‚Äôs leadership council to succeed Wuhayshi. He said many of the council members were able to meet and pledge allegiance to the new leader, despite security concerns and the fact the group was fighting on 11 fronts with Houthi rebels and their allies in Yemen. Wuhayshi, once a fighter in Afghanistan, accompanied Osama bin Laden in the caves of Tora Bora as thei fled the US invasion in 2001, and was his secretary and close aide. He has been involved in fighting the Americans since the 1990s. After spending time in prison in Yemen, he escaped and helped found AQAP in 2009, rising to the leadership of the group. Under Wuhayshi, the group helped maintain a semblance of influence for al-Qaida‚Äôs central leadership by refusing to pledge allegiance to the leader of Isis, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, when he declared the founding of a caliphate last year. In a video released in November, AQAP‚Äôs chief cleric, Harith al-Nadhari, rejected the caliphate declaration and renewed the group‚Äôs allegiance to al-Qaida and its leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, urging an end to the discord between the jihadi franchises. Washington considers AQAP a threat and has pursued a policy of drone strikes against the group in Yemen even as the country descended into chaos during a Saudi-led air campaign to stem the advance of Houthi rebels, who belong to the Zaydi sect of Shia Islam and who seized the capital, Sana‚Äôa, last year. The violence has allowed the group to advance in Yemen‚Äôs eastern provinces. AQAP considers the Houthis apostates. AQAP has claimed responsibility for a number of terrorist attacks against western targets. The gunmen who carried out the massacre at the offices of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in January are thought to have trained with the group, and AQAP said it was responsible for a failed attempt to bomb a transatlantic flight on Christmas Day 2009, involving the ‚Äúunderwear bomber‚Äù Umar Farouk Abdulmutallib. Wuhayshi was born on 1 October 1976 and was designated Zawahiri‚Äôs second-in-command in 2013. The US had offered a bounty of up to $10m for information leading to his arrest, putting him in the same echelon as IBaghdadi and Sirajuddin Haqqani, the leader of the Haqqani network, who is believed to be based in Pakistan. Wuhayshi‚Äôs last known major video release was in the spring of 2014, showing him along with AQAP militants who had broken out of prison in Sana‚Äôa. He threatened in the video to retaliate against the US, saying al-Qaida had to ‚Äúremove the cross, the bearer of the cross, America‚Äù. The defiance of the hundreds of AQAP members gathered in the video raised concerns that the group was growing in strength despite continuing US drone strikes. This year AQAP denied it was involved in two suicide bombings in Houthi mosques in Yemen that were claimed by Isis, reflecting the attempts by the group to distance itself from its more extreme jihadi rival. Reports of Wuhayshi‚Äôs death emerged as representatives of the Houthi rebels arrived in Geneva for UN-brokered talks aimed at finding a resolution to the ongoing crisis in Yemen and the Saudi-led coalition bombing campaign, which has lasted two and a half months. A militant group in Libya appeared to deny reports that a US strike had killed a jihadi leader linked to al-Qaida. Libya‚Äôs recognised government had claimed that Mokhtar Belmokhtar, charged by the US with leading a deadly attack on a gas plant in Algeria in 2013, was killed in an American air strike over the weekend. The US confirmed it had targeted Belmokhtar, but did not confirm his death. The Ansar al-Sharia militant group released a statement on Twitter that did not include a name resembling Belmokhtar‚Äôs on a list of seven people it said had died in the attack. ‚ÄúWhile we eulogise these heroes ‚Ä¶ we deny the killing of any other personalities besides those whom we have named who are sons of this land [Libya],‚Äù the statement said. Reuters, which reported the statement, said it could not verify its authenticity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-16T09:24:26Z,world,World news,What will Hong Kong's political reform vote mean?,"After 18 months of protest and debate, lawmakers in Hong Kong are to vote on a Beijing-backed plan for political reform that opponents have condemned as ‚Äúfake democracy‚Äù. What is at stake? On Wednesday members of Hong Kong‚Äôs parliament ‚Äì better known as the legislative council or legco ‚Äì will debate and then vote on a political reform package that would change the way in which the former colony‚Äôs leader is chosen. Since Hong Kong returned to Chinese hands in 1997, its mayor-like chief executive has been chosen by a 1,200-strong ‚Äúelection committee‚Äù whose members are largely pro-Beijing. The proposal now being put forward by Chinese officials would allow Hong Kong‚Äôs citizens to vote for their leader for the first time, something Beijing says proves it honoured a commitment to bring universal suffrage to the former colony. ‚ÄúIt is a big leap in our democratic development,‚Äù Holden Chow, a pro-Beijing lawmaker, told the New York Times. However, pro-democracy activists and lawmakers say the Communist party‚Äôs plan is nothing but ‚Äúfake democracy‚Äù. Under the new rules voters would only be able to cast ballots for two or three candidates who had been screened by a ‚Äúnominating committee‚Äù that is likely to be heavily stacked with Communist party loyalists. That would give Beijing effective control over who can and cannot run for office. Beijing‚Äôs manoeuvrings showed ‚ÄúHong Kong citizens could not believe the promise made by the Communist party of China any more‚Äù, said Nathan Law, a prominent student leader. ‚ÄúThe central government‚Äôs credibility has dropped to zero.‚Äù When will the vote take place? Hong Kong‚Äôs government will put the reform package to the territory‚Äôs 70-strong parliament on Wednesday with a vote likely to take place on Thursday or Friday. For the proposals to go through two-thirds, or 47, of those lawmakers must vote for it. Recent polls suggest Hong Kong‚Äôs 7 million residents are more or less evenly split over the proposals. Will the proposals get through? On the eve of the vote, senior Chinese officials are privately confident that their reforms will be approved, Reuters reported last week. However, the general consensus is that they will not be passed. Hong Kong‚Äôs 27 pro-democracy lawmakers have publicly vowed to vote against the package. It can only be approved if at least four of them have a last-minute change of heart. ‚ÄúThe question is: are really these four or five local moderates or pan-democrats going to be able to hold the line?‚Äù said Suzanne Pepper, a Hong Kong-based writer whose blog focuses on the former colony‚Äôs democratic transition. ‚ÄúI think they will ‚Äì but I‚Äôm not entirely certain.‚Äù Martin Lee, a veteran activist, said pro-democracy lawmakers would not dare to go back on their word. ‚ÄúThat would mean [they had] betrayed the voters who elected them in 2012 on the basis of the platform which is for genuine democracy, not this sort of democracy,‚Äù he said. What happens if the reforms are voted down? Pro-Beijing academics and newspapers have warned of dire consequences should the government‚Äôs plans be thwarted. ‚ÄúHong Kong‚Äôs society would be badly torn apart and the good environment for economic development would therefore be destroyed,‚Äù warned an editorial in the People‚Äôs Daily, the Communist party‚Äôs official mouthpiece. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong‚Äôs number two official, this week painted a bleak picture of the risks. ‚ÄúFor a start, our democratic development would come to a standstill. The community and legislature would remain divided,‚Äù she wrote in the South China Morning Post this week. ‚ÄúIn the end, all Hong Kong people would suffer.‚Äù However, blocking the package would represent a major triumph for Hong Kong‚Äôs notoriously division-prone democracy movement. ‚ÄúThe vote is very important because it would be the time that Hong Kong has simply turned back and said no to something that Beijing has decreed,‚Äù said Pepper. ‚ÄúThis of course is the thing that Beijing does not want to have to tolerate: that someone has defied its sovereign authority. Beijing ‚Ä¶ have tried to maintain the Communist style of rule here and they have tried to impose it and if they vote no it will be very significant. It will be Hong Kong saying no to Beijing‚Äôs type of rule.‚Äù Could there be a repeat of last year‚Äôs protests if the package is approved?
Student leaders and members of Hong Kong‚Äôs pro-democracy camp say new demonstrations are likely and warn of the threat of violence if the government does manage to push its package of reforms through. ‚ÄúThere will be riots,‚Äù said Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker, admitting, however, that many in Hong Kong had ‚Äúprotest fatigue‚Äù after last year‚Äôs 79-day umbrella movement demonstrations. ‚ÄúSocial order will be further affected and social management will prove more difficult,‚Äù said Law. On Tuesday, after 10 people were arrested for allegedly plotting to set off explosives around Hong Kong, CY Leung, the chief executive, warned: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt tolerate any kind or any form of illegal activity whether they are non-violent or violent.‚Äù Some violence was possible but the more long-lasting consequence would be a bitter and potentially fatal civil war within the pro-democracy movement. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs approved all hell will break loose. It will be unpleasant to watch,‚Äù said Pepper. ‚ÄúWhat it will do is further split the democratic movement. If it is passed it might well mean the end of the democracy movement here. Because it will just fly off into even more factionalism and factional infighting than we see now.‚Äù Additional reporting by Luna Lin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-16T09:04:46Z,world,World news,A new chapter ‚Äì how an Oxfam shop is giving refugees a helping hand,"Squashed between Riley‚Äôs bingo bar and a salon selling extravagant hair extensions, the Oxfam book and music shop in Swansea bulges with stories of journeys. The display is full of travel books ‚Äì Italy for the gourmand, Wainwright walking guides ‚Äì but the travel theme runs much deeper than the window. Refugees and asylum seekers make up about a third of the shop‚Äôs workforce; there are volunteers here from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Syria, Pakistan, Ukraine and more. Sharmin Fattahi, who is 18, works the Tuesday afternoon shift, filling bags with the ragtag books that no one wants. He is one of eight members of the shop‚Äôs volunteer staff to have sought asylum in Britain and been ‚Äúdispersed‚Äù, as the terminology has it, to Swansea. He made the journey here from Tehran with his mother Farzaneh, an artist, who also volunteers here. It sounds like a long story, but Sharmin says only ‚Äúlorry‚Äù. He thinks the journey began last November, and probably took around two weeks. He can‚Äôt be sure, because there wasn‚Äôt time to think about it. ‚ÄúLeft everything,‚Äù he says, plucking a film book from a crate. His sentences break into small pieces, mostly two words each, as if he is still putting everything, language included, back together after the trip.
‚ÄúMost there was darkness. Just I want time to pass,‚Äù he says. There were murmurings from passengers he could not see in languages he did not understand. Sharmin and his mother ‚Äútalked little bits. Not too noisy.‚Äù He sat beside her, giving her hugs when she felt cold. ‚ÄúThe lorry was almost a freezer. Not a freezer, a fridge.‚Äù Sitting in the back room amid the teetering towers of books, with the kettle happily bubbling and the chocolates being passed around, it is easy to see why this shop is so important to those who work here. It casts them immediately in a different relationship with the outside world. Instead of needing help, they are giving help ‚Äì to customers ‚Äì and all for a good cause. In the shop, they are knowledgeable insiders. The benefits can be practical as well as emotional. When, for instance, George William, a volunteer from Pakistan, was removed to a detention centre in 2007, 3,000 customers signed the petition for his family‚Äôs release. It soon followed. William‚Äôs son went on to marry a local woman; William is now a grandfather. Nadia Ahmed, another volunteer, travelled from Sudan to Swansea three years ago to join her husband, who was already a refugee here. ‚ÄúFighting,‚Äù she explains grimly. In Nyala, in South Darfur, she had been doing human rights work. But when she arrived in Wales, three years ago, the only English she knew was ‚ÄúHello‚Äù and the correct reply to ‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù, which she wrote down as prompts in a notebook. After a fortnight in the shop, her English is advancing. She sees this as a first step into the world of work. ‚ÄúGive me experience,‚Äù she says. Perhaps she, like so many volunteers here, will travel the three miles east to Amazon‚Äôs giant fulfilment centre and the world of paid employment. Oxfam Castle Street is the sorting office for book banks across south Wales, which is why several slatted structures, like giant compost bins, rise behind Nadia, almost to the ceiling. They are full of bags for bulk sale, many of which have been thrown up there by the strong arms of fellow volunteer Alexi, a Russian agronomist, who came to Swansea seeking asylum after working as a builder in London. ‚ÄúI was really excited,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúCity very nice. Sea views. Lighthouse. I never had a chance to live in a quiet and peaceful place.‚Äù Others are more ambivalent. When the doors of Sharmin‚Äôs lorry opened and daylight poured in, Sharmin‚Äôs mother Farzaneh was ecstatic to see they had reached England. ‚ÄúBut for me not,‚Äù he says. Despite all the danger, and the fact he and his mother have been granted refugee status ‚Äì they share three rooms and ¬£70 a week of living costs ‚Äì he hesitates to say that leaving Tehran ‚Äúwas a good choice‚Äù. ‚ÄúI still not sure,‚Äù he says. ‚Äú‚ÄôCause, you know, I‚Äôve lost too many things. Money. Good life. Friends. Studying. Everything. My film and music studio.‚Äù In Tehran, he planned to start a degree in industrial design. In Britain, he will have to take A-levels. In Tehran, he ‚Äúhad found my cast ‚Äì my friends who match with me‚Äù. In Swansea, even with his work at Oxfam Castle Street, he is ‚Äúyounger than anyone else, my interests are different. Honestly. No friends yet,‚Äù he says. What Sharmin does get from the shop is a sort of cultural embrace. He is really here for the books and the music. And the conversations about music with the shop‚Äôs manager, Phil Broadhurst, 49, who, in his youth, put together a gig guide in Reading and hung out in the town‚Äôs Caribbean Club. Broadhurst likes ‚Äúobscure reggae‚Äù to Sharmin‚Äôs prog rock (he hopes one day to flip through all the Perry Como records and find Camel‚Äôs 1974 album Mirage). Broadhurst‚Äôs policy of inclusivity is about being ‚Äúopen to everybody, because the more people you‚Äôre open to, the more good people you‚Äôll meet‚Äù. In recognition of his commitment to inclusivity, last year the shop became the first retailer in Britain to receive a national City of Sanctuary award. Clearly, providing a warm welcome to refugees and asylum seekers fits with Oxfam‚Äôs mission, but, more than anything, it is Broadhurst‚Äôs creed that is played out in this shop. He says this openness began for him aged 11 when he came across his first non-white fellow pupil, and went home after school laughing at his name. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find out he‚Äôs just the same as everyone else,‚Äù his older brother sagely counselled. Sure enough, the two became best friends, and, in some ways, Broadhurst, nearly 40 years on, is still applying the lesson he learned that day. It enriched his life, and the lives of countless others. Beyond the benefits of working with Broadhurst, there is one more perk to working in this particular Oxfam shop. ‚ÄúI take plenty of books about fishing,‚Äù Alexi says. Broadhurst looks troubled by this revelation. Loaning stock to staff is not official Oxfam policy. But Broadhurst is kind. And the books come back. Sharmin borrows anything on film. Nadia, who hopes for a council house because her rooms are damp, has borrowed a book on home improvement. Bogdan, from Ukraine, takes all the half-finished Sudoku books the shop cannot sell, while Farzaneh takes broken books and loose leaves and uses them in her art. For months after she arrived, she could not paint. But these snippets and scraps have given her ideas, and this week the shop is holding an exhibition of her work: Farzaneh Yousefi, the Swansea era.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-16T09:00:03Z,world,World news,"Danish elections 2015: a guide to the parties, candidates and electoral system","Denmark heads to the polls on Thursday to elect 179 members of the Folketing, the country‚Äôs parliament. It will be the country‚Äôs first summer election in 95 years, and the first June vote since 1903. The Danish parliament sits in Christiansborg Palace, also known as Borgen, which in Danish means ‚Äúthe castle‚Äù.
Denmark‚Äôs voting system Denmark has had a unicameral (single-chamber) parliament since 1953. (Prior to that the Folketing was the lower house of a bicameral parliament. This was amended following a constitutional referendum.) The parliament has 179 members: 175 are elected in Denmark, two in the Faroe Island and two in Greenland. The country is divided into 10 multi-member constituencies (which in turn are divided into districts). Each constituency is assigned a set number of seats. A total of 135 seats are distributed in proportion to the votes in each constituency. The other 40 seats are supplementary, and allotted to balance any difference between district-level results and the nationwide vote share. This is meant to ensure that the number of seats each party secures matches as closely as possible each party‚Äôs vote share, in accordance with Denmark‚Äôs constitution which requires not only regional representation but ‚Äúequal representation of the various opinions of the electorate‚Äù. Simply put, if a party wins 20% of the vote it should have about 20% of the seats in parliament. There is a 2% threshold to enter parliament (unless a party wins a constituency seat, in which case it would enter parliament even if it hasn‚Äôt met the threshold. This is unlikely in practice as winning a constituency seat would most probably mean that a party has won more than 2% of the vote nationally). The threshold is low compared with most other countries. Germany, for example, has a 5% threshold, Sweden 4% and Turkey 10%.
The political parties Denmark‚Äôs voting system makes it near impossible for a single party to win an outright majority. No party has won one since 1903. This means that governments in Denmark tend to be coalitions, often even minority alliances with parliamentary support from other parties. The constitution allows for a government to rule without winning a vote of confidence, as long as it doesn‚Äôt lose a no-confidence vote. Denmark has a lot of political parties in comparison with the UK, where a less representative electoral system is used. Broadly speaking the parties can be divided into two main blocs: a red bloc on the left of the political spectrum, and a blue bloc to the right of centre. The main parties in the red bloc are: The Social Democrats (A), led by the incumbent prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Radikale, the Danish Social Liberal party (B). Leader: Morten √òstergaard. The leftwing Socialist People‚Äôs party (F). Leader: Pia Olsen Dyhr. The socialist Red-Green Alliance (√ò). The Alternative (√Ö), a green party founded in 2013. And in the blue bloc: The centre-right Venstre (V), currently the main opposition party. Led by Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen. The rightwing Danish People‚Äôs party (O). Leader: Kristian Thulesen Dahl. The Liberal Alliance (I). Leader: Anders Samuelsen. The Conservative People‚Äôs party (C). Leader: S√∏ren Pape Poulsen. The Christian Democrats (K). Leader: Stig Grenov. The 2011 election At the last election, Venstre won the most votes (26.7%) and seats (47). However, the incumbent centre-right coalition lost power to the centre-left because the red bloc emerged as the larger of the two groups in parliament. It won 50.2% of the Danish vote, which translated into 89 seats against the blue bloc‚Äôs 86.
Including seats from the Faroe Islands and Greenland, the final tally for the parties supporting the Social Democrat leader Thorning-Schmidt was 92 seats, while the parties backing the outgoing PM Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen secured 87. Thorning-Schmidt went on to form a minority coalition with the Social Liberal party and the Socialist People‚Äôs party and became Denmark‚Äôs first female prime minister. At the more recent European parliament election, in 2014, the People‚Äôs party won the most MEPs, followed by the Social Democrats and Venstre. The Danish electorate is highly engaged Denmark has one of the highest levels of voter turnout in the world. The proportion of the electorate who voted was 87.7% in 2011, 86.6% in 2007), 84.5% in 2005 and 87.2% in 2001.
The candidates There are 799 candidates standing in this election, of whom 31% are women and 69% are men. Radikale and the Conservative People‚Äôs party have the most female candidates with 40% and 38% respectively. The most common male candidate names are Anders, Henrik and S√∏ren (14 candidates each), and the most common female name is Helle (nine candidates) followed by Anne (eight). Of the current group of MPs, 38% are women. Among EU members, only Sweden, Finland, Spain and Belgium have more women in parliament.
What do the polls say? Pre-election polls suggest the two main blocs are virtually tied. This year‚Äôs election could turn out to be a reversal of 2011: the Social Democrats may well emerge as the largest party, but the centre-right bloc could have the numbers to form a government.
If the seat distribution is as tight as the polls suggest, the four seats in Greenland and the Faroe Islands could prove decisive. But as always with polling, the usual note of caution applies. Remember another recent European election where the race was too close to call? Polling stations open at 9am and close at 8pm. Exit polls are published after voting closes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-16T07:01:59Z,world,World news,"China must grant Hong Kong genuine democracy, says activist on eve of vote","The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, must prove to the world he is a reformer by granting Hong Kong genuine democracy, a leading activist has said on the eve of a highly contentious vote on the former British colony‚Äôs political future. Martin Lee, the founding chairman of Hong Kong‚Äôs Democratic party, said he believed pro-democracy lawmakers would reject a Beijing-backed ‚Äúpolitical reform package‚Äù governing the 2017 election of Hong Kong‚Äôs chief executive when they convened to discuss it on Wednesday. Under the plans, Hong Kong‚Äôs citizens would be able to vote for their future leaders ‚Äì but only after candidates had been approved by a pro-Beijing ‚Äúnominating committee‚Äù. ‚ÄúThis is not genuine universal suffrage. The people of Hong Kong are given the vote but they select all the candidates. This is rotten. This is totally unacceptable,‚Äù Lee said, urging China‚Äôs president to scrap the proposals. ‚ÄúWhat better thing can Xi Jinping do than to show the world that he is a reformer and how better to show it than by giving Hong Kong democracy which was already promised?
‚ÄúI see hope in him and if I‚Äôm right then the whole world will applaud. If I‚Äôm wrong then that is going to be terrible,‚Äù he added. But with hours to go before Hong Kong‚Äôs parliament meets to vote on the package, a sudden about-turn from the Communist party is unthinkable. ‚ÄúI am one of the very few people who are optimistic,‚Äù admitted Lee. Beijing has refused to modify its controversial plans ‚Äì originally unveiled last August ‚Äì despite mass demonstrations and a 79-day occupation of Hong Kong‚Äôs financial heart during last year‚Äôs Umbrella movement. The blueprint, which if approved would come into effect in 2017, was ‚Äúfeasible, rational and pragmatic‚Äù, Hong Lei, a spokesperson for Beijing‚Äôs ministry of foreign affairs, said last week. The 70 members of Hong Kong‚Äôs parliament will be given the choice of supporting or rejecting a bill that supporters say is a vital step towards universal suffrage but detractors label ‚Äúfake democracy‚Äù. At least four of its 27 pro-democracy lawmakers need to switch sides for the package to be approved. Senior officials in Hong Kong and Beijing ‚Äúbelieved intense backroom lobbying would crack unity‚Äù among that group, Reuters reported last week. Rumours have been swirling for months about possible incentives ‚Äì including financial ones ‚Äì the Communist party might have offered to lure pro-democracy politicians to its side, said Suzanne Pepper, a political writer and blogger. ‚ÄúThe truth is nobody knows. You just assume that things are going on,‚Äù she said. However, on the eve of the vote ‚Äì which is likely to take place on Thursday or Friday ‚Äì experts and pro-democracy lawmakers said the most likely outcome was the package‚Äôs defeat. ‚ÄúInitially, I thought that they would buckle, that the pan-democrats would not be able to hold to their vow of vetoing it. Now, increasingly, it looks like they do mean to hold the line on that,‚Äù said Pepper. Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker, said: ‚ÄúI am 101% confident that the democrats in Hong Kong will veto this so-called political reform package. I have made a solemn promise that I will vote it down.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe all know that keeping the status quo is not ideal but as of now it is the best thing to do,‚Äù Mo added. ‚ÄúWe just want to make sure that things don‚Äôt get worse in Hong Kong.‚Äù But Tian Feilong, a law professor at Beijing‚Äôs Beihang University who has criticised the plan‚Äôs opponents, said the vote represented ‚Äúthe first time Hong Kong has a chance to achieve universal suffrage‚Äù. ‚ÄúAt the moment, the odds for the package being voted through or voted down are 50/50,‚Äù he said. Lee predicted a furious reaction if pro-democracy lawmakers ‚Äúbetrayed‚Äù their electorate by caving in to Beijing at the last minute. ‚ÄúAfter the ‚Äòumbrella movement‚Äô, young people will certainly not accept this position,‚Äù he said. Asked whether there could be renewed large-scale protests, he said: ‚ÄúOf course. Of course. These young people will certainly not give up.‚Äù Nathan Law, the secretary general of the Hong Kong Federation of Students, told the Guardian a Beijing victory would ‚Äúfurther radicalise‚Äù its opponents in the former colony. ‚ÄúThere will be protest activities should the package voted through. There definitely will be protest activities,‚Äù said Law, whose group played a key role in last year‚Äôs demonstrations. ‚ÄúAs for whether it would be another occupation, I don‚Äôt know yet.‚Äù Dozens of police surrounded Hong Kong‚Äôs government headquarters this week as the ‚Äúspecial administrative region‚Äù braced itself for possible unrest. ‚ÄúIf this so-called reform is really passed there will be riots in Hong Kong. It is going to be unthinkable,‚Äù said Mo. ‚ÄúSo for the sake of stability let‚Äôs have it vetoed first and then we‚Äôll move on from there.‚Äù Carrie Lam, Hong Kong‚Äôs number two official, also warned of ‚Äúviolent protests‚Äù, writing in the South China Morning Post: ‚ÄúI urge all protesters to express their views calmly and peacefully.‚Äù However, Pepper played down the possibility of major upheaval. ‚ÄúThere will be small protests like we‚Äôve seen already, last week and the week before. But I really don‚Äôt think there is going to be another Occupy,‚Äù she said. The umbrella movement protests did not achieve ‚Äúwhat the demonstrators wanted and of course they didn‚Äôt have a well thought out strategy‚Äù. ‚ÄúIn terms of actual reoccupying I think that is probably not likely and if it [happens] it will be small scale and people won‚Äôt stick around very long.‚Äù Additional reporting by Luna Lin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-16T06:50:36Z,world,World news,Italy threatens to give Schengen visas to migrants as EU ministers meet,"EU interior ministers are due to meet in Luxembourg on Tuesday to discuss how to cope with mass migration across the Mediterranean from Libya. Europe has become embroiled in a worsening feud over the issue, with Italy threatening to issue migrants with temporary visas that would allow them to enter other EU countries if no equitable deal is struck to share the burden. Brussels is struggling to bring in a new quota system for migrants. The ministers will try to hammer out a response to controversial proposals from the European commission that amount to the beginnings of a coherent and shared immigration policy. With tens of thousands of migrants crossing the Mediterranean, most of them heading for Italy, Rome appears outraged at the European infighting and is threatening to retaliate. East European states reject the commission‚Äôs proposals, Britain and Denmark are opting out; Germany supports them; France, Spain and Portugal are lukewarm; and Italy is furious that it may be left to deal with the influx on its southern shores. The Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, said that if no equitable deal is struck, Rome would start issuing migrants with temporary visas allowing them to travel elsewhere in Europe, stop receiving the hundreds of boats arriving from Libya and refuse docking for foreign ships rescuing those stranded at sea. Austria and Hungary are threatening to close their borders to migrants, and France and Switzerland are refusing them entry from Italy. Police are patrolling international rail traffic, flouting the passport-free travel rules governing Europe‚Äôs Schengen area.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not looking good,‚Äù an EU official said on Monday ahead of the interior ministers‚Äô session. The EU is staging special events this week to celebrate 30 years of borderless travel in the Schengen area. Leaders have declared the system irreversible, but it has seldom appeared under greater strain. Reacting to the drowning of more than 800 migrants when their boat capsized in the Mediterranean in April, the European commission delivered radical new proposals last month on quotas for migrants to spread across the EU. Britain, Denmark and Ireland do not need to take part in the scheme under the special EU terms they enjoy, but Dublin has said it will take some in. The commission‚Äôs proposals would start modestly, calling for the distribution across the EU of 60,000 Syrian and Eritrean asylum-seekers, 40,000 already in Italy and Greece and 20,000 still to make the Mediterranean crossing. The figures have been criticised as risibly low ‚Äì more than 600,000 asylum-seekers entered the EU last year ‚Äì but the commission‚Äôs scheme would establish the principle of a shared burden across the EU for the first time. Almost 60,000 have already arrived in southern Italy so far this year, more than the equivalent figure for last year. The proposals would redistribute 24,000 from Italy to other countries. Renzi described the figure as a provocation. Under the commission proposals, the redistribution of migrants would be binding on 25 of the 28 EU member states. The newer EU countries of eastern Europe, with low immigrant populations, do not want to take part and insist any redistribution should be voluntary rather than mandatory. Italy, Germany, Austria and Sweden are the foremost supporters of quotas, but to be accepted, they need to be backed by a qualified majority of countries. The east European members do not have enough support to block the proposals, but would be able to veto if Spain and Portugal joined them. Officials in Brussels said Poland, the biggest of the newer eastern members, was the key country. The issue is unlikely to be decided on Tuesday, but will be taken up by an EU leaders‚Äô summit next week in Brussels. The east European countries are keen to renew economic sanctions against Russia over Ukraine, an issue that resonates less strongly in western Europe, and Poland could be persuaded to bend on immigration in return for support on Russia, officials said. Germany and France have adopted a joint position, criticising but not rejecting the commission‚Äôs quota scheme while setting conditions such as the freezing of visa waiver schemes for the countries of the Balkans, and insisting that Italy fingerprint and register all new arrivals to keep them from travelling north to other EU countries. Under EU rules, migrants need to lodge their asylum claim in the first EU country they enter. Italy is demanding changes to the system, but France and Germany stress that it should be left alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-16T06:00:11Z,world,World news,Doubts persist over Iranian pledge to ease ban on women at sports events,"The international volleyball federation says it has received assurances from Iran that women will be allowed to attend a world league match in Tehran on Friday amid concerns that the country might backtrack at the last minute. Women‚Äôs rights activists have complained that Iran appeared to be retreating from an earlier decision to ease restrictions on female attendance due to increasing pressure from hardliners. Hopes that the longstanding ban could be eventually overturned is left hanging in the air with various officials expressing conflicting statements. Iran‚Äôs men‚Äôs team are due to play the US on Friday and again on Sunday at the Azadi sport complex in Tehran. Further home games against Poland are scheduled for later this month. Volleyball‚Äôs governing body, the FIVB, said it was monitoring the situation closely. It remains to be seen whether it would intervene to stop the events should it become clear that Tehran will not sell tickets to women.
‚ÄúThe FIVB has been informed that there is no change to Iran‚Äôs previous decision to ease its ban on women attending sporting events,‚Äù a federation spokesperson told the Guardian. ‚ÄúThe FIVB is monitoring the situation and will liaise closely with the international federation of volleyball officials onsite, to monitor Iran‚Äôs conditions for hosting the 26th FIVB world league. ‚ÄúThe FIVB remains totally committed to ensuring inclusivity and the right of women to participate in sport on an equal basis all around the world.‚Äù Last year a British-Iranian woman, Ghoncheh Ghavami, spent nearly five months in jail in Tehran after trying to attend a men‚Äôs volleyball match. The FIVB said at the time that it would prevent Iran from hosting international championships for as long as it maintained its ban on female spectators. Ghavami was arrested in June 2014 after taking part in a protest with other activists in front of the Azadi complex, demanding to be allowed to watch a match between Iran and Italy. She has since been released on bail but is barred from leaving the country.
In April she told the Observer in April that the campaign by the ‚Äúwomen with white headscarves‚Äù, as the group is known, had gained public support, and women in Iran wanted unrestricted access to all sporting events, not just selected sports such as volleyball or basketball. Last week, Iran‚Äôs vice president for women and family affairs, Shahindokht Molaverdi, said only ‚Äúa limited number of women, mainly families of national team players,‚Äù would be allowed to attend the games in Tehran. She said women would in time be allowed into volleyball, basketball, handball and tennis stadiums but would still be barred from football, swimming and wrestling events. Almost 500 Iranian social activists wrote to the interior minister protesting at the ambiguities surrounding women‚Äôs attendance. Many fear that the authorities may avoid confrontation with the FIVB by allowing a limited number of family members and VIP female fans. Others fear that even that limited attendance may not be allowed. Hardliners have threatened that ‚Äúblood‚Äù will be spilled if women attend the match on Friday. In a statement that circulated online, Iran‚Äôs diehard voluntary militia, known as Ummat Hezbollah, likened women‚Äôs attendance at sporting events to prostitution and claimed that it contradicted fatwas issued by the country‚Äôs supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The government‚Äôs spokesman has said the Hezbollah militia will not be allowed to stage a protest over women‚Äôs attendance. But the government does not necessarily have the power to stop them.
Asieh Amini, a women‚Äôs rights campaigner who was among the first group of women who protested against the ban on female spectators a decade ago, said the authorities were dodging the issue. ‚ÄúThey might allow a small number of women to enter the stadium on Friday by giving them VIP tickets but that‚Äôs not what we‚Äôve been looking for. Unfortunately, the government has not done enough,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe situation has got worse in recent years and hardliners have become more extreme on this matter but on the positive side, more people are aware of our cause now than ever before.‚Äù Until three years ago when the rules were tightened, small numbers of women were allowed to attend volleyball and basketball events. This month a limited number of women, mostly family members of players, were allowed to watch a basketball game in Tehran. Mohammadreza Davarzani, the head of Iran‚Äôs volleyball federation, warned recently that Tehran would be banned from hosting international games if it could not resolve the issue of female attendance. He said the decision to lift the ban was in the hands of the interior ministry rather than sports officials. The issue was the focus of a 2006 film, Offside, by the prominent director Jafar Panahi, who in 2010 was sentenced to six years in jail and banned from filmmaking for 20 years for ‚Äúworking against the Iranian system‚Äù. The film features a group of girls attempting to enter a stadium to watch a football World Cup qualifying match.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-16T06:00:10Z,world,World news,"Denmark's green Alternative: organic, meat-free and poised for breakthrough","They have campaigned for a 30-hour working week, for 100% organic agriculture in Denmark, and meat-free days in public institutions. Now, The Alternative ‚Äì a political party formed less than two years ago to champion a green agenda ‚Äì could hold the key to power in Denmark‚Äôs general election next week.
As Denmark goes to the polls on Thursday, the Social Democrat-led alliance led by the country‚Äôs first female prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, is locked in a tight election battle with a centre-right blue bloc and the leader of the Liberal party. Seats won by The Alternative could nevertheless help secure another term in power for her. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the perfect position for us to be in,‚Äù said Uffe Elb√¶k, leader of The Alternative and a former minister of culture under Thorning-Schmidt‚Äôs government. ‚ÄúEveryone now has to deal with us ‚Äì whether they like us or not.‚Äù The prime minister certainly looked to have paid attention. Asked during a TV debate whether she thought Elb√¶k was on to something with his political ideas, Thorning-Schmidt said: ‚ÄúYes, I think so. I also have an inner hippie who likes to wear colourful clothes, relax and have meat-free days.‚Äù
Critics have labelled The Alternative a joke and attacked its policies for being unsubstantiated and fanciful ‚Äì one of its members floated the idea of solar-powered cycling pipelines that would generate tailwind ‚Äì but the party has struck a rich vein among disillusioned voters who find the old parties closely aligned on core issues and lacking ambition. Speaking at their party headquarters in Copenhagen, where lime-green election posters were on display in the windows and a stack of T-shirts carried words such as ‚Äúgenerosity‚Äù, ‚Äúhumour‚Äù and ‚Äútransparency‚Äù, Elb√¶k said The Alternative was part of a wider international movement demanding a new political culture.
He pointed to Podemos in Spain as a potential collaborator in Europe. ‚ÄúIf we succeed in this election, then this is another step in the direction of moving from a representative democracy to an involving democracy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have to legitimise democracy.‚Äù While public sector spending, welfare and immigration have dominated the election debate in Denmark, the future of Europe came to the fore last week. The opposition parties, led by the normally pro-European Liberal party, announced they would back David Cameron in his quest for renegotiation to prevent the EU turning into a ‚Äúsocial union‚Äù.
The eurosceptic Danish People‚Äôs party looks set to cement its position as Denmark‚Äôs third-biggest party after the election, and the agreement was seen as another sign of its renewed pressure on the opposition for wider EU reforms.
‚ÄúA very powerful Danish People‚Äôs party will have implications,‚Äù said Kasper Fogh Hansen, a political commentator and former Social Democratic campaign adviser. ‚ÄúDenmark is on a political trajectory where people are very skeptical about a European community that can‚Äôt handle the migration of workers and the pressure of immigrants and refugees. The political direction will be the same whether it‚Äôs a red or blue government, but there might be more draconian measures from the right.‚Äù As Denmark earlier this month celebrated the centenary of its constitution and women‚Äôs right to vote, Thorning-Schmidt spoke outside the parliament building, Christiansborg, amid a sea of red banners and the reverberating bass from a nearby soundsystem. She was preceded on stage by a male dance performer wearing only a pair of sand-coloured skimpy shorts, as early summer sun and street parties engulfed Copenhagen. The prime minister put party politics aside in her speech, but the battle for Borgen was preoccupying the crowds.
‚ÄúI want her to continue in office but it has not worked as well as I thought under the current centre-left government,‚Äù said Karen Wolf, a 57-year-old business consultant from Copenhagen. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm disappointed that they haven‚Äôt carried through with some of their ideas ‚Äì but the opposition is a frightening prospect.‚Äù Broken promises ‚Äì from a proposed congestion charge in Copenhagen to a cap on student numbers in school classes ‚Äì have been recurring points of attack for the opposition, which has led opinion polls since the last election. Social Democratic voters have been dismayed by what they see as a shift to the right for the party, including a toughened stance on immigration. Selling a stake in Denmark‚Äôs biggest utility to Goldman Sachs put the government on the brink of collapse, while speculation has been rife over Thorning-Schmidt‚Äôs future as she was touted for a top EU job. But the last three weeks have seen a remarkable comeback by the prime minister and her red bloc, who have turned around a large poll deficit to leave them neck and neck with the opposition before Thursday‚Äôs vote. Part of the reason for this, and the biggest obstacle on the road back to power for the centre-right blue bloc, is a series of expenses scandals that have dogged the Liberal party leader, Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen. ‚ÄúWe can chose between two leaders with a character problem,‚Äù the newspaper Politiken wrote after the election was called. ‚ÄúLars L√∏kke Rasmussen apparently doesn‚Äôt have any personal character, while Helle Thorning-Schmidt doesn‚Äôt have any political character.‚Äù
Turning the focus from politics to personalities appears to have played into the hands of the incumbent prime minister. ‚ÄúThorning-Schmidt was never popular,‚Äù says Fogh Hansen. ‚ÄúShe was just a lot less unpopular than her opponent. If the blue bloc loses this election, it is down to the very poor choice of keeping a thoroughly scandalised Rasmussen as their candidate for prime minister. But their politics are victorious.‚Äù According to Martin Krasnik, a TV anchor for national broadcaster Danmark‚Äôs Radio, personality has never before played such a crucial role in Danish elections, something which he says has generated fertile ground for new political parties, including The Alternative. Krasnik said: ‚ÄúThe crucial divide in Danish politics no longer runs across the centre. The two main parties ‚Äì the Social Democrats and the Liberals ‚Äì do everything they can not to position themselves on either side on major issues such as integration, asylum, economy and security. Now, the divisions can be found further out on the edges, and that‚Äôs why the most interesting discussions are taking place among the other parties.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-16T05:00:09Z,world,World news,Boris Johnson criticised over 'women crying' remarks,"Boris Johnson has been criticised by a Labour MP for defending claims that women in the workplace cry more readily than men. Chi Onwurah, who worked for 20 years in a male-dominated sector as a chartered electrical engineer, said the mayor of London may be in breach of discrimination laws by defending comments made by Professor Tim Hunt. In a newspaper column, Johnson said it is a scientific fact that women cry more readily than men, and maintained that it should not be an offence to point out a ‚Äúgender difference‚Äù. Hunt, a Nobel laureate and senior scientific adviser, was forced to stand down last week after claiming that female colleagues cry when criticised. Onwurah, who was head of technology at Ofcom before becoming an MP, said that while it was reasonable to argue that Hunt had been treated unfairly, Johnson‚Äôs comments were irresponsible because he sought to excuse views that are unacceptable in the workplace.
‚ÄúAs the mayor of London, he is effectively managing many women. If Boris is treating women differently from men by not giving them honest feedback on their performance because they might burst into tears, he is certainly failing in his duty of care and could be in breach of the Sex Discrimination Act. ‚ÄúI think women employees could rightly argue that they have not had proper feedback from Johnson because of his views on women and their propensity to weep in the workplace. It could have prevented women from being promoted. ‚ÄúI have found in my career in industry that constructive criticism can really improve opportunities at work. Johnson could be holding women back by not giving them honest feedback,‚Äù she said. Hunt resigned from both the Royal Society and University College London after his remarks sparked a backlash online. The renowned scientist reportedly described himself as a ‚Äúchauvinist pig‚Äù at the World Conference of Science Journalists in Seoul and argued in favour of single-sex laboratories. He said: ‚ÄúLet me tell you about my trouble with girls. Three things happen when they are in the lab: you fall in love with them, they fall in love with you, and when you criticise them they cry.‚Äù Hours later, he attempted to justify his words in comments to Radio 4‚Äôs Today Programme. The scientist told the Observer that he had been ‚Äúhung out to dry‚Äù over comments that he insisted were meant to be humorous and for which he later apologised. Johnson said the comments were made during a ‚Äúlight-hearted, off-the-cuff speech‚Äù. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, he said: ‚ÄúSir Tim Hunt was doing what he had done all his life ‚Äì pointing out a natural phenomenon he had observed. He did not deserve to be pilloried, and should be reinstated forthwith to his academic positions.‚Äù The Conservative politician likened the reaction to Hunt‚Äôs comments to what he described as ‚Äúmumbo jumbo‚Äù claims by a Malaysian minister that the actions of tourists, including Briton Eleanor Hawkins, who stripped on a mountain considered to be sacred, had caused an earthquake. He wrote: ‚ÄúI am afraid that we in 21st-century Britain are in no position to snigger at the tribes and their fit of irrational indignation. We have our own mystery gods these days.‚Äù Onwurah criticised the way that UCL reportedly forced Hunt to leave his job without a formal explanation, but said he should no longer be put in charge of female employees. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he [Hunt] should have been dismissed from his job without being given some performance feedback. But I don‚Äôt think he should be in a position to manage women with those views,‚Äù she said. Onwurah has worked in hardware and software development, production management and strategy for private sector firms in the UK, France, the US and Nigeria. Before becoming an MP in 2010, she was head of telecoms technology at the industry regulator Ofcom. A spokesman for Johnson did not reply to a request for a comment. Nicky Morgan, the equalities minister, told the Fortune Most Powerful Women International Summit in London on Monday: ‚ÄúWe have been reminded of how far we still have to go with men. Just in the last week we have been reminded how far we still have to go in one field: science. I think someone who starts off remarks with ‚ÄòI‚Äôm a chauvinist should remember the old adage: ‚ÄòIf you can‚Äôt say something nice don‚Äôt say anything at all.‚Äô‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-16T01:30:49Z,world,World news,Nauru opposition MP arrested after anti-government protest outside parliament,"A protest against the Nauruan government has broken out outside the country‚Äôs parliament, leading to the arrest of opposition MP Mathew Batsieu. The protest follows allegations that place the president, Baron Waqa, and justice minister, David Adeang, at the centre of bribery claims, after the the ABC published extracts from emails that appear to suggest that both men were allegedly bribed by Australian mining company Getax. The Nauruan parliament is sitting on Tuesday, but was suspended briefly due to noise from the protest. Pictures obtained by Guardian Australia show some of the protesters gathered blocking the entry to the Nauruan parliament. The Nauruan citizens were demanding to speak with Nauruan politicians, according to a source at the protest. Several hundred Nauruans were present, and when police arrived the group gradually dispersed. Nauruans have become increasingly disenchanted with the government in the past two years, with former magistrate Peter Law saying it had led to a serious breakdown in the rule of law. In 2014 all opposition MPs were suspended from the Nauruan parliament. Concerns continue to be raised about Nauru internationally, after the blocking of several websites including Facebook and the recent deportation of the general manager of telecommunications provider Digicell. The government also blocked the entry of Australian barrister Jay Williams, who was set to appear in two significant legal cases on the island. Former president Sprent Dadwibo said the government was paranoid about independent media scrutiny. The protest is also likely to serve as a test of new laws that could see political protesters jailed for up to 10 years. The laws have been criticised by the United Nations as a serious attack on freedom of expression. In a statement on Tuesday afternoon the Nauruan government confirmed the arrest of Batsieu on a charge of ‚Äúdisrupting the legislature‚Äù. President Baron Waqa described the behaviour as ‚Äúdisgraceful‚Äù.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-15T22:36:12Z,world,World news,Dalai Lama's spokesman dismisses Australian tour protesters as a 'cult',"A spokesman for the Dalai Lama has described the Shugden Buddhist community who have staged protests against the religious leader during his tour of Australia as a ‚Äúcult‚Äù and said their protests were intended to ‚Äúcreate friction among Tibetan Buddhists‚Äù. Protests against the rejection of the Shugden community, which has been described by the demonstrators as ‚Äúreligious apartheid‚Äù, have marked every point of the Dalai Lama‚Äôs 12-day tour. The mixed reception to his appearance in at a business lunch in Perth on Monday, his last formal engagement before the tour ended on Tuesday, was typical.
A group of about 50 protesters carrying placards and chanting ‚Äúfalse Dalai Lama, stop lying‚Äù lined the road opposite the Hyatt Regency, where the Dalai Lama addressed an event hosted by the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce. On the other side of the road, a smaller group stood in welcome, playing Tibetan instruments. The protesters are complaining about the Dalai Lama‚Äôs stance on the worship of Shugden, or Dolgyal, a spirit alternatively seen as enlightened or malevolent. The Dalai Lama, on his own website, cites the danger of Tibetan Buddhism ‚Äúdegenerating into a form of spirit worship‚Äù. Since 1975 he has recommended against the practice. The specific complaint of the Shugden protesters is that he also asks that those who do follow it to stay away from his teachings and formal events. In a statement released on Monday, Rob Keldoulis, a spokesman for the Dalai Lama, reaffirmed the religious leader‚Äôs disapproval of the practice while also saying he believed everyone should be free to practice religion as they wished. ‚ÄúBecause of its fiercely fundamentalist and sectarian associations, the Dalai Lama concluded that worshiping the Shugden spirit was divisive, inhibiting philosophical inquiry and critical analysis,‚Äù Keldoulis said. ‚ÄúWhatever one believes about the reality of fierce spirits it is clear that the leaders of the Dolgyal/Shugden cult had intended to cause trouble among their own followers and sought to create friction among Tibetan Buddhists.‚Äù The Shugdens, for their part, say any sectarianism in the Tibetan community is caused by the Dalai Lama‚Äôs refusal to accept Shugden worshippers, saying he started and maintained a practice of discrimination and exclusion. Nicholas Pitts, spokesman for the Shugden community, said the Dalai Lama needed to ‚Äúend to the suffering caused by his sectarianism and religious intolerance‚Äù. ‚ÄúReligious freedom should apply to all traditions whether he likes them or not,‚Äù Pitt said. ‚ÄúAs a powerful political leader he must implement a policy of religious freedom and non-discrimination for all.‚Äù
Religious harmony was one of the topics the Dalai Lama addressed in Monday‚Äôs talk in Perth, which happened to fall on his 80th birthday. ‚ÄúAll religious institutions have same practice, the practice of love,‚Äù he said, adding that there needed to be, ‚Äúconstant effort to promote religious harmony on the basis of mutual respect, mutual harmony‚Äù. He also addressed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, telling the audience: ‚ÄúI really admire the Jewish community. Hard-working, very practical,‚Äù before adding, ‚ÄúThe political side, some complications there.‚Äù The Dalai Lama arrived in Australia on 4 June for his 10th tour of the country, touching down in Sydney with the actor Richard Gere as his travelling companion. Gere, a Buddhist, told the waiting press that the Dalai Lama gave, ‚Äúvery high teaching, experiential, something extraordinary ‚Äì so it‚Äôs worth coming this far‚Äù. The Dalai Lama and his entourage then went to a spiritual resort in the Blue Mountains, where he remained for five days, before giving lectures in Sydney, Brisbane, and Perth. He also visited Uluru in the Northern Territory, meeting Mutitjulu elders on Saturday. He told the gathering in Perth that after seeing the living conditions in central Australia he had donated $100,000 to local Aboriginal communities. A spokeswoman told Guardian Australia the money had been set aside and would be donated when an appropriate organisation was identified. The Dalai Lama said Indigenous people in Australia had been ‚Äúisolated‚Äù through lack of education, but said ‚Äúthey are the same human beings, they have the same rights‚Äù as anyone else in Australia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-15T18:43:44Z,world,World news,Moroccan gay men to be tried for violating 'public modesty' over photo,"Two Moroccan gay men are set to go on trial for violating ‚Äúpublic modesty‚Äù after holding each other for a photo at a historic site in Rabat, and could go to jail for up to three years. Mohsine, a 25-year-old from Marrakesh, in the west of the country, and Lahcen, 38, from Rabat, were touring and taking pictures near Hassan tower, the capital‚Äôs famous minaret, earlier in June when they were arrested by the police for supposedly standing too close to each other, activists said. It is not clear if the men were in a relationship. The pair are expected to appear in the court on Tuesday and if convicted, could face up to three years in jail under the country‚Äôs anti-gay laws. According to article 489 of Morocco‚Äôs penal code, homosexuality is punishable by six months to three years imprisonment. The news of their arrest was initially announced by the state-run Al Aoula television channel, which revealed their identities and photos in public in an attempt to shame them in the eyes of the country‚Äôs conservative society.
Activists condemned the move as reckless as it sparked demonstrations in front of their families‚Äô houses. Aswat Collective, a prominent LGBT group in Morocco, told The Guardian that demonstrators shouted homophobic slurs without any intervention by watching police. Morocco‚Äôs ministry of interior has linked Mohsine and Lahcen‚Äôs arrest to a protest by the French feminist group Femen in the exact same place in Rabat one day earlier. The two topless Femen activists were arrested and immediately deported from Morocco after kissing each other in front of Hassan tower, one of the iconic landmarks of the country. The Moroccan authorities suspect that Mohsine and Lahcen were mimicking Femen‚Äôs protest act but Aswat said they have denied any connection to the group or their actions. ‚ÄúAccording to police records, the detainees, while under investigation, have admitted that they are gay but they have also confirmed according to the same source that their visit to the square of the Hassan tower was for pure touristic reasons and not to imitate anyone,‚Äù Aswat said. ‚ÄúDetainee from Marrakech was visiting Rabat for the first time and wanted to go sightseeing with his friend. They visited several touristic places that day and took photographs at different sites before they ended up at the Hassan tower.‚Äù The arrest has come at a time when the authorities in Morocco are becoming more sensitive about pro-LGBT activities as the equality debate polarises a society still heavily rooted in conservative attitudes. Last month, Morocco sentenced three gay people to three years in jail, the first time the authorities are known to have used the maximum sentence to punish homosexuals. This week, the latest issue of Maroc Hebdo magazine controversially asked on its cover: ‚ÄúShould we burn gays?‚Äù Activists, Aswat included, have been campaigning for Morocco to abolish its article 489. Earlier in June, guitarist-bassist Stefan Olsdal from the US alternative rock band Placebo protested against the country‚Äôs anti-gay laws by writing the number 480 on his chest as he performed on stage in Rabat. Abdellah Ta√Øa, one of the first Moroccans to come out publicly as gay who is currently living in Paris, said the recent premier of the French-Moroccan drama film Much Loved at the Cannes festival has also added to the Moroccan authorities‚Äô sensibilities. Nabil Ayouch‚Äôs film is about the prostitution scene in Marrakesh. ‚ÄúThe debate in Morocco is pretty much that the west is invading us socially,‚Äù Ta√Øa told the Guardian. ‚ÄúBut let‚Äôs not forget, that there are also people who support the LGBT community in Morocco, recently an editorial published by TelQuel magazine called for equality.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-15T18:32:57Z,world,World news,Spain's indignado mayors stay true to their roots in first day on the job,"They promised change, and as Spain‚Äôs new crop of leftist mayors with roots in the indignado movement began their first day on the job, they kept their word, shunning official cars for the metro and stepping in to suspend home evictions. Barcelona‚Äôs mayor, Ada Colau, began her day in office on Monday in the district of Nou Barris, which made headlines last November when 15 families faced evictions on the same day. She had been informed of several other families at risk of eviction for falling behind on their mortgage payments, and when she arrived, she found a family ‚Äì including two children aged two and seven ‚Äì sitting in the street with their suitcases. ‚ÄúTheir nerves were on edge,‚Äù she said. Colau called the family‚Äôs lender, Bankia, who assured her that the eviction had been suspended. She then dispatched another city councillor to make sure that the other families at risk remained in their homes. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working to find a more stable solution,‚Äù she told reporters afterwards. In Valencia, the ecologist Joan Rib√≥ began his day by cycling to city hall. His Comprom√≠s movement, which put an end to more than two decades of the centre-right People‚Äôs party (PP) rule in the city, has made increasing sustainable mobility options a priority. As she was sworn in as Madrid‚Äôs new mayor on Saturday, Manuela Carmena insisted she would continue to take the metro to work rather than make use of the mayor‚Äôs official car. And on Monday she did just that, smiling at the handful of journalists that gathered to follow her just before 8am. Standing rather than sitting in the carriage, she was congratulated by several well-wishers. ‚ÄúI voted for you,‚Äù said one passenger excitedly. In Galicia, the three new mayors from leftist coalitions made headlines when they declined to attend a mass and religious procession on Sunday, rebuffing a tradition for officials in the region since 1669. Their decision was taken out of respect for Spain as a secular state, the new mayor of Santiago de Compostela, Marti√±o Noriega wrote in an article on the Praza P√∫blica website. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm one of those who thinks its not right for a mayor to ask the apostles to do away with unemployment and corruption. Instead, a mayor should be able to put in place policies aimed at fostering transparency and creating jobs,‚Äù he wrote. Noriega‚Äôs counterpart in A Coru√±a, Xulio Ferreiro, said he would instead pay homage to the Galician mathematician Maria Wonenburger, who died a year ago at the age of 86 and was the first Spaniard to secure a Fulbright scholarship for doctoral studies in mathematics. Jorge Su√°rez, the new mayor of Ferrol, said he would also give the religious ceremony a pass, pointing to the separation of church and state. Their stance contrasts with that of the central PP government, which has repeatedly angered secularists in recent years by handing out the country‚Äôs top policing award to a statue of the Virgin Mary and stating that Saint Teresa was intervening to help the country through the economic crisis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-15T17:59:56Z,world,World news,Fate of jihadi Mokhtar Belmokhtar unclear after US air strike in Libya,"The US air force has said it targeted a notorious jihadi leader linked to al-Qaida in a weekend air strike on Libya. But there was no confirmation of the reported death of Mokhtar Belmokhtar, who was accused of leading an attack on a gas plant in Algeria in 2013 that killed 40 hostages. Saturday‚Äôs raid near Adjabiya was carried out by F-15E aircraft using precision weapons. The US air force secretary, Deborah Lee James, said ‚Äúenormous care‚Äù had been taken to avoid harming civilians. ‚ÄúThe impact of the raid is still being assessed,‚Äù she told reporters at the Paris air show. ‚ÄúI have absolute confidence in our people and the intelligence, but this is not exact science.‚Äù She said Belmokhtar had ‚Äúa long history of terror with al-Qaida affiliates‚Äù. Belmokhtar embodied the link between al-Qaida ‚Äúcentral‚Äù and local extremist movements. If confirmed, his death would be a triumph for US intelligence-gathering in a region ravaged by civil war. It would also underline how the Obama administration prioritises counter-terrorism operations while avoiding wider involvement in the Middle East and north Africa. Libyan media reported that the US strike left 33 dead and many others wounded. There were claims that several high-profile al-Qaida leaders had gathered for a meeting at a farm owned by a leader of the extremist group Ansar al-Sharia. On Sunday, government forces clashed with survivors of the strike when the latter group tried to bring their wounded on armed pickup trucks to the hospital in Ajdabiya. Elsewhere in Libya, air strikes were reported on Monday near Sebha, in the south-west near a known transit route for al-Qaida out through Niger and Algeria. The US attack depended on collaboration with the internationally recognised Libyan government, based in the eastern city of Bayda. Tripoli, the capital, is run by the Islamist-dominated Libya Dawn coalition. The existence of rival administrations is one aspect of a chaotic and lawless situation that has worsened steadily since Nato-backed rebels overthrew Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Belmokhtar has been reported killed before, including in 2013, when he was targeted in Mali. Major Mohammed Hegazi, a military spokesman for the Bayda administration, told the Associated Press that two foreign leaders and a Tunisian fighter were killed in the strike. Tests were needed to determine whether Belmokhtar was among them. The Bayda government called for further ‚Äúconsultation and co-ordination‚Äù to counter Islamic State control of the coastal city of Sirte and its push westwards towards Misrata and to the south towards Jufra. Belmokhtar‚Äôs biography reflected the violent history of Algeria and the Sahel in the last quarter of a century. He first emerged as a member of the Armed Islamic Group fighting the Algerian military in the 1990s. He fought in Afghanistan, where he lost an eye ‚Äì earning him the nickname ‚Äúthe one-eyed‚Äù ‚Äì and returned home to continue the jihadi struggle. He later joined al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqim), a ‚Äúfranchise‚Äù of Osama bin Laden‚Äôs group, but fell out with its leader, Abdelmalek Droukdel. In late 2012 Belmokhtar formed a new group, al-Mulathamin (the Masked Ones), and was described as its ‚Äúemir‚Äù, or commander. French sources have said that he was heavily involved in smuggling diamonds and cigarettes ‚Äì another nickname is ‚ÄúMr Marlboro‚Äù. The unit that attacked the BP camp at Ein Amenas in Algeria was known in Arabic as ‚Äúthe signers in blood‚Äù. Two months ago Belmokhtar made headlines by refusing to pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the Islamic State, which is now in open competition with al-Qaida. Saturday‚Äôs raid was the first American air strike on Libya since 2011, but US forces have conducted operations there more recently. Two years ago, Delta commandos captured Anas al-Libi, blamed for the bombing of US embassies in Africa, in Tripoli. Last June another commando raid seized Ahmed al-Khattala, now on trial in the US on charges of killing the US ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi in 2012. The effect of the air strikes on diplomatic efforts to end Libya‚Äôs civil war are unclear. US diplomats have been urging both sides to end the violence and commit themselves to a power-sharing plan proposed by the United Nations. The UN wants agreement on the plan by 17 June, before the onset of Ramadan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-15T17:59:05Z,world,World news,Alexander Litvinenko murder suspect to cooperate with public inquiry,"One of the two men accused of murdering Alexander Litvinenko, the Russian spy who died of radiation poisoning in London in 2006, is set to give evidence next month to the public inquiry into the dissident‚Äôs death after agreeing to cooperate with the process. Dmitry Kovtun, who is accused of importing the polonium-210 allegedly slipped into Litvinenko‚Äôs tea at a Mayfair hotel, has been given core participant status at the inquiry, a statement from its chairman, Sir Robert Owen, said. In an unexpected move in March, Kovtun wrote to the inquiry offering to give video evidence from Moscow. Both Kovtun and his fellow accused, Andrei Lugovoi, now an ultra-nationalist politician, had previously said they would boycott the process set up by the home secretary, Theresa May. Both deny any wrongdoing. Lugovoi has stated that he will maintain the right to avoid self-incrimination when answering questions or providing documents, the inquiry statement added. Owen, a high court judge, subsequently ruled that Kovtun would be allowed to participate if he provided a detailed witness statement by 22 May, disclosed material that he has previously said in interviews would exonerate himself and Lugovoi, and confirmed that he would cooperate in giving evidence. ‚ÄúSir Robert is satisfied that Mr Kovtun has complied in full with his directions dated 2 April 2015,‚Äù it said. Kovtun has promised to give evidence from Moscow on a date to be determined by the inquiry, most likely towards the end of next month. Direct evidence from a man repeatedly and strongly linked with the murder is likely to prove among the more dramatic moments of a process already rich in grisly detail. The inquiry has already heard that Litvinenko himself believed that Vladimir Putin personally authorised his murder, as he told police from his hospital bed where he lay dying from radiation poisoning. Kovtun and Lugovoi, both former KGB agents, are accused of killing Litvinenko by putting polonium in his green tea during a meeting with him on 1 November 2006 at the Millennium hotel in central London. Ben Emmerson QC, acting for Litvinenko‚Äôs widow Marina told the inquiry it was beyond any reasonable doubt that the men were the murderers. The Crown Prosecution Service has charged them both with murder and issued an international arrest warrant. Putin has refused to extradite them. Kovtun, the inquiry was told, flew to Hamburg days before the meeting with Litvinenko, seemingly to collect the poison. German detectives found traces of radiation in his former wife‚Äôs home, where he stayed, including on a teddy bear belonging to one of her children. Other evidence came via a former colleague in a Hamburg restaurant who said Kovtun talked about seeking a cook in London who could put ‚Äúvery expensive poison‚Äù he was carrying into food or drink. High readings of polonium were also found in Kovtun‚Äôs bedroom at the Millennium hotel.

2015-06-15T15:40:54Z,world,World news,Fears grow for friend of Dewsbury boy believed to be latest Isis suicide bomber,"A childhood friend of the teenager believed to be Britain‚Äôs youngest suicide bomber said he is now fearful for the safety of the boy‚Äôs travel companion. Talha Asmal, 17, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, reportedly detonated a vehicle fitted with explosives while fighting for the militant group Islamic State (Isis) in Iraq, after travelling to the conflict-torn country with his best friend, Hassan Munshi. Despite his death not being officially confirmed, Asmal‚Äôs family said images released through an Isis-linked Twitter account showing a young man named as Abu Yusuf al-Britani appear to show their son. Anees Mahmood, 24, a neighbour of the family who grew up with Asmal, told the Guardian he was now ‚Äúvery concerned‚Äù about the fate of Munshi, the brother of Britain‚Äôs youngest convicted terrorist Hammad Munshi. ‚ÄúI am very concerned because they went there together but according to word of mouth they parted their ways after going there,‚Äù said Mahmood, a law graduate. ‚ÄúAs far as what I‚Äôve heard, he‚Äôs maybe doing OK.‚Äù Mahmood said Asmal and Hassan Munshi would play football on the street together and that he last saw them about a week before they disappeared over the Easter holidays. They were walking down the street like ‚Äúordinary lads‚Äù, he said. ‚ÄúIt feels so unimaginable for something like this to have happened; it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs just going to turn up. I know it might be mad but I don‚Äôt believe what has happened. I‚Äôve known his family all my life and they‚Äôre from a British cultural background as well so you wouldn‚Äôt expect anything like that.‚Äù
Munshi‚Äôs brother Hammaad was 15 when he was arrested in 2006 and found to have a guide to making napalm. He was jailed for two years in 2008 for being part of an al-Qaida cell. Family and community leaders have been left shocked by the death of Asmal, who was described as ‚Äúa loving, kind, caring and affable teenager‚Äù. The 17-year-old lived with his mother Noorjaha, 38, and father Ibrahim, 42, at their terraced home before he left for Syria via Turkey on a Thomas Cook flight with Munshi. In a statement, Talha‚Äôs family condemned Isis for preying on his ‚Äúinnocence and vulnerability‚Äù. They said: ‚ÄúTalha‚Äôs tender years and naivety were, it seems however, exploited by persons unknown, who, hiding behind the anonymity of the world wide web, targeted and befriended Talha and engaged in a process of deliberate and calculated grooming of him. ‚ÄúWhilst there, it appears that Talha fell under the spell of individuals who continued to prey on his innocence and vulnerability to the point where, if the press reports are accurate, he was ordered to his death by so-called Isis handlers and leaders too cowardly to do their own dirty work.‚Äù Pictures released by Isis online show Asmal smiling as he stands by a black Toyota 4x4 giving the militant group‚Äôs signature one-finger gesture. Another shows the teenager clutching a rifle as he sits cross-legged on a mat alongside two other armed men, apparently being instructed by a uniformed militant in a crudely furnished operations room. Paula Sherriff, the Labour MP for Dewsbury, said the community in Savile Town district, were in a state of ‚Äúshock and devastation‚Äù. ‚ÄúI was there last night and people were crying in the street. There is quite an open outpouring of grief and people were genuinely completely shocked at the news,‚Äù she said. Sherriff added that there needed to be renewed efforts to tackle radicalisation across the country, not just in Dewsbury. She said the government should devote more money to tackling the problem and strengthening the anti-radicalisation programme, Prevent. ‚ÄúWe need to be working with the community and establish why boys and girls feel the need [to go to Iraq and Syria], and the police have got a part to play in that as well. Politicians and elected members have got a responsibility, as have the local community, to look out for signs of this going on,‚Äù the MP said. Asmal finished studying for his GCSEs at Westborough high school before leaving to study information and communications technology and business at Mirfield Free Grammar school.
Lorraine Barker, executive principal of Mirfield Free grammar & sixth form, where Asmal was studying, said he was very quiet, private and a ‚Äútypical teenager‚Äù. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt draw any attention to himself,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe was just a conscientious student.‚Äù The suicide attacks are understood to have occurred in Salahuddin province, near one of Iraq‚Äôs largest oil refineries, as part of an offensive by the militant group. Isis statements on Saturday named Abu Yusuf al-Britani ‚Äì Asmal‚Äôs nom de guerre ‚Äì as one of four suicide bombers. The others were said to be a German, a Kuwaiti and a Palestinian. All four were photographed by Isis standing beside vehicles. Charlie Winter, a researcher at the Quilliam Foundation, a counter-extremism thinktank, said the short amount of time the teenager spent in Syria before he died was an unusual feature of the case. ‚ÄúHe was chosen soon after he arrived,‚Äù said Winter. Isis would have deliberately selected a young British person to act as a suicide bomber as it is more provocative and likely to generate publicity, Winter continued. ‚ÄúDisplaying Talha‚Äôs face without a mask, making clear who he is, saying that he was British ‚Äì they would have calculated this would have caused a media storm.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-15T15:19:22Z,world,World news,Snowden leak: governments' hostile reaction fuelled public's distrust of spies,"The hostile reaction of the British and US governments to the Snowden disclosures of mass surveillance only served to heighten public suspicion of the work of the intelligence agencies, according to an international conference of senior intelligence and security figures. The recently published official account of a Ditchley Foundation conference last month says one of the event‚Äôs main conclusions was that greater transparency about the activities and capabilities of the security services would be essential if their credibility was to be preserved and enhanced around the world. The account of the conference chaired by Sir John Scarlett, the former head of MI6, was published on Friday and makes clear the foundation recognised the widespread public unease following the revelations and that the conditions of data collection about individuals and who has access to it are legitimate areas of concern.
Sir John Holmes, the foundation‚Äôs director, said while Snowden‚Äôs disclosures had not revealed the intelligence agencies to be out of control, they ‚Äúhad shocked the publics in many countries because they had been unaware of the nature of much intelligence work, as well as uninformed about the authorisation and oversight arrangements already in place‚Äù. The conference was attended by leading figures in the British and international intelligence and security community. The UK contingent included Robert Hannigan, director of GCHQ, Lewis Neal, Foreign Office intelligence policy director, and Peter Clarke, ex-head of the Metropolitan police counter-terrorism command, as well as a BBC journalist, Gordon Corera. The participants agreed that ‚Äúone thing governments and parliaments could do to increase trust and improve awareness was to hold more debates about these issues, rather than trying to avoid them‚Äù. They wrote: ‚ÄúThe reaction of the governments most concerned after the Snowden revelations had often appeared as ducking and weaving, trying to reveal as little as possible, or attempting to change the subject, rather than getting ahead of the argument. This had only made things worse and increased public suspicion.‚Äù Another participant, the security journalist Duncan Campbell, has reported that to many participants‚Äô surprise, there was general agreement across broad divides of opinion that Snowden had changed the landscape. The journalist wrote that there was agreement that more transparency, or at least ‚Äútranslucency‚Äù, and providing more information about intelligence activities affecting privacy, was both overdue and necessary. ‚ÄúNo one tried to debate whether Snowden was a villain, traitor or hero,‚Äù Campbell said. The indication of a new post-Snowden consensus within the international intelligence and security community of the significance and impact of his disclosures emerges a day after the Sunday Times cited Home Office sources warning that British agents have had to be withdrawn from live operations as a consequence of the Snowden leaks.
Traditionally, debates on intelligence issues organised by the Ditchley Foundation, which specialises in high-level transatlantic international policy debates, had been kept confidential. But Holmes said it was time for change to reflect ‚Äúthese more transparent times‚Äù. International participants included the EU‚Äôs counter-terrorism coordinator, a former acting director of the CIA, Canada‚Äôs national security adviser and former senior figures in the German, French and Australian intelligence agencies. The participants debated extensively the issue of the bulk collection of personal data, and while they agreed it did not in itself amount to ‚Äúmass surveillance‚Äù, it could be used for that purpose without proper regulation and oversight. Participants also conceded that as the flood of personal data increases, concerns about individual privacy will not go away any time soon, and that access for the security services to the data held by private companies, such as Twitter and Google, will have to be through the frontdoor and not by secret, backdoor programmes such as the Prism and Tempora schemes revealed by Snowden. According to Holmes‚Äôs account, there ‚Äúwas optimism that relations between private companies and agencies could be regularised and improved post-Snowden‚Äù as long as access to individuals‚Äô information was via ‚Äúproperly authorised, legally sound and specific warrants‚Äù. ‚ÄúNothing else would be acceptable to their customers,‚Äù the director concluded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-15T14:14:35Z,world,World news,Bilderberg looks to the future but is stuck in the past,"Disturbing news has emerged that a bullet was fired at a police helicopter during this year‚Äôs Bilderberg conference. Who would do such a thing? It turns out, the people who would do it are the police. The bullet was fired accidentally, admits a government spokesperson, by a member of Austria‚Äôs elite EKO Cobra counter-terrorism squad: the rifle went off when the officer was climbing into the helicopter. Luckily, no one was hurt. One helicopter was slightly injured. That‚Äôs a relief, although it begs the question: what on earth is a crack anti-terror unit doing flying helicopter patrols around Telfs with live ammo and the safety off? Last time I looked we‚Äôre in the Tyrol, not Vietnam. It seems appropriate that the single act of violence perpetrated towards police at Bilderberg 2015 was the direct result of their crazily heavy policing. In fact, the only injury the police received the entire time was when an officer sprained his lips from going ‚Äúbrrrm brrrm brrrm‚Äù while sitting in their redundant armoured personnel carrier and pretending to drive it.
The police won‚Äôt spend money on a much-needed press accreditation centre here, but they‚Äôre happy to splash out on an armour-plated snowplough. What a joke. In the wake of the conference, at the bar of the Interalpen-Hotel Tyrol, I chanced upon a lingering delegate, the Portuguese media mogul Francisco Pinto Balsem√£o. In my terrible Portuguese I asked him whether he‚Äôd had a productive conference ‚Äì uma confer√™ncia √∫til ‚Äì and he replied in English: ‚ÄúWe always do.‚Äù I managed one more question before being bustled away by hotel staff. ‚ÄúDo you think next year you might hold a press conference, like in the old days?‚Äù Senhor Balsem√£o smiled, and replied in Portuguese. ‚ÄúTalvez,‚Äù he said. Perhaps. He seemed a charming man, but tired. He was lingering, I suspect, because this was his last Bilderberg as a member of the steering committee, and he was savouring the memories of power. In the runup to this year‚Äôs conference, the Portuguese press had reported how Balsem√£o had nominated his fellow countryman, Jos√© Manuel Barroso, the former European commission president, to replace him on the steering committee. And midway through the proceedings, the official website was changed to show the switch in names. After the conference, Barroso seemed jubilant. His grin spoke volumes as he sprang from his car at the airport. He beamed and waved at the cameras, and I thought for a moment he was going to punch the air like at the end of The Breakfast Club. He looked like the cat that got the cream, then decided the cream was boring, and drank a bottle of champagne instead.
Rather less forthcoming than Barroso was the investment banker James Wolfensohn. When asked by reporter Dan Dicks whether he‚Äôd had a good conference, Wolfensohn said: ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt there ‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt attend.‚Äù Which is a pretty rubbish answer to give to the press when you‚Äôve just stepped out of a V12 Mercedes with a massive ‚ÄúB‚Äù sticker in the front window.
Emerging from the next limo along, with a soft whir from its cyborg limbs, the remarkably lifelike Peter Thiel 3000 checked its scanners for threats, then made its way out towards its private jet.
The founder of Paypal and director of Facebook is currently pouring money into anti-ageing research, as part of his ‚Äúimmortality project‚Äù. He says: ‚ÄúI believe if we could enable people to live forever, we should do that. I think this is absolute.‚Äù (Of course, he‚Äôs not the only Bilderberger with an eye on immortality. David Rockefeller, the godfather of the group, turned 100 during this year‚Äôs conference ‚Äì it‚Äôs thought he joined the event via the huge screen they have set up in the main conference room. And Henry Kissinger is 92. He would have died years ago but Death is too scared to knock on his door.) Back in 2006, Thiel was a co-founder, with Ray Kurzweil, of the Singularity Summit. Kurzweil is a famous futurologist, transhumanist and currently a director of engineering at Google. By ‚Äúsingularity‚Äù is meant the shift towards smarter-than-human technology: the era of non-biological intelligence and, by extension, the merger of human and machine intelligence. Thiel‚Äôs ticket to immortality. At Bilderberg this year, the executive chairman of Google, Eric Schmidt, brought along two of his top people to lead a session on AI. It might seem an odd fit for Bilderberg, but over the last few years the big shift within the group has been towards new media and new technology. Schmidt and Thiel both sit on the group‚Äôs steering committee, as does Craig Mundie of Microsoft and Alex Karp, the billionaire CEO of data analytics company Palantir, who was Thiel‚Äôs roommate at Stanford Law School. Bilderberg has reached out to Silicon Valley; it‚Äôs grappling with AI. Looking forwards to the future, always with an eye to what‚Äôs valuable. If Bilderberg is to survive, and stay influential, it has to merge with this new technology. It knows it can‚Äôt be left behind. And here‚Äôs where I worry for the future of Bilderberg. Inwardly, the group seems able to adapt to new technology, but what about the relationship between the group and the technology being used by the news media? It‚Äôs not the 1950s any more: you can‚Äôt just ‚Äúhave a quiet word‚Äù with half a dozen editors and keep a story out of the papers. You‚Äôve got to deal with reporters like Dan Dicks and Luke Rudkowski, with their instant uploads and cameras hanging off every rucksack strap. You‚Äôve got bloggers and citizen journalists, activists with Instagram accounts. News articles with comments sections and buttons to share them on social media. The news just doesn‚Äôt work the way it used to. Thiel will tell you that, if no one else does. Equally anachronistic is the heavy-handed policing: the checkpoints, the armoured snowploughs, the harassment, the helicopter patrols with itchy-fingered cops. The obstinate refusal to engage in proper press relations. It‚Äôs just a physical extension of Wolfensohn‚Äôs ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt there ‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt attend‚Äù. A denial of reality, a denial of change: and it‚Äôs no kind of long-term strategy. It‚Äôs like George Osborne keeping his head down, dodging the cameras, and half-pretending he‚Äôs not been at Bilderberg, then eventually declaring the three days of meetings in his transparency data with the two words: ‚Äúgeneral discussion‚Äù. More is required of Osborne, and more is required of the group in general. For its own sake as much as ours. So will the Bilderberg group take a deep breath, move forwards, and give us more in 2016? In the words of Senhor Balsem√£o ‚Ä¶ talvez.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-15T14:01:32Z,world,World news,Omar al-Bashir case suggests South African foreign policy is going rogue,"The South African government‚Äôs brazen decision to bypass the high court in Pretoria and seemingly allow Omar al-Bashir, the Sudanese president accused of genocide and war crimes, to leave the country on Monday raises serious questions about the ANC-led administration‚Äôs commitment to the rule of law and looks like an enormous V-sign aimed at key allies, including the US, Britain and the international criminal court.
The act of defiance by the president, Jacob Zuma ‚Äì and there can be little doubt he was directly involved ‚Äì places him at the head of a growing band of African leaders who argue that the ICC, which issued arrest warrants for Bashir in 2009, is biased against Africa and has become an oppressive tool of western powers. Zuma‚Äôs ostensible ‚Äúanti-imperialist‚Äù stance will be popular in the developing world, reflecting a larger north-south split. From Bashir‚Äôs point of view, his successful Houdini act marks a breakthrough in his continuing attempt to end Sudan‚Äôs diplomatic isolation. The fact that he attended a prestigious African Union summit in a country that is a state party to the ICC, was granted de facto immunity from prosecution, hobnobbed with fellow pariahs such as Zimbabwe‚Äôs Robert Mugabe and got away scot free, is one in the eye for his tormentors, principally the Americans, who continue to sanction his regime. For the ICC, Bashir‚Äôs vanishing act, following his similar though less dramatic escapades in Egypt, Libya and Saudi Arabia, is a significant setback in the court‚Äôs quest to establish its effectiveness and extend its reach. It may now face a full-scale rebellion led by South Africa of many of the African countries that originally signed up to the court in droves.
The constitutional and legal issues raised by the South African government‚Äôs pre-empting of the high court are far reaching. It is unconvincing to argue, as the government did in court, that its pre-summit offer of immunity to Bashir superseded its international obligations under the Rome statute, which created the ICC. All state parties to the statute are obliged to cooperate fully with the court and may face UN security council sanctions if they fail to do so. Zuma‚Äôs government did not just fail to cooperate. It sent justice department lawyers to court to argue, in effect, on Bashir‚Äôs behalf. It defied a direct appeal from the ICC prosecutor, who asked Pretoria ‚Äúto spare no effort in ensuring the execution of the arrest warrants‚Äù. It ignored similar appeals from the US state department and the EU and raised the stakes by questioning the ICC‚Äôs authority. An ANC national executive committee statement said: ‚ÄúThe African National Congress holds a view that the ICC is no longer useful for the purposes for which it was intended ‚Äì being a court of last resort for the prosecution of crimes against humanity ... countries, mainly in Africa and eastern Europe ... continue to unjustifiably bear the brunt of the decisions of the ICC, with Sudan being the latest example.‚Äù In a clear dig at the US, which like China, Russia and India is not an ICC signatory and is sometimes accused of double standards, the ANC claimed ‚Äúgross human violations committed by non-signatory countries go unpunished‚Äù. It called for the Rome statutes to be reviewed to ensure all UN members were subject to the same level of scrutiny. Monday‚Äôs events will increase concern in the US and elsewhere about South Africa‚Äôs international outlook. In 1993, Nelson Mandela declared that ‚Äúhuman rights will be the light that guides our foreign policy‚Äù. But Pretoria has often appeared to side with egregious human rights abusers, such as Mugabe. Its UN voting record on Burma, Belarus, Cuba and Iran has aligned South Africa with authoritarian states such as China and Russia.
South Africa‚Äôs defiance will dismay the ICC, which is still recovering from its inability last year to pursue crimes against humanity charges against Kenya‚Äôs president, Uhuru Kenyatta. Fatou Bensouda, the ICC prosecutor, complained that her investigation had been blocked by the Kenyan authorities and suggested witnesses had been interfered with, which she claims is a problem commonly encountered elsewhere. The ICC has also frozen inquiries in Darfur, western Sudan, where Bashir‚Äôs human rights crimes are alleged to have taken place, due to a lack of UN support. Bensouda said last year that the security council‚Äôs lack of foresight had hurt the people of Darfur. This failure ‚Äúreflects badly not just on the international justice system of which the ICC is only a part, but it also greatly undermines the credibility of this council as an instrument of international peace and security‚Äù, she said. The ICC has nine situation investigations under way at present, all in Africa. Responding to criticism that its focus is too narrow, or even racist, it has since launched preliminary inquiries into alleged crimes in Ukraine, Palestine, Iraq and Honduras. Bensouda argued recently that this growing caseload demonstrated the court‚Äôs increased effectiveness. She said: ‚ÄúThis is testament to the ever growing legitimacy of the court ... this shows how in less than 15 years of existence, the court has managed to establish itself as a credible, professional, independent instrument.‚Äù Bensouda said the ICC would be expanding its remit to include children‚Äôs rights and sexual and gender-based crimes.Speaking before the case of Bashir in South Africa arose, Bensouda admitted big problems remained over perceptions of the ICC‚Äôs judicial independence. She said: ‚ÄúThere is a continuous need to shield the court from politicisation at national and international levels. The court has to be allowed to carry out its mandate impartially and independently, without fear or favour.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-15T13:08:19Z,world,World news,Riga mayor: 'I'm a Russian-speaking Latvian and patriot of my country',"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs complicated,‚Äù is a phrase Nils U≈°akovs uses often. As the ethnic Russian mayor of Riga, capital city of a country that looks with extreme wariness to its large eastern neighbour, it is hardly surprising. Even spelling his name is not straightforward: Nil Ushakov is the transliteration from the Russian, but Nils U≈°akovs is his official Latvian name. The 38-year-old has been mayor of Riga, where about half of the population are Russian speakers, since 2009. But in Latvia, where ethnic policies and politics have always been contentious, the Russian annexation of Crimea and war in eastern Ukraine have made things even more complex. In the new confrontation between Russia and the west, Riga is as close as it gets to a frontline. Latvia is a member of the EU and Nato, and in recent days there has been talk of the US deploying heavy weaponry there. But Russian money flows through the country; the nearby seaside resort of J≈´rmala is the summer home of many rich Russians and a number of NGOs promote Russian culture. Many Latvian politicians whisper conspiratorially that the NGO activity is a front for the Kremlin‚Äôs spying activities.
With one-third of the population ethnic Russian, there are lingering fears that while Russia could not pull off a full-blown Crimea scenario in Latvia, it could cause serious mischief. Few local Russians yearn for annexation, but many watch Moscow television and are sympathetic to the Kremlin. Their irritation is boosted by perceived unjust policies on the status of Russian language. Much of the ethnic Latvian ruling elite view ethnic Russian politicians as potential Kremlin agents, and there is a deep-seated suspicion of U≈°akovs. During an interview in his office in Riga‚Äôs old town last month, he said such fears were ridiculous. ‚ÄúI was born here. It was my considered decision to take a Latvian passport. I‚Äôm a Latvian national; a Russian-speaking Latvian who is a patriot of my country.‚Äù Events in Ukraine, however, have meant he now has to watch every word. During a trip to Moscow last year, he said in a television interview that Vladimir Putin was ‚Äúthe best Russian president for Latvia‚Äù. What he meant, he said later, was that bringing down the Putin regime would not necessarily bring anything better to power, but his words were taken as a show of support for the Russian president. He said he fully supports Ukrainian territorial integrity, ‚Äúincluding Crimea‚Äù. But semantics can have a big political impact here. Asked if he recognised the Soviet period of Latvian history as an occupation, he smiled wearily and said: ‚ÄúWe believe there are no debates on the fact that Latvian independence was violated in a violent form by the strident usage of military force.‚Äù So, is that an occupation?
‚ÄúPrecise wording has become politics itself,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhether it was an annexation, an occupation or an incorporation, better to leave that to historians. But nobody doubts that Latvia did not want to become part of the Soviet Union and was forced to.‚Äù This, already, marks him as closer to the official Latvian government position on the Soviet period than to Moscow, which has continued to insist the territories voluntarily joined the Soviet Union during the second world war. He has also made some moves not likely to appeal to his core ethnic Russian electorate, such as a posting a selfie of himself with an American Abrams tank during a joint training exercise. He has, however, criticised EU sanctions against Russia as ineffective and lashed out at Latvian politicians for not understanding the damage Russia‚Äôs counter-sanctions ‚Äì such as banning EU foodstuffs ‚Äì has caused to Latvia‚Äôs economy.
In municipal politics, he can appeal to non-Russian voters and is widely popular among residents of Riga. Certainly, for all his Russian heritage, U≈°akovs does not come from the Moscow school of staid public politics. He studied in Copenhagen, speaks Russian and Latvian, as well as fluent English. U≈°akovs is a savvy social media user, running his own Twitter feed and frequently posting chatty updates on his Facebook page. Many whisper about his links to big business, but in general he is liked. But for all this, at the national level, things are trickier. Although his party, Harmony, won the largest number of votes in 2011 and last autumn, both times it failed to attract large numbers of ethnic Latvian votes and was kept out of government by a coalition of parties supported more by ethnic Latvians. ‚ÄúWhen we talk about national politics, it‚Äôs complicated for many reasons. It‚Äôs much easier to talk about bad Latvians or bad Russians than talk about fighting unemployment or facing other economic challenges, so politicians from both sides start abusing national rhetoric,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou become hostages of the rhetoric used when you deal with your own voters. This is bad from many perspectives.‚Äù U≈°akovs backed making Russian the second state language in 2011, a move that many ethnic Latvians say has ruled him out as someone they could vote for. ‚ÄúIt was complicated,‚Äù he said, referring to the hostile rhetoric that followed Harmony winning the largest number of votes but being shut out of government in 2011. ‚ÄúOur voters became really mad and participating in this referendum became a protest. And sometimes you have to be with your voters.‚Äù He said he was now fully behind Latvian as the only language, but of the view that the government could do more to make life easier for Russian speakers, especially the older generation. ‚ÄúLatvian is a small language facing tough competition both from English and Russian, you have to protect it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut show some psychological steps forward, for example saying you can apply for social support from the municipality in Russian.‚Äù When U≈°akovs gave a speech to a mainly ethnic Russian crowd on 9 May, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of victory in the second world war, the Latvian state language board said it would investigate him for speaking without Latvian translation. The event, celebrated by the ethnic Russian population, is shunned by Latvians who see it as the start of the Soviet occupation. Although he was cleared of any wrongdoing, the issue of the war still cuts a deep division throughout society.
One 31-year-old ethnic Russian Riga resident, a marketing manager, said: ‚ÄúWhen my ethnic Latvian colleagues at work asked what I‚Äôd done on the weekend I said the family just gathered to remember my granddad who fought in the war and passed away recently. They all looked horrified, and asked me: ‚ÄòDo you really celebrate 9 May?‚Äô We didn‚Äôt really talk about it after that but there was a kind of tension there.‚Äù Both U≈°akovs‚Äô grandfathers fought in the war, and his family settled in Latvia in its aftermath. His current wife ‚Äì his third ‚Äì is an ethnic Latvian. ‚ÄúAs I understand, much of her family was called up and fought for the Germans,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd somehow we can live with this fact. It‚Äôs time to move on. This country has huge challenges to face in the future and we can only do it if we‚Äôre ethnically united.‚Äù As he spoke during last week‚Äôs interview, sirens were frequently heard as the motorcades of David Cameron, Angela Merkel, and many other European leaders sped past. Riga was hosting an EU summit devoted to the Eastern Partnership countries; six former-Soviet countries. The thorny issue of what to do about the resurgent Kremlin dominated the summit, and U≈°akovs said the combination of Russian roots and European outlook could make him an important go-between. The polls suggest Latvian society is not ready for an ethnic Russian prime minister, but he believes this will change. ‚ÄúTen years ago, Russian mayors and vice-mayors sounded like science fiction, right now it‚Äôs just a part of our life,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt will take a lot of time and effort, but having a Russian prime minister is definitely possible.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-15T11:32:58Z,world,World news,Venice mayoral election result may open way for bigger cruise ships,"A businessman and staunch supporter of the cruise ship industry has won the mayoral election in Venice, dealing a significant blow to efforts by environmental activists to keep the big ships out of the city. Luigi Brugnaro‚Äôs victory over Felice Casson, a left-of-centre senator from the Democratic party (PD) of the prime minister, Matteo Renzi, in a runoff election on Sunday is expected to set off discussions with Rome over new possible routes into the city by massive cruise ships.
Brugnaro won 53% of the vote against 47% for Casson. Even though Casson went into the race with an edge over his opponent following the initial election on 31 May ‚Äì when neither won more than 50% in a crowded field ‚Äì Brugnaro emerged the victor because he gained the support of conservative allies in the rightwing Northern League party. Cruise ship companies have voluntarily stopped sending ships weighing over 96,000 tonnes into the city following a ban brought in after the 2012 Costa Concordia shipwreck off the coast of Tuscany. That ban has since been reversed but is still the subject of litigation. Before the election, both Brugnaro and the cruise ship industry said the issue of what kinds of ships ought to be let into Venice ‚Äì and which route they will use ‚Äì would largely be determined by the next mayor. However, the central issue that dominated the election was not the controversy over cruise ships, but corruption allegations. The centre-left lost the important mayoral seat after a 20-year reign that was marked by recent corruption and bribery scandals. The last elected mayor of Venice, Giorgio Orsoni, stepped down last year following allegations that he was part of a corrupt dealings related to construction of underwater barriers to protect the lagoon city from flooding. Although the presence of massive cruise ships is a heated issue in Venice ‚Äì environmentalists and celebrities have joined in the debate, warning that their presence was an ecological disaster waiting to happen ‚Äì the debate was overshadowed by anger over the corruption allegations, which were deemed ‚Äúfatal‚Äù for the PD in local press coverage. In what was seen as a rebuke against Renzi‚Äôs leadership, the PD also lost selections in Arezzo, Matera and Nuoro, but held on to seats in Mantua and Lecco. The local races followed regional elections on 31 May in which the PD lost an important bellwether race in Liguria and ceded territory to the Northern League, the rightwing anti-immigrant and anti-euro party headed by Matteo Salvini. In an interview with the Guardian before he won Sunday‚Äôs election, Brugnaro, emphasised the importance of the cruise ship industry in the Veneto region and said he supported a new route into the city of Venice that would require dredging. He also said he staunchly opposed another route ‚Äì which is currently being assessed by environmental experts in Rome ‚Äì that would force big cruise ships to dock at a proposed offshore platform far outside Venice, and load and offload passengers on to ferries to get them into the city. The cruise industry has deemed the offshore platform proposal to be unsafe and logistically unworkable. Although the leading cruise ship association, CLIA, did not formally endorse Brugnaro, his opposition to the offshore platform clearly made him the group‚Äôs preferred candidate. A spokesman for CLIA said it welcomed the election of a new mayor. ‚ÄúBrugnaro‚Äôs come-back in the second turn [run-off] speaks to Venetians‚Äô desire for a more entrepreneurial approach to the city‚Äôs management,‚Äù said Francesco Galietti, the top CLIA official in Italy. ‚ÄúWe trust that at soon as the new mayor has settled in, he will take at heart the issue of finding a sustainable and long-term solution for the access of cruise liners to Venice.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-15T11:02:11Z,world,World news,Northern Irish woman launches legal bid to overturn abortion ban,"A Northern Irish woman who travelled to England to have an abortion is launching a court challenge to the almost total ban on terminations in the region‚Äôs hospitals. Sarah Ewart‚Äôs legal bid to overturn the abortion ban is backed by the Northern Ireland human rights commission. The commission wants abortion to be legalised Northern Ireland in cases of rape, incest or serious malformation of a foetus. Speaking before her case in Belfast high court, Ewart said the experience of having to go to England while 20 weeks pregnant for an abortion was ‚Äúa living nightmare‚Äù. She decided to go to England for the termination in 2013 after her baby had been diagnosed with anencephaly, a condition in which the brain has not developed. Ewart said: ‚ÄúI am an ordinary woman who suffered a very personal family tragedy, which the law in Northern Ireland turned into a living nightmare. I was told that my baby was likely to die before being born or shortly afterwards. All I kept thinking was, ‚ÄòOur baby has no brain, she cannot liv.‚Äô ‚ÄúI simply could not face it, but the law in Northern Ireland meant I had no option but to go to England and take myself away from the care of the doctors and midwife who knew me. I was 23 years old and totally devastated. ‚ÄúI and many women like me have been failed by our politicians, after they left me with no option but to go to England for medical care. Now, by their refusal to change the law, they leave me with no option but to go to the courts on my and other women‚Äôs behalf.‚Äù Around 2,000 women travel to English hospitals and clinics from Northern Ireland every year to have terminations. There is strong opposition to liberalising the province‚Äôs abortion laws inside the Northern Ireland assembly. Abortion is only legal in Northern Ireland if a woman‚Äôs life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent or serious damage to her mental or physical health. The 1967 Abortion Act was never extended to Northern Ireland and all the main local political parties oppose it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-15T11:00:04Z,world,World news,Republican 2016 hopefuls seek 20-week abortion ban but rebound may be costly,"As they criss-cross early voting states, seeking to woo primary voters, Republican presidential contenders are going all-out with their opposition to abortion ‚Äì even if it could come back to bite them. It all has to do with proposed legislation that would ban women from terminating pregnancies after 20 weeks, a move viewed by pro-life advocates as the most historic debate on abortion in decades. In recent months, support for a 20-week abortion ban has turned into its own litmus test for Republicans eyeing the White House. Nearly every one of them has thrown his or her support behind the measure. In the span of one week, hypothetical backing from some presidential hopefuls has turned into concrete support for legislation that could become law depending on who Americans elect president when they go to the polls next year. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina senator who launched his presidential campaign this month, introduced a 20-week abortion ban in the Senate last week. His co-sponsors included three other Republicans running for president: Florida senator Marco Rubio, Kentucky senator Rand Paul and Texas senator Ted Cruz. Graham‚Äôs introduction of the bill happened to coincide with the passage of a similar measure by the Wisconsin state Senate, where Governor Scott Walker ‚Äì who is expected to declare his candidacy for president in the coming weeks ‚Äì has said he will sign a 20-week abortion ban without exceptions once it reaches his desk. Republican candidates vying to be the most anti-abortion in order to win over social conservatives is nothing new, but for a party that has struggle to attract women voters in recent elections, the 20-week ban carries with it a political risk that could loom well beyond the primary. Democrats have already revived the so-called ‚Äúwar on women‚Äù narrative that cost Republicans heavily in 2012, when Barack Obama beat Mitt Romney by 12 points among women voters. ‚ÄúIt could hurt them. It feeds right into this Democratic strategy of the Republican war on women,‚Äù said Drew Halfmann, an associate professor in sociology at the University of California, Davis, and author of Doctors and Demonstrators: How Political Institutions Shape Abortion Law in the United States, Britain and Canada. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been successful in the past, it could be successful again. It could hurt them, and it could benefit Hillary Clinton.‚Äù Indeed, Clinton, the presumed Democratic nominee for president, has wasted no time criticizing Republicans for trying to restrict access to abortion. In the first rally of her campaign, in New York on Saturday, Clinton told thousands of supporters that Republicans ‚Äúshame and blame women, rather than respect our right to make our own reproductive health decisions‚Äù. On the day that Graham introduced his 20-week abortion ban, Clinton hit back on Twitter: ‚ÄúA group of senators trying to make medical decisions for millions of women: That isn‚Äôt leadership ‚Äì it‚Äôs malpractice.‚Äù But Republicans and anti-abortion groups believe they have an opportunity to flip the debate. The 20-week abortion ban, they have argued, is supported by the majority of Americans. The Republican party‚Äôs more aggressive approach was perhaps best reflected in a statement made by Paul, shortly after he announced his bid for president. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we ask Democrats, ‚Äòis it OK to kill a 7lb in the uterus?‚Äô‚Äù he said, after repeatedly refusing to specify to reporters if he supported abortion exceptions for rape or incest. The Susan B Anthony List, a pro-life group that led a campaign to get all 2016 GOP candidates on the record supporting a 20-week abortion ban, applauded Paul‚Äôs response. ‚ÄúThe 2016 election cycle is turning out to be vastly different from what happened in 2012, and the most important thing that‚Äôs happening is we‚Äôre seeing candidates go on the offense,‚Äù Mallory Quigley, the group‚Äôs spokeswoman, told the Guardian. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre already seeing candidates with confidence and with passion explaining the pro-life position ‚Ä¶ and we‚Äôre seeing our candidates call out the other side for their extremism.‚Äù Liz Mair, a Republican strategist who has worked for several candidates ‚Äì including Walker and Paul ‚Äì made a similar argument. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to go and start playing immediately on your opponent‚Äôs turf, but I don‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre playing on their turf,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf Hillary Clinton wants to come out and say, ‚ÄòNo we should allow abortions after Week 20,‚Äô that‚Äôs going to make her look like an extremist.‚Äù Democrats, Mair added, are ‚Äúseriously mis-gauging where the public stands on this issue‚Äù.
American attitudes on abortion are indeed mixed. The general electorate remains fairly split between voters who are pro-choice and pro-life. But one potential problem for Republicans is that a majority of Americans believe decisions on abortion should be made by a woman and her doctor. Republicans and anti-abortion advocates rest their logic on polls that find majority support for banning late-term pregnancies, but other surveys have found the results to be more complicated. Many Americans identify as both pro-choice and pro-life across every demographic group ‚Äì in other words, voters‚Äô perceptions on abortion can change depending on the circumstances. Pro-choice groups like Planned Parenthood have pointed to such nuances in opinion to illustrate why it is misleading to simply say that most Americans support a ban on abortion after 20 weeks. They argue that outside of those Americans who are staunchly pro-life, in all cases, others are less likely to oppose late-term abortions when the reasons women typically seek them are broken down. Late-term abortions account for less than 1.5% of all abortions in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They often occur among women who discover fetal abnormalities at a later stage, women who are diagnosed with a life-threatening illness such as cancer, or among women who cannot afford to pay for the procedure. Some women do not even find out they are pregnant until after the 20-week mark. ‚ÄúThere is no science or medicine behind this bill ‚Äì just politics,‚Äù Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement responding to Graham‚Äôs bill. ‚ÄúLeading medical groups oppose these bills as do the majority of the American public when they understand the reality that women and their families face when seeking abortion at 20 weeks in pregnancy.‚Äù Medical studies have also disputed that fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks, the core argument pro-life advocates have used to push a flurry of 20-week abortion bans at the state level. The US House of Representatives passed its own version of the legislation last month. If Graham‚Äôs bill comes up for a vote in the GOP-controlled Senate, however, it is unlikely that it would overcome a Democratic filibuster. If it did, the Obama administration would most certainly veto it. It is unclear if Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, would want to hold a vote on a bill that could carry also ramifications for the GOP‚Äôs control of the Senate. Several Republican senators are facing tough re-election battles in swing states in 2016 and have sought to curry favor with women voters by pushing legislation that would make birth control available over the counter. A vote on a 20-week abortion ban would only complicate that message. Jennifer Lawless, director of the Women & Politics Institute and an associate professor of government at American University, said Republicans fare better when they are careful not to play into the Democrats‚Äô narrative. ‚ÄúAll it takes is one Todd Akin or Richard Mourdock and the Democrats can put forward a narrative ‚Äì quite compellingly ‚Äì that the GOP just doesn‚Äôt respect or understand women,‚Äù said Lawless, referring to two Republicans who lost 2012 Senate elections after making controversial comments on rape while discussing abortion. ‚ÄúBut with such a large Republican presidential field, and what will surely be numerous debates in which the candidates try to differentiate themselves from one another, stepping into women‚Äôs health issues is slippery.‚Äù Doing so has already proved somewhat slippery for Walker, who recently garnered headlines for saying rape and incest exceptions were only concerns for women ‚Äúin the initial months‚Äù of pregnancy. He also defended a 2013 bill he signed into law that requires women seeking abortions to first undergo a mandatory ultrasound by noting that ultrasounds were ‚Äújust a cool thing out there‚Äù.
Rick Perry, again running for president after an unsuccessful attempt in 2012, has also shown no hesitation defending bills he signed curbing access to abortion while serving as governor of Texas ‚Äì some of which are regarded as the most restrictive anti-abortion laws in the country. When asked on Fox News recently if he supported exceptions for rape, incest or to save the mother‚Äôs life, Perry told host Megyn Kelly he was ‚Äúpro-life on all of those‚Äù. Halfmann said Republicans ‚Äúunderstand the benefits and the risks‚Äù of wading into the abortion debate. For Graham and Perry, both underdogs in the primary, it provides an opportunity to stand out in a crowded GOP field. For Walker, one of the early frontrunners, touting his record gives him a leg up over his main rivals ‚Äì Rubio and former Florida governor Jeb Bush. Voters in the general election do not rank abortion among their top issues, he added, which is why it will be critical for Democrats to build a broader case on Republicans and women as they have done successfully in the past. ‚ÄúAbortion is not a super salient issue for voters,‚Äù Halfmann said. ‚ÄúBut portraying the Republican Party as anti-women has very high salience.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-15T09:53:00Z,world,World news,Fears of new crackdown as China holds two former members of rights group,"Two former members of a prominent Chinese human rights group have been detained, fuelling fears that the country‚Äôs crackdown on civil society has entered a new phase of repression that will see NGOs face increasing pressure. Guo Bin and Yang Zhanqing, who had both worked at Yirenping, a public health group that offers support to people with hepatitis B and HIV, were taken into custody on Friday on charges of ‚Äúillegal business operation‚Äù, according to lawyers and activists. Guo, 32, was detained as he visited his two-year-old son at a children‚Äôs hospital in Shenzhen, his lawyer said. ‚ÄúA nurse called him out of the ward and he didn‚Äôt come back,‚Äù Pang Kun told the Guardian. ‚ÄúAnother nurse told his family he had been taken away and would not be coming back anytime soon.‚Äù Yang, 38, was detained at around 10pm at his home in the city of Huizhou, his wife, who asked not to be named, said. ‚ÄúThe police didn‚Äôt even leave me the arrest warrant when they took him.‚Äù The detentions are the latest chapter in an offensive against Chinese civil society that has been gathering pace since Xi Jinping became Communist party leader in late 2012. Yirenping, a non-profit group that was founded in 1996, has found itself at the eye of the storm since March when it criticised the detention of five feminists who had planned to protest against sexual harassment. The group‚Äôs Beijing offices were subsequently raided with security officials seizing computers and documents. In April, a government spokesperson said the group had ‚Äúallegedly violated the law, and will be punished‚Äù. Maya Wang, the China researcher for Human Rights Watch, said: ‚ÄúThe ongoing campaign against this key NGO signifies the Xi government‚Äôs strengthened resolve to control civil society and to crack down on dissenting voices.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe message is to instil a sense of fear among NGOs so that they don‚Äôt dare do anything that could be perceived as threatening,‚Äù Wang added. ‚ÄúWhen the red line keeps moving inward and you don‚Äôt really know where it is, NGOs will scale back their work significantly just to be safe. The result is a tamer civil society.‚Äù Xi‚Äôs crackdown has targeted a variety of groups from grassroots activists to influential bloggers, journalists, civil rights lawyers and academics. Public security officials are likely to be given far greater control over the activities of foreign NGOs under draft legislation that Beijing says is needed to protect ‚Äúnational security and social stability‚Äù. Eva Pils, an academic from King‚Äôs College London who studies civil society and human rights in China, said the outlook was ‚Äúvery bleak‚Äù with moderate groups and individuals now finding themselves in Beijing‚Äôs crosshairs. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs now no longer just a few radicals who are being perceived as somehow suspect and potential enemies of the state. Rather the party-state has communicated the message that actually we just don‚Äôt want civil society as a whole. We don‚Äôt want civil society as a potentially oppositional, liberal force within the system,‚Äù she said. Under Xi, the Communist party had used both nationalistic propaganda and the promise of action on issues such as corruption to try to reinforce its authority, said Joshua Rosenzweig, a Hong Kong-based human rights researcher. ‚ÄúThe repression message is: ‚ÄòIf you persist in criticism ‚Äì in mobilising independently within society ‚Äì then, in the interests of Chinese society at large, we, the party, will stop you, we will throw you in jail, we will cut off or restrict your access to the internet, we will close down your organisation.‚Äô‚Äù ‚ÄúMore than in recent years the party is wielding a stick to make sure that its message is received,‚Äù Rosenzweig added. Party leaders had feared the west was seeking to topple them by using foreign NGOs to incite a colour revolution for at least a decade, Rosenzweig said. But under Xi those claims had intensified. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know whether or not that reflects Xi Jinping‚Äôs personal vision. But the fact that this has become such a central part of both the rhetoric and the policy under his leadership suggests that he may have something to do with it.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is significant that there has been such a marked increase in the kind of suspicious stance towards foreign institutions and foreign governments since he came to power.‚Äù The wife of Yang Zhanqing, one of the detained activists, said she had been allowed to visit her husband on Monday. ‚ÄúHe was in a good state despite having had his head shaved and wearing handcuffs,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI have nothing to be afraid of as long as they don‚Äôt plant things on him.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is our belief that the state and government should reward these people who work for the public good, instead of framing them with fabricated crimes,‚Äù Yirenping said in a statement. ‚ÄúSuch campaign-style repression must end,‚Äù it added.

2015-06-15T09:00:02Z,world,World news,World leaders accused of shameful failure over refugee crisis,"Millions of refugees have been condemned to a life of misery in the worst displacement crisis since the second world war, a leading human rights organisation has said in a scathing report (pdf) that blames world leaders‚Äô neglect for the deaths of thousands of civilians fleeing wars in the Middle East and Africa. ‚ÄúWe are witnessing the worst refugee crisis of our era, with millions of women, men and children struggling to survive amidst brutal wars, networks of people traffickers and governments who pursue selfish political interests instead of showing basic human compassion,‚Äù said Salil Shetty, Amnesty International‚Äôs secretary general, in a statement.
‚ÄúThe refugee crisis is one of the defining challenges of the 21st century, but the response of the international community has been a shameful failure.‚Äù The report, titled The Global Refugee Crisis: A Conspiracy of Neglect, places a particular focus on the Syrian crisis. Almost 4 million people displaced from Syria have registered with the UN high commissioner for refugees. The burden has fallen almost entirely on the shoulders of neighbouring states, who host 95% of the refugees. In Lebanon, one in five people is a Syrian refugee, the equivalent per capita of the UK hosting nearly 13 million refugees.
With its infrastructure stretched beyond breaking point and its government in a state of disarray, Lebanon has imposed a series of restrictions on the entry of refugees that has led to an 80% drop in new registrations compared with last year, despite the continued ferocity of the Syrian civil war. The report concluded that the countries hosting Syrian refugees have received ‚Äúalmost no meaningful international support‚Äù, with the UN‚Äôs humanitarian appeal to cover the costs of caring for the refugees receiving less than a quarter of the necessary funds. In Turkey, border guards used water cannon over the weekend to push back a fresh influx of refugees fleeing the fighting between Islamic State militants and Kurdish militias near the long border with Syria. Amnesty criticised the international community for similarly failing to respond to massive displacement crises in sub-Saharan Africa, where there are an estimated 3 million refugees, including hundreds of thousands who have fled conflicts in Nigeria, South Sudan, the Central African Republic and Burundi in recent years.
On the Mediterranean migrant crisis, Amnesty called on European nations to share the burden of resettling refugees, and said the scaling back of Operation Mare Nostrum ‚Äì the Italian effort to handle asylum seekers fleeing to Europe by boat ‚Äì had contributed to the increase in the number of people drowning.
About 3,500 people died while trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe in 2014, with 1,865 dying this year so far. The majority of those fleeing by boat are Syrians displaced by the war. ‚ÄúThe European governments have pushed them back into the sea rather than resettle them,‚Äù Shetty said at the report‚Äôs launch in Beirut. More generally, Shetty added, the world is ‚Äúturning its back to the most vulnerable people‚Äù. In south-east Asia, 300 refugees and migrants have died at sea due to starvation, dehydration and abuse by boat crews, with Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand initially refusing to allow boats carrying migrants to land back, putting many at risk. Amnesty castigated the Australian government in particular for ‚Äúharsh, humiliating‚Äù conditions in which asylum seekers are kept when they attempt to reach the country. Amnesty estimated the number of displaced people globally to be above 50 million, a crisis greater in magnitude than any since the second world war. The rights group called on states to resettle 1.5 million refugees over the next five years, prioritise saving the lives of displaced people over domestic immigration policies, create a refugee fund, hold a global summit to deal with the crisis, and ratify the UN‚Äôs refugee convention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-15T08:31:19Z,world,World news,Sudan president barred from leaving South Africa,"South Africa‚Äôs high court has barred Sudan‚Äôs president, Omar al-Bashir, from leaving the country in a dispute over alleged war crimes that could undermine the authority of the international criminal court (ICC). Bashir, who travelled to Johannesburg for a summit of African leaders, is wanted by the UN-backed court for alleged atrocities, including genocide, committed during the Darfur conflict.
The high court in Pretoria issued an interim order preventing Bashir from leaving South Africa until an urgent application to force authorities to arrest him is heard. A further hearing was scheduled for Monday at 11.30am (9.30am BST) after the Southern Africa Litigation Centre (SALC), which promotes human rights, filed an urgent application to overturn a government decision to grant immunity to all delegates attending the African Union (AU) summit. The prospect of the Sudanese president being formally arrested appeared to recede on Sunday evening, however, when South Africa‚Äôs ruling African National Congress (ANC) said the ICC was ‚Äúno longer useful for the purposes for which it was intended‚Äù. The ANC also called for a review of ICC statutes to make them applicable to all UN members and ensure a ‚Äúfair and independent court for universal and equitable justice‚Äù. Bashir was seen at the conference venue on Sunday evening, but his whereabouts on Monday was not confirmed. African states accuse the court, which is based in The Hague, of only targeting political leaders on their continent and failing to bring to justice those responsible for war crimes in the Middle East and elsewhere.
The initial order preventing Bashir‚Äôs departure was extended on Sunday so that the court could reconvene on Monday to examine the SALC application. Judge Hans Fabricuis urged the government to take ‚Äúall necessary steps‚Äù to prevent Bashir, 71, from leaving the country. If he left, the judge said, it would damage South Africa‚Äôs international reputation. In a statement issued at the weekend, the ICC called on South Africa, which has signed up to the court, to detain Bashir and ‚Äúspare no effort in ensuring the execution of the [two] arrest warrants‚Äù. It also expressed ‚Äúdeep concern about the negative consequences for the court in case of non-execution of the warrants by states parties and, in this regard, urges them to respect their obligations to cooperate with the court‚Äù. South Africa‚Äôs foreign ministry did not immediately comment. As an ICC signatory, the government is obliged to exercise its arrest warrants. Bashir was originally indicted more than a decade ago. ‚ÄúHe would be a fool if he had not sought guarantees he would not be transferred before leaving for South Africa,‚Äù one ICC official was reported as saying. Since his indictment in 2009, he has mostly travelled to countries that have not joined the ICC. ‚ÄúWe are all happy to be here. There‚Äôs no problem,‚Äù a Sudanese official said at the summit. The AU summit is chaired by Zimbabwe‚Äôs president, Robert Mugabe, who has urged African leaders to pull out of the ICC. Human rights groups, however, expressed outrage that Bashir could openly defy arrest. ‚ÄúAllowing president Bashir into South Africa without arresting him would be a major stain on South Africa‚Äôs reputation for promoting justice for grave crimes,‚Äù said Elise Keppler of Human Rights Watch. ‚ÄúSouth Africa‚Äôs legal obligations as an ICC member mean cooperating in Bashir‚Äôs arrest, not in his travel plans.‚Äù Darfur erupted into conflict in 2003 when insurgents mounted a campaign against Bashir‚Äôs government, complaining their region was politically and economically marginalised. More than 300,000 people have been killed in the conflict and about 2.5 million have been forced to flee their homes, according to the UN.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-15T08:21:26Z,world,World news,Japanese PM's plan to allow troops to fight overseas angers voters,"Controversial plans by Japan‚Äôs prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to allow his country‚Äôs troops to fight on foreign soil for the first time since the second world war have sent his support ratings to their lowest level since he became leader in late 2012. A poll by Nippon TV network found that almost two-thirds of respondents opposed the change, which requires new legislation to reinterpret Japan‚Äôs pacifist constitution. Growing opposition could threaten Abe‚Äôs recent promise to Barack Obama that he will enact legislation currently being debated in parliament later this summer. Article 9 of the postwar constitution, written by US occupation officials, prohibits Japan from threatening or using force as means of settling international disputes. Successive administrations in Tokyo have interpreted that to mean that troops can only go into battle in defence of direct threats to Japanese territory. A year ago, Abe‚Äôs cabinet reinterpreted the constitution, saying it did not prevent Japan from exercising its right to collective self-defence, or coming to the aid of an ally ‚Äì almost certainly the US ‚Äì even when Japan itself is not attacked. That dramatic shift is reflected in new joint defence guidelines agreed in April between Tokyo and Washington. On a visit to the US later that month, Abe pledged to push the changes through parliament by mid-August, when he will release a much-anticipated statement to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the Pacific war. The current parliamentary session is supposed to end on 24 June but could be extended to accommodate a vote on the collective self-defence bills. But Abe, a conservative who has long argued for a more robust, internationally active military, is struggling to convince voters and constitutional experts.
The Nippon TV poll showed support for Abe falling to 41.1%, while 63.7% opposed collective self-defence. Almost 80% said the government had not properly explained the new legislation. The poll results come soon after a respected expert on constitutional law invited to address a panel of MPs by Abe‚Äôs Liberal Democratic party [LDP] said the proposed changes were unconstitutional. ‚ÄúThe government should retract the bills because the core element of the bills ‚Äì the use of the right of collective self-defence ‚Äì is manifestly unconstitutional,‚Äù Yasuo Hasebe, a professor at Waseda University, told a news conference after his appearance. The change would require outright constitutional reform, Hasebe added ‚Äì an option Abe has apparently abandoned for now due to public opposition. Two other experts said government assurances that potential missions would be strictly non-combative and risk-free were misleading. In response, Abe told reporters at the G7 summit in Germany last weekend that Japanese forces would operate ‚Äúunder the world‚Äôs strictest conditions on the use of force‚Äù and exercise the right to collective self-defence ‚Äúin a restrained manner‚Äù. The security bills would remove geographical constraints on where Japanese troops could operate in ‚Äúsituations that would significantly affect Japan‚Äôs security‚Äù. They would also allow them to defend allies ‚Äúin situations where there is a clear risk that Japan‚Äôs existence is threatened and its people‚Äôs rights ‚Ä¶ are compromised through an attack on a country which has a close relationship with Japan‚Äù. Opponents say that Abe‚Äôs new interpretation is too broad and would risk dragging Japanese troops into US-led conflicts. The LDP and its junior coalition partner, New Komeito, have comfortable majorities in both houses, but would be wary of alienating voters in order to satisfy the US, which wants Japan to play a bigger role in bilateral security ties to counter an increasingly assertive China. ‚ÄúIt depends on public opinion,‚Äù said Atsuo Ito, a political commentator. ‚ÄúSome LDP executives are now wondering which is the bigger risk: breaking a promise to Washington, or damaging public support.‚Äù About 25,000 people demonstrated in Tokyo on Sunday in defence of the pacifist constitution, organisers said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-15T08:15:31Z,world,World news,‚ÄòBritain‚Äôs youngest suicide bomber‚Äô mourned by West Yorkshire family,"The family of a West Yorkshire teenager, believed to have become Britain‚Äôs youngest suicide bomber, said they have been left ‚Äúutterly devastated and heartbroken by the unspeakable tragedy‚Äù. Pictures of Talha Asmal, 17, were released by Isis on Saturday, along with a statement saying that he detonated a vehicle fitted with explosives in the northern Iraqi town of Baiji. The militant group said his name was Abu Yusuf al-Britani but following media reports identifying the boy in the pictures as Asmal, his family released a statement on Sunday expressing their grief and anger. ‚ÄúTalha was a loving, kind, caring and affable teenager,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúHe never harboured any ill-will against anybody nor did he ever exhibit any violent, extreme or radical views of any kind. Talha‚Äôs tender years and naivety were, it seems however, exploited by persons unknown, who, hiding behind the anonymity of the worldwide web, targeted and befriended Talha and engaged in a process of deliberate and calculated grooming of him. ‚ÄúWhilst there it appears that Talha fell under the spell of individuals who continued to prey on his innocence and vulnerability to the point where if the press reports are accurate he was ordered to his death by so-called Isis handlers and leaders too cowardly to do their own dirty work. ‚ÄúWe are all naturally utterly devastated and heartbroken by the unspeakable tragedy that now appears to have befallen us.‚Äù The family said that Isis did not represent Islam or Muslims ‚Äúin any way, shape of form‚Äù. In April, they said the teenager boarded a flight to Turkey with his friend Hassan Munshi, also 17 at the time. The families of both boys issued an urgent appeal for their return, adding they were gravely worried the pair had joined Isis. Isis statements on Saturday named Britani as one of four suicide bombers. The others were said to be a German, a Kuwaiti and a Palestinian. All four were photographed by Isis standing beside SUVs. The suicide attacks are understood to have occurred in Iraq‚Äôs Salahuddin province, around one of the country‚Äôs largest oil refineries, as part of a larger military offensive by the militant group.
If the reports are corroborated, Asmal would be Britain‚Äôs youngest known suicide bomber. Another West Yorkshire teenager, Hasib Hussein, was almost 19 when he blew himself up on a London bus in the 7 July 2005 attacks. Shahid Malik, a former government minister and a friend of the Asmals, described them as ‚Äúa beautiful, caring, peace-loving and incredibly humble family‚Äù. The former MP for Dewsbury said: ‚ÄúThe local community grieves with them today, Ebrahim (the father) and the family‚Äôs world has been shattered in the cruellest of ways and one which no family should ever have to experience. ‚ÄúTalha was a truly sweet-natured, helpful, respectful and friendly kid, and it is incredibly difficult to reconcile this Talha with the suicide bomber at an Iraqi oil installation. ‚ÄúMy thoughts and prayers are obviously also with those killed at the oil installation and their families. ‚ÄúIt is disturbing to see how relaxed he looks in the Isis photographs allegedly taken just prior to his suicide mission. He looks at peace. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs ready to go and meet his maker. This is a clear indication of just how successful the evil Isis groomers have been in poisoning and brainwashing Talha and kids like him. ‚ÄúWe must defeat Isis in mosques and communities across the country. This is a generational struggle and everyone must be willing to rise to the challenge. Importantly, it‚Äôs a struggle which can only succeed if it is one which is led by Muslims themselves.‚Äù West Yorkshire police said: ‚ÄúThe police have been made aware of media reports with regard to the death of a British national in Iraq.

2015-06-15T08:13:24Z,world,World news,Dewsbury in 'utter shock' over Talha Asmal's death in Iraq suicide bombing,"Community leaders have been left shocked by the death of a teenager believed to have become Britain‚Äôs youngest suicide bomber after being ‚Äúgroomed‚Äù by Islamic State. Talha Asmal, 17, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, who reportedly detonated a vehicle fitted with explosives while fighting for the militant group in Iraq, was described as ‚Äúa loving, kind, caring and affable teenager‚Äù by his devastated family. Despite his death not being officially confirmed, his family said images released through an Isis-linked Twitter account showing a young man named as Abu Yusuf al-Britani appear to depict their son. Qari Asim, an imam at the Makkah Masjid mosque who was awarded an MBE for his efforts to build bridges between communities in Leeds since the 7 July 2005 terror attacks, said Isis leaders were acting ‚Äúlike paedophiles‚Äù by grooming young men. ‚ÄúThe community is in utter shock and a sense of disbelief that a young lad from Yorkshire is said to [have] become Britain‚Äôs youngest suicide bomber,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIsis is running a sophisticated social media campaign and the community is concerned their faith is being used by hate preachers and internet groomers to manipulate their religion.‚Äù Farooq Yunus, from the Zakaria mosque in Savile Town, Dewsbury, said the whole system had failed the boys. ‚ÄúI think we have failed. Not just the people in here ‚Ä¶ the council, the police, the community,‚Äù he told BBC Radio 5 Live. Pictures released by Isis online show Talha smiling as he stands by a black Toyota SUV giving the militant group‚Äôs signature one-finger salute. Another shows the teenager clutching a rifle as he sits cross-legged on a mat alongside two other armed men, apparently taking instruction from a uniformed militant in a crudely furnished operations room. Lorraine Barker, executive principal of Mirfield Free Grammar and Sixth Form, where Talha was studying, told the Times he was very quiet and private and a ‚Äútypical teenager‚Äù. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt draw any attention to himself, he was just a conscientious student,‚Äù she said. The 17-year-old lived at the family‚Äôs terraced home with his mother Noorjaha, 38, and father Ebrahim, 42, before he left for Syria via Turkey in April on a Thomas Cook flight with his next-door neighbour and best friend Hassan Munshi, the brother of Britain‚Äôs youngest convicted terrorist Hammad Munshi. In a damning statement, Talha‚Äôs family lashed out at Isis for preying on his ‚Äúinnocence and vulnerability‚Äù. They said: ‚ÄúHe never harboured any ill will against anybody nor did he ever exhibit any violent, extreme or radical views of any kind. Talha‚Äôs tender years and naivety were, it seems however, exploited by persons unknown, who, hiding behind the anonymity of the worldwide web, targeted and befriended Talha and engaged in a process of deliberate and calculated grooming of him. ‚ÄúWhilst there, it appears that Talha fell under the spell of individuals who continued to prey on his innocence and vulnerability to the point where, if the press reports are accurate, he was ordered to his death by so-called Isis handlers and leaders too cowardly to do their own dirty work. ‚ÄúWe are all naturally utterly devastated and heartbroken by the unspeakable tragedy that now appears to have befallen us.‚Äù The family said that Isis did not represent Islam or Muslims ‚Äúin any way, shape or form‚Äù. Isis statements on Saturday named Britani ‚Äì the 17-year-old‚Äôs nom de guerre ‚Äì as one of four suicide bombers. The others were said to be a German, a Kuwaiti and a Palestinian. All four were photographed by Isis standing beside SUVs. The suicide attacks are understood to have occurred in Salahuddin province, near one of Iraq‚Äôs largest oil refineries, as part of a larger military offensive by the militant group. Shahid Malik, a former government minister and a friend of the Asmals, described them as ‚Äúa beautiful, caring, peace-loving and incredibly humble family‚Äù. The former MP for Dewsbury said: ‚ÄúThe local community grieves with them today, Ebrahim and the family‚Äôs world has been shattered in the cruellest of ways and one which no family should ever have to experience. ‚ÄúTalha was a truly sweet-natured, helpful, respectful and friendly kid, and it is incredibly difficult to reconcile this Talha with the suicide bomber at an Iraqi oil installation.‚Äù Charlie Winter, a researcher at counter-extremism thinktank the Quilliam Foundation, said the short amount of time the teenager spent in Syria before he died was an unusual feature of the case. ‚ÄúHe was reported to have left the UK in March, now we‚Äôre in June and we‚Äôre told he has blown himself up ‚Äì that‚Äôs a quick turn around. He was chosen soon after he arrived,‚Äù said Winter. Isis would have deliberately selected a young British person to act as a suicide bomber as it is more provocative and likely to generate publicity, Winter continued. ‚ÄúThey have used young people and children on suicide operations for a while now. The youngest I‚Äôm aware of is 14. Displaying Talha‚Äôs face without a mask, making clear who he is, saying that he was British, they would have calculated this would have caused a media storm.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-15T04:00:19Z,world,World news,Iran's next parliamentary elections ‚Äòcould be on a par with Turkey‚Äô,"President Hassan Rouhani unofficially kicked off next February‚Äôs parliamentary elections before a gathering of provincial governors on 26 May. ‚ÄúNo political or sectarian belief should be discounted, for they are based in religion, science, and personal beliefs, and of course elections without competition are impossible,‚Äù Rouhani said. ‚ÄúWe have different ideas in our society, and all are free to express their ideas. This is why we have various parties and persuasions.‚Äù Rouhani‚Äôs comments suggest he hopes to prepare the way for increased reformist participation in the majles (parliament). The president suggested he would resist attempts by far-right, fundamentalist elements to improperly leverage money, influence, or advertising in order to influence voters. ‚ÄúHopefully no one will be told that so-and-so from the government, the Revolutionary Guards, the military, the media, the regional or local government, or the mosques, supports so-and-so as a candidate for the majles,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSuch talk constitutes poison for otherwise healthy elections. All officials and people in positions of power are duty bound to serve the interests of the nation as a whole and not those of [particular] political parties or individuals.‚Äù Has this given any encouragement to the reformists? In an interview with Tehran Bureau, a member of the Islamic Iran Participation Front, a leading party suspended since 2009, expressed cautious optimism. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs certainly come out swinging, but he‚Äôll eventually tone down the intensity as time passes,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe may be demanding today that these elections be on a par with those of Finland and the UK in terms of openness and freedom, but ultimately he‚Äôll have to temper his expectations to something resembling Turkey‚Äôs elections. If his strategy gets results, it‚Äôll be a step forward, since it should translate to more moderates and reformists and fewer fundamentalists in the majles.‚Äù Fundamentalists have held a majority in the 310-seat majles since 2004, when they overturned a reformist majority, and changing this will not be easy. The fundamentalists‚Äô predominance goes back to an election when the Guardian Council, which vets candidates, disqualified around 4,000 reformist hopefuls, including 80 sitting members. In 2004, only 50% of those eligible voted, compared with 66% in 2000. Four years later, in 2008, only 51% of eligible voters participated after the Guardian Council disqualified around 2000 candidates and only 29 reformists won seats. The turnout in Tehran was just 30%. By the time of the 2012 parliamentary election, the political situation had been transformed by the authorities‚Äô response to the street protests after the disputed 2009 presidential election. Iran‚Äôs conservatives referred to the protests as the ‚Äòsedition‚Äô and to protestors and their alleged supporters as ‚Äòseditionists‚Äô ‚Äì so justifying the continuing house arrest of Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, presidential candidates in 2009 and leaders of the Green Movement, which emerged in the protests. In the 2012 parliamentary elections there was a boycott by reformist parties, including the Islamic Iran Participation Front, the Mojahedin of the Islamic Revolution Organisation, and Karroubi‚Äôs National Trust Party. The Executives of Construction Party, led by pragmatic conservative Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, also kept aloof. The reformists then cried foul when the authorities announced a 64% turnout. ‚ÄúObviously there was foul play,‚Äù the Islamic Iran Participation Front member alleged. ‚ÄúThe Revolutionary Guards interfered by supporting certain candidates. Considering that all the reformists boycotted the elections and a large percentage of the voters still had the 2009 elections on their minds, only a Revolutionary Guard intervention could explain such a high turn-out.‚Äù Several prominent individuals from more moderate conservative parties explicitly confirmed this. Parliamentary deputy Ali Mottahari told the majles in May 2012: ‚ÄúDespite its successes, one of the major failures of the ninth majles elections was the degree to which the Revolutionary Guards entered the political arena and offered active, open support to the candidates of their choice. Many candidates, both those who won and those who lost, have confirmed this.‚Äù
Mohammad-Reza Bahonar, a parliamentary deputy from Tehran and the first deputy speaker, made allegations of rigging to the reformist newspaper Etemad at the time. ‚ÄúIn these elections, I was told I would be ranked fifth (in Tehran), but when the results were tallied, I was 25th,‚Äù he said. For next February‚Äôs election, the reformists‚Äô fears centre on the possibility that they or even candidates close to Rouhani‚Äôs government will be disqualified en masse.
A staff member at the politics desk of the moderate newspaper Ebtekar told Tehran Bureau: ‚ÄúTo an extent, Rouhani‚Äôs decisive victory in [the presidential election of] 2013 restored the people‚Äôs confidence in the electoral process: the rulers here seemed to have learned a lesson from 2009, and they weren‚Äôt willing to take quite such a big risk again. Of course it‚Äôs possible that there were some small cases of fraud in smaller cities and rural areas, but there was no sign of the kind of mass, systematic fraud that occurred in 2009 and 2012.‚Äù Concerns around mass disqualifications can be explained in part by recent statements by Ahmad Jannati, 88, chairman of the Guardian Council since 1992. ‚ÄúThe leadership of the Guardian Council has not forgotten the ‚Äòsedition‚Äô as it relates to those candidates who would participate in the elections,‚Äù Jannati told the May gathering of municipal governors. ‚ÄúThe sedition, which occurred after the 2009 elections, was soundly defeated, but its goal was nothing less than the overthrow of the government, and the supreme leader has said that sedition is our ‚Äòred line.‚Äô‚Äù Jannati‚Äôs comments suggest that conservative factions within the governing apparatus are set on continuing revenge against the reformists and the Green Movement, and therefore have no intention of opening up the political arena. But there is clear, and unresolved, tension here with what Rouhani has said. Many prominent reformist politicians, some of whom received prison sentences after the 2009 protests, have yet to comment. Even Mohammad Khatami, the former president still seen by many as the leader of the reform movement, has not talked about the elections in any public appearances over recent months. The chances that the reformists will submit a comprehensive list of candidates for the elections are slim. But if reform-minded politicians hope to clear fundamentalists out of parliament and the government, they could support a list of moderate technocrats.
Some reformists adopted a similar strategy in the 2013 presidential election when Khatami decided against running and former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was disqualified. They threw their support behind the moderate Rouhani to stop a fundamentalist candidate getting elected.
Such a strategy could have considerable support among voters. In the small village of Lasjerd, 170km east of Tehran, a 55-year-old melon farmer named Akbar, who once voted for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president, said he would support whoever Rafsanjani recommended in order to curb ‚ÄúHezbollahis‚Äù, or fundamentalists. ‚ÄúThey cut our bread and water, our medicine, and they filled their own pockets,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey used these sanctions, which devastated the farmers, to further enrich themselves, and now that this [Mohammad Javad] Zarif [the foreign minister leading talks with world powers] is trying to get the sanctions lifted, these bastards are trying to sabotage it! They‚Äôre trying to stop the agreement, so I‚Äôll vote for whoever can keep them out of power.‚Äù Shaghayegh, a 26-year-old reformist and law student at Tehran‚Äôs science and technology university, said she would vote against ‚ÄúFrankensteins and Draculas‚Äù in the parliament. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt mind voting in some sane people ‚Äì as long as I know there won‚Äôt be any funny business.‚Äù Shaghayegh is not optimistic over wider political reform. ‚ÄúIf a bunch of cowardly moderates take over...all we can hope for... is that they don‚Äôt muck things up further. They could at least let Rouhani and Zarif pursue their foreign policy, and maybe they could push some good proposals for the economy. But first we have to get rid of the people who are in control now.‚Äù A similar argument came from a Tehran-based reformist journalist, who argued next February‚Äôs elections were of the ‚Äúutmost importance‚Äù given the wide powers of the majles, including over the selection of ministers. ‚ÄúIn the event that many reformist candidates are not disqualified, there may be considerable room for a competition that decides who controls the majles,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis would not necessarily translate into a democratic transformation of the legal sphere. The biggest gains will probably be seen over the economic situation and corruption. Although [wider] democracy is undoubtedly an urgent matter, the precarious political conditions simply don‚Äôt allow it at present.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-15T01:38:11Z,world,World news,Fate of al-Qaida's 'Uncatchable' Algerian militant in the balance after US air strike,"Dubbed ‚ÄúThe Uncatchable‚Äù for staying at large for so long, and ‚ÄúMr Marlboro‚Äù after his cigarette smuggling operation to fund jihad, Mokhtar Belmokhtar became one of al Qaida‚Äôs most notorious operatives. Belmokhtar was reportedly killed by a US air strike on Saturday, according to statement from the Libyan government. But his death has not been verified and the truth about the man who lost an eye fighting the Russians in Afghanistan ‚Äì or possibly in Algeria, fighting the military, depending on which source you believe ‚Äì has always been as evasive as the man himself. Belmokhtar was known best for masterminding the 2013 attack on an Algerian gas plant that killed 39 hostages, and was carried out by his own al-Qaida offshoot known as the ‚ÄúMasked Men brigade‚Äù, or ‚ÄúSigned in Blood battalion‚Äù. This is not the first time he has been reported dead. In 2013 Chadian troops claimed to have killed him in an operation against a terrorist base in northern Mali, only for him to resurface months later, linked to terror attacks in Mali and Niger.
Born in Algeria in 1972, Belmokhtar professed to being inspired by jihad as a schoolboy and travelling to Afghanistan aged 19 to train with al-Qaida. He later claimed that during his time in Afghanistan he was in touch with leading lights of the terror group including Abu Qatada and the recently released Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi. Belmokhtar returned to Algeria in 1993 and joined the country‚Äôs fledgling jihadi movement, going on to become a leading figure in the militant Armed Islamist Group (GIA) and later the Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), a breakaway group formed by former GIA commander Hassan Hattab. In early 2007, it was announced that GSPC would merge with al-Qaida to form al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Belmokhtar took control of an AQIM battalion. But in 2012, after in-fighting among AQIM commanders, Belmokhtar broke away once again to form his own group, the Signed in Blood battalion, or ‚ÄúThose Who Sign in Blood‚Äù. It was under this moniker that he masterminded the 2013 attack against the In Amenas gas facility in south-eastern Algeria, the group‚Äôs first big operation. The militants seized control of the facility, taking hundreds of people hostage. By the time the Algerian army stormed the facility four days later, 39 foreign hostages were dead, including six Britons. An Algerian security guard and 29 militants also lost their lives. In recent years, Belmokhtar reportedly made money smuggling cigarettes and other contraband across the Sahara and extorting ransoms for western hostages. In January, he emerged to praise the shooting at satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris and called on Muslims to carry out similar attacks. In August 2013 it was announced that the Signed in Blood battalion would join with another al-Qaida offshoot, the Movement for the Unity and Jihad in West Africa, to form the al-Mourabitoun group. In May this year, Belmokhtar was forced to deny that he had pledged allegiance to Islamic State after a faction within al-Mourabitoun defected. He issued a statement reiterating his allegiance to al-Qaida and its chief, Ayman al-Zawahri.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-14T23:48:07Z,world,World news,London house to become museum to Indian activist,"A six-bedroom house in north London is set to become a museum to one of India‚Äôs most revered ‚Äì but still controversial ‚Äì campaigners and political figures after being bought for ¬£3m-¬£4m by a provincial government in the south Asian country. Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, a politician, social activist and lawyer who drafted much of the Indian constitution, lived in the house in London‚Äôs Primrose Hill while a student at the London School of Economics in 1921 and 1922. Ambedkar was a Dalit, or ‚Äúuntouchable‚Äù, from the lowest rank of the tenacious social hierarchy known as caste. However, he escaped poverty and discrimination to win scholarships to study economics at LSE and Columbia University, New York and to qualify as a barrister in London. A fierce critic of the caste system, he became India‚Äôs first law minister when the country won its independence in 1947. Ambedkar is still revered today by Dalits there and across the world. The house will be turned into a museum and library, with rooms available for Dalits from India who are studying, like Ambedkar, at the LSE on two new scholarships. It will need up to ¬£1m of refurbishment and conversion work if the sale goes through. Arun Kumar, general secretary of the UK-based Federation of Ambedkarite and Buddhist Organisations, said: ‚ÄúIt is a historical place. [Ambedkar] came to London and was exposed to an atmosphere of freedom and equality and went back to India building on everything he had seen and saying, ‚ÄòIf in western countries there is equality, why not in India?‚Äô‚Äù Ambedkar was born a Hindu but converted to Buddhism before he died in 1956, convinced that caste discrimination was intrinsic to his original faith. Remembered as one of the founders of modern India, his portrait hangs in many homes of India‚Äôs 200 million Dalits. ‚ÄúHe is a hero to us, a saint, like our god,‚Äù said 38-year-old Radhika Kumar, a Dalit and a cleaner in Delhi.
Though some of the harsher aspects of the caste system have been moderated in recent decades, Dalits still suffer systematic discrimination. In some regions, particularly the poor northern states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, caste tensions can lead to violence. When a statue of Ambedkar in Punjab state was vandalised this weekend, roads were blocked by local Dalits in protest. Ambedkar‚Äôs views on caste contrasted with those of Mahatma Gandhi, the revered independence leader whose statue was recently unveiled in Parliament Square. Gandhi condemned caste discrimination, but believed its causes were not religious and that parts of the caste system should be maintained. The museum is being funded by the government of Maharashtra, the Indian state where Ambedkar‚Äôs family was from. Dalits are an important constituency in India and wooed by politicians. Next year is the 125th anniversary of his birth. ‚ÄúThis is a historical moment for us because it is not just a house but has the emotions of all Indians attached to it,‚Äù Rajkumar Badole, Maharashtra‚Äôs minister of social justice, said in London this year. Badole pledged too to fund an Ambedkar chair at the LSE and scholarships. Supporters of the museum say it will have relevance in the UK, too. Research by the British government has found evidence of caste discrimination among Britons of Asian origin in the workplace and in schools. Legislation is due to be introduced this year to make caste discrimination an offence in Britain. ‚ÄúIt is important to send a message here, too,‚Äù said Kumar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-14T17:11:24Z,world,World news,Rome feels pressure of migration buildup with makeshift refugee camp,"While passengers at Tiburtina, one of Rome‚Äôs main train stations and just a 10-minute ride from the Colosseum, tinkled on the station‚Äôs piano or stopped off for an ice cream, outside there were more urgent matters at hand. Officials were trying to channel a water tap into a makeshift refugee camp that was opened on Saturday, prompted by the growing number of migrants left in limbo after France increased security at the Italian border. Around 100 migrants are staying in tents in the shadow of the station, a modern transport hub from where travellers are whisked on high-speed trains to cities including Florence and Milan. The camp was opened in a joint effort by the Italian Red Cross and local authorities, after a growing number of migrants began gathering at the train station. Alessandro Radicchi, the Red Cross‚Äôs director for combating poverty across Italy‚Äôs rail network, said the worsening situation prompted the organisation to act. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre here because they‚Äôve closed the border; people wanted to go elsewhere in Europe but now the border‚Äôs been blocked. This isn‚Äôt just a problem today, this is a problem in general,‚Äù he said. News that France has increased security checks on its border has prompted many migrants to temporarily halt their journey north. Although under the EU law asylum seekers must register at their first point of arrival, most of those arriving in Italy by sea avoid doing so in order to travel onwards to northern Europe. The new refugee camp is already equipped with beds and toilets. On Saturday an idle digg ing machine signalled the hasty clearing of the building site to make way for the refugees, who have fled from countries including Syria and Eritrea.
But Radicchi was clear that the camp is only a temporary solution; work will begin on Sunday on transforming a disused hotel into accommodation for up to 200 migrants. Italy‚Äôs prime minister, Matteo Renzi, has called for changes to the EU regulation on where asylum seekers must first register. ‚ÄúIf the European Council chooses solidarity, good. If it doesn‚Äôt, we are ready for plan B. But it would above all hurt Europe,‚Äù he told Italian daily Corriere della Sera, without giving further details. Renzi criticised the EU‚Äôs ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù proposal to relocate 24,000 refugees from Italy and said he would discuss the migration crisis in upcoming meetings with the UK‚Äôs prime minister, David Cameron, and French president, Fran√ßois Hollande. The Italian premier also faces an internal battle, with rightwing politicians rebelling over plans to distribute boat migrants across Italy. Regions across the north were asked by the government to take in 7,500 new arrivals, a request flatly refused by rightwing leaders. The refugee camp at Tiburtina is also intended to take pressure off a nearby Eritrean cultural centre, Baobab, where dozens of migrants queued for meals. Food donations were piled up alongside toys for the children, who passed their time blowing bubbles and playing with rainbow-coloured windmills. Despite the calm atmosphere, the centre‚Äôs Eritrean cook said none of the migrants wanted to stay in Italy. Although he made the sea journey a decade ago, the cook chose not to give his name for fear of the impact it could still have on his family back home. New arrivals were equally scared of the backlash they could face from authorities in Eritrea, where citizens face compulsory military conscription and torture is widespread according to Amnesty International. ‚ÄúIf you go back, you go to prison,‚Äù the cook said. Outside the Baobab centre, a group of young Eritrean men said they planned to travel onwards to France. They had intended to head north by bus or train and were surprised to hear they may now face difficulty in crossing the border. Their counterparts who have already reached north-west Italy tried in vain to enter France on Saturday. Protesting migrants were met with riot police who pushed them back to Ventimiglia, a border town on the Italian coast. Austria and Switzerland have followed France in tightening controls and returning migrants, putting greater pressure on Italy, which has seen more than 50,000 people arrive by sea so far this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-14T16:23:30Z,world,World news,Israel defends Gaza conflict as 'moral war',"Israel has claimed the Israel Defence Forces‚Äô operation in Gaza last summer was a moral, defensive war conducted in accordance with international law. The publication on Sunday of a report written in conjunction with Israeli government ministries was timed to occur days before the release of the findings of an investigation by the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) into possible war crimes by Israel and Hamas. The UNHRC report, with which Israel refused to cooperate, is expected to serve as the foundation for the Palestinian case against Israel in the international criminal court, which is due to be submitted on 25 June. Israel‚Äôs report highlights efforts by the IDF to avoid harm to civilians and presents the operation as an ‚Äúimperative necessity‚Äù in response to incessant rocket fire from Gaza and the threat of Hamas infiltrating through its tunnels. It states that the goals were ‚Äúrestoring security to Israeli civilians living under Hamas rocket fire‚Äù and ‚Äúdismantling the Hamas tunnel network used to infiltrate Israel‚Äù. The majority of the 250-page report is dedicated to showing Hamas‚Äôs human rights violations and war crimes. It holds Hamas responsible for many of the Palestinian civilian casualties caused by the IDF, arguing that they were unavoidable due to Hamas‚Äôs tactics of embedding militants among civilian populations, whether in homes, schools, mosques or UN buildings. A section is dedicated to Palestinian fatalities, which deals largely with what it claims are Hamas‚Äôs duplicitous numbers. According to the IDF, a total of 2,125 Palestinians were killed during the two-month war, 761 of them, or 36%, uninvolved civilians, including 369 children and 284 women. The UN figures are far higher, with at least 1,483 civilians killed (of a total of 2,205), of whom 521 are children and 283 are women. Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said the report presented ‚Äúthe true picture‚Äù of what happened in Gaza and that the IDF was committed to international law because ‚ÄúIsrael is a democracy and a moral country with values‚Äù. He added: ‚ÄúWhoever wants to automatically ‚Äì and without foundation ‚Äì blame Israel, let them waste their time with the UN Human Rights Council report.‚Äù Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri rejected the report, saying ‚ÄúIsraeli war crimes are clear because they were committed in front of live cameras,‚Äù Reuters reported. The Palestinian Authority also rejected the report. ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äôs decision to deny having targeted civilians in Gaza is the logical extension of what it did in the Gaza Strip,‚Äù Ihab Bseiso, a government representative, told AFP.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-14T15:57:59Z,world,World news,Art of diplomacy: how French schools abroad cope with censorship,"It is one of the great allegorical paintings celebrating the French revolution: Liberty Leading the People, by Eug√®ne Delacroix, shows a barefoot, bare-breasted woman ‚Äì representing Marianne, the female symbol of the republic ‚Äì brandishing a tricolour in one hand and a bayonetted musket in the other, leading the people over the bodies of the fallen. Pupils at the French Lyc√©e in Kuwait, however, might be forgiven for missing the symbolism of the celebrated work of art used to illustrate their history books after local censors slapped a large red sticker over the robust goddess Liberty. A few pages on, another allegorical revolutionary painting, La V√©rit√© Am√®ne la R√©publique et l‚ÄôAbondance (Truth Bringing the Republic and Abundance) by Nicolas de Courteille, has been given a similar dressing down ‚Äì or dressing up ‚Äì with another judiciously placed sticker.
Pupils opening their science books to the chapter, ‚Äútransformations linked to puberty‚Äù and ‚Äúhow the female reproductive organs work‚Äù will find the human bodies crudely effaced with a black felt-tipped pen and illustrations of reproducing animals scribbled over. Drawings of the male anatomy have not been defaced, though. France‚Äôs ministry of education, which is responsible for ensuring all schools study the same approved list of text books, insisted there was nothing it could do. ‚ÄúAll French establishments abroad are subject to the laws of the countries in which they are established, unlike embassies and consulates, ‚Äú a spokesperson told Le Monde. ‚ÄúObviously they have to work with the social and political reality of each country. There‚Äôs no obligation to use the textbooks that are just there to support the work of the teachers.‚Äù The wielders of the black pens came from somewhere within the ministry of education in Kuwait City, the paper said. The French Lyc√©e in Kuwait City opened in 1988 and has 1,350 pupils, about 13% of them French, and the rest either local children or the children of expats of various nationalities. It is a private school that comes under the foreign and education ministries in Paris and is regarded as an official ‚Äúpartner establishment‚Äù. Under article 2 of French regulations, such educational establishments must offer teaching ‚Äúsimilar to that offered in France in a state school‚Äù. However, the lyc√©e‚Äôs internal regulations clearly state it is subject to Kuwaiti law. Peter Gumbel, a writer on education and a professor at Paris‚Äôs prestigious Institut d‚Äôetudes Politiques, known as Sciences Po, admitted the censorship was surprising in the wake of the rush to uphold republican values after the January attacks on Charlie Hebdo newspaper and a Jewish supermarket in Paris.
However, he said it was part of France‚Äôs realpolitik approach to foreign policy. ‚ÄúThe French do this kind of soft diplomacy through schools and culture very well. It‚Äôs a grotesque irony that after Charlie Hebdo and the defiant call for repbulican values and standing up for freedom, but it‚Äôs a classic clash of different interests and the foreign office has clearly won this battle.‚Äù Delacroix‚Äôs painting, which hangs in the Louvre, is credited with influencing Victor Hugo‚Äôs novel Les Mis√©rables and inspiring the Statue of Liberty, a gift from the French to New York. The Louvre, which is due to open a ‚Ç¨500m (¬£362m) museum in the United Arab Emirates capital, Abu Dhabi, in December, is expected to face similar problems from the country‚Äôs conservative authorities.
However, museum officials insist the UAE has not censored any nudity or religious symbolism in the works going on display. These include a Jewish Torah from Yemen, an ancient Hindu statue, a Buddha and works evoking African animism, according to art experts. ‚ÄúNo work has been refused,‚Äù a source told AFP Sophie Grange, a spokeswoman for the Louvre, insisted the Abu Dhabi museum was not simply a branch of the French museum but independent and it was up to the UAE to decide what was put on display. Titian‚Äôs fully-clothed but voluptuous Woman with a Mirror will be among the paintings sent to Abu Dhabi from the Paris Louvre. The emirati museum has also acquired an unseen portrait by Pablo Picasso called Portrait of a Lady, that is unlikely to raise any embarrassed eyebrows. Art and the censors: recent battles In September last year, the UN criticised the US for ‚Äúwidespread censorship‚Äù in prisons and schools, revealing that books containing the work of C√©zanne, Picasso and Van Gogh, among many others, are banned from Texan state prisons for containing ‚Äúsexually explicit images‚Äù. In May, a local Fox news station in the US was accused of being ‚Äùsexually sick‚Äù by art critics after blurring the breasts in Pablo Picasso‚Äôs cubist painting Women of Algiers, when reporting its record-breaking sale. Also in May, western authors were warned about the censorship of politically and sexuality sensitive subjects in Chinese translations of their work, with the Pen American Centre reporting that many of the expurgations currently occur without the author‚Äôs knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-14T15:31:02Z,world,World news,Bilderberg 2015: TTIP and a travesty of transparency,"Weaving down the alp came the Bilderbus, taking delegates on a whistlestop tour of the Tyrol. Buzzing along above it, at a crazy height, was its helicopter escort. I swear I could have bounced a euro off the roof of the coach and into the blades. If I‚Äôd wanted to have been dropped by an NSA sniper. In the coach below it must have been like being in a washing machine. No wonder the delegates on board looked grumpy. Sitting up front, Jessica T Mathews had a face like thunder. Although maybe the cause of her headache wasn‚Äôt the helicopter, but rather the howling contradiction of being on the steering committee of the world‚Äôs most secretive policy summit and also on the advisory council of Transparency International USA.Also on the bus was James Wolfensohn. A fellow member of TI-USA‚Äôs advisory council, Wolfensohn was the joint winner of their 2014 ‚Äúintegrity award‚Äù, an honour he shared with that other famous transparency campaigner, and the world‚Äôs fourth-biggest arms company, Raytheon. Previous winners of the integrity award include (and I kid you not) Coca-Cola, General Electric and the then secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton. The great email deleter herself. I think someone should tell TI-USA what ‚Äútransparency‚Äù means. There may have been a mix-up somewhere down the line. When it comes to transparency, this year‚Äôs Bilderberg summit fails in every way imaginable. Three prime ministers, two foreign ministers, one president, no press conference. No public oversight. Just a bunch of senior policymakers locked away for three days with some incredibly powerful corporate lobbyists, discussing subjects intimately related to public policy. Subjects such as ‚Äúglobalisation‚Äù and ‚Äúcurrent economic issues‚Äù, which in practical terms mean the giant trade deal, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). Writhing around the issue of TTIP is an unholy knot of politicians and vested interests, their tails knotted together in the pitch black of an Austrian sewer. I‚Äôm going to put on some gloves, stick a clothes peg on my nose, and see if I can tease apart one corner of this filthy interconnected mass. Here goes. First, I‚Äôll pick a policymaker: how about Mikael Damberg? He‚Äôs the Swedish minister for enterprise and innovation, and 2015 is his first time round the table at Bilderberg. Sliding on to the chair next to him is Carola Lemne, the chief executive of the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise. This lobby group describes itself as ‚ÄúSweden‚Äôs largest and most influential business federation‚Äù, and it‚Äôs extremely in favour of TTIP. As its website says: ‚ÄúSince 2007, the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise has worked actively to promote the success of these negotiations‚Äù. Cosying up on the other side of Damberg is the chairman of Volvo, Swedish businessman Carl-Henric Svanberg. His company is a strong supporter of TTIP. Just last year, the official Twitter account of the Volvo Group tweeted: ‚ÄúA comprehensive ‚Ä™#TTIP agreement would reduce regulatory and trade barriers and boost US competitiveness.‚Äù Damberg is trapped by Swedes. He slithers down under the table to try to make his escape. But there in the half-light he meets Swedish billionaire Jacob Wallenberg, the chairman of the industrial conglomerate Investor AB. Wallenberg was quoted by the US embassy in Sweden at the end of last year as saying: ‚Äú‚Ä™TTIP is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. With a strong agreement consumers will be the beneficiaries.‚Äù Lobbyist, company chairman, billionaire investor: a close-harmony chorus of influence pushing policy behind closed doors. And the chorus gets louder: Wallenberg and Svanberg, along with five fellow Bilderberg participants, are members of the influential European Round Table of Industrialists. And the ERT is a member of ‚Äúthe European Business Alliance for TTIP‚Äù. Layer upon layer of lobbying. And this is still just a fraction of the big business pro-TTIP influence at Bilderberg. And all of it happening behind closed doors: out of sight of a disenchanted, disenfranchised electorate, 500 of whom gathered in the centre of Telfs on Saturday to protest against the way Bilderberg does business.
‚ÄúPublic representants: let us know what‚Äôs going on,‚Äù implored one placard. ‚ÄúStopps silents,‚Äù urged another. There was anger everywhere at the how elected politicians had tucked themselves away like this with big business. I spoke to Ursel Herbst, who had driven all the way from Cologne for this demonstration. ‚ÄúThe way Bilderberg hide is stupid, like naughty children.‚Äù She smiled a tired smile. ‚ÄúI do not respect them.‚Äù It‚Äôs ironic that the Bilderberg conference puts on such a show of power: taking over an alp for a ‚Äúprivate meeting‚Äù, closing down the airspace, shutting roads, hovering helicopters over their buses ... and yet the net result is they come across as a bunch of naughty kids. They‚Äôll just have to console themselves with exerting a huge influence on large swaths of transatlantic policy. It may not be much but it‚Äôs something.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-14T15:12:37Z,world,World news,Israeli artists protest against 'anti-democratic' government,"More than 2,000 Israeli artists have signed a petition warning against what they call anti-democratic measures being taken by the government against freedom of expression. The petition, which includes the signatures of prominent figures from film, theatre, cinema, dance, literature and music, claims artists are being silenced for views that do not fall in line with those espoused by the new government‚Äôs ministers. ‚ÄúWe, the signatories below, are the voices you are trying to silence. We hope that Israel will not deteriorate into a country in which artists that express their views are put on a ‚Äòblack list‚Äô.‚Äù The petition was launched after the newly installed minister of culture and sport, Miri Regev, announced she would re-examine the criteria for state funding of the arts. At a meeting with representatives of cultural institutions on Thursday, Regev said that because her Likud party had received 30 seats in the Knesset [parliament], she had the legitimacy to decide how to allocate the funds. ‚ÄúI decide the criteria; I can decide which institutions get money,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe government doesn‚Äôt have to support culture. I can decide where the money goes. The artists will not dictate to me.‚Äù A day earlier, Regev threatened to cut government funding for the Elmina Theater in Jaffa because its manager, the Israeli-Arab actor Norman Issa, refused to perform in a settlement in the Jordan Valley with the Haifa Theater troupe of which he is a member. The petition was also a response to last week‚Äôs decision by the education minister, Naftali Bennett, to stop performances for high-school students of a play by the al-Midan Theater in Haifa entitled A Parallel Of Time, which tells the story of Walid Daka‚Äôs time in prison for torturing and murdering the Israeli soldier Moshe Tamam in 1984. ‚ÄúThe question here is whether the ministry of education in Israel should pay for schoolchildren to go see a play that shows sympathy to a murderer and a terrorist,‚Äù Bennett told the Associated Press, adding, ‚Äúand my answer is no.‚Äù Responding to the petition on Sunday, Regev said ‚ÄúThe signatories do not know me. It‚Äôs a bit uncivilised to make frightening statements about potential McCarthyism that are entirely baseless.‚Äù Supporters of Regev and Bennett claim that Israelis should have the freedom to create art as they please, but if it is disparaging to the state, there is no reason why it should be state-funded. Among the signatories on the petition are the actor Gila Almagor, dancer, choreographer and BatSheva Dance Company artistic director Ohad Naharin and author Yehonatan Gefen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-14T14:58:14Z,world,World news,Zoo animals on the loose and deaths feared after Georgia floods,"Tigers, lions, wolves and bears are feared to be still on the loose in Georgia‚Äôs capital, amid chaotic scenes brought by devastating floods that have reportedly killed 12 people. Images of an escaped hippopotamus being cornered in one of Tbilisi‚Äôs main squares after escaping from the city‚Äôs zoo have emerged, while other animals have been killed or remain at large.
Heavy rainfall turned the Vere river ‚Äì which flows through the capital ‚Äì into a torrent that swept away dozens of buildings and cars. At least 12 people have been killed, according to news agencies, while others are missing. The army has been mobilised to help. ‚ÄúThe damage is substantial,‚Äù the prime minister, Irakli Garibashvili, told reporters. He also called on residents to stay at home as the search for the animals continued.
Carcasses of wild animals that have been shot dead litter the streets and tangled heaps of wreckage scar a large area around Tbilisi‚Äôs zoo after Saturday night‚Äôs flash flood. The zoo itself has been almost totally destroyed, says its director, with most of its animals either drowned or shot after escaping. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an unbelievable tragedy,‚Äù said Zura Gurielidze as he surveyed his stricken zoo park. Three of his staff were among those reported dead in the disaster. Among them was 56-year-old Guliko Chitadze, who was attacked by one of the zoo‚Äôs tigers last month and lost an arm. She had just returned to work, telling fellow staff she did not blame the tiger for what happened. She lived in the zoo grounds with her husband, who died with her. The escaped hippo was cornered in one of the city‚Äôs main squares on Sunday and subdued with a tranquilliser gun, the zoo said. Some other animals also have been seized, but it remained unclear how many were still on the loose.
Police with rifles were still combing the tree-covered hills above the zoo looking for the escaped animals as the remains of a hyena shot dead lay in the nearby grounds of Tbilisi State University. It had chased one of the staff, according to a police officer, who then locked himself in a shed and called for help. There are also reports of people using their hunting rifles to shoot animals they see, and Gurielidze appealed for them not to, in case they could be saved. There were no immediate reports that any of the other fatalities were due to animal attacks. Among the biggest tragedies for the zoo is the loss of a rare white lion called Shumba. It had become one of the zoo‚Äôs biggest attractions after they paired it with a dog to keep it company, after Shumba‚Äôs mother stopped caring for him. They became friends and could be seen playing and sleeping together right outside the zoo‚Äôs main offices. Images on Tbilisi city hall‚Äôs Facebook page showed roads submerged by floodwater and landslides with many vehicles washed away, while rescue workers carried people on their shoulders through waist-high water. Such heavy rain is unusual for this time of year. But many say uncontrolled development in the area made things worse, with the drainage system overwhelmed. The zoo, situated at the bottom of a valley in the city, was right in the target of line of the surge of water that resulted. The head of Georgia‚Äôs Orthodox church, Patriarch Ilia II, said the flood was punishment for the zoo being built by the country‚Äôs former communist rulers. ‚ÄúThey ordered that all the crosses and bells in churches be melted down and the money used to build the zoo,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI am very sorry that Georgians fell so that a zoo was built at the expense of destroyed churches.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-14T13:59:13Z,world,World news,Climate activists leave Tate Modern after all-night protest against BP,"Climate activists have left the Tate Modern‚Äôs Turbine Hall after an unauthorised all-night performance lambasting BP‚Äôs sponsorship of the gallery. On Saturday night, protesters from Liberate Tate faced down officials who had threatened to call the police if they did not leave when the museum closed at 10pm.
The Tate‚Äôs head of safety, Dennis Ahern, addressed the group along with a member of the Metropolitan police. He said the gallery respected the British right to protest but warned them: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a duty of care to make sure members of the public leave the licensed premises at the time of closing‚Äù. If the activists did not leave, he said the gallery may ask the police to step in. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a back-down,‚Äù said Mel Evans, a Liberate Tate activist and author of Artwash: Big Oil and the Arts, after it became clear the protesters would be allowed to spend the night inside the hall. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs a sign of how much the groundswell of public opinion has shifted that the Tate doesn‚Äôt feel like they can shut down this discussion.‚Äù The group spent 25 hours scrawling words of warning about climate change in charcoal on the sloping floor of the hall. They brought with them sleeping bags, food and even a toilet, which they placed behind a bamboo frame and curtain. They left at 1pm on Sunday. Thousands of visitors to the Tate filed past the protest on Saturday as if it was another work at the prestigious gallery, but on Sunday officials closed the Turbine Hall to the public. Liberate Tate have staged 14 protest performances since 2010 calling on the Tate to ditch its deal with BP, which is worth around ¬£224,000 a year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-14T13:34:01Z,world,World news,Chinese police 'find suicide note' in case of 'left behind' children deaths,"Police investigating the deaths of four Chinese children who drank pesticide after being abandoned by their migrant worker parents say they have found a suicide note near the eldest victim‚Äôs body. ‚ÄúThanks for your kindness. I know you mean well for us, but we should go now,‚Äù the note said, according to the state-run China News Service. The four siblings, a boy and three girls aged five to 14, were found dead on Tuesday at their home in a rural village outside the city of Bijie in Guizhou, one of China‚Äôs poorest provinces. Initial reports suggested they had poisoned themselves after their parents abandoned them and left the village to find work elsewhere. There are an estimated 60 million ‚Äúleft behind‚Äù children in China, who are often put into the care of elderly relatives or unsupervised when their parents migrate to the cities looking for work. The mother of the four children returned to the village on Friday from Guangdong province, China‚Äôs manufacturing heartland, where she had been working in a toy factory. ‚ÄúI did not shoulder my responsibility for them,‚Äù Ren Xifen, 32, told China‚Äôs official Xinhua news agency, after arriving home to see her children‚Äôs bodies before their cremation.
‚ÄúI have truly failed them,‚Äù she added, according to the China Youth Daily newspaper. ‚ÄúHow I wish I could go with them.‚Äù Ren admitted she had left them behind in early 2014 after a dispute with her husband involving domestic violence. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt dare not go home,‚Äù she said. In March this year, the siblings found themselves completely alone after their father also left the village. ‚ÄúI am illiterate and cannot even write my own name. I wanted them to perform well in school, unlike me, living a hard life,‚Äù Ren said. State-controlled media outlets have sought to downplay the government‚Äôs possible responsibility for the tragedy, but at least two local officials have been sacked. Facing public outrage over the deaths, China‚Äôs prime minister, Li Keqiang, was forced to step in on Friday to promise an urgent inquiry. ‚ÄúSuch a tragedy cannot be allowed to happen again,‚Äù he said. Investigating officers have determined it was a mass suicide, Xinhua reported on Saturday, citing the letter police said they had found at the children‚Äôs home. Liu Xin, a senior police officer, told the China News Service his team had used handwriting analysis to determine that the couple‚Äôs 14-year-old son had written the note. ‚ÄúI made a vow that I wouldn‚Äôt live over the age of 15,‚Äù the note said, according to the news agency. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 14 now. I dream about death, and yet that dream never comes true. Today it must finally come true.‚Äù Chinese bloggers reacted to claims about the existence of a suicide note with suspicion. ‚ÄúIt is still uncertain whether there is a note or whether its contents have been tampered with,‚Äù Xu Xin, a law professor from the Beijing Institute of Technology, wrote on Weibo, China‚Äôs equivalent to Twitter. The deaths are the second tragedy involving ‚Äúleft behind‚Äù children in Bijie in recent years. In 2012, five young boys from the same area died after lighting a fire in a dustbin inside which they had taken shelter from the cold.

2015-06-14T09:00:08Z,world,World news,‚ÄòEveryone is hurting‚Äô: Paris‚Äôs luxury hotels running on empty,"Rather than yield to the ambient gloom, the most recent of Paris‚Äôs luxury hotels, the Peninsula, chose to crack open the bubbly and forget about the crisis. Having opened last August, on Avenue Kl√©ber, the management held an official launch party in April. Two thousand happy people, including the chain‚Äôs top customers and celebrities such as actors Zhang Ziyi and Michelle Yeoh, gathered, savouring champagne, canapes and buckets of caviar. But this beano was no more than a ray of sunshine in a very cloudy sky. Luxury hotels in the French capital have been having a hard time since the new year. Clement Kwok, CEO of Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, which owns the Peninsula group, acknowledged this quite openly: ‚ÄúIn January, February and March 2015 the market was weak,‚Äù he said during a brief visit to Paris. Nor is he alone. Didier Le Calvez, general manager of Le Bristol, puts it rather more bluntly: ‚ÄúThe first quarter was catastrophic.‚Äù This is partly the fault of the terror attacks in early January, which scared off much of the luxury hotels‚Äô custom, in particular foreign visitors, who make up 80% to 90% of their clientele. Above all it affected ‚Äúthe two core targets for luxury hotels: visitors from the United States and the Middle East‚Äù, says Gwenola Donet, head of the hotels and hospitality department, for France, at Jones Long Lasalle, a specialist in luxury property. The tension sparked by the Charlie Hebdo attack also discouraged Asian and South American visitors.
‚ÄúIt scared everyone,‚Äù Le Calvez says. The cost for Le Bristol, despite its choice location on Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor√©, was steep. ‚ÄúWe had cancellations worth ‚Ç¨400,000 ($456,000) in the week following the violence.‚Äù But ‚Äúeveryone is hurting‚Äù, he adds. ‚ÄúNor is Le Bristol the worst off ‚Ä¶ between January and April it was the top hotel in Paris [in terms of revenue] and in second place for average expenditure.‚Äù Fran√ßois Delahaye, general manager of the Plaza Ath√©n√©e, also registered a drop in custom between January and March, but this had little impact. It reopened in August 2014, after eight months‚Äô refurbishment, and soon ‚Äúrecovered its market share‚Äù, Delahaye says. Indeed on some occasions, such as the recent visit by the Indian prime minister, the hotel was full. The truth is that the events of January merely accentuated a decline in trade for luxury hotels in Paris. The downturn started in the last quarter of 2014. Le Bristol is typical of this two-stage trend. Revenue fell by 9% in the fourth quarter of 2014, but plummeted by 20% in the first three months of this year. ‚ÄúIt started in October,‚Äù Donet explains, coinciding with the Plaza relaunch and the availability of 200 brand-new suites and rooms at the Peninsula. So in autumn 2014, ‚Äúwith a glut in supply, demand failed to keep pace‚Äù, Donet adds. Indeed, last July, she forecast ‚Äúa choppy passage‚Äù for the capital‚Äôs top hotels. Prior to that, the select group of luxury establishments ‚Äúenjoyed an exceptional situation‚Äù, Donet says. In 2013 the Ritz and the Crillon closed, at a time when work was still under way at the Plaza and Peninsula. So at that point, ‚Äúthere were more customers and fewer luxury hotels on the market‚Äù. But the underlying trend was towards overcapacity. ‚ÄúBetween 2007 and 2017 the capacity of luxury hotels in Paris will have increased by 60%. Which is huge!‚Äù she points out. The Ritz and the Crillon will be reopening in the next two years, so by 2017 luxury accommodation in Paris will amount to 1,850 rooms and suites, as against only 1,150 in 2007. The rise in supply has not so far triggered a price war. ‚ÄúWith the social charges we have to pay, it‚Äôs quite impossible to lower our prices,‚Äù Delahaye says. The response is the same at Le Bristol, where the management is determined to ‚Äústay on course‚Äù, rejecting ‚Äúa policy of lower prices‚Äù. However, speaking off the record, some sources have alleged that the luxury hotels ‚Äúhave drastically reduced prices to maintain or improve their occupancy rate‚Äù. Donet confirms this: ‚ÄúPrices dropped by 4% between October and March.‚Äù But the trend is bottoming out. In March, she explains, they only fell by 1.5% to flatten out at an average charge for a room in a luxury establishment of ‚Ç¨1,000. This is substantially higher than in London, where the average price is about ‚Ç¨700 a night. In practice, the main factor pushing prices down has been the lack of customers from the Middle East. They like to take suites, the most expensive apartments in these hotels and the main money-spinner. A night in a suite at the Peninsula costs ‚Ç¨25,000. The Plaza Ath√©n√©e charges ‚Ç¨27,000 for its 500-square- metre suite. ‚ÄúNot including breakfast,‚Äù Delahaye says. Over the year this accommodation is nevertheless occupied almost two-thirds of the time.
The question everyone is asking is how much longer the gloom will last. The management at both the Plaza and Le Bristol believe that trade will improve in the summer. ‚ÄúThere is rising enthusiasm this summer and we have already had a lot of bookings,‚Äù says Delahaye. At Le Bristol the mood is similarly upbeat. ‚ÄúLe Bourget, which opens in mid-June, draws a large, up-market clientele to Paris,‚Äù Donet says. The sort of visitors who book plenty of suites. However, many people in the trade think that, in addition to the problem of overcapacity expected to last another five to six years, luxury hotels in general are inevitably heading for a period of restructuring. In 2017, 11 luxury hotels will be in competition in the French capital, or maybe 12, counting the hotel slated to be built at the former La Samaritaine department store. Ultimately about half a dozen will emerge from the pack. ‚ÄúThe remaining four or five will need to be repositioned,‚Äù Donet predicts. It will be a tough battle, but the key factor in the outcome will be geographical position. Moreover, women customers will have the final say, because what matters is being close to the luxury goods outlets. ‚ÄúIt will be just too bad for a hotel closer to a M√©tro entrance than to the Dior boutique,‚Äù quips the head of a well-placed contender. So properties on Avenue Montaigne or close to Faubourg Saint-Honor√© or Place Vend√¥me ‚Äì the Plaza, Bristol, Ritz or Crillon ‚Äì will enjoy a certain advantage. The other threat is the boom in boutique hotels, which offer upscale accommodation but charge ‚Ç¨350 to ‚Ç¨550 on average per night. Following the trend set by Costes, on Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor√©, La R√©serve entered the fray in autumn 2014. Others are expected to follow. Word has it that a five-star JK Place, with 32 rooms, will open on Rue de Lille in 2017.

2015-06-14T08:00:07Z,world,World news,Russia hasn‚Äôt lost that air show feeling,"As advertisements go, the 1986 film Top Gun was perhaps not the most helpful tool for sales executives seeking commissions by flogging the MiG fighter aircraft. Four of them got shot down by the heroic combination of the US Navy‚Äôs Pete ‚ÄúMaverick‚Äù Mitchell (Tom Cruise) and Tom ‚ÄúIceman‚Äù Kazanski (Val Kilmer), while two others were so spooked by the brilliance of the world‚Äôs police force that they retreated to base, thereby allowing Cruise to rediscover that loving feeling with Kelly McGillis‚Äôs Charlotte ‚ÄúCharlie‚Äù Blackwood. In the real world, the Russian maker of the MiG is less easily spooked by the Americans and their allies, and it has developed much improved sales lines. We saw that at the Farnborough air show last year when, despite the sanctions against their compatriots, the Russians embarrassed fellow delegate David Cameron by waltzing into Hampshire to exhibit their gear. They will be doing the same this week at the UK trade fair‚Äôs biennial wingman, the Paris air show ‚Äì where Rostec Corporation is organising the presence of nine Russian military contractors exhibiting a range of combat aircraft at one of the most important and prestigious international exhibitions in the industry. Or, as Maverick himself once put it: ‚ÄúThis is what I call a target-rich environment.‚Äù Ed Miliband for No 10: place your bets now There‚Äôs a view in the City that the market is always right and the best predictor of the future. Members of this school always supply numerous examples to bolster their argument, while tending to ignore cases that seem to undermine the thesis, typically small blips such as, er, the financial crisis. A slightly less costly example of the market calling things completely wrong is Betfair, the online betting group which the City failed to understand had been massively overpriced when it floated in 2010. It took a change in business model ‚Äì and executive team ‚Äì to reverse all that, and since then the shares have soared. So as the company reports full-year results this week, what is the market expecting? Well, a nice rise in revenues and profits, which partly explains why investment banks remain extremely bullish on the shares (60% of them say buy, according to IG Group). Still, there are those who are now worrying that the City is being too optimistic again ‚Äì much like all of those betting markets last month which made Ed Miliband the favourite to walk through the door of 10 Downing Street. Among them? The amusingly entitled Betfairpredicts.com. The mountain moves, the rate stays still If you mention Mont Blanc during conversations in the Square Mile, folk tend to assume that you‚Äôre asking to borrow their fountain pen. But a less brand-obsessed City faction will also have heard of the Alpine mountain ‚Äì and a few of them might actually have climbed it. One is Kristin Forbes, a US economist and member of the Bank of England‚Äôs monetary policy committee, who‚Äôs giving a talk at the London School of Economics this week, entitled: ‚ÄúDisinflation and Deflation: Where? Why? and What‚Äôs Next?‚Äù. It will be timely, as a day earlier the latest data on UK inflation will be released, with economists expecting a slight rise after last month‚Äôs reversal of prices. Of course, any tick-up in the inflation rate will again prompt talk that Forbes and her fellow committee members might soon consider changing the UK‚Äôs interest rate, for the first time since March 2009. Which brings us back to Forbes‚Äôs hobby. Mont Blanc was once said to stand 4,807m high, only to be revised up to 4,810.9m in 2007, and back down by 45cm to 4,810.45m in November 2009. So the height of the mountain scaled by Forbes has changed more recently than the UK interest rate she helps to set.

2015-06-13T23:09:10Z,world,World news,Climate change conference in Paris later this year is of global importance,"What is the significance of the Paris climate talks? In 30 years, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere will have risen to such an extent that temperatures will be 2C higher than in pre-industrial times, scientists say. Beyond that temperature, there will be devastating environmental consequences: worsening storms, extreme heat waves and rising seas. The most important decision to be taken in Paris will therefore be to agree, through a binding commitment, that 2C is the highest acceptable limit of global warming on Earth. All other decisions taken in Paris will follow as a consequence of that agreement. What are the problems that lie ahead for delegates in making that commitment work? To keep any temperature rise to a 2C limit, delegates will have to call for pledges from countries and power blocks (such as the European Union) and then settle individual targets. That will be extremely tricky. In addition, once particular cuts have been agreed in carbon outputs, a commission will have to be set up to monitor nations‚Äô emissions in order to check that they are keeping to their pledges. What will be the cost? The high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today are the handiwork of the industrialised developed nations. Developing countries will therefore demand a clear commitment from them to provide financial support to help them to adapt to a hotter planet and to militate against the worst effects of global warming. By 2020, the amount of money needed for this purpose is expected to be around $100bn a year. Pledges to reach such a funding level will be another key milestone that will have to be reached in Paris. What other issues will have to be faced? Some nations face more than damaging impacts from global warming They can foresee complete devastation. Large tracts of Bangladesh coastline, the Maldives and some Pacific archipelagos face inundation, for example. Some form of compensation for populations who could lose their homelands will therefore need particular attention and a mechanism will have to be agreed in Paris to ensure that these people are properly recompensed for future generations. In addition, new forms of tide, wave and wind power plants will have to be developed to replace generators that rely on fossil fuels. A method to allow systems created in one country to be shared with other countries in an equitable manner will have to be agreed to ensure the rapid take-up of technologies that will be crucial to efforts to keep global warming within bearable limits. Will the pope‚Äôs intervention make a difference? At times the debate over climate change has suffered from being forbiddingly technical and arcane. A high-profile and impassioned intervention by a popular pope, who has already managed to win admiration from non-Catholics as well as inside the church, is bound to focus minds ahead of Paris.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-13T21:59:18Z,world,World news,Endgame looms for Greek crisis as both sides take debt negotiations to the brink,"Eleventh-hour talks to avoid Greece defaulting on its debt and plunging the eurozone into crisis intensified at the weekend with Greek officials flying to Brussels only days before a meeting of Europe‚Äôs finance ministers that many regard as a final deadline. Almost five months after he assumed power, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has come to a fork in the road: either he accepts the painful terms of a cash-for-reform deal that ensures Greece‚Äôs place in the single currency or he decides to go it alone, faithful to the vision of his anti-austerity Syriza party. Either way, the endgame is upon him. Thursday‚Äôs meeting of eurozone finance ministers is viewed as the last chance to clinch a deal before Athens‚Äôs already extended bailout accord expires on 30 June. ‚ÄúIt is in his hands,‚Äù Rena Dourou, governor of the Attica district, told the Observer. ‚ÄúTsipras, himself, is acutely aware of the historic weight his decision will carry.‚Äù The drama of Greece‚Äôs battle to keep bankruptcy at bay has, with the ticking of the clock, become ever darker in tone. What started out as good-tempered brinkmanship has turned increasingly sour as negotiations to release desperately needed bailout funds have repeatedly hit a wall over Athens‚Äôs failure to produce persuasive reforms. ‚ÄúIt is as if they work in Excel and we work in Word,‚Äù said one insider. ‚ÄúThere just seems to be no meeting of minds.‚Äù Last week the mood became more febrile as it emerged that Eurocrats, for the first time, had debated the possibility of cash-starved Athens defaulting. The revelation came amid reports that Germany‚Äôs chancellor, Angela Merkel, was resigned to letting Greece go. Berlin is by far the biggest contributor to the ‚Ç¨240bn bailout propping up the near-bankrupt state. Last week, the EU council president, Donald Tusk, ratcheted up the pressure, warning: ‚ÄúThere is no more time for gambling. The day is coming, I am afraid, that someone says the game is over.‚Äù On Saturday Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis hit back, telling Radio 4 that he did not believe ‚Äúany sensible European bureaucrat or politician‚Äù would seriously contemplate the country‚Äôs euro exit. ‚ÄúThe reason why we are not signing up to what has been offered is because it is yet another version of the failed proposals of the past,‚Äù he said. The persistent demand of foreign lenders for pension reform, given the scale of austerity already undertaken in a country that has seen its economy shrink by more than a quarter in the past five years, was not only silly but plainly a deal-breaker, he said. ‚ÄúIt is just the kind of proposal that one puts forward if you don‚Äôt want an agreement,‚Äù insisted the academic-turned-politician. With both sides seemingly determined to take negotiations to the brink, the nerve-racking game of poker was raised a notch yesterday as Tsipras‚Äôs closest aides resumed talks with technical teams in Brussels. The EU and IMF say the ball is now in Greece‚Äôs court. Following his rejection of their demands as ‚Äúabsurd‚Äù last week, the young premier is hoping the officials will be able to bridge outstanding differences on the basis of a new set of ‚Äúcounter proposals‚Äù. Publicly, the government says it is closer than it has ever been to a deal, but in private EU sources say the Greek government‚Äôs proposed measures still run too close to the ‚Äúred lines‚Äù that Tsipras has refused to cross in terms of pension cuts and labour deregulation. In a statement released by his office , the leader was quoted as saying that, if a compromise agreement was viable, his government would support it, no matter what. ‚ÄúBut if what Europe wants is division and continuation of subordination we will again ‚Ä¶ say the big no and we will give battle for the dignity of the people and our national sovereignty,‚Äù the statement quoted him as saying. Tsipras‚Äôs robust defence of what Greek people believe are their rights has played well with a population both worn out and humiliated by crisis. Support for him has never been higher. Neither, ironically, has support for Greece‚Äôs continued membership of the eurozone itself. ‚ÄúEven if we achieve very little, we will know that we have held our heads high,‚Äù said Vangelis Pavlatos, an actor, in what has become a common refrain. But the prolonged talks and the uncertainty they have engendered has also sounded the death knell for the real economy and a banking system that has been depleted by worried savers. Panic is on the rise; so, too, is the unmistakable sense that whichever way they go ‚Äì and an extension of the current programme may well be the end result ‚Äì pride will soon be replaced by hardship. ‚ÄúEveryone knows that a new deal is going to mean more austerity,‚Äù said Takis Leonidopoulos, among the hundreds of accountants who took to the streets on Friday in protest over projected tax rises. ‚ÄúBut if there is no deal we will likely see capital controls, our bank savings will be up in the air, salaries could stop, it‚Äôll be ordinary people who will pay the price. What we are looking at is misery either way,‚Äù he sighed. ‚ÄúThe big question ‚Äì and be sure to write this ‚Äì is how are the Greeks going to react?‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-13T21:57:54Z,world,World news,EU states in ‚Äòdeals to shut Eritrean borders‚Äô,"UN officials and human rights organisations are increasingly concerned at what they believe are secret deals being drawn up between Eritrea and European Union nations, which may involve the regime being given money or having sanctions lifted in return for imposing tougher border controls. Norwegian state secretary J√∏ran Kellmyr is under fire for travelling to Eritrea ‚Äì often called ‚ÄúAfrica‚Äôs North Korea‚Äù because of the repressive and murderous regime of President Isaias Afwerki ‚Äì to forge a ‚Äúreturn‚Äù agreement enabling Norway to send back Eritrean refugees.
It is believed Italian and British officials have been to the Eritrean capital Asmara on similar errands. The Home Office said it would not comment. Eritreans are the second largest group, behind the Syrians, of those migrating to Europe. About 200 leave each day and the money sent home by the diaspora is almost exclusively responsible for supporting those who remain. A UN report last week issued a damning picture of a ‚Äúculture of fear‚Äù within Eritrea, citing random arrests, torture and systematic rape, military service that equated to slave labour, political persecution and executions. But Kallmyr stressed it had been written without access to the country, relying on accounts of Eritreans who have fled. Norway and the UK toughened their stance on asylum requests from Eritrea earlier this year, controversially citing a Danish report, Eritrea ‚Äì Drivers and Root Causes of Emigration, which suggested many Eritreans were fleeing for economic reasons. The report caused outrage and was widely discredited; two of its authors resigned. Leslie Lefkow of Human Rights Watch attacked it as ‚Äúa political effort to stem migration‚Äù. But the UK issued new guidance on Eritrea, citing the Danish report, and since then the refusal rate for asylum applications from Eritreans has risen from 13% in 2014 to 23% so far this year. ‚ÄúKey European figures have been heading to Asmara and it‚Äôs clear there is a real political will to solve the migrant crisis by getting the borders shut from the Eritrean side ‚Äì it‚Äôs a very dangerous tactic,‚Äù said one UN insider. There are fears the Eritreans could re-impose a shoot-to-kill border operation. At present, there is a UN and EU arms embargo on Eritrea, a travel ban and an asset freeze on listed individuals. A Home Office spokesperson said there were no immediate plans to change policy towards Eritrea but added: ‚ÄúWe will carefully consider the findings of the United Nations report.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-13T21:03:02Z,world,World news,‚ÄòRecruiter‚Äô of UK jihadis: I regret opening the way to Isis,"The ‚Äúgodfather‚Äù of the British jihadi movement, who recruited dozens of young men to fight in foreign wars, has said he now regrets opening the way for people to join terror groups such as Islamic State and al-Qaida. Abu Muntasir, 55, who lives in Suffolk, was one of the first influential propagandists in the UK for a radical Islamist message. Active in the 1980s and 1990s, he helped to radicalise ‚Äúthousands‚Äù of young Muslims, encouraging many of them to travel to fight in wars in Afghanistan, Kashmir, Burma, Bosnia and Chechnya. Among the first to invite speakers to the UK from abroad who preached violence and hatred to disaffected Muslims, he distributed speeches from hate preachers Ali al-Timimi, now serving a life sentence in the US for inciting terrorism, and the late Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in a controversial CIA drone attack in Yemen that also left his children dead. In a documentary by Emmy-winning film-maker Deeyah Khan to be shown on ITV this week, Muntasir and several former extremists speak of their deep regret at the decisions of hundreds of UK Muslims to travel to join Isis in Syria and Iraq, and of their efforts to educate young people away from the same paths they followed as angry young men. Muntasir, who is seen sobbing in the film as he recounts the horrors of his own days on battlefields in Bosnia, Afghanistan and Burma, is described as one of the ‚Äúfounding fathers of western jihad‚Äù and admitted that he worked to ‚Äúcreate the link and clear the paths. I came back [from war] and opened the door and the trickle turned to a flood. I inspired and recruited, I raised funds and bought weapons, not just a one-off but for 15 to 20 years. Why I have never been arrested I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù He said it was not until he realised, while fighting in the jungles of Burma with armed resistance groups, that what was going on was not a holy war, but nothing less than the butchery and exploitation of young Muslims, that he turned his back on violence. ‚ÄúIf people want to call me a coward, fine ‚Äì I‚Äôm a coward.‚Äù Muntasir, founder and chief executive of Jimas, said it was time for people who supported Islamic extremism to ask why their sons and daughters were being blown up for false ideals in ‚Äúunwinnable wars‚Äù. Hate, he said, is not what Islam or the prophet taught. ‚ÄúIt was a virus with which we infected a generation. Now it has proliferated,‚Äù said one of Muntasir‚Äôs former followers, Alyas Karmani, now a peace campaigner, youth worker and imam in Bradford. He said the psychology used by Isis to groom youngsters is similar to that which Muntasir used to bring in followers. ‚ÄúHe was a charismatic father figure. It was exciting and there was an energy. I was an activist, never an extremist. For me I always had an inner voice telling me that a lot of this is not right. ‚ÄúBut I was angry. I had a very violent dad. I had a lot of racism. I was angry and frustrated. So we planted this virus. And the kids today have caught it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the same attraction then as it is for young people now. A range of factors that is the same for Muslims and non-Muslims. Young people want to change the world, to feel loved and have a sense of belonging, a sense of attachment. That might just be in a foreign field.‚Äù Speaking to the Observer, Karmani said that to tackle the numbers of young people leaving the UK for Syria, Iraq and Libya, it was important that the debate should change to understanding the human elements at play. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about ideals ‚Äì 90% of them never subscribe to the ideals ‚Äì it‚Äôs other factors that are a draw. This is the new rock and roll; jihad is sexy. The kid who was not very good-looking now looks good holding a gun. He can get a bride now, he‚Äôs powerful. The Isis gun is as much a penis extension as the stockbroker with his Ferrari. ‚ÄúThere is a fundamental disconnect with our young people. Youth work used to be a brilliant vehicle but that‚Äôs all gone in the cuts, so who connects with young people now?‚Äù He said many first- and second-generation immigrants were forced to live double lives. ‚ÄúI do blame the parents. If their kids aren‚Äôt able to talk about what‚Äôs going on in their lives outside the house, that‚Äôs a massive problem. ‚ÄúIf they have to be repressed about sex, about their friendships, who are they going to talk to? It makes them exposed and vulnerable. We have to stop seeing Muslims as ‚Äòother‚Äô. They‚Äôre not. See them as the same.‚Äù In making the film, Khan, ‚Äúborn in the west to parents from the east‚Äù and forced to give up a singing career because of extremists threats to her and her family, said she had been shocked by many attitudes she found in talking to young people across the UK: ‚ÄúI was horrified to find so many people with backgrounds like mine turning to extremism.‚Äù Exposure: Jihad ‚Äì A British Story will be on ITV at 10.40pm on 15 June",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-13T17:46:00Z,world,World news,"Clear out African migrants, Lega Nord governor orders in stand-off with Rome","After breezily winning re-election earlier this month as governor of the northern Italian region of Veneto, Luca Zaia, a star of the surging anti-immigrant Northern League party, wasted little time showing voters that he had heard and understood their demands. Claiming that the sight of African migrants would have a ‚Äúdevastating effect‚Äù on the tourism industry, Zaia called on Friday for local officials across his region to begin clearing all reception centres and other housing occupied by migrants near tourist areas. His decision reflected the dismay that had been expressed to him in ‚Äúevery way and in every place‚Äù, Zaia claimed, adding that all further placements should be halted. This was the latest salvo in an escalating standoff between Zaia ‚Äì and other rightwing governors in Liguria and Lombardy ‚Äì and the government in Rome, where a fight has broken out over a plan by the centrist prime minister, Matteo Renzi, to distribute tens of thousands of African migrants and refugees across Italy. Renzi‚Äôs proposal ‚Äì which called on Veneto and other northern Italian regions to accept 7,500 migrants ‚Äì was unveiled the day after the Northern League made significant gains in regional elections. ‚ÄúThe immigrant bomb is coming,‚Äù read one headline in Il Giornale, the rightwing newspaper, which claimed that the proposal was revenge by Renzi after his ‚Äúelectoral thumping‚Äù. Zaia and other rightwing governors responded to the proposal with a resounding ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. Italy has been praised for its role in saving refugees and migrants amid the debate across Europe over how to handle the humanitarian crisis. But the issue has created political upheaval, where it has helped to propel the Northern League ‚Äì which was considered a fringe and even wacky extremist party only a few years ago ‚Äì into the big league. The Lega Nord, as it is known in Italy, now also holds the governing seat in Lombardy, which is next door to Veneto. A League-backed candidate from Silvio Berlusconi‚Äôs Forza Italia won the bellwether race in Liguria, and the League even won 20% of the vote in the leftwing bastion of Tuscany in regional elections on 31 May, much to the dismay of Renzi, who was the mayor of Florence before he became prime minister. At a conference on Friday, the prime minister took a verbal shot at one of his big critics, the Lombardy governor Roberto Maroni, who was sitting next to him. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no good thinking that globalisation is a justification to close in on yourself,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere are lots of people in the world today who bark at the moon, live off fear and think that the only way is to lock yourself in at home.‚Äù In Veneto, a region which was traditionally the stronghold of the centre-right Christian Democrats but has tilted to the right in recent years, allies of Zaia portray the governor as a moderate force within the Northern League who stands apart from the bombastic leader of the party, Matteo Salvini. They insist that votes for the League do not represent a call for radical policies hostile to immigrants or the euro, which Salvini has also railed against. ‚ÄúThe Lega of Veneto is the Lega of Zaia. The votes are for Zaia. Yes, he is Lega, but he is a man of the government, who knows our people and is bringing a positive change. He is not an extremist,‚Äù says Luigi Brugnaro, a businessman and candidate for mayor of Venice who is facing a runoff election on Sunday . In Mestre, a mainland suburb of Venice, locals asked about Zaia point out ‚Äì first and foremost ‚Äì that he is not a crook, which is welcome news after a spate of corruption scandals in the region over the years. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not stealing,‚Äù said one woman stepping out of a tram. But Zaia‚Äôs rise in politics has included episodes that reveal his opposition to things deemed ‚Äútoo foreign‚Äù for Italy. As minister of agriculture in the government of Berlusconi, the former conservative prime minister, he defended authorities in Lucca and Milan when they began cracking down on restaurants that served non-Italian food, saying ethnic restaurants that served kebabs, sushi and Chinese food should ‚Äústop importing container loads of meat and fish from who knows where‚Äù and use only Italian ingredients. He denied ever having eaten a kebab ‚Äì or even a pineapple ‚Äì because they were not Italian. Zaia did, however, endorse McDonald‚Äôs McItaly burger, a move that the Guardian‚Äôs food writer criticised at the time as a ‚Äúmonstrous act of national betrayal‚Äù. Zaia responded tartly: ‚ÄúWith regret we are forced to deliver bad news to this kind of left: Stalin is dead. And we can safely bet he never set foot in a McDonald‚Äôs.‚Äù
The question now is whether the Northern League can become Italy‚Äôs leading conservative party, permanently displacing Forza Italia, which has steadily lost influence. Some analysts see Salvini‚Äôs rise as a blip at a difficult time in Italy, where continuing economic hardship, combined with a political void on the right given Berlusconi‚Äôs fall from grace and advancing age, means that the Northern League leader is temporarily gaining momentum. In Venice and its mainland outskirts few Italians mention Salvini as a viable political leader. The rightwing politician regularly makes headlines with outrageous assertions, like his frequent calls for Roma camps to be razed. Last week he suggested that migrants with scabies, a contagious skin condition, ought to give Renzi a ‚Äúbig hug‚Äù. While Salvini has sought to distance himself from the Northern League‚Äôs radical early history as a secessionist party ‚Äì it wanted to create a mythical-sounding country in northern Italy called Padania and frequently made prejudice assertions about ‚Äúlazy‚Äù southern Italians ‚Äì most analysts agree that the League will never be embraced fully in southern Italy, even if growing anti-immigrant sentiment has marginally increased Salvini‚Äôs appeal there. Lorenzo De Sio, a political scientist at the LUISS University in Rome, does not believe that Salvini‚Äôs Lega will muster more than 20% of the vote nationally because he is viewed as too extreme. ‚ÄúMany people who used to vote for Berlusconi don‚Äôt have radical attitudes towards immigrants,‚Äù he says.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-13T16:02:29Z,world,World news,Barcelona‚Äôs tourist hordes are target for radical new mayor Ada Colau,"On a rainy night in June last year, 2,000 people crammed into a public school auditorium in Barcelona‚Äôs El Raval district. As they waited for the presentation to begin, the buzz was deafening. All of them had come to hear about a new grassroots movement being launched by some of the city‚Äôs most prominent activists and academics. ‚ÄúWe want to occupy city hall and open it up to the people,‚Äù Ada Colau told them as she detailed a ‚Äúprocess of revolution and radical democracy‚Äù designed to hand back power to the citizens of Barcelona. One year later, Colau again called on Barcelona residents. This time, though, the setting was city hall. And Colau was no longer an activist aiming to fight power from the outside, but instead the city‚Äôs top leader. ‚ÄúI personally invite you come to the plaza and celebrate our unprecedented collective victory,‚Äù she wrote last week on her Facebook account, inviting residents to follow her swearing-in inside city hall from the plaza that sits just outside the emblematic building. ‚ÄúBut also because we know that in these next four years, when there are more people pushing from outside, we‚Äôll have more strength on the inside.‚Äù As one of the founders of the anti-eviction group Mortgage Victims‚Äô Platform, Colau has long been a familiar name in Barcelona. In 2013 she became one of the country‚Äôs most prominent voices of protest against a political and economic elite who had led the country into crisis when, during a parliamentary hearing on the hundreds of thousands of families who have been evicted from their homes, she pointed to a senior member from the Spanish Banking Association and declared: ‚ÄúThis man is a criminal and should be treated as such.‚Äù Months later, she was captured on camera being hauled away by police as she and other housing activists occupied a bank to demand that it negotiate with a man who was unable to pay his mortgage. On Saturday, Colau, 41, was sworn in as the mayor of Barcelona. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a victory of David over Goliath,‚Äù said a tearful Colau last month as news broke that her party, Barcelona en Com√∫, had earned the most votes in this city of 1.6 million people. Crowdfunded and guided by a collaborative platform that features input from more than 5,000 citizens, the leftwing coalition ‚Äì backed by Podemos ‚Äì earned 11 seats in the 41-seat assembly. ‚ÄúThis victory is thanks to the hard work of the thousands of people who‚Äôve shown politics can be done differently,‚Äù said Colau. She and her team will now push forward with what they call their emergency plan; a list of 30 measures aimed at creating jobs and fighting against job insecurity, guaranteeing basic rights and tackling corruption. Her salary as mayor will be slashed from ‚Ç¨140,000 to around ‚Ç¨35,000 a year, privileges such as official cars will be a thing of the past and bankers will be hauled into meetings to discuss how to halt evictions and turn the empty homes on their books into affordable housing. Leftwing parties with roots in Spain‚Äôs indignado movement now govern four of the five biggest cities in Spain; including Ahora Madrid and mayor Manuela Carmena in Madrid, as well as in Comprom√≠s in Valencia and Zaragoza en Com√∫n in Zaragoza. In C√°diz, A Coru√±a and Santiago de Compostela, leftwing coalitions that include Podemos are also set to govern. A tough road lies ahead for Colau ‚Äìnot only because her party, 10 seats short of a majority, will need to constantly form alliances to govern. As her party hands back the reins of the city to its residents and touts a new, participatory way of doing politics, it faces opposition from some who are deeply opposed to the idea. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the ideas of a city can be based on what a citizen‚Äôs assembly wants ‚Äì it‚Äôs absurd,‚Äù said Francesc de Carreras, a constitutional law professor at the Autonomous University of Barcelona. ‚ÄúDemocracy doesn‚Äôt mean that everyone expresses their desires and they come true by some miracle. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a good idea to have citizens participate in these things. We‚Äôre not the ones who have skills in these areas,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt go into a restaurant and tell them how to cook.‚Äù Others say that Colau‚Äôs main challenge will come from inheriting a city at a crossroads. ‚ÄúThe Barcelona model is in decline,‚Äù said journalist Marta Monedero, referring to the ideas that guided the city‚Äôs growth in the late 1980s and early 1990s and helped put Barcelona on the world map. ‚ÄúThe model was a way to understand the city and bring it closer to the people ‚Äì there wasn‚Äôt a lot of money so they came up with things like having lots of squares and intensifying the social fabric of the city through organisations.‚Äù Monedero recently co-edited a book called The Dream of Barcelona: A City in Which to Live or to See?, in which she and journalist N√∫ria Cuadrado asked residents from various sectors of society about the issues facing the city. What they found was that the model that had once been so successful in guiding the city was now deeply out of sync with everyday reality. Unlike in the late 1980s, today around 17% of the city‚Äôs population is foreign born. Housing activists say that some 15 residents a day were evicted from their homes in 2014. Like other cities across Spain, unemployment remains stubbornly in double digits, while the young and educated continue to leave the city in hopes of finding work abroad. The failure of policymakers to address these issues has created a climate of inequality that colours ordinary life in Barcelona, said Monedero. ‚ÄúNot just inequality between neighbourhoods, but also between residents and the tourists that come here.‚Äù The result is a city that has reached a tipping point, she said. ‚ÄúBarcelona is a liveable city right now, but could stop being that way if measures aren‚Äôt taken to correct these differences.‚Äù Colau said during the campaign that inequality is one of Barcelona‚Äôs biggest problems. ‚ÄúIn the past four years the difference between the most rich and more poor of the city has increased by 40%,‚Äù she said, pointing to neighbourhoods where the average income has increased six-fold, while other areas struggle with unemployment, home evictions and families who can‚Äôt afford their electricity bills. ‚ÄúAn unequal city is a city that can be broken easily, it‚Äôs an insecure city.‚Äù Another issue on Colau‚Äôs radar is tourism. Recent years have seen the number of tourists in Barcelona more than quadruple, from 1.7 million in 1990 to 7.5 million in 2013. This city is now the third most visited in Europe, with the annual number of tourists outnumbering residents four times over. For many years, these numbers were seen as a success story; with visitors leaving behind more than ‚Ç¨12bn a year in the city and supporting an estimated 100,000 jobs.
But persistent issues with noise, illegal tourist flats and rising real estate prices have led weary residents to draw battle lines in recent years against the seemingly never-ending tide of camera-toting, beer-swilling visitors. In Pla√ßa del Sol, in the district of Gr√†cia, construction workers hammer away inside a three-storey concrete building, slowly turning it into a 14-room hotel with a restaurant and a pool. In February, after several hundred people attended a protest against the construction of new hotels in the district, the soon-to-be hotel was occupied by activists, who turned it into a impromptu office to help those on the verge of being evicted from their homes. The group was dislodged by police earlier this month. The words ‚ÄúGr√†cia is not for sale‚Äù scrawled on the side of the building are now the only remnants of their three-month occupation to protest against the effects of rampant tourism on the city. Colau has vowed to put a moratorium on new licences for hotel and tourist apartments, in order to take stock of how many there are and how many each neighbourhood can realistically support. The hope, she said, is to avoid Barcelona ‚Äúending up like Venice‚Äù ‚Äì a city where locals have been pushed out by tourists. The city‚Äôs most central neighbourhoods have become overrun with hotels and illegal tourist lets, she said, leading to a spike in rents and the feeling among residents that they‚Äôre being expelled from their homes. Left unchecked, Colau said, mass tourism in Barcelona could kill off the very essence of the city that attracted the tourists in the first place. ‚ÄúMore and more tourists are disappointed when they visit Barcelona because in the centre of Barcelona they find a theme park. Everyone wants to see the real city, but if the centre fills up with multinationals and big stores that you can find in any other city, it doesn‚Äôt work.‚Äù Her goal is to distribute tourists across the city and crack down on the precarious, low-paying jobs that often proliferate in the industry. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre saying that we need to put conditions on the industry, such as restaurants and hotels, so that they better distribute the wealth.‚Äù The tourist tax, which currently is used for tourism promotion, will instead be directed towards providing basic services for the neighbourhoods most affected by the influx of visitors. Film-maker Eduardo Chib√°s, who captured the city‚Äôs polarised conversation about tourism in his documentary Bye Bye Barcelona, doubted whether moving tourists to other neighbourhoods would help address the problem. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just going to take the problems elsewhere,‚Äù he said, pointing to the series of protests sparked in La Barceloneta district last summer, after three naked Italians frolicked through the neighbourhood one Friday morning. ‚ÄúImagine the people that live there. They just exploded. La Barceloneta used to be a really nice place to walk around and to be with your family, and eat or have a drink. Now it‚Äôs become something very awkward.‚Äù He argued that tourists will inevitably end up drawn to the same areas. ‚ÄúTourists obviously go to the same places ‚Äì that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre here for,‚Äù he said, pointing to the masses that throng daily around Antoni Gaud√≠‚Äôs most famous work near his home in the Sagrada Familia neighbourhood. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs spectacular. Just incredible,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOne has to laugh at it, I‚Äôm not going to get bitter anymore.‚Äù The simpler solution, he said, lies in trying not to have as many tourists in Barcelona. Limits could be put on cruise ship tourists coming into the city, he said, while a crackdown on the thousands of tourist lets that aren‚Äôt legally registered with local authorities would help. ‚ÄúIf they found a great way of attracting people, I‚Äôm sure they can find a way of de-attracting them.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-13T15:11:49Z,world,World news,Woman who stripped on Malaysian mountain 'glad to be going back to UK',"A 23-year-old British woman who was deported from Malaysia on Saturday with three other tourists after spending three days in jail for posing partially naked on a sacred mountain said she was looking forward to getting back to Britain. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking forward to going home,‚Äù a smiling Eleanor Hawkins told reporters at the business class lounge in Kuala Lumpur international airport, where she was accompanied by a British consular official and airport security guards. She refused to comment further. She had arrived from the city of Kota Kinabalu, where she was detained, and will continue to the UK. The four, including two Canadian siblings and a Dutch man, were found guilty of an ‚Äúobscene act‚Äù for posing nude at the summit of Mount Kinabalu, which indigenous people believe holds a spirit. Photos of the group, the men in boxer shorts and the women with their torso uncovered, were posted on social media and caused a national uproar.
They were fined 5,000 Malaysian ringgit (¬£860) and sentenced to three days in jail from the time of their arrest, which meant they were free to go on the same day. Hawkin‚Äôs lawyer said the group were ignorant of local customs and stripped off as a challenge to each other at the summit, where the temperature was around 0C. After her conviction, Hawkins‚Äôs father Timothy said his daughter‚Äôs sentence was appropriate and fair. Indigenous people on the island believe the mountain holds the spirit of their ancestors, and some have suggested the disrespectful act caused an earthquake that killed 18 people days later. Only five of the 10 foreigners accused of stripping on the mountain were arrested. Hawkins was detained when she tried to board a flight to leave the country. Malaysian police say they have informed border guards to look out for the other five on the offence of public indecency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We emphasise that rebels are also firing at residential areas,‚Äù he said. The casualties were the result of landmine explosions and shelling by the pro-Russia separatists, he added. The truce brokered by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France is in its fourth month and has stemmed large-scale fighting, but skirmishes claim lives on both sides on an almost daily basis, and international monitors have warned of the threat of a bigger flare-up. Separatist officials accused Ukrainian forces of firing at the village of Oktyabrsky, near Donetsk, wounding two civilians, and shelling three districts of the city over the last day, according to the rebel DAN press service. At least seven people, including five civilians, were reported killed on Thursday, and more than 35 died last week in exchanges of mortar and rocket fire across the buffer zone established by the February truce. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe said on Thursday that despite assertions to the contrary, neither side has completed the withdrawal of heavy weaponry as agreed in the ceasefire deal. The UN estimates that at least 6,400 people have been killed in the conflict and more than a million have been forced to flee their homes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-13T11:53:57Z,world,World news,‚ÄòExtremist‚Äô sect threatens protests against Dalai Lama during UK visit,"This article is the subject of a column by the readers‚Äô editor Its followers believe it can help them achieve serenity, but Buddhism itself is under assault from a toxic campaign against its spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, that, it is alleged, is being encouraged by the Chinese authorities. The International Shugden Community, followers of a 300-year-old Buddhist sect, plans a series of protests against the exiled Tibetan leader before his visit to Britain this month, a week before he turns 80. ISC members have in the past disseminated images depicting the guru as a pig. They have described him as a ‚ÄúMuslim masquerading as a Buddhist‚Äù and compared him with Hitler. Now they plan to demonstrate when the Dalai Lama appears in Aldershot this month at a ceremony to remember victims of the Nepal earthquake. He is also reported to be appearing at the Glastonbury festival in a fortnight. The UK protests are being organised by the New Kadampa Tradition, which emerged in the 1990s and now has nearly 50 centres in the UK promoting Shugden practices. In preparation for his visit, the ISC and its supporters have inundated Twitter with tens of thousands of anti- Dalai Lama tweets that have caused offence to mainstream Buddhists. In the past, aggressive responses from Buddhists provoked by Shugden supporters have been filmed and posted on YouTube. Anticipating further tension, briefing notes prepared for the Dalai Lama‚Äôs visit and seen by the Observer encourage mainstream Buddhists not to react to ‚Äúprovocation‚Äù from members of the Shugden community. They urge followers: ‚ÄúDo not rise to the bait! All spokespersons and community members need to be warned to show a calm face in response to the Shugden supporters‚Äô now well-established tactic of deliberately provoking and filming responses to support their victimisation claims.‚Äù The advice underlines the unease felt within Britain‚Äôs Buddhist community about the increasingly divisive presence of the Shugden sect. Shugden followers accuse the Dalai Lama of wanting it banned. His supporters insist that he has merely expressed concerns that Shugden practices reduce Buddhism to the level of spirit worship. ‚ÄúThe advice of his holiness about Shugden practice is based on his strong commitment to promote religious harmony and greater understanding between the world‚Äôs major religious traditions and the different Buddhist schools,‚Äù said Geshe Tashi, a Buddhist chaplain at the 2012 London Olympic Games. Claims that the Dalai Lama wants to ban Shugden practices are part of a campaign of misinformation against him encouraged by Chinese authorities seeking to suppress all opposition in Tibet, according to pro-Tibet organisations. Documents obtained by the International Campaign for Tibet reveal that China thinks those who protest against the Dalai Lama can be used to promote splits within Buddhism to attack his authority, inside and outside Tibet. ‚ÄúThe protesters are from an extremist religious group that is aligned with the political agenda of the Chinese government in Tibet to undermine the Dalai Lama and enforce allegiance to the Chinese Communist party,‚Äù said Kate Saunders, ICT communications director. ‚ÄúThis systematic campaign against the Dalai Lama and deepening oppression threatens the very survival of Tibetan religion and cultural identity.‚Äù The vitriolic nature of the attacks on the Dalai Lama have dismayed many of the estimated 1,000 Tibetan exiles living in Britain. In a statement, the Tibetan Community in Britain said that it was ‚Äúdeeply distressed by this inflammatory and extremist campaign‚Äù. Damar Ghale, spokesperson for the Buddhist Community Centre UK in Aldershot, one of the organisers of the Dalai Lama‚Äôs visit, urged the ISC not to protest on the day that prayers will be said for the Nepal earthquake victims. He added: ‚ÄúWe understand that it is the right of the International Shugden Community to protest and express their views; this is a free country.‚Äù The New Kadampa Tradition did not respond to requests for comment. This article was amended on 4 July 2015 to remove a reference to belief in evil spirits.

2015-06-13T11:43:58Z,world,World news,Climate change activists occupy Tate Modern's Turbine Hall,"Activists have occupied Tate Modern‚Äôs Turbine Hall with the aim of giving an all-night performance criticising BP‚Äôs sponsorship of the gallery. The group intend to cover the hall‚Äôs 152-metre sloping floor, which once housed the oil-fired turbines of the Bankside power station, with thousands of charcoaled words of warning about climate change. The performers said the art work would take 25 hours to complete, if they manage to remain inside the building, and is timed to coincide with a full tide cycle. Eva Blackwell, of the arts activism group Liberate Tate, said the protest was ‚Äúa textual intervention‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre filling the Turbine Hall with a tide of ideas and narratives of art, activism, climate change and oil,‚Äù she said. The words were sourced from a range of books and reports, including Margaret Atwood‚Äôs dystopian novel Oryx and Crake, the UN‚Äôs latest climate science report and Naomi Klein‚Äôs This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs the Climate.
The Tate has tolerated the group‚Äôs performances in the past, including a naked man being doused in oil at Tate Britain, extracts from the court case against BP‚Äôs Gulf of Mexico oil spill whispered throughout their galleries and a public exorcism of the ‚Äúevil spirit of BP‚Äù. There have been 14 events in all. The Turbine Hall performance, however, is the first to defy the gallery‚Äôs opening hours, and a showdown with the Tate‚Äôs security team is likely before it closes at 10pm. Protester Yasmin de Silva said the group was compelled to adopt a more antagonistic attitude by the looming climate talks in Paris in December. ‚ÄúOil companies like BP are trying to carry on pretending its business as usual, but time is running out to act on climate change. We‚Äôre already seeing the impact of climate change globally, and companies, foundations and institutions around the world are turning away from the fossil fuel industry that‚Äôs driving us to climate disaster,‚Äù she said. The group began protesting against the Tate‚Äôs links with BP in 2010. In January, after a three-year legal battle over a freedom of information request, it was forced to reveal the extent of BP‚Äôs support, which amounts to an average of ¬£224,000 a year.
The gallery has described BP‚Äôs contribution as considerable, but according to campaigners from Platform, which made the FOI request, it represents just 0.3% of the Tate‚Äôs 2013-14 operating budget. They have described the sum as ‚Äútiny‚Äù and questioned why the Tate has clung so hard to the funding. Elisabeth Monro, a Tate visitor who used to work in art sponsorship, said the performance was ‚Äúas valid an installation art piece as anything else here. The whole reason to have modern art is to have dialogue.‚Äù She said she did not necessarily agree with the protesters‚Äô call for the Tate to drop BP‚Äôs money, but that it was a ‚Äúsurprisingly low‚Äù amount. ‚ÄúWe all benefit from corporate sponsorship of the arts. Without corporate sponsorship we wouldn‚Äôt have buildings like this, because the government doesn‚Äôt give enough,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs very difficult where you draw the line about which company is acceptable.‚Äù Glen Tarman, a member of the Liberate Tate movement since its inception, said: ‚ÄúArt museums are places where we make sense of the world. We make meaning from our lives and they contain what we most value. We shouldn‚Äôt be complicit in climate change just because we appreciate great art.‚Äù He said the group was increasing its calls for the Tate to drop BP‚Äôs sponsorship because the deal was due to expire in 2016. He said the growing divestment movement, which has seen the Rockefeller Foundation, the Church of England and dozens of universities drop fossil fuel investments, was an example of the mounting view that public institutions should not be tied to the companies that drive climate change.
‚ÄúWe wanted to do a performance that confronted them more fully. This year public institutions are breaking links with fossil fuels every week. This work is about calling on the Tate to make their decision [about whether to renew their contract with BP] earlier, preferably by the Paris climate talks in December.‚Äù Many visitors to the Tate Modern were initially unaware that the performance was unsanctioned. Frances O‚ÄôNeill, an artist, said she had viewed the work from the balcony above and, without knowing it was a protest was nonetheless ‚Äúreally, really moved‚Äù. ‚ÄúI was just mesmerised by the visuals of it. I didn‚Äôt know what they were writing, I just got filled with a deep sadness,‚Äù she said. Once she read the interpretation signs laid out by the group she said she was supportive of the action. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs got to do these sort of things. Someone‚Äôs got to say our planet‚Äôs being damaged. It may not be sponsored [by the Tate], but they are doing what the Tate does,‚Äù she said. Another visitor, Audrey Valentine, said she thought it was wonderful the Tate was allowing the protest to unfold, but she that she did not agree with its message. ‚ÄúIf these big boys didn‚Äôt do these things, are you suggesting that government should pay? They should put some money back,‚Äù she said. Liberate Tate‚Äôs campaign against the Tate‚Äôs relationship with BP is part of a wider drive to rid the art world of oil patronage. The British Museum, National Portrait Gallery and National Theatre are among many major UK cultural institutions that receive support from fossil fuel companies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-13T11:20:31Z,world,World news,"Gaza beach killings: no justice in Israeli exoneration, says victim's father","The father of one of four Palestinian children killed on a Gaza City beach during last summer‚Äôs war between Hamas and Israel has said he is outraged that an Israeli investigation into the killings has been closed without finding anyone culpable for their deaths. The comments by Mohammed Bakr came as new questions emerged about both the scope and the accuracy of the findings of the Israeli military police inquiry.
‚ÄúThere is no justice in the internal investigation,‚Äù Bakr said on Friday. ‚ÄúWe are counting on the ICC [international criminal court] and human rights. We are not afraid and we are confident we will win because the world is with us.‚Äù Mohammad Ramiz Bakr, 11, Ahed Atef Bakr and Zakariya Ahed Bakr, both 10, and Ismail Mahmoud Bakr, nine, were killed on 16 July last year when they were hit by explosive rounds. Three of the boys died as they tried to run from the beach after the first child was killed. The Israeli military announced on Thursday evening that the ‚Äúextensive‚Äù criminal inquiry into the case had been closed because it was deemed to be a ‚Äútragic accident‚Äù. After a review of the investigation‚Äôs findings, Danny Efroni, Israel‚Äôs military advocate general, found that the process used in the attack ‚Äúaccorded with Israeli domestic law and international law requirements‚Äù. But among troubling issues to have emerged since the Israeli military closed its investigation is the fact that not all witnesses to the incident were interviewed by Israeli investigators, despite comments by Efroni‚Äôs office suggesting it would do so. The incident came to global prominence because it took place in front of a number of international media organisations, including the Guardian and the New York Times.
The New York Times‚Äôs Pulitzer prize-winning photographer Tyler Hicks, who witnessed the incident, though from a different angle to the Guardian, wrote in a blog at the time: ‚ÄúA small metal shack with no electricity or running water on a jetty in the blazing seaside sun does not seem like the kind of place frequented by Hamas militants, the Israel Defence Forces‚Äô intended targets. ‚ÄúChildren, maybe four feet tall, dressed in summer clothes, running from an explosion, doesn‚Äôt fit the description of Hamas fighters, either.‚Äù Although pro-Israel social media activists at first made strenuous efforts to claim the deaths were the result of one of Hamas‚Äôs own rockets falling short, the IDF later admitted its own munitions were responsible. Several weeks after the attack ‚Äì announcing it was launching investigations into a number of controversial incidents in which civilians died ‚Äì the military advocate general‚Äôs office briefed more than a dozen journalists. The senior Israeli officer was asked by reporters then if investigators would seek to contact all witnesses. The officer replied in the affirmative. In reality, however, it appears no effort was made to contact a number of the journalists who witnessed the incident ‚Äì including this correspondent. A handful of Palestinian witnesses supplied information by affadavit. The IDF‚Äôs closure of the case comes at a highly sensitive time for Israel over the conduct of last year‚Äôs war. The UN is expected to publish a report on the conflict and there are reports that a delegation from the ICC may visit later this month as part of its preliminary investigation into alleged crimes committed by both sides. Israel has, in the past, pointed to the credibility of its internal investigations as proof that the involvement of the ICC was unnecessary. As the IDF announced it was closing the case having found no criminal culpability among its servicemen over the attack, the IDF‚Äôs chief spokesman, Peter Lerner, described the investigation as ‚Äúextensive‚Äù in a post on Facebook. According to Lerner: ‚ÄúFrom the factual findings collected by the investigators, it revealed that the incident took place in an area that had long been known as a compound belonging to Hamas‚Äôs Naval Police and Naval Force (including naval commandos), and which was utilised exclusively by militants. ‚ÄúThe compound in question spans the length of the breakwater of the Gaza City seashore, closed off by a fence and clearly separated from the beach serving the civilian population. ‚ÄúIt further found in the course of the investigation (including from the affidavits provided by Palestinian witnesses), that the compound was known to the residents of the Gaza Strip as a compound which was used exclusively by Hamas‚Äôs Naval Police.‚Äù Several foreign journalists present at the time of the incident disputed that claim to the Guardian on Friday, echoing the Guardian‚Äôs own observations. Indeed, far from being used ‚Äúexclusively‚Äù by Hamas, the site of the initial attack ‚Äì an area of several makeshift structures on the breakwater itself and where the first boy died ‚Äì is regularly used by fishermen, and is immediately adjacent to, and accessible from, the public beach in Gaza port. Clearly visible to journalists staying in the Al Deira hotel, it is far from being the site of obvious militant activity, appearing largely deserted ‚Äì at least during daylight hours ‚Äì and with little obviously discernible evidence of any nighttime boat launches. The IDF‚Äôs statement said a container on the breakwater which had been attacked the day before was being used by Hamas as a storage facility for weapons. Journalists, however, who visited it in the immediate aftermath of the attack saw no weapons or equipment. Usually reliable sources told the Guardian on Friday that they believed the container had been ‚Äúincriminated‚Äù by Israeli intelligence, making it a potential target because it belonged to the equivalent of Hamas‚Äôs coastguard, even if it was empty. Its incrimination, in effect, meant anyone approaching it could be engaged. Pictures posted on Facebook on Friday by the Daily Telegraph correspondent Robert Tait, who photographed the scene of the strike in its immediate aftermath, show twisted metal and scattered rubble but no sign of any military material. Another question ‚Äì unanswered by the IDF ‚Äì relates to aerial oversight of the scene before the attack. According to the IDF, ‚Äúcivilian presence in the area had been ruled out‚Äù, including by the deployment of ‚Äúreal-time visual surveillance‚Äù. According to multiple media and other witnesses, children had been playing football in the vicinity immediately before the attack. One Israeli military expert at the time expressed his surprise that those conducting the surveillance were unable to distinguish between children and Hamas militants, when the children were clearly identifiable as they fled from several hundred metres away before the second strike. An Israeli military spokesman had not replied to questions put to it by the Guardian at the time of publication on Friday afternoon. However, a spokesman said on Saturday that the site was under full control of Hamas and that intelligence suggested Hamas militants were planning to use it to launch an operation.Regarding the concerns that not all witnesses had been interviewed by investigators, he said: ‚ÄúThey were presented with a number of witnesses‚Äô names who, following several attempts to coordinate their testimonies being given to the investigative military police, refrained from coming to present their testimonies.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-13T09:52:21Z,world,World news,Fears of Greece eurozone exit mount as EU deadline looms,"Fears that Greece could leave the eurozone continued to mount on Saturday, despite its finance minister saying that Europe would not allow that to happen. Yanis Varoufakis told BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Today programme: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe that any sensible European bureaucrat or politician will go down that road.‚Äù Asked whether the EU and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were bluffing, he said: ‚ÄúI hope they are.‚Äù Varoufakis said Greece had not agreed to the proposals offered by its creditors because they were ‚Äúyet another version of the failed proposals of the past‚Äù. Greek officials and the country‚Äôs creditors were due to resume talks in Brussels on Saturday. Athens needs to reach a deal before the end of June to avoid running out of money and defaulting on payments due to the IMF. It is expected to make counter-proposals at Saturday‚Äôs talks in Brussels in a bid to end a five-month standoff since Alexis Tsipras‚Äôs anti-austerity government was elected in January. In a signal that Athens may be prepared to make major concessions, Tsipras told Greek officials attending Saturday‚Äôs talks: ‚ÄúIf we arrive at a viable accord, even if it is a difficult compromise, we will take up the challenge because our only criteria is to get out of the crisis ‚Ä¶ The decisions and how we handle them belong to us completely, despite their difficulty.‚Äù Whatever needs to be done ‚Äúshould be done quickly‚Äù, said the deputy finance finister, Dimitris Mardas, who predicted that there would be a deal. Eurozone finance ministers will meet on Thursday in Luxembourg and that meeting is now viewed as the deadline for a decision on Greece‚Äôs fate. Officials preparing for the Luxembourg talks included the default scenario in their discussions for the first time at a meeting on Thursday night in Bratislava. Until then they had refused to countenance the prospect of a default and the issue has not been discussed at any official level. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is said to have resigned herself to the prospect, and an opinion poll for ZDF television found that 51% of Germans wanted Greece to leave the eurozone, up from 33% at the start of the year. Varoufakis sought to play down the level of dissatisfaction with Greece in Germany. ‚ÄúI think [Merkel] does not even begin to contemplate an exit of Greece from the eurozone,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhat matters, in the context of the European Union, is that we get it together and work towards a sensible solution that is mutually beneficial.‚Äù The European Central Bank chief economist, Peter Praet, said on Saturday that the bank‚Äôs governing council wanted Greece to remain in the eurozone. Fears that a ‚ÄúGrexit‚Äù would cause chaos in European markets have subsided in recent months and officials believe it would not cause lasting damage to the euro. The vice-president of Germany‚Äôs Bundesbank said, however, that the full extent of the fallout of a Greek departure was not certain. ‚ÄúThe direct contagion effect on other countries is smaller because the direct claims of banks on Greece are smaller, but no one knows what the indirect effects would be,‚Äù Claudia Buch told the Rheinische Post newspaper. On Friday it appeared Greece was still refusing to back down. In a policy document leaked to the Greek press, the Tsipras government once again called for a debt restructuring and ruled out pension cuts or labour market reforms that would include wage decreases. It attacked the IMF‚Äôs decision to walk out of negotiations on Thursday, arguing that it represented pressure not on Greece, but on Germany. The IMF said the gap between the two sides was too wide and there had been no progress in talks. The negotiations have gone from bad to worse in the past 10 days and reached stalemate, with Tsipras refusing to table proposals that would satisfy Greece‚Äôs creditors by agreeing to pension cuts and tax increases. He has been insisting on a form of debt writedown - which is anathema to the Germans. The eurozone, in turn, has reverted to the pre-Tsipras practices of the past five years of serving up ultimatums and policy diktats to the Greeks. Standard & Poor‚Äôs lowered the rating of Greece‚Äôs biggest four banks on Friday, two days after doing the same to Greek government bonds, which it had already rated as junk. The ratings for Alpha Bank, Eurobank, the National Bank of Greece and Piraeus Bank were cut from CCC+ to CCC, S&P said. ‚ÄúThe downgrade reflects our view that Greek banks will likely default within the next 12 months in the absence of an agreement between the Greek government and its official creditors,‚Äù the agency said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-13T04:37:12Z,world,World news,British woman who posed naked on Malaysian mountain on her way home,"Four tourists, including 23-year-old British woman Eleanor Hawkins, are leaving Malaysia after pleading guilty to ‚Äúobscene acts in public‚Äù for stripping off their clothes on a sacred mountain in Malaysia, their lawyer told the Guardian on Saturday. ‚ÄúThey are leaving now,‚Äù Ronny Cham said on the telephone. He said all four were checked into flights to leave.
Hawkins, from Derby and on her gap year, appeared with Canadian siblings Lindsey Petersen, 23 and Danielle Petersen, 22, and Dutch national Dylan Snel, 23, in court on Friday in Kota Kinabalu, the main town near Mount Kinabalu where photos posted online on 30 May showed them half dressed on a peak. They were sentenced to a 5,000 Malaysian Ringgit (¬£860) and three days in jail from the time of arrest, which meant they were free to go on the same day. Indigenous people on the island believe the mountain holds the spirit of their ancestors and some have suggested the disrespectful act caused of an earthquake that killed 18 people days later. Of the 10 foreigners accused of stripping on the mountain only five have been arrested. Hawkins was detained when she tried to board a flight to leave. Malaysian police say they have informed border guards to look out for the other five on the offence of public indecency. Cham said Hawkins was relieved to be returning home. ‚ÄúShe is pleased and happy,‚Äù he told the Press Association. After her conviction Hawkins‚Äôs father, Timothy, said the sentence his daughter received was ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù and ‚Äúfair‚Äù. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful that the Malaysian authorities reached this decision,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEleanor knows what she did was wrong and disrespectful and she is deeply sorry for any offence she‚Äôs caused to the Malaysian people. ‚ÄúWe now look forward to having her back home but we don‚Äôt know when this will be as we‚Äôve no contact with the consulate in Kuala Lumpur and have not spoken to Ellie.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-13T04:21:31Z,world,World news,Malaysia to free British tourist over naked mountain pose,"The British gap-year tourist Eleanor Hawkins is being released from custody in Malaysia after pleading guilty to committing obscene acts in public when she and nine others stripped for a dare on Mount Kinabalu. A judge at a court in Kota Kinabalu, the capital of Sabah state, sentenced Hawkins and three others ‚Äì Canadian siblings Lindsey and Danielle Petersen, and Dutch national Dylan Snel ‚Äì to three days in jail from the time of arrest, 9 June, which means they have already served their time. Ronny Cham, who represented Miss Hawkins in court, said she was relieved to be returning home. ‚ÄúShe is pleased and happy,‚Äù he told the Press Association. Her father Tim Hawkins said she was under consular protection and Malaysian authorities were ‚Äúprocessing her for deportation‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe are hoping to get her back by Monday,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHopefully we should get a chance to speak to her soon.‚Äù Prison guards said earlier that the four backpackers had not returned to the jail after the hearing, and did not have to wear handcuffs. The four were also fined 5,000 Malaysian ringgit (¬£860) each. Hawkins left the court in tears as she was told she was to be freed after paying the fine.
The judge, Dean Wayne Daly, said: ‚ÄúThis court accepted the plea of guilty as mitigation.‚Äù He also noted the remorse of the tourists, and accepted that although Hawkins was arrested at an airport ‚Äúthere was nothing to show Eleanor was absconding the law‚Äù. Hawkins‚Äôs defence lawyer, Ronny Cham, said: ‚ÄúThis is a happy ending to the whole episode.‚Äù He said he expected all four tourists to be deported after they had paid the fines.
Arriving handcuffed at court, the four defendants had to battle through a throng of reporters to enter the building. They pleaded guilty to committing obscene acts in a public place and agreed to apologise to the Malaysian people, after the stunt prompted an angry reaction in Sabah, where the mountain is regarded as sacred. The judge decided against imposing the maximum sentence of three months in prison after the lawyer for the four said they were ignorant of local laws and customs and were sorry for what they had done. Diplomats from the UK, the Netherlands and Canada were in court for the hearing. The Foreign Office refused to discuss the verdict, but a spokesman said: ‚ÄúWe remain in contact with Ms Hawkins and her family following this morning‚Äôs court appearance, and will continue to provide consular assistance.‚Äù Officials and tribal elders suggested the disrespectful act was linked to an earthquake that killed 18 people days later.
Eleanor‚Äôs father, Tim, expressed relief at the verdict but said he was anxious to get his daughter safely back to the UK. Speaking by phone from his engineering business in Derby, he said: ‚ÄúWe are relieved, but we don‚Äôt want to say too much because we want to protect Ellie. As far as we know she is currently under the protection of the consulate.‚Äù He said he had not managed to speak to his daughter since the verdict. ‚ÄúWe are waiting for the consular official to get her somewhere safe. We need to talk to the FCO about travel arrangements. As far as I‚Äôve seen, it is immediate deportation. ‚ÄúWe really do want her home, but we‚Äôve got no idea what is going to happen and when.‚Äù Hawkins praised the diplomats in Malaysia. ‚ÄúThey have done a fabulous job, they‚Äôve been really helpful, really useful. And our local MP Maggie Throup has been very good as well.‚Äù
The charge, read out in court, was that at 6.45am on 30 May in the vicinity of Mount Kinabalu they carried out ‚Äúobscene acts in a public place under 294 [a] of the penal code‚Äù. They were also accused of ‚Äúexcessive noise and ignoring the advice [of their guide]‚Äù. All four avoided trial by pleading guilty. The public prosecutor had called for a ‚Äúsentence to deter others‚Äù. He said their behaviour caused ‚Äúannoyance to many Malaysians‚Äù and urged the judge to ‚Äútake into account public sentiment‚Äù in the sentence.
Cham pleaded for leniency: ‚ÄúYour honour, they were ignorant of the culture, tradition and belief of the local people ‚Ä¶ including the people of Sabah and Malaysia ‚Ä¶ This is a group of a young generation ‚Ä¶ who have more freedom and liberty to express their thoughts and ideas.‚Äù Cham said the four stripped as they were ‚Äúchallenging one another to stand the cold of the mountain, to stand the temperature, which was near zero degrees‚Äù. He said they had suffered ‚Äúshame, ridicule and humiliation to themselves, their parents and possibly even their country ‚Ä¶ They have paid a heavy price ‚Ä¶ lost personal integrity and self esteem.‚Äù Police in Malaysia are looking for six other foreigners who appeared in the nude photographs and were wanted for public indecency, a police officer involved in the case told the Guardian on Friday. ‚ÄúWe think they are still in Sabah,‚Äù the officer revealed on condition of anonymity. ‚ÄúThere is a possibility they have already left the country.‚Äù He said Hawkins and her fellow detainees did not identify the others who were with them: ‚ÄúThey said they didn‚Äôt know their full names, only nicknames.‚Äù Another police source said border guards had been informed and were hoping to catch the others at airports.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-12T23:59:03Z,world,World news,Zimbabweans get chance to swap 'quadrillions' for a few US dollars,"Zimbabweans will start exchanging ‚Äúquadrillions‚Äù of local dollars for a few US dollars next week as President Robert Mugabe‚Äôs government discards its virtually worthless national currency. The southern African country started using foreign currencies including the US dollar and South African rand in 2009 after the Zimbabwean dollar was ruined by hyperinflation, which hit 500bn% in 2008. At the height of the country‚Äôs economic crisis, Zimbabweans had to carry plastic bags bulging with banknotes to buy basic goods. Prices were rising at least twice a day. From Monday, customers who held Zimbabwean dollar accounts before March 2009 can approach their banks to convert their balance into US dollars, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, John Mangudya, said. Zimbabweans have until September to turn in their old banknotes, which some people sell as souvenirs to tourists. Bank accounts with balances of up to 175 quadrillion Zimbabwean dollars will be paid $5. Those with balances above 175 quadrillion dollars will be paid at an exchange rate of $1 for 35 quadrillion, or 35,000,000,000,000,000, Zimbabwean dollars. The highest ‚Äì and last ‚Äì banknote to be printed by the bank in 2008 was 100tn Zimbabwean dollars. It was not enough to ride a public bus to work for a week. The bank said customers who still had stashes of old Zimbabwean notes could walk into any bank and get $1 for every 250tn they hold. That means a holder of a 100tn banknote will get 40 cents. The bank has set aside $20m to pay Zimbabwean dollar currency holders. Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe left pensions, wages and investments worthless and spread poverty as everyday items became unaffordable. It also caused severe cash shortages, because the government could not afford to print bank notes to keep pace with inflation. The crisis in Zimbabwe was reminiscent of the hyperinflation Germany went through in the 1920s when the highest denomination note was 100,000,000,000,000 (100 trillion) marks and people were being paid several times a day. Zimbabwe‚Äôs period of soaring prices came to an end in 2009 and the economy stabilised under a unity government that lasted until 2013, when Mugabe was declared the winner of Zimbabwe‚Äôs presidential election. GDP growth averaged more than 10% during 2009-2012. But the economy slowed last year and the outlook remains tough, say economists. The International Monetary Fund‚Äôs latest overview of Zimbabwe in April said growth was expected to weaken further in 2015. ‚ÄúDespite the favourable impact of lower oil prices, the external position remains precarious and the country is in debt distress,‚Äù the IMF said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When asked about their daughter‚Äôs ethnicity in another local interview that went beyond-viral, her mother said: ‚ÄúOur daughter is primarily German and Czech and of European descent.‚Äù ‚ÄúShe is white. Caucasian,‚Äù added her father. In the hours since, the internet has provided us with hot take after hot take after a hot take. And, of course, there will be many more ‚Äì along with more actual answers about Dolezal‚Äôs life story, from her role as the president of the Spokane chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to her relationship with her parents. For now, here is a quick guide to the complex questions on the story everyone‚Äôs talking about. Why does Rachel Dolezal identify as black, exactly? Dolezal‚Äôs motivations remain unclear, though she was expected to make an official statement to the internet cacophony soon. Some ‚Äì OK, many ‚Äì have speculated that she called herself black all these years because of an ex-husband who is black. Other people ‚Äì like her parents ‚Äì say the elaborate persona was borne of activism. Here‚Äôs what her mother had to say: Rachel is a master artist and so she is able to disguise herself and make her appearance look like any ethnicity. She could accomplish the work that she set out to do in the beginning by being herself and being a white woman who is an advocate for the African American.
Steven Thrasher, Guardian US writer at large, points out that while we might not know what motivated Dolezal to say she was black, her story exposes the ‚Äúshaky and ridiculous‚Äù concept of race:
Like it or not, she‚Äôs exposed how shaky and ridiculous the whole centuries-old construct of individual ‚Äòrace‚Äô is. Among the biggest conversations from the ‚Äúouting‚Äù of Dolezal‚Äôs ‚Äúpassing‚Äù is that race and ethnicity are not interchangeable. Are race and ethnicity the same thing?
Race and ethnicity are not the same thing. A panel of experts interviewed on this topic by PBS pointed to one main difference: race is something people associate with biology. In America, it‚Äôs a social construct based on certain physical markers over which you have no control (skin color, certain kinds of facial features and hair texture, for example). Ethnicity, on the other hand, often has to do with culture, nationality and geography. Dolezal was born with white skin, so she‚Äôs considered white even if she more strongly associates with black culture. Her parents have said her ethnicity is mostly central and eastern European. Can you be ethnically black? The same parents who insist that Dolezal is white point out that, culturally, she has assimilated in the African American community. According to their interview with the Washington Post, this began in her early years when the family adopted her siblings. According to her father, Lawrence Dolezal, the real identity switch occurred when Howard University ‚Äútook her for a black woman‚Äù and gave her a full scholarship. You‚Äôve got a white woman coming in that got a full-ride scholarship to the black Harvard. And ever since then she‚Äôs been involved in social justice advocacy for African Americans. She assimilated into that culture so strongly that that‚Äôs where she transferred her identity. [...] But unfortunately, she is not ethnically by birth African American. She is our daughter by birth. And that‚Äôs the way it is. Gary Younge, a Guardian columnist, agrees.
‚ÄúAll of [this] might make Rachel Dolezal a white woman who identifies closely with the black community. It does not make her black,‚Äù he wrote on Friday.
Dolezal, however, claims that the question of race is ‚Äúnot as easy as it seems‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all from the African continent,‚Äù she told the Spokane Spokesman-Review at Eastern Washington University. Is identifying as another race similar to identifying as another gender?
A number of people have been asking this question, including Mia Farrow. Gene Demby, from NPR‚Äôs Codeswitch, also invited his Twitter followers to weigh in on this ‚Äì his feed is definitely worth checking out. There are many, many people who say these two ‚Äútranses‚Äù are not the same at all. ‚ÄúThe people using her mistakes to try to ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô or ‚Äòexplain‚Äô the experiences of trans people have none of my empathy; they‚Äôre simply propagating the stereotype that trans people are out to fool the rest of you,‚Äù Meredith Talusan, a transgender writer and photographer, wrote for the Guardian. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to pass as a woman the way Dolezal needs to pass as black, for the simple reason that I am a woman.‚Äù
Which bring us back to: why did Dolezal pretend to be black? Would Dolezal not be allowed to become a member of the NAACP if the group knew she was white?
The NAACP was founded in February 1909 and by now has more than half a million members. Founders of the NAACP included white liberals like Mary White Ovington and Oswald Garrison Villard, according to NAACP‚Äôs website. You do not have to be black to become a member of the NAACP. The membership form for the NAACP does not even ask applicants for their race. All you have to do is ‚Äúcare about fighting the racial disparities‚Äù that exist in America. Different chapters of the groups had different defenses, but the bottom line seemed to be: race does not equal qualifying criteria.
Does this affect the NAACP at all? ‚Äú[A] white person pretending to be black and running a chapter of the NAACP is a big problem,‚Äù Jonathan Capehart wrote at the Washington Post. Some feel that by pretending to be a woman of color, Dolezal invaded a space that many black Americans have viewed as safe and sacred. ‚Äú[A] lot of people find comfort and solace in spaces like the NAACP. The NAACP means something ‚Äì not just historically, but as a sort of permanent safe space for people who need it,‚Äù Danielle Henderson wrote in a conversation with Latoya Peterson at Fusion. You should definitely check out their conversation here.
Just like everyone else, both Peterson and Henderson wondered what Dolezal had to gain from pretending to be black. ‚ÄúI love my heritage, but I cannot understand in this cultural moment why someone would OPT IN to being black,‚Äù said Henderson. So, who is black? If this entire controversy has somehow still made you wonder about your race, Gawker has this handy quiz titled Are you black? to ‚Äúrid you of any and all uncertainty‚Äù. That wasn‚Äôt so hard, now was it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-12T18:27:12Z,world,World news,Jane Goodall hails 'awakening' as US labels all chimpanzees endangered,"The US has named chimpanzees a fully endangered species, extending greater protections to the apes in a decision that primate researcher Jane Goodall has hailed as a sign of ‚Äúan awakening‚Äù. The US Fish and Wildlife Service director, Dan Ashe, announced on Friday that chimpanzees will no longer hold their unique ‚Äúsplit status‚Äù under US law, which since the 1990s has protected wild chimps but allowed largely unfettered research on captive animals.
Prompted by the worries of Aids researchers and thinking the special status would forestall the exploitation of wild chimps, the US previously classified chimps in America as ‚Äúthreatened‚Äù. Ashe said: ‚ÄúThat was a well-intentioned decision, but we now realize it was a mistake.‚Äù Rather than solve the problem, the dual status ‚Äúexpanded a culture and attitude of treating these animals as commodities,‚Äù he said. The decision to provide the full protections of the Endangered Species Act to chimpanzees follows years of research by the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Institutes of Health, as well as years of activism by the Humane Society and other animal welfare organizations. The new rules grant new protections to the primates, restrict their commercial trade, and will probably most affect biomedical research institutions, which will now have to apply for permits in order to perform research on chimpanzees. Absent permits, the new rule will also ban interstate commerce, and prohibit ‚Äútaking‚Äù, a term that could encompass anything that could cause a chimpanzee harm or distress, from serious injury to taking blood to harassment. The federal agency says that ‚Äúpermits will be issued for these activities only for scientific purposes that benefit the species in the wild, or to enhance the propagation or survival of chimpanzees.‚Äù Researchers would need to show ‚Äúsubstantial‚Äù contribution to chimpanzees‚Äô survival in the wild, Ashe said, either through their scientific research or material contributions to support the animals in the wild, such as giving to habitat restoration programs.
Goodall praised the decision, saying: ‚ÄúThere are times in the past when I wondered whether this day would ever happen. ‚ÄúIt shows an awakening, it shows a new consciousness. We should all raise our glasses tonight.‚Äù Not all scientists celebrated, however, with some arguing that the rules threatened vital research that could save lives. ‚ÄúThis new ruling effectively means that biomedical research with the chimpanzee model may become difficult, if not impossible, to conduct,‚Äù the National Association for Biomedical Research (NABR) said in a statement, adding that the species‚Äô contribution to medicine ‚Äúbenefits nearly every child born in America today‚Äù. NABR said that chimpanzees made it possible to produce vaccines for hepatitis, and that the species could help with research in any number of diseases that humans suffer from. ‚ÄúIt would be unfortunate, even grave, should an infectious disease outbreak occur where human lives are at stake and a chimpanzee model could expedite development of life-saving medicines.‚Äù But Wayne Pacelle, the president of the Humane Society of the United States, said the decision was ‚Äúan incredible one-two punch for conservation and chimpanzee protection‚Äù. While the old law ‚Äúreflected some moral confusion‚Äù about chimpanzees, he said, more Americans now understood that ‚Äúchimpanzees possess so many qualities that we value, the capacity to suffer, to show intelligence, awareness‚Äù. He said the decision heralded ‚Äúa new era where we treat them with respect and show concern for every individual‚Äù. Pacelle‚Äôs view was echoed by Goodall. ‚ÄúI remember so well,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúhow the scientific establishment told me that chimpanzees couldn‚Äôt have personalities, couldn‚Äôt have minds, couldn‚Äôt be capable of any kind of rational thought and certainly couldn‚Äôt have emotions, because those are unique to the human animal.‚Äù Even within the past two decades ‚Äúwe‚Äôve seen a lot of change,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think of chimpanzees as chimpanzee beings because they‚Äôre so like us.‚Äù Although many biologists and researchers remain wary of anthropomorphizing animals, and divided about how to talk about and study animal consciousness, research into intelligent and social animals has expanded massively in the past 30 years.
The field of animal cognition has boomed alongside neuroscience, geneticists have shown that humans share most of their genes with chimpanzees, and research has shown evidence that chimps exhibit complex memory, emotions, self-awareness, and even an awareness of death. Greater research also shows quirkier similarities with mankind: 17 years of study concluded this month that some wild chimps indulge in regular, habitual drinking. The cultural shift has extended into the public domain: though a chimpanzee once starred alongside Ronald Reagan, in May a poll found that nearly a third of Americans felt that animals deserved the same protections as humans, and this year an animal rights campaign won itself a hearing over partial, legal ‚Äúpersonhood‚Äù for chimpanzees in New York. That case could remove two chimpanzees from a research program at Stony Brook University in New York. Ashe said people should not ‚Äúread anything else‚Äù into the new rule except ‚Äúwe have learned a lot about the nature of chimpanzees‚Äù. ‚ÄúSome of the things that we thought did not constitute harm or harassment of chimpanzees do in fact constitute harm and harassment,‚Äù he said, and the rule is ‚Äúin large part in recognition of that‚Äù. Goodall said she hoped the new classification would help counter the forces that threaten chimpanzees: habitat destruction by deforestation and encroaching humans, diseases, the bushmeat trade, and the ‚Äúsurging demand from Asia‚Äù for captive animals. In particular, Goodall hoped the new rules would help end the practice of keeping chimps as pets or for entertainment, noting that the animals grow too powerful for their owners and suffer ‚Äúpsychological trauma‚Äù. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre stuck between two worlds,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve never learned to be a chimpanzee and they can never become a human.‚Äù There are 1,742 chimps in the US, according to a project for the Center for the Study and Conservation of Apes at the Lincoln Park Zoo: 730 in biomedical labs, 559 in sanctuaries, 265 in accredited zoos, and the remainder with unaccredited facilities and private owners. In 2011, the National Institute of Health found that while chimpanzees had research value in the past, medical advances ‚Äúhave provided alternatives to the use of chimpanzees‚Äù. Two years later, the institute said it would retire about 300 research chimpanzees; to date, only a handful of those animals have gone to sanctuaries, a process that Pacelle said he wants to see expedited.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-12T18:23:46Z,world,World news,Mexican woman jailed for combatting cartels: 'It is a sacrifice that had to be made',"Nestora Salgado is not a woman who caves in easily. A child bride who soon became a single mother of three, Salgado was still a teenager when she left her hometown in the mountains of southern Mexico to rebuild her life in the US. Two decades later, she returned home to lead an armed rebellion against drug traffickers and corrupt local authorities ‚Äì only to be accused of kidnapping and imprisoned. Salgado spent 21 months in a high-security jail until a hunger strike galvanized international support for her case and helped secure her transfer last month to the medical wing of a more relaxed facility. Now, in her first interview with the international press, Salgado argued that she was guilty of nothing more than helping her community stand up to the narcos and their corrupt political allies, and called on the Mexican government to release her and drop all the charges. ‚ÄúI have no regrets about what I did, and I never will have any regrets,‚Äù she told the Guardian. ‚ÄúI am not a person who likes to confront the authorities, but in a place where dialogue is not possible, what else can you do?‚Äù
Salgado‚Äôs extraordinary story has unfolded amid a fierce debate about the role of armed vigilante groups that have sprung up across the country to fight the cartels, but have themselves been accused of murder, extortion and ‚Äì in some cases ‚Äì even acting as proxies for rival crime groups. Mexican officials argue that nobody has the right to take the law into their own hands. Salgado‚Äôs supporters say she is merely a community leader who has been criminized for exposing the Mexican state‚Äôs failure to enforce the rule of law. Sitting on her prison hospital bed in white and blue flannel pyjamas, Salgado, 43, said she had never underestimated the risks involved in taking a stand. ‚ÄúThe government is against people who want to do the right thing and protect their communities,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI know I have made my family suffer, but it is a sacrifice that had to be made.‚Äù Salgado‚Äôs indomitable character was forged in Olinal√°, high in the mountains of Guerrero, a state in southern Mexico with a long history of repression and rebellion. The town is best known for the intricately lacquered boxes produced by local craftsmen ‚Äì and for the opium poppies grown in the surrounding hills. The sixth of seven children, Salgado says her childhood was happy, if brief. She was married at 14, but within five years her husband emigrated to the US. The plan had been for him to send money to support the family, but it never arrived. Struggling to make ends meet, Salgado decided to entrust her daughters to her sisters and head north too. She soon joined her husband in Washington state. In those days, it was still relatively easy for migrants to cross the border safely, so in 1992 Salgado sent for her children. Saira was five, Ruby was three and Grisel was one. The family settled in the Seattle suburb of Renton, but according to Salgado, the reunion was not a happy one: her then-husband drank and beat her, and the couple separated. Soon after, she met her current husband, Jose Luis Villa, who is now a driving force of the cross-border campaign to secure her release. Life in Seattle was tough, but good, she says. Salgado and Villa both worked two or three jobs, and sent money to her family in Olinal√° whenever they could, but Salgado didn‚Äôt return home until 2000 when she obtained her US residency. The visit was a reminder of the harsh reality of she had left behind, Salgado said. ‚ÄúIt really hurt me to see my people still living in such poverty,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI had got used to the United States.‚Äù
Salgado took the family to live in Olinal√° for a year, hoping it would make her daughters appreciate the opportunities they had in the US. She also became more outspoken against day-to-day corruption and lawlessness. ‚ÄúLiving in the United State had opened my horizons and made me conscious of rights,‚Äù she said.
Guerrero has long been one of Mexico‚Äôs most lawless regions, but in 2006 the state was plunged into a open conflict by a military-led offensive against organized crime. The campaign helped shatter the once-mighty Beltran Leyva cartel, but numerous splinter groups sprang up in its wake. One of these, Los Rojos, took control of Olinal√°. Kidnapping, extortion, disappearances and murder became common; cartel gunmen walked the streets with impunity. ‚ÄúAt first you just try to keep a distance out of fear, but then it starts to move your heart,‚Äù Salgado said of the terror. ‚ÄúYou get angry when the authorities do nothing.‚Äù That fury erupted in October 2012 at the funeral of a taxi driver who had been kidnapped and killed by cartel thugs. A rumour broke out that a second driver had been abducted ‚Äì and Salgado decided that enough was enough. She helped organize the crowd as they disarmed the local police, then commandeered a police car to drive around town, using a megaphone to urge townspeople to join the rebellion. Within hours, the gunmen were driven from town, and an ad hoc militia armed with hunting rifles and AK-47s had set up checkpoints. The ragtag force gained a figleaf of legality within an older tradition of community policing in Guerrero‚Äôs indigenous communities. But it also tapped into another strand of the region‚Äôs history ‚Äì that of armed uprisings against the Mexican state. Under the leadership of ‚ÄúComandanta Nestora‚Äù, the Olinal√° community police arrested suspected wrongdoers and detained them for ‚Äúre-education‚Äù. Meanwhile the group also built ties with radical community groups allegedly linked to the region‚Äôs defunct guerrilla movement. But many locals chafed at the Salgado‚Äôs high-handed manner and called for the military to take over security in the town. Anger focussed on the detention of three teenage girls accused of dealing cocaine for their narco boyfriends. Soon after, Salgado incurred the displeasure of local politicians when she detained a well-connected town official she accused of fraternizing with the narcos. By then, even some of Salgado‚Äôs supporters suspected she had gone too far, quietly admitting that she had perhaps been politically naive in her attempt to cut through the web of local politics and organised crime. ‚ÄúI knew that when I started to expose the municipal government that there was a risk I would be arrested or killed,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt care. It was necessary.‚Äù Authorities put out an arrest warrant for kidnapping, and on 21 August 2013, Salgado was detained by the army. She was sent to a high-security jail over 1,000km (620 miles) away from Olinal√° ‚Äì a move her lawyers describe as the first of many violations of due process in the government crackdown crackdown on vigilantes. ‚ÄúThe arrest and prosecution of Nestora was clearly a political decision,‚Äù said Salgado‚Äôs lawyer, Leonel River. ‚ÄúThe case is full of violations.‚Äù Salgado‚Äôs supporters also allege mistreatment within the jail. They say she has been isolated from other inmates, denied medical attention for spinal injuries sustained in a 2002 car accident, and that visits from her legal council and family have been severely restricted. In January, calls by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights for urgent action to improve her conditions did little to help. But suggestions from the Guerrero state government that it would consider dropping the kidnapping charges faded after a backlash from high-profile anti-crime campaigners associated with the political right. The case, meanwhile, inched through Mexico‚Äôs labyrinthine judicial system, in which cases are still mostly fought in written arguments, often behind closed doors. On 5 May, Salgado decided to stop eating in protest at her treatment. ‚ÄúI was prepared to die,‚Äù she said of the hunger strike that she maintained for 31 days.
The hunger strike focused new attention on her cause which has been taken up by supporters on Mexico and the US, and at the end of May, Salgado was transferred to the medical wing of a relatively relaxed women‚Äôs prison on the southern outskirts of Mexico City At first, Salgado said she would continue to refuse food until she was freed, but was persuaded to end the hunger strike when doctors warned she risked permanent damage. Meanwhile, discrete negotiations with state authorities continue ‚Äì though Salgado‚Äôs supporters are wary of raising their hopes too soon. ‚ÄúWe are facing a monster in Mexico and we know how dirty politics are,‚Äù said her husband, Jos√© Louis Villa. ‚ÄúThe government gives three choices to activists. You can be bought, you can be killed or you can be put in prison.‚Äù Meanwhile, La Comandata remains defiant. In an 30-minute interview, she only appeared to drop her guard for a brief moment as she described seeing herself in the mirror last month for the first time since her arrest. ‚ÄúThey try to destroy you in that place,‚Äù she said. Then she straightened her back and continued: ‚ÄúBut I am strong.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-12T16:08:26Z,world,World news,Footballer Robbie Keane mourns death of two cousins in sewer incident,"Another cousin of the Republic of Ireland striker Robbie Keane has died after he and his brother were overcome by toxic fumes as they worked in a sewer. Stephen Harris, 34, died in Beaumont hospital, Dublin, at 9am on Friday. His brother Alan Harris died on Wednesday. The pair had been inspecting underground pipes, some of which were understood to be 20ft below the surface, on the Drumnigh Woods housing estate in the Portmarnock area. Questions centre on whether the men were overcome by methane gas as they began initial assessments of the work to be done on the sewers. Keane paid tribute to his cousin on Facebook. He wrote: ‚ÄúWith a heavy heart I write this. May Stephen rest in peace. Once again I would like to thank you all for your kind messages and the love and support you have shown my family.‚Äù
On Thursday, before Stephen Harris‚Äôs death, Keane wrote: ‚ÄúAs you can imagine it‚Äôs been a very difficult time for our family may Alan RIP and we continue to pray for Stephen thanks everyone for your kind messages and support.‚Äù Alan Harris was the owner of DrainTech, a company specialising in drainage clearance and pipe and sewer unblocking in the Dublin region for about 20 years. Investigations by the garda and the Health and Safety Authority are continuing. A garda spokesman said: ‚ÄúThe scene of the incident is still preserved for investigation purposes.‚Äù Keane did not speak about the tragedy as he trained with the Republic squad earlier this week in Malahide, a few miles from the scene. Ireland are due to face Scotland in a Euro 2016 qualifier on Saturday evening, and the Republic‚Äôs manager, Martin O‚ÄôNeill, will let Keane decide whether he takes part in the match. ‚ÄúIt was obviously very bad news this morning as well,‚Äù O‚ÄôNeill said on Friday. ‚ÄúSo he is not feeling great, I must admit. It is obviously very difficult for the family. He is quite down at the moment. I am hoping he will come round. Whether he feels he wants to participate in the game tomorrow, it will be entirely his decision.‚Äù He said Keane had trained as normal with the Ireland squad. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you could ever question his professionalism. It is how he is feeling within himself as much as anything else. He is not great, not great at all.‚Äù Alan Harris‚Äôs widow, Tracy Glynn Harris, posted on Facebook that she had lost her ‚Äúbest friend and soulmate‚Äù. She wrote: ‚ÄúMy heart has been shattered into a million places yet again. Thank you all for the kind words.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-12T15:14:50Z,world,World news,Sweden gears up for royal wedding as republican sentiments rise,"Official Sweden is gearing up to celebrate an extravagant royal wedding on Saturday. Prince Carl Philip and Sofia Hellqvist, a former reality television star and yoga teacher, are to tie the knot at the royal palace in Stockholm. Linda Nordlund, however, will not be hanging out the bunting. ‚ÄúIt gives a bitter taste to the very concept of democracy,‚Äù said the 28-year-old president of the Young Liberals ‚Äì and a convinced republican.
‚ÄúIt feels strange to live in a society that tells the world about the importance of equal rights for women and minorities, but has a constitution that says some people are not equal and are born into privilege.‚Äù In an egalitarian country where multiculturalism is celebrated and atheism is the norm, the white, patriarchal, Protestant and unelected institution at the pinnacle of society seems to stand for everything on which Sweden has emphatically turned its back. The tabloids are devoting page after page to the royal nuptials, and Swedish public television will broadcast the wedding for nine uninterrupted hours, but opponents of the monarchy are growing in number and support for the royal family is at a record low. Police anticipate large crowds to line the route of the royal procession on Saturday, but elsewhere public displays of affection are hard to find. Partying will take place in front of the television rather than out in the streets, said Liv Sander of Svensk Damtidning, a weekly that devotes much of its coverage to the royals. ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt like to admit they are interested in the wedding.‚Äù Recent surveys suggest that barely half the population want to preserve the monarchy, down from nearly 70% 12 years ago, and more than a quarter of all Swedes are abolitionists, according to the SOM Institute for opinion research in Gothenburg. The number of people professing confidence in the Royal House of Bernadotte has fallen dramatically in recent years and is almost on a par with those who are unhappy with it.
The change in attitude accelerated after the publication in 2010 of a book that not only broke the taboo of criticising the royal family, but also provided a mountain of sordid detail on the king‚Äôs alleged womanising and partying. The book also drew attention to links between the royal family and the Nazi party during the second world war. Thomas Sj√∂berg, the book‚Äôs lead author, said he had endured slander, betrayals and a smear campaign as supporters tried to rally around the monarch. ‚ÄúBut in some respect the king has now turned a page,‚Äù Sj√∂berg said. ‚ÄúI think the glory days of his spectacular private life are gone.‚Äù Carl XVI Gustav is 69 and has ruled Sweden for 41 years. The abdications of Juan Carlos in Spain last year, and Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and Albert II of Belgium in 2013, have fuelled speculation that he might step down in favour of his daughter Victoria, whose popularity ratings are higher than those of any public figure.
‚ÄúIf we saw a change like that it would increase confidence in the royal family,‚Äù said Professor Lennart Nilsson of the SOM Institute and a specialist on attitudes to the royals. The wedding on Saturday, however, and the imminent birth of another royal baby to Princess Madeleine, are unlikely to do much to reignite royalist enthusiasm, Nilsson said. Sweden‚Äôs Republican Association points out that political parties on the left, including the ruling Social Democrats and Greens, have the abolition of the monarchy in their manifestos, but they do not campaign for it because it is a vote loser. ‚ÄúIt is difficult for people to stand up and call for a republic,‚Äù said Magnus Simonsson, the association‚Äôs general secretary. ‚ÄúThe royal family has a strong influence in society, and it can be quite hard on people who don‚Äôt show them support.‚Äù
For Nordlund, who grew up in a family of staunch royalists, monarchy belongs only on television in programmes such as Downton Abbey. ‚ÄúIt is embarrassing that so much of the Swedish media is just sucking up to the royal family,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHow does monarchy suit a society that strives for equal opportunities and meritocracy? How is blood more important than competence or qualifications? ‚ÄúFor me it is revolting that a democracy does not choose its head of state,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt is a connection to a past that we should not remember fondly, when we were not a democracy but a dictatorship ruled by cruel kings.‚Äù
Most young people, however, don‚Äôt really feel too strongly, she said. They treat the royal family much like they do the Kardashians. ‚ÄúThis is the first summer weekend after so much bad weather, and I expect a lot of partying in Stockholm,‚Äù Nordlund said. ‚ÄúBut I am certain there will be no royalist ecstasy.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-12T13:34:09Z,world,World news,"Civil rights activist Rachel Dolezal misrepresented herself as black, claim parents","The biological parents of a prominent civil rights activist in Washington state have claimed that she has been misrepresenting herself as a black woman when her heritage is white. Rachel Dolezal is an academic, chair of the office of the police ombudsman commission in the city of Spokane and president of its chapter of the African American civil rights organisation NAACP. Dolezal, a professor of Africana studies at Eastern Washington University, where she specialises in black studies and African American culture, has spoken out regularly on local media about racial justice.
This week, however, in an interview with the local Spokane news channel KREM 2 News, Ruthanne and Larry Dolezal said their daughter‚Äôs biological heritage was not African American but German and Czech, with traces of Native American ancestry. They said their daughter had adopted black siblings and had attended school in Mississippi, where her social circle had primarily been African American. She later married and subsequently divorced an African American man, they said.
They claim that she began to adapt her appearance following her divorce in 2004. ‚ÄúRachel has wanted to be somebody she‚Äôs not. She‚Äôs chosen not to just be herself, but to represent herself as an African American woman or a bi-racial person and that‚Äôs simply not true,‚Äù Ruthanne Dolezal said. In the video, the Dolezals showed pictures of their daughter as a blonde child, and at her wedding several years ago. The couple later provided a copy of their daughter‚Äôs birth certificate to the Spokesman-Review newspaper. Rachel Dolezal has since told local media she is not in touch with the couple because of an ongoing lawsuit, and that she does not view them as her real parents. The 37-year-old told the Spokesman-Review on Thursday that she would prioritise speaking to her executive committee before commenting on speculation in the media. ‚ÄúI feel like I owe my executive committee a conversation,‚Äù she said, adding that the subject was a ‚Äúmultilayered issue‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe question is not as easy as it seems. There‚Äôs a lot of complexities ‚Ä¶ and I don‚Äôt know that everyone would understand that. We‚Äôre all from the African continent.‚Äù A statement from Spokane city hall said she had listed her ethnicity as a mix of white, black, Native American and a number of others in her application to the office of the police ombudsman commission. ‚ÄúWe are gathering facts to determine if any city policies related to volunteer boards and commissions have been violated,‚Äù Spokane‚Äôs mayor, David Condon, and the council president, Ben Stuckart, said in a joint statement. ‚ÄúThat information will be reviewed by the city council, which has oversight of city boards and commissions.‚Äù James Wilburn, a former president of the Spokane NAACP chapter, told the Coeur d‚ÄôAlene Press that Dolezal‚Äôs race was not what had qualified her for the position in the organisation.
‚ÄúIt is traditional to have a person of colour in that position, but that hasn‚Äôt always been the case in Spokane,‚Äù he said. A woman of European descent was president in the 1990s, he added, and half of the chapter members were not black. ‚ÄúThat is probably a result of the fact that only 1.9% of the population in Spokane is African American,‚Äù he said. In a statement on Friday, the NAACP said its local coalition ‚Äústands behind‚Äù Dolezal‚Äôs record. ‚ÄúOne‚Äôs racial identity is not a qualifying criteria or disqualifying standard for NAACP leadership,‚Äù the national group said. Dolezal does not discuss her own ethnicity in detail in her numerous writings on civil rights issues, but in several pieces she uses idioms such as ‚Äúour cultural memory‚Äù when speaking about African American history. In a lecture posted on YouTube, she speaks about the history of African American hairstyles and says she will describe ‚Äúwhat happened to our hair here in America‚Äù when slavery meant certain kinds of styles were banned. Since the current furore began, Dolezal has closed down her Facebook page, having been an active user of the site to post commentary on African American issues and culture.
In a post about the Oscar-winning film 12 Years a Slave, she said it was ‚Äúnot the best film to take a white partner to on a first date‚Äù. She advocates sitting in the back row of the cinema so that ‚Äúif white people are inclined to stare, they have to turn all the way round to do it ‚Ä¶ so that during the movie people aren‚Äôt constantly looking at you to monitor the ‚Äòblack response‚Äô to the film‚Äù. Dolezal‚Äôs parents also allege she has portrayed her adopted black sibling Izaiah as her son in pictures on social media. Dolezal confirmed later to the CDA Press that Izaiah is an adopted brother. ‚ÄúBut I have full custody of him now,‚Äù she added.
Spokane NAACP‚Äôs Facebook page has an image of Dolezal with an older black man, whom it describes as her father. The CDA Press, however, names the man as Albert Wilkerson, a volunteer at the Human Rights Education Institute in north Idaho, where Dolezal previously worked. In an interview about her portrait art with the Easterner magazine, Dolezal described a traumatic upbringing during which her parents would ‚Äúpunish us by skin complexion‚Äù. She also described being raised in a teepee and hunting for food with a bow and arrow. Her parents have confirmed that they lived in a teepee, but before their daughter was born.
Dolezal has been a regular face at local demonstrations and on TV channels, and has made the news on numerous occasions for the graphic hate mail she has received, including nooses left at her home. In one of the most recent incidents, she found an envelope containing pictures of lynchings in Spokane NAACP‚Äôs postbox at the local sorting office. Postal workers later told police the envelope had never been posted, and had been placed in the box by someone who had an access key.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-12T13:11:41Z,world,World news,Activists and artists hit by new wave of harsh sentencing by Iran judiciary,"Iran‚Äôs judiciary has unleashed a wave of heavy jail sentences against artists and activists in what appears to be an attempt to send a warning to those who dare to express dissent. As the country‚Äôs moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, tries to improve relations with the west, the conservative-dominated judiciary, which acts independently of his government, is demonstrating the limits of his power internally. Those targeted recently include film-maker, writer and TV producer Mostafa Azizi, who has been sentenced to eight years in prison, painter Atena Farghadani, sentenced to 12 years, and anti-death-penalty activist Atena Daemi, sentenced to 14 years. All three have been found guilty of insulting Iran‚Äôs supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, through their activities on social networking sites such as Facebook. They have also been convicted of other vague charges, which are often used against activists held on political grounds, including ‚Äúspreading propaganda against the ruling establishment‚Äù. Recent harsh sentences follow a familiar pattern in Iran‚Äôs judicial system whose independence and impartiality have been repeatedly questioned by human rights groups. A number of judges, who are believed to be acting under the influence of the country‚Äôs intelligence apparatus, are notorious for holding trials behind closed doors and without proper legal procedures. One of the convicts, Azizi, a former employee of Iran‚Äôs state TV, was arrested in February after returning to Iran from Canada, his country of residence, to take care of his elderly, ailing father. According to his son, Arash Azizi, the film-maker was on Monday given five years for ‚Äúgathering and colluding against the national security‚Äù, two years for insulting Khamenei and a further year for his activities online. The head of the Iranian judiciary is appointed directly by Khamenei. Azizi has lodged an appeal against his conviction. ‚ÄúMy father had heard numerously from Rouhani that it is safe for expatriates to return home,‚Äù Arash Azizi told the Guardian. ‚ÄúHe was encouraged to go back and he was under impression that there is a new opportunity in Iran for people like him to work.‚Äù In jail, Azizi is held along with Somali pirates.
Farghadani, 29, who was put on trial last month in connection with her activism such as meeting with the families of political prisoners as well as her art, has recently been given 12 years and nine months in jail. One evidence used against her in court was a cartoon she drew and posted online that depicted a group of Iranian parliamentarians with faces of monkeys and donkeys. Cartoonists across the globe have since launched a campaign #Draw4Atena, drawing cartoons in her solidarity. Atena Daemi, who has campaigned against capital punishment in Iran by participating in peaceful protests, distributing anti-death-penalty pamphlets and being active on Facebook and Twitter, now has to serve at least seven out of her total 14 years in jail under Iranian law. On Tuesday, Ahmed Shaheed, the UN special rapporteur for the situation of human rights in Iran, expressed concern about the heavy sentences and urged the Iranian authorities to reconsider the cases. ‚ÄúI am deeply concerned by the prosecution of these individuals for what appears to be a legitimate exercise of internationally protected rights to expression and assembly,‚Äù he told the Guardian.
‚ÄúThe arrest, prosecution, and conviction of these authors, artists, and human rights advocates for violating vaguely worded national security laws demonstrates that the environment in Iran is still not yet conducive for addressing certain issues of concern raised by the international community, and still not yet amenable to the demands of thousands of Iranians that voted for a new approach during the 2013 presidential elections.‚Äù Although Rouhani cannot directly interfere in judicial matters, he can use his position as the public face of the country to defend those jailed unjustly, which he has not done publicly so far. Focused on resolving the nuclear issue, critics say Rouhani has overlooked ongoing, if not increasing, violations at home. At least four other social and human rights activists have reportedly also been given recent harsh convictions, including Omid Alishenas, sentenced to 10 years and Asou Rostami, Saeed Hosseinzadeh, and Ali Nouri, each sentenced to seven years. ‚ÄúThe extremely harsh prison sentences handed down to Mostafa Azizi, Atena Daemi and Atena Farghadani are another nail in the coffin of freedom of expression in Iran, where the cost of voicing peaceful dissent is escalating rapidly,‚Äù said Raha Bahreini, Amnesty International‚Äôs Iran researcher. ‚ÄúPunishments are now even harsher than they were in the post-2009 election crackdown. The situation is absurd but frightening. The Iranian authorities are clearly trying to frighten individuals into complete silence and submission.‚Äù Faraz Sanei of Human Rights Watch echoed Bahreini. ‚ÄúThe absurdly harsh prison sentences handed down against these social media activists underscore the prominent role revolutionary courts play in violating the most basic rights of Iranians to express their views,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs shameful that instead of protecting citizens against abusive laws that criminalise their right to speak out, Iran‚Äôs judiciary is actively endorsing the state‚Äôs unlawful targeting of peaceful activists.‚Äù The Islamic republic‚Äôs judiciary is using various tactics to stymie activists. One that has been used in recent cases is charging individuals on multiple grounds, thus increasings their total jail sentence, whereas activists were previously given less years in jail for similar activities. Another tactic used is barring them from leaving the country after they are released, imposing bans on them being able to find work or banishing them to remote areas in the country, away from their family. In May, after serving his six-year jail term, respected journalist Ahmad Zeidabadi was sent into internal exile a day after his release. He was banished to Gonabad, in northeastern Iran, which is 1,000km away from Tehran. Similarly, Nourali Tabandeh, a dervish from Gonabad, whose community has also been targeted by the authorities, is not allowed to live in his hometown.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-12T12:22:53Z,world,World news,Penis transplant patient to become a father,"A South African man who had the world‚Äôs first successful penis transplant is to become a father less than a year after the breakthrough surgery. Prof Andr√© van der Merwe, who led the operating team, announced that the 21-year-old‚Äôs girlfriend was pregnant. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs definitely smiling big,‚Äù the urologist, based at Stellenbosch University, said on Friday. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs proud. He‚Äôs also a little bit shy.‚Äù The man‚Äôs partner was four months pregnant so the baby could be expected in November, Van der Merwe added. It is not yet known whether it will be a boy or a girl. The man‚Äôs mother and sisters have been informed. The man‚Äôs penis was amputated three years ago after life-threatening complications arising from a botched circumcision. His penis had developed gangrene. He was 18 and sexually active at the time. Van der Merwe had not been worried that he would be infertile, given that his testicles and sperm were not affected. ‚ÄúThe pregnancy is not unexpected because this man is having normal intercourse with a partner of quite a few years. But for the recipient, it is a big thing and proof the operation has been a success. I‚Äôm happy and I have to thank my whole team.‚Äù The man, whose identity is being kept secret, received his new penis from an organ donor in a nine-hour operation on 11 December at Tygerberg hospital in Cape Town. Van der Merwe said they had discussed beforehand questions such as ‚ÄúCan I have sexual intercourse?‚Äù and ‚ÄúCan I have children?‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve ticked all the boxes.‚Äù The professor said that even now there remains some risk of organ rejection. Evidence would include lesions on the skin. ‚ÄúBut at the moment the skin is fine. There‚Äôs no rejection and he‚Äôs doing well,‚Äù said Van der Merwe. The 46-year-old medic has been inundated with requests for his work from around the world but says the need in South Africa is greatest. Every year, thousands of teenage boys from the Xhosa ethnic group undergo circumcision during a traditional rite of passage. While many initiation schools are officially sanctioned, others are unregulated and bogus surgeons are blamed every year for numerous deaths and injuries. The penis transplant was part of a pilot study to develop a procedure that could be performed in South African hospitals. There are about nine people on the programme and Van der Merwe hopes to perform the next operation before the end of the year if funding is granted. Nine years ago, a Chinese man had a penis transplant, but his doctors removed the organ after two weeks due to ‚Äúa severe psychological problem of the recipient and his wife‚Äù.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-12T10:55:46Z,world,World news,'At the first sight of a dictator the African Union loses its backbone',"The African Union claims to promote peace, security and stability, but as its leaders continue their usual prevarication on recent upheavals and conflicts across the continent, these values seem forgotten. Take Burundi, for example. As president Pierre Nkurunziza defies the country‚Äôs constitution and clings to power, the African Union (AU) has largely remained quiet or flip-flopped on the issue, even as the country plummeted into chaos as a result, leaving more than 20 people dead and scores of others injured and displaced. The AU‚Äôs limp-wristed response to Nkurunziza‚Äôs actions may be because it lacks the moral authority to act given that in January it appointed 91-year-old ruler of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe to lead it. Mugabe, who has ruled his country for more than 35 years shows no signs of stepping down, as evidenced by an incident captured by mobile phone footage in Nigeria last week.
At the new Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari‚Äôs inauguration, Mugabe was confronted by journalist Adeola Fayehun about his plans to hand over the reins to younger blood. But he was promptly ushered away by his security personnel to the sounds of Fayehun calling after him: ‚ÄúAre you going to step down, sir?‚Äù Later, she heckled him again, asking: ‚ÄúMr President, don‚Äôt you think that it‚Äôs time you step down, so you can rest? When will there be change in Zimbabwe, sir? Is there democracy in Zimbabwe?‚Äù The clip went viral across the continent. Presidential sell-by dates This weekend, Mugabe is in South Africa for the bi-annual AU summit. Of the many thorny issues on his plate, the problem of Burundi‚Äôs president will feature prominently. Nkurunziza announced in April that he would run for a third term in elections that were due on 26 June. Burundians took to the streets in protests which were met by a ruthless crackdown. A military coup attempted while Nkurunziza was out of the country held for just a day, before it was quashed. In Zimbabwe, Mugabe is the only president the country has known since it gained independence in 1980. Is he the right person to lead other African leaders in convincing Nkurunziza a third term is unwise? Military coups are no longer de rigueur, as the South Africa-based Institute for Security Studies‚Äôs recent report shows: it found 16 African leaders tried to remain in power by changing their countries‚Äô constitutions to remove presidential term limits between 2000 and 2015. The fact that 10 of them succeeded will surely bring some comfort (and inspiration) to Nkurunziza.
A look at the AU leaders who preceded Mugabe doesn‚Äôt paint a promising picture, either: the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was the union‚Äôs chairperson in 2009. He had been in power in Libya for an astonishing 40 years. In 2011 the union was led by Teodoro Obiang Nguema, the leader of Equatorial Guinea who has been in power since 1979. What has the AU done about any of these leaders? What did it do when Mugabe went on an orgy of torture after he lost the parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe in 2008? Nothing. Africa rising? This track record raises the question: what is the AU really for? At its inauguration in 2002, the AU was led by a cohort of leaders ‚Äì among them Nigeria‚Äôs former military leader Olusegun Obasanjo, South Africa‚Äôs Thabo Mbeki and Senegal‚Äôs Abdoulaye Wade ‚Äì who declared a commitment to ending wars, promoting democracy and driving economic transformation on the continent. They were not angels, but the ‚ÄúAfrica rising‚Äù narrative is partly a result of their drive to show that peace and democracy can lead lead to greater economic activity and prosperity. This was done by example: South Africa and Nigeria grew phenomenally in the 2000s following the restoration of democracy in both countries, a message the countries‚Äô leaders emphasised regularly.
But since Nkurunziza quashed the military coup at home there isn‚Äôt a single AU member country calling clearly for him to stand down at the end of his second term. Although at first South Africa and a few West African leaders at first condemned his actions, they‚Äôve all since back-tracked. The organisation is unlikely to take a clear stance as it meets this weekend, and Nkurunziza will comfortably join other leaders who continue to warm their presidential seats well beyond their sell-by dates. Beyond leaders overstaying their welcome, there are other pressing issues on the union‚Äôs agenda: a call will be made for a permanent seat for Africa on the UN Security Council; there might be some movement on building a continental ‚Äúintervention‚Äù force; and there will be declarations on fighting islamist groups like Boko Haram in Nigeria and al-Shabaab in Somalia. In Burundi, however ‚Äì and for many of us on the continent who are footing the bill for the AU‚Äôs expensive jamboree ‚Äì the question remains: what is the point of the AU when it loses its backbone at the first sight of a dictator?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-12T10:43:41Z,world,World news,Dominique Strauss-Kahn acquitted in pimping trial,"Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund, has been cleared by a French court of ‚Äúaggravated pimping‚Äù. The one-time French presidential hopeful, who has described seeking ‚Äúrecreation‚Äù from the stress of world politics by having rough sex with strangers at orgies in Europe and the US, was found not to have promoted or profited from the prostitution of seven women. The judges said Strauss-Kahn was not the instigator of the orgies with prostitutes. Throughout his trial, he maintained he did not know that some of the women brought to him by businessmen friends at group-sex sessions were prostitutes, saying he thought they were merely swingers like himself. The businessmen had told the women not to say they had been paid. Strauss-Kahn‚Äôs lawyer, Henri Leclerc, said the case against him had been ‚Äútotally empty‚Äù, accusing investigating magistrates of a moral crusade with no legal foundation. The wide-reaching trial in the northern French city of Lille revealed a saga of money, fame and women travelling to luxury locations for sex with powerful men against a backdrop of economic deprivation and social misery.
Known as the Carlton affair, the case began in 2011 as an investigation into an alleged prostitution network at Lille‚Äôs Hotel Carlton, where women ‚Äì described as ‚Äúlivestock‚Äù or ‚Äúdossiers‚Äù ‚Äì had been offered up as the ‚Äúdessert course‚Äù at business lunches. Strauss-Kahn was never involved in any alleged activity at the hotel, but when his name was mentioned by sex workers in interviews with investigators, the inquiry was widened. Thirteen other men appeared in court on pimping charges, many with no connection to Strauss-Kahn, but the high-profile coverage of the case centred on the former IMF chief and how he sought to wind down from managing the fallout from the global financial crisis by having sex with strangers brought to him at orgies by businessmen keen to curry favour. The trial exposed not only Strauss-Kahn‚Äôs secret double life but also the harrowing accounts of some of the women with whom he had sex. Between 2009 and 2011, the years covered by the trial, Strauss-Kahn held the most senior economic job in the world in Washington, and he was convinced he would become the next Socialist president of France. He invited TV crews to document his cosy and high-profile marriage to Anne Sinclair, an influential French journalist and feminist, who has since divorced him. During his working day, however, he would send text messages asking a businessman friend to join him at a ‚Äúmagnificent‚Äù swingers‚Äô club in Madrid and bring him some ‚Äúequipment‚Äù, a term he admitted meant women. While in Brussels for IMF meetings, he would be driven to the countryside at night for group sex with strangers on mattresses on the floor of a swingers‚Äô club. Throughout the trial, he said he never knew or suspected that there were prostitutes among the many women brought to him at the sessions. The trial was marked by the tearful accounts of two destitute and vulnerable prostitutes who were among the women brought to locations in Paris, Brussels and Washington to have sex with Strauss-Kahn. They likened the orgies to ‚Äúslaughter‚Äù, ‚Äúkilling‚Äù and ‚Äúbutchery‚Äù. The former IMF chief told the trial that he had regrettably discovered during the court hearings that he had ‚Äúa sexuality that was rougher than the average man‚Äù but that he believed ‚Äúno means no‚Äù. Mounia, a Lille sex worker whom court papers described as having been sexually abused as a child, broke down in tears as she told the court how, at an orgy in Paris, Strauss-Kahn had subjected her to anal penetration against her wishes. She said that when he saw she was crying and in pain he smiled and went ahead ‚Äúwith force‚Äù. Asked by the judge whether he had noticed her crying, Strauss-Kahn said: ‚ÄúNo, I would have found it chilling.‚Äù He said he did not have a precise memory of the woman, but that he had had no sense of refusal. ‚ÄúWhen someone says no, it‚Äôs no,‚Äù he said.
Another prostitute, Jade, who was also sexually abused as a child, described the atmosphere at one Paris hotel orgy. She said of Strauss-Kahn: ‚ÄúNo one asked me my name, there was just a hand on my head to fellate him.‚Äù She later broke down in tears as she told the court how on a different occasion Strauss-Kahn had also subjected her to anal penetration against her wishes. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have time to say no,‚Äù she said. Strauss-Kahn told the court he did not view his sexual encounter with Jade in the same way that she did. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realise,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not for doing things that are disagreeable for partners. ‚ÄúI had no way of knowing she didn‚Äôt want it ‚Ä¶ It wasn‚Äôt my intention, I‚Äôm sorry it happened like that.‚Äù Throughout the trial, Strauss-Kahn maintained the suggestion that he had to be brought ‚Äúfresh meat‚Äù by businessmen friends was a ‚Äúdisgrace‚Äù. He insisted he never had sex with prostitutes because ‚ÄúI prefer a party atmosphere before, during and after‚Äù. As he told one sexual partner: ‚ÄúI have a horror of whores.‚Äù Prostitution involving people over the age of 18 is not illegal in France, but pimping and living off the benefits is. Just as the Strauss-Kahn verdict came through, however, the French parliament voted in a second reading to criminalise prostitutes‚Äô clients, making payment for sex punishable by a fine. The bill must now return to the senate for a further reading. Strauss-Kahn had told the court that group-sex sessions were rare ‚Äúrecreation‚Äù in his hectic schedule as IMF chief, taking place only four times a year because he had been very busy ‚Äúsaving the world from catastrophe‚Äù at the time of the US sub-prime crisis. The two entrepreneurs from northern France who flew women to the US for orgies involving Strauss-Kahn ended their last visit on 13 May 2011, the day before he was arrested in New York over the alleged attempted rape of a hotel maid, Nafissatou Diallo. Criminal charges against Strauss-Kahn in the Diallo case were dropped by prosecutors in New York, and he later settled a civil action with her out of court. The case marked the end of his political career in France, where he is now seen as a pariah, and his acquittal on pimping charges in the Carlton case is not expected to change that view. Strauss-Kahn‚Äôs two businessmen friends and a police chief acquaintance were also cleared of pimping charges on Friday. Dominique Alderweireld, 65 ‚Äì known as Dodo la Saumure or Dodo the Pimp, and who runs brothels in Belgium ‚Äì was acquitted of sending prostitutes from his establishments to Paris and the US for Strauss-Kahn. Ren√© Kojfer, 74, the former head of public relations at the Hotel Carlton in Lille, was the only man to be convicted. He was given a one-year suspended sentence for pimping ‚Äì charges which had no connection to Strauss-Kahn.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-12T10:01:13Z,world,World news,China orders inquiry into deaths of children who swallowed pesticide,"China‚Äôs prime minister has ordered an urgent inquiry into the deaths of four ‚Äúleft-behind‚Äù children who swallowed pesticide after being abandoned at their rural home. The siblings ‚Äì one boy and three girls aged between five and and 14 ‚Äì were found on Tuesday at their home in Cizhu village in Guizhou, south-west China, one of the country‚Äôs poorest provinces. As public outrage grew on Friday and two local officials were reported to have been sacked, Li Keqiang called for immediate steps to prevent similar incidents. ‚ÄúThose who fail to act or pretend to act must be held responsible,‚Äù Li said, according to the central government‚Äôs website. ‚ÄúSuch a tragedy cannot be allowed to happen again.‚Äù The case has shocked China, where there are an estimated 60 million children left behind when their parents head to the cities in search of work.
The dismal conditions in which the four siblings lived were captured in photographs published by Xinhua, China‚Äôs official news agency. One picture showed a red and yellow poster bearing the Chinese character for happiness taped to the door of a dirty, junk-filled room. Responsibility for the infants‚Äô deaths lay with their absent parents and not with authorities, reports in state-run media hinted. Ren Xifen, the children‚Äôs mother, had abandoned her family last year ‚Äúafter a long and bitter dispute with her husband‚Äù, Xinhua reported, citing the local Communist party chief. In March, Zhang Fangqi, their father, also left the village, leaving the couple‚Äôs four children to fend for themselves. ‚ÄúThe children did not lack food and clothes, but lacked the love and care of parents,‚Äù Xiao Wenying, a distant relative, told Xinhua. ‚ÄúThe parents failed to fulfill their parental responsibilities.‚Äù Officials had tried to call the father ‚Äúmore than 100 times‚Äù since Tuesday but had not been able to reach him, Dai Delun, a government press officer, told the Beijing News. However, experts said the tragedy also pointed to government negligence. ‚Äú[If] the family is not capable of or willing to take care of the children, the state should step in,‚Äù said Chen Fucai, a child welfare specialist from the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. By Friday afternoon, both parents had been tracked down, the Legal Evening News reported. ‚ÄúHave heard what happened to the family,‚Äù the father reportedly said via a social media account through which he had been located. ‚ÄúComing home tomorrow.‚Äù Additional reporting by Luna Lin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-12T09:42:07Z,world,World news,British tourist who stripped on Malaysian mountain pleads guilty,"The British gap year tourist Eleanor Hawkins has pleaded guilty in a court in Malaysia after stripping on the country‚Äôs highest peak. Arriving handcuffed at court in Kota Kinabalu for a second time, Hawkins and three other tourists had to battle through a throng of reporters to enter the building. The four pleaded guilty to committing obscene acts in a public place. The charge, read out in court, was that at 6.45am on 30 May in the vicinity of Mount Kinabalu they carried out ‚Äúobscene acts in a public place under 294 (a) of the penal code‚Äù. They were also accused of ‚Äúexcessive noise and ignoring the advice (of their guide)‚Äù. All four avoided trial by pleading guilty. Their lawyer said they were willing to offer a public apology and called for them to be fined and deported. The public prosecutor called for a sentence to deter others, and said the tourists‚Äô behaviour had caused ‚Äúannoyance to many Malaysians‚Äù.
He urged the judge to take into account the public sentiment, adding that ‚Äúclaiming to be young and innocent is not acceptable‚Äù. Hawkins, 23, was first to stand in court to hear the charges. Asked if she pleaded guilty, she replied ‚ÄúI do‚Äù. She was handcuffed to the Canadian Danielle Peterson, 22, who also pleaded guilty. The two men, Peterson‚Äôs brother, Lindsey, and Dutchman Dylan Snel, both 23, also pleaded guilty. The hearing was adjourned for 10 minutes after the four disagreed with some of the facts that were presented to them by a court aid. The four tourists, who had been remanded in jail, could be sentenced to up to three months in prison or fined, or both. Sentencing is expected shortly. Before the court hearing Hawkins had told her father, Tim, by telephone that she expected to be charged. He told the Guardian: ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt want to second-guess what‚Äôs going to happen. So we are just waiting for the outcome. It could go either way. We have been up all night waiting.‚Äù
Earlier on Friday, the chief police officer investigating the case confirmed all four tourists would be charged but he refused to say what sentence the police were looking for. Senior police officers from Kota Kinabalu have been in Malaysia‚Äôs capital, Kuala Lumpur, for meetings on how to proceed with a case that has caused controversy in the south-east Asian country. Many residents believe Mount Kinabalu, where the offence is alleged to have taken place, holds the spirits of their ancestors and some have suggested the disrespectful act caused an earthquake that killed 18 people days later. The tourists have also breached customary law in the Malaysian state of Sabah, the northern half of the island of Borneo, and could face an indigenous court. It is not clear what type of punishment they would receive from this court, which can order community work and fines for offences.
Sabah‚Äôs chief tribal priest, Tindarama Aman Sirom Simbuna, told Malaysia‚Äôs Star newspaper that the tourists should be fined in line with local custom. It quoted him saying: ‚ÄúAccording to local beliefs, the spirit of the mountain is very angry. This fine, called sogit in the native tongue, should be in the form of 10 male or female buffalo.‚Äù Police sources have said that, based on previous convictions, the sentence in the civil court is likely to be small. ‚ÄúThis is a small case. It will likely be a small fine with no jail time,‚Äù the source said. ‚ÄúWe care more about drugs.‚Äù
The four tourists had already appeared in purple outfits at Karamunsing police station in Kota Kinabalu, the main town near the mountain. Since then they have been held in the city jail, a two-storey building with 24-hour armed guards, surrounded by two four-metre-high (12ft) wire fences topped with barbed wire. Police in Malaysia are looking for six other foreigners who are wanted for public indecency, a police officer involved in the case told the Guardian on Friday. ‚ÄúWe think they are still in Sabah,‚Äù the officer revealed on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to media. ‚ÄúThere is a possibility they have already left the country.‚Äù He said Hawkins and her fellow detainees did not identify the others who were with them: ‚ÄúThey said they didn‚Äôt know their full names, only nicknames.‚Äù Another police source said border guards had been informed and were hoping to catch the others at airports.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-12T09:18:43Z,world,World news,"Japanese court endorses adultery for business purposes, experts say","A court in Japan has shocked the country‚Äôs legal sector by concluding that a seven-year sexual relationship between a company president and the owner of a Tokyo hostess club did not constitute an extramarital affair. In a ruling that could have profound consequences for future lawsuits aimed at adulterous men and their lovers, the Tokyo district court dismissed a compensation claim by the man‚Äôs wife, saying that his relationship was a purely commercial arrangement that had not harmed their marriage. Some experts said the ruling effectively endorsed adultery, as long as the third party ‚Äì in this case the hostess ‚Äì was motivated by financial gain. The judge, Masamitsu Shiseki, said the hostess had slept with the customer only to secure his continued patronage of the club she runs in the capital‚Äôs Ginza shopping and entertainment district. High-class hostess clubs charge customers large sums to spend time drinking, chatting and singing karaoke in the company of female staff, but they do not offer sexual services. Shiseki said the hostess‚Äôs actions were more akin to prostitution than an affair, and dismissed the wife‚Äôs ¬•4m (¬£20,860) claim for emotional distress. Details of the 2014 ruling have only just been made public in a Japanese legal journal after the plaintiff decided not to appeal, saying she did not want to be reminded of her husband‚Äôs behaviour. Shiseki said it was common knowledge that hostesses slept with customers, to whom they have no emotional attachment, to retain their patronage. ‚ÄúThe defendant had sexual relations with her patron only for business, like in cases of prostitution,‚Äù the Asahi Shimbun quoted him as saying in his ruling. ‚ÄúEven if the wife is disgusted by the act, it does not constitute a legal offence.‚Äù The only difference between prostitution and sleeping with customerswas that in the former, he said, payment was made directly.
Instead, he referred to the case as makura eigyo, which translates as ‚Äúpillow sales‚Äù and usually refers to hostesses who enter into a sexual relationship with customers to ensure they continue to visit. That kind of relationship was not illegal and ‚Äúnot something that will damage the tranquility of a marriage‚Äù, the judge said. The hostess, who along with the husband and wife is not named, denied having sex with the man. The wife‚Äôs lawyer, Katsuyuki Aoshima, said the ruling could harm future legal actions against suspected adulterers. ‚ÄúCitizens should discuss whether compensation should be made by a hostess having a sexual relationship with a married man,‚Äù the Japan Times quoted him as saying. ‚ÄúA judgment like this case shouldn‚Äôt be set as a new standard without clear and logical reasoning.‚Äù Other legal experts rounded on the ruling, saying it deviated dramatically from precedents that require defendants to pay compensation to a wronged spouse if they were aware that their lover was married at the time of the affair. ‚ÄúThe ruling is not in line with past court decisions on cases involving an extramarital affair, and appears to greatly deviate from socially accepted norms,‚Äù Hayato Tamura, a divorce lawyer, told the Asahi Shimbun. Kaoru Inoue, a former judge, told the Shukan Bunshun magazine that since the wife did not appeal, ‚Äúthere is a possibility that this might affect future trials involving relationships between men and women‚Äù. The ruling was greeted with dismay by private investigators, who derive much of their income from gathering evidence of adultery on behalf of suspicious spouses. ‚ÄúIf the ruling makes it difficult to demand compensation from hostesses, many clients will stop seeking our assistance to prove their claims,‚Äù Fumiyoshi Hashimoto told the Asahi Shimbun. ‚ÄúIt can reduce our business opportunities.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-12T07:00:08Z,world,World news,Whole lotta live: the night Led Zeppelin played an Indian gig for a bottle of scotch,"It was the night Led Zeppelin played Bombay. Not in a stadium, park or concert hall, but in a bar called Slip Disc that Jimmy Page and Robert Plant had found as they searched for somewhere to drink in the Indian port city. There, the two British rock stars, at the height of global adulation, were joined by local musicians for an impromptu jam. Forty-three years later, details of the one-off gig in the city, now known as Mumbai, have been revealed in a new book, while Led Zeppelin have announced they are to release previously unheard recordings made with classical Indian musicians on the same trip. The news, reported in all major English-language newspapers in India and by the national press agency, has prompted a wave of excitement.
‚ÄúIt was a pretty legendary moment. No one ever thought they would turn up and then they did and very few people got to hear them. The idea that they came [to India] is a huge thing,‚Äù said Aditya Varma, of the Rock Street Journal, an Indian music magazine. The book comes amid signs of a revival of interest in the 1970s, a decade which saw political and economic crises in India but also the beginning of globalisation. Authorities in northern India recently said they would be refurbishing the ashram in Rishikesh, the temple town visited by the Beatles in 1968 and which subsequently became a high point of the hippy trail through south Asia, while the Times of India reported a return to 70s-style flared trousers. ‚ÄúPopularised by ‚Äòthe angry young man‚Äô of Bollywood in early 70s, bell-bottoms are here again,‚Äù the newspaper‚Äôs correspondent in Ludhiana, a city in the north-west, wrote. One Indian fashion blog described the 70s as ‚Äúthe most fashionable decade of India‚Äù. Sidharth Bhatia, the journalist who revealed the 1972 Led Zeppelin visit and the author of India Psychedelic : the Story of a Rocking Generation, said there had been ‚Äúa wave of nostalgia‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt was a minuscule number of people at the time. It had no relevance in the broader scene musically. India at the time was very much into high culture or folk culture. But there‚Äôs been lots of reaction [to the new book] among the under-25s. They all say this is what my mum and dad told me about,‚Äù Bhatia said.
Page and Plant, Led Zeppelin‚Äôs guitarist and singer, were returning from a tour in Japan when they stopped in India in 1972. They had tried the members‚Äô only club at the luxury Taj hotel where they were staying but found it staid and boring. At the door of the Slip Disc, a grubby bar nearby, the two long-haired rock stars were stopped by a bouncer who told them ‚Äúno hippies allowed‚Äù but were taken in by a regular who thought he recognised them, according to Bhatia. Inside, Page and Plant ordered beers and watched a local band before the manager asked them to play. No one recorded their near hour-hour jam with two regulars and instruments that were at hand. The next night a queue formed round the block at the bar but the musicians did not return. Plant later described ‚Äúplaying in an old dive ‚Ä¶ for a bottle of scotch‚Äù. ‚ÄúJimmy and I played in a club in Bombay in 1972,‚Äù he told the Guardian in 2012. ‚ÄúI played drums and he played guitar and it was the only club in Bombay that had a drum kit. Somehow or other we ended up in there with loads and loads of illict substances. Some guy is writing a book about rock in India ‚Äì and apparently it was born in this club with Page and I wired out of our faces. I‚Äôm not a very good drummer, to say the least, but for some reason or another it left a mark.‚Äù Imports were tightly restricted at the time and local rock musicians had to make do with instruments and equipment that were locally made copies or old and repeatedly repaired. ‚ÄúIt was superb. I was singing through a Fender cabinet which was the size of a 12-inch telly, and Pagey was playing a guitar that must have had piano strings on it. And the people were so happy because they‚Äôd never witnessed anybody [who was] just passing through taking the trouble to stop and play,‚Äù Plant later told a journalist.
The band had already become one of the wealthiest and bestselling of all time, filling vast venues across the world and with multiple platinum discs. The recordings Led Zeppelin are releasing this year were made on the same trip with professionals from the Bombay Symphony Orchestra using traditional instruments. Page later described it as a ‚Äútricky‚Äù but ‚Äúexciting learning experience‚Äù. The band went on to record the hit song Kashmir, though it was apparently inspired by a drive through the desert in north Africa. ‚ÄúIndian rhythm has long been admired by musicians worldwide. It‚Äôs very complex and pretty advanced. As for Led Zep‚Äôs influence here, it went into the mix. Call it a remix or whatever, but it‚Äôs there somewhere,‚Äù said B Narayanaswamy, a marketing consultant and music enthusiast in Delhi.
There have been some signs of nostalgia for the 70s before. In 2011 a new version of the classic song Dum Maaro Dum of 1971 was a huge hit. The song comes from the Bollywood film Hare Rama Hare Krishna, which explored the complexities of the impact of western popular culture on India at the time and caused a storm by showing an Indian girl led astray by foreign hippies in Kathmandu, Nepal. Bhatia pointed to the enduring appeal of India‚Äôs best-known film star, Amitabh Bachchan, as evidence. ‚ÄúWhy the interest in a film star who is 72 years old? Or in Sholay [a classic Bollywood film starring Bachchan], which came out in 1975?‚Äù The 70s saw widespread unrest in India, a war with Pakistan, the nationalisation of much of the economy and the declaration of a state of emergency by Indira Gandhi, the then prime minister. The decade also saw the coming of age of the first generation of Indians with no memory of life under British rule, which ended in 1947. ‚ÄúThere is a political nostalgia now for the decade too,‚Äù said Ramachandra Guha, a historian and commentator. ‚ÄúIndia has had so many weak leaders that people look back now to a time when we had a strong one, with all the advantages and disadvantages.‚Äù However, any cultural nostalgia is limited to a small segment. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs restricted to people in the major urban centres and really to a certain type of middle-class generation born in the 1950s,‚Äù Guha said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-12T06:24:55Z,world,World news,Ko√ß pops up at Bilderberg: could this be the year to let it all hang out?,"There was an unfortunate limo-jam outside the gates of the Interalpen-Hotel. Over to the side was a whispering huddle of police, flicking hopelessly through a list of names and shrugging, while a row of V12 Mercedes idled angrily. What was happening? Had the organisers realised they‚Äôd made a terrible mistake inviting Ed Balls and scratched his name at the last minute? A people carrier pulled up to the back of the queue, carrying a face I knew well. It was Turkish billionaire and Bilderberg steering committee member, Mustafa Ko√ß. He rubbed the back of his wrestler‚Äôs neck with a meaty hand and looked profoundly unamused by the Ko√ß block. I haven‚Äôt witnessed a Ko√ß being denied entry this embarrassingly since my university leaving ball. After snapping a quick Ko√ß pic I ventured a hello. ‚ÄúMr Ko√ß!‚Äù I cried, and gave a friendly wave. He nodded back. I introduced myself, and took his photo again. This suddenly felt a little rude in the middle of a more than usually human moment, so I apologised. ‚ÄúNo problem,‚Äù he said, and smiled. Oh my goodness, this was it: dialogue! The great I-Thou connection at the root of all human interaction. Me and Ko√ß, two souls reaching out to each other, across the barricades. I pressed on. ‚ÄúAre you looking forward to the conference?‚Äù His eyes shone and he nodded a yes. ‚ÄúAnd what are your thoughts on the recent Turkish elections?‚Äù at which point our burgeoning friendship was cut short tragically short when Ko√ß‚Äôs driver raised his window. The bottleneck cleared and Ko√ß shot off. I appreciate Skelton-Ko√ß may not have been Frost-Nixon, but it was a rare moment of humanity across the barricades. And let‚Äôs face it, this meagre exchange shouted across a driver‚Äôs chest is probably the closest we‚Äôll get to a press conference this whole Bilderberg. I have to say, the cavernous lack of press co-operation from what is an important political summit, attended by politicians, prime ministers, and public policymakers, is seeming more absurd by the year. At this year‚Äôs summit for example, the subject of ‚ÄúGreece‚Äù is being discussed by three European prime ministers, the Austrian president, a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, two European finance ministers (including George Osborne) and the head of the Dutch national bank. Some major players in the game. Discussing it with them, we have a large number of CEOs and chairpersons from some extremely large financial institutions, all of whom have a keen interest in what happens to Greece: the assembled heads of HSBC, Lazard, Deutsche Bank, Santander and KKR; board members of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs; the chairman of Goldman Sachs International; and the vice-chairman of BlackRock. All these public officials meeting with all these corporations, and no representation whatsoever from any serving Greek politicians. And no press oversight. It might perhaps be wiser, and certainly more respectful towards the journalists who are being harassed by police, and the electorates of the politicians who are attending, for the Bilderberg group to hold a press conference on the final day. There‚Äôs a precedent for this: it‚Äôs what they used to do, before the Lockheed scandal and the resignation of Prince Bernhard saw them retreat further into secrecy. I‚Äôve seen footage of a Bilderberg press conference from the 1970s. It could happen again. I‚Äôm sure the funding that Goldman Sachs and BP funnel into the Bilderberg conferences (as revealed in the annual returns of the Bilderberg Association) could cover a few rows of chairs and a microphone. Nothing fancy. A short statement and a few Q&As. You don‚Äôt have to reinvent the wheel. Just give us something resembling a wheel. A chopped log would do at a pinch. We‚Äôll take anything. We‚Äôre tired of watching diplomatic passports being slid above tinted windows. Tired of politicians hiding their faces, and ministers refusing to talk about what they talked about. Tired of police officers who, when they aren‚Äôt hassling journalists, are lining up in ranks in front of limousines to obscure the view.
Now here‚Äôs an idea: maybe Mustafa Ko√ß could help enable this press conference? The Ko√ß family‚Äôs conglomerate, the brilliantly named Ko√ß Holding, lists ‚Äúfour main inviolable principles‚Äù in its articles of corporate governance, and the very first of these is ‚Äútransparency‚Äù. Ko√ß himself, the chairman of the company, seems happy to chat to the press, and he‚Äôs spoken out against corruption in politics. He said recently, just before his country‚Äôs elections: ‚ÄúOur people deserve clean politics.‚Äù Clean politics is open politics. Transparency lets the sunlight in. Ko√ß might have a fight on his hands, but he looks like someone who doesn‚Äôt mind twisting arms. And there‚Äôs no denying that Ko√ß is a powerful presence at Bilderberg. There are a lot of friends of Ko√ß on the steering committee, so when it comes to lobbying for better press relations, maybe Ko√ß can swing it? Surely something this simple wouldn‚Äôt be hard for Ko√ß. Not a Ko√ß that powerful. After all, Ko√ß is hugely connected in the world of business. He‚Äôs a member of the International Advisory board of Rolls-Royce, and sits on JPMorgan‚Äôs International Advisory Council alongside Tony Blair. And his fellow member of the steering committee, Peter Sutherland, the chairman of Goldman Sachs International, is on the board of Ko√ß Holding. And I think, in some small way, I have an understanding with Ko√ß. So, in the spirit of dialogue and progress, of transparency and ‚Äúclean politics‚Äù, I‚Äôm reaching out to Ko√ß, to help make this press conference happen. I may be wrong, my dreams my come to nothing, but I have a strange feeling that 2015 might just be the year of Ko√ß.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-12T03:23:46Z,world,World news,Germanwings co-pilot saw 41 doctors but 'secrecy law stopped them reporting him',"A number of doctors who treated the Germanwings flight 4U9525 co-pilot Andreas Lubitz felt he was unfit to fly but did not tell his employers because of German patient secrecy laws, a French state prosecutor has said. Lubitz, who is believed to have intentionally crashed the plane into the Alps, killing all 150 people on board, saw seven doctors in the month before the 24 March crash, including three appointments with a psychiatrist, said the Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin.
Robin, who is leading a criminal investigation into the crash, said some of the doctors felt Lubitz was psychologically unstable, and some felt he was unfit to fly, but ‚Äúunfortunately that information was not reported because of medical secrecy requirements‚Äù. In Germany, doctors risk prison if they disclose information about their patients to anyone unless there is evidence they intend to commit a serious crime or harm themselves. Robin also said Lubitz, 27, had vision problems and feared going blind. He said Lubitz was afraid his vision problems would put his job at risk. Robin disclosed that Lubitz saw 41 doctors in the five years before the flight from Barcelona to D√ºsseldorf crashed. He said the investigation so far had ‚Äúenabled us to confirm without a shadow of a doubt‚Äù that Lubitz ‚Äúdeliberately destroyed the plane and deliberately killed 150 people, including himself‚Äù. Investigators say Lubitz locked the pilot out of the cockpit and flew the plane into a French mountainside, after having researched suicide methods and cockpit door rules and practiced an unusual descent. The prosecutor has upgraded the investigation from a preliminary inquiry to a fully fledged manslaughter inquiry, which means the case will be passed to French investigating magistrates who can file eventual charges against people or entities. St√©phane Gicquel, head of a disaster support group, who attended a meeting between French officials and the victims, told AFP that the ‚Äústakes‚Äù in the expanded inquiry were to find out if there had been errors or negligence in tracking the mental state of the co-pilot, who had a history of severe depression. Gicquel said the families were shown three different reconstructions of what had happened in the cockpit. Several expressed their anger at a delay in the return of their relatives‚Äô remains after spelling errors on death certificates. The mayor of the French village of Prads-Haute-Bl√©one, near the crash site, said there had been slight spelling errors ‚Äúof foreign-sounding names‚Äù on several death certificates. Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, said: ‚ÄúThe repatriation of victims‚Äô remains will continue over the next few weeks and should be finished by the end of June.‚Äù Investigators last month finished identifying the remains of all 150 people aboard the flight. The German lawyer Peter Kortas, whose firm represents relatives of 34 victims, told Associated Press that negotiations with Germanwings about compensation began several days ago. The first burial is expected on Friday. Nearly half of the victims were German, 47 were Spanish and there were victims of 17 other nationalities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-11T22:33:57Z,world,World news,Israel exonerates itself over Gaza beach killings of four children last year,"The Israeli military has cleared itself of culpability in one of the most controversial incidents in last summer‚Äôs Gaza war: a missile attack that killed four children on Gaza beach and injured a number of others.
Israel‚Äôs advocate general‚Äôs office said the attack, which led to the death of four boys aged between nine and 11 was a ‚Äútragic accident‚Äù. An account of the investigation, posted late on Thursday by military spokesman Lt Col Peter Lerner, said the strike had targeted a ‚Äúcompound‚Äù which had been known as belonging to Hamas‚Äôs Naval Police and Naval Force (including naval commandos)‚Äù. But journalists who attended the scene in the immediate aftermath of the attack ‚Äì including a reporter from the Guardian ‚Äì saw a small and dilapidated fisherman‚Äôs hut containing a few tools where the children had been playing hide-and-seek. Mohammad Ramiz Bakr, 11, Ahed Atef Bakr and Zakariya Ahed Bakr, both 10, and Ismail Mahmoud Bakr, nine, were killed when they were hit by explosive rounds. Three of them died as they sought to flee the beach after the first child was killed. Three other people were injured in the attack: Hamad Bakr, 13, was hit by shrapnel in his chest; his cousin Motasem, 11, injured in his head and legs, and Mohammad Abu Watfah, 21, who was hit by shrapnel in his stomach. The conclusion of the Israeli military investigation comes while the Israel is under a preliminary investigation by the International Criminal Court to establish whether war crimes were committed during the Gaza war ‚Äì both by Israel and Hamas. The finding will inevitably raise questions over the way in which Israel investigates incidents in which civilians were killed. Israel‚Äôs conduct in last summer‚Äôs war was thrown under a harsh spotlight last month with the publication of the testimonies of dozens of soldiers who served in Gaza, collected by the Israeli human rights group Breaking the Silence, which included allegations that the Israeli military did not meet its obligations to protect civilians in wartime. According to the UN, 2,200 Palestinians were killed in the 50-day conflict, of whom 1,492 were civilians, 605 militants and 123 unverified. Thursday‚Äôs statement by the Israel Defence Forces said the conclusion came at the end of an ‚Äúextensive criminal investigation‚Äù. ‚ÄúDuring the investigation,‚Äù it added, ‚Äútestimonies were collected from a large number of IDF soldiers and officers who were involved in the planning and execution of the attack.‚Äù The statement continued: ‚ÄúAdditionally, an extensive number of documents relating to the attack were reviewed, along with video footage documenting the attack in real time, as well as media images and video footage which documented parts of the incident. ‚ÄúEfforts were made to collect the testimonies of Gaza strip residents who were, allegedly, witnesses to the incident. In this context, the collection of testimony from three witnesses was coordinated. Regretfully, despite the prior coordination, the witnesses eventually declined to meet the investigators, and instead provided affidavits in regard to the incident.‚Äù Although the attack was witnessed by a Guardian reporter, no attempt was made by the Israeli military investigators to seek a statement. The IDF statement continued: ‚ÄúFrom the factual findings collected by the investigators, it revealed that the incident took place in an area that had long been known as a compound belonging to Hamas‚Äôs Naval Police and Naval Force (including naval commandos), and which was utilized exclusively by militants.‚Äù The hut, however, was in plain sight of nearby hotels housing international journalists, none of whom described seeing militants in the area at the time of the attack. Continuing its statement the Israeli military continued: ‚ÄúThe compound in question spans the length of the breakwater of the Gaza City seashore, closed off by a fence and clearly separated from the beach serving the civilian population. ‚ÄúIt further found in the course of the investigation (including from the affidavits provided by Palestinian witnesses), that the compound was known to the residents of the Gaza Strip as a compound which was used exclusively by Hamas‚Äôs Naval Police. ‚ÄúThe IDF carried out a number of attacks on the compound in the days prior to the incident. In the course of one such attack, which took place on the day prior to the incident (15 July 2014), a container located inside the compound, which was used to store military supplies, was attacked.‚Äù The Israeli claims appear at odds in several details with what journalists were able to see at the time. The breakwater is both easily accessible from a side lane and also is located on one of the busiest parts of the public beach in Gaza port and accessible not only to the fishermen who use it, but local Palestinians who come to sunbathe and swim within feet of it. The container described in the Israeli finding also appeared to contain no military equipment. Describing the moment of the attack the Iisraeli military continues: ‚ÄúOn 16 July, aerial surveillance identified a number of figures entering the compound at a running pace. ‚ÄúThese figures entered a shed adjoining the container which had been attacked the day prior. Against the backdrop of the aforementioned intelligence assessment, these were believed to be militants from Hamas‚Äôs Naval Forces, who had arrived at the compound in order to prepare to execute the aforementioned military activity against the IDF. It should be stressed that the figures were not identified at any point during the incident, as children.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn light of the above, it was decided to conduct an aerial attack against the figures which had been identified, after all the necessary authorizations for an attack had been obtained, and after a civilian presence in the area had been ruled out. ‚ÄúWhen one of the identified figures entered into the remains of the container which had been attacked on the day prior to the incident, one missile was fired from the air towards the container and the adjoining shed. As a result of this attack, it appeared that one of the figures identified was hit. Following this attack, the rest of the figures began to run in the direction of the compound‚Äôs exit. Shortly before their exit from the compound, an additional missile was fired from the air towards them, which hit the figures in question after they had exited the compound.‚Äù What is not clear from the Israeli report is why Israeli targeters had failed to identify that children had been playing on the beach prior to the attack.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-11T19:19:47Z,world,World news,Bilderberg 2015: where criminals mingle with ministers,"I had three Austrian policemen in my hotel room last night. They stood there all grim faced with their fluorescent bibs, torches and sidearms. It was like the worst ever fancy dress party. I offered them a pilsner. They declined. They were too busy checking my ID that had been carefully checked 10 minutes prior at a police checkpoint. And carefully checked two minutes prior to that, at another police checkpoint. This third check took so long, it was so late, and my patience was so thin, that eventually I took my shirt and trousers off in front of the officers. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm having a shower,‚Äù I explained, and went and had one. When I‚Äôd finished, I came out in my towel, thinking they might be gone. They weren‚Äôt. ‚ÄúPut your clothes on please and come to your car.‚Äù This party wasn‚Äôt getting any better. Out at my car I couldn‚Äôt be bothered to get into the whole ‚Äòprobable cause‚Äô thing so I flung open the doors and with as much good cheer as I could muster, said: ‚ÄúHelp yourself‚Äù. They did. While one set of police searched my car with their torches, another lot clustered round me and asked me questions: ‚ÄúWhere do you live? What are you doing here?‚Äù I‚Äôm a journalist and I live in a police state. What about you? In my trouser pocket I found a ‚ÄúMedienhandbuch‚Äù from the G7, which I was given in my goodie bag when I was accredited there. By the light of a police searchlight, which was trained on me like I was trying to escape Stalag 17, I read out passages to my guards to pass the time. ‚ÄúExperienced staff from the Federal Government will be happy to help you with your work ‚Ä¶‚Äù An officer interrupted. ‚ÄúYour address please.‚Äù It was on my driving licence in his hand. This was getting silly. A little while later, bored and a bit cold, I decided to point out to the officers that while they were treating a journalist like a criminal, there were actual criminals about to arrive at the hotel they were guarding. Convicted criminals. Such as disgraced former CIA boss, David Petraeus, who‚Äôs just been handed a $100,000 (¬£64,000) fine and two years‚Äô probation for leaking classified information.
Petraeus now works for the vulturous private equity firm KKR, run by Henry Kravis, who does arguably Bilderberg‚Äôs best impression of Gordon Gecko out of Wall Street. Which he cleverly combines with a pretty good impression of an actual gecko. ‚ÄúWhat is a gecko?‚Äù asked one of my captors. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you what a gecko is if you tell me where the press accreditation centre is. What, there isn‚Äôt one? That‚Äôs a shame, because it would be really useful. You wouldn‚Äôt have to harass me in the middle of the night like this. I could just show you my press pass.‚Äù The policeman scribbled on his notebook. ‚ÄúGreat, are you getting this down?‚Äù No. He was writing down the number on my driving licence. Again. ‚ÄúCan I go now?‚Äù Another no. So I continued my list of criminals. I moved on to someone closer to home: Ren√© Benko, the Austrian real estate baron, who had a conviction for bribery upheld recently by the supreme court. Which didn‚Äôt stop him making the cut for this year‚Äôs conference. ‚ÄúYou know Benko?‚Äù The cop nodded. It wasn‚Äôt easy to see in the glare of the searchlight, but he looked a little ashamed. I reassured him that Benko‚Äôs crimes were in the very best traditions of Bilderberg. Don‚Äôt forget, the first chairman of the group, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, was the biggest fraudster of the lot; he was caught back in the 70s organising bribes from Lockheed and Northrop for the same arms contract. It was such a scandal that in 1976, Bilderberg had to skip a year out of sheer embarrassment. Maybe they should think about giving this year a miss as well. I wouldn‚Äôt mind. I‚Äôm not having any fun here. ‚ÄúDo you mind turning off that searchlight? I won‚Äôt run away, I promise.‚Äù A stern head shook. The policemen were careful to keep officers on all sides of me. Like they‚Äôve been trained to when faced with a slightly damp journalist wielding a G7 media handbook. I decided to reward their vigilance with a chat about HSBC. The chairman of the troubled banking giant, Douglas Flint, is a regular attendee at Bilderberg, and he‚Äôs heading here again this year, along with a member of the bank‚Äôs board of directors, Rona Fairhead. Perhaps most tellingly, Flint is finding room in his Mercedes for the bank‚Äôs busiest employee: its chief legal officer, Stuart Levey.
A Guardian editorial this week branded HSBC ‚Äúa bank beyond shame‚Äù after it announced plans to cut 8,000 jobs in the UK, while at the same time threatening to shift its headquarters to Hong Kong. And having just been forced to pay ¬£28m in fines to Swiss regulators investigating money-laundering claims. The big question, of course, is how will the chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne, respond to all this? Easy ‚Äì he‚Äôll go along to a luxury Austrian hotel and hole up with three senior members of HSBC in private. For three days. High up on this year‚Äôs conference agenda is ‚Äúcurrent economic issues‚Äù, and without a doubt, one of the biggest economic issues for Osborne at the moment is the future and finances of Europe‚Äôs largest bank. Luckily, the chancellor will have plenty of time at Bilderberg to chat all this through through with Flint, Levey and Fairhead. And the senior Swiss financial affairs official, Pierre Maudet, a member of the Geneva state council in charge of the department of security and the economy. It‚Äôs all so incredibly convenient. Yet it doesn‚Äôt sit easily with Osborne‚Äôs intention, which he trumpeted five years ago, shortly after taking office, ‚Äúto implement the most radical transparency agenda the country has ever seen‚Äù. What he‚Äôs doing this week in Bavaria is about as transparent as an alp. I‚Äôd got about as far as the 8,000 job cuts when I was finally allowed to go free. An utterly ridiculous 35-minute ID check. I would have been more furious but I was starting to get into the swing of my lecture. The searchlight was lowered and they waved me off into the night. ‚ÄúBut wait, I haven‚Äôt even got as far as Henry Kissinger being questioned for war crimes ‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúGoodnight, sir.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-11T18:01:04Z,world,World news,Sainsbury's CEO acquitted of embezzlement charges in Egypt,"The chief executive of Sainsbury‚Äôs, Mike Coupe, has been acquitted by an Egyptian court after contesting a two-year jail sentence for embezzlement. Coupe had been sentenced in his absence by a court in September, following a dispute with businessman Amr el-Nasharty, who had established a short-lived joint venture with the supermarket group in 1999. ‚ÄúWe are pleased that justice has prevailed today, with the court ruling in favour of Mike, and ultimately Sainsbury‚Äôs,‚Äù the retailer said on Thursday. The case relates to the supermarket‚Äôs attempt to open in Egypt in 1999 by buying 80% of Nasharty‚Äôs Egyptian Distribution Group, known as Edge. After a chaotic 18 months, Sainsbury‚Äôs withdrew, having written down the value of its share in the business by ¬£111m. The stake was then bought back by Nasharty, who paid in cash and cheques. Sainsbury‚Äôs said the cheques bounced and now remain in a court file. After agreeing to end the relationship, Nasharty claimed to have discovered Edge was insolvent. He then alleged that Coupe had travelled to Egypt in July 2014 and attempted to seize the cheques from the court file. Coupe says he was in London at the time of the alleged incident. Joel Hills, ITV‚Äôs business editor, said in a tweet in April: ‚ÄúI can confirm that on July 15th 2014 Mike Coupe was not in Cairo ‚Äòseizing cheques‚Äô, he was in London having breakfast with me. And he paid.‚Äù Nasharty has brought several claims against Sainsbury‚Äôs and its employees over the years, the supermarket said Thursday, adding: ‚ÄúWe have always strongly refuted the legal case in Egypt brought against our chief executive, Mike Coupe, which relates to a historic commercial dispute which has absolutely nothing to do with Mr Coupe. Mike was not employed by Sainsbury‚Äôs at the time of the original dispute in 2001 and has never met the complainant, Mr el-Nasharty.‚Äù Coupe was not in court to hear the verdict ‚Äì it was relayed to him by legal representatives. Sainsbury‚Äôs has said Coupe did not find out about his conviction until December 2014, but the supermarket waited until April to tell shareholders, saying it had hoped to first overturn the conviction. The Egyptian venture, the first by Sainsbury‚Äôs in an emerging market, was a bruising experience. The chain was boycotted in 2000 after rumours began circulating that it was Jewish owned. President Hosni Mubarak was drawn into the row, speaking out against the boycott but saying he understood why some Egyptians were against Jewish-owned businesses following a Palestinian uprising. Egyptian students took to the streets, vandalising Sainsbury‚Äôs stores and injuring employees. The firm began the process of selling its Egyptian business in late 2000 after incurring losses. Coupe took over from Sainsbury‚Äôs long serving chief executive Justin King in July 2014, just days before he was supposed to have made the alleged trip to Egypt. He joined the group in 2004, the same year as King, and several years after the Egyptian debacle, having previously worked at Iceland, ASDA and Tesco.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-11T16:33:14Z,world,World news,Zhou Yongkang trial exposes Chinese officials' links with mystic,"The secret trial of China‚Äôs former security tsar exposed not only rampant corruption at the very top of the Communist party but also links between senior government officials and a mysterious fortune teller known as the ‚ÄúXinjiang sage‚Äù. Zhou Yongkang, 72, was jailed for life after being found guilty of corruption, abuse of power and leaking state secrets, it was reported on Thursday.
The latter crime related to claims that Zhou had passed sensitive papers to a man named as Cao Yongzheng, a court in the city of Tianjin heard. ‚ÄúZhou leaked five ‚Äòextremely confidential‚Äô documents and one ‚Äòconfidential‚Äô document to Cao Yongzheng, an unauthorized person, directly contravening the State Secret Law,‚Äù Xinhua, China‚Äôs official news agency reported, citing the court‚Äôs ruling. The ‚Äúdeliberate disclosure of state secrets‚Äù to Cao were ‚Äúin particularly grave circumstances [but] did not have very serious consequences,‚Äù the court added without giving further details of the leak. Cao was born in Shadong province in east China in 1959 but was later named the ‚ÄúXinjiang sage‚Äù after the northwestern region where he was raised. During the 1990s he ‚Äúgained fame for purportedly having unusual abilities‚Äù, Caixin, a respected Chinese magazine, reported last year. Those skills were said to include the power to predict people‚Äôs futures and to cure incurable ailments. In 1993, Cao, a practitioner of qigong, a spiritual martial art, was said to have successfully predicted that Beijing would host the 2008 Olympics. The spiritual healer ‚Äúcarved out a life of wealth and riches amongst the extensive network of relations he quietly built over the decades, especially in the nation‚Äôs capital,‚Äù the Taipei-based website Want China Times claimed in a 2013 story. That network included Zhou Yongkang, the now disgraced security tsar, as well as other senior Communist party figures, it emerged on Thursday. Zhou‚Äôs son, Zhou Bin, had been close to the mystic as had Li Chuncheng, the former deputy party boss of Sichuan province, according to reports. Li, who had links to Zhou Yongkang, went on trial for corruption in April this year where he was accused of engaging in ‚Äúfeudalistic and superstitious acts‚Äù. The fortune teller‚Äôs coziness with power brought financial rewards. In 2005, Cao formed a partnership with one former official from state energy firm CNPC and began to develop oil projects in Xinjiang and Jilin province, Caixin claimed. However, the mystic failed to foresee his own downfall even as investigators closed in on his most powerful follower. Cao was detained last year after attempting to flee to Taiwan, some reports suggested.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-11T16:16:51Z,world,World news,China‚Äôs former security chief given life sentence for corruption,"China‚Äôs former security chief and the arch-rival of the president, Xi Jinping, has been sentenced to life in prison for corruption following a secret trial. Zhou Yongkang ‚Äì one of the Communist party‚Äôs most powerful and feared figures until his retirement in 2012 ‚Äì was a key adversary of the Chinese leader and some experts had predicted he would be executed for his alleged crimes. Following the closed-door trial, the 72-year-old was convicted of bribery, abuse of power and leaking state secrets, Xinhua, China‚Äôs official news agency, announced. He is the most senior Communist party figure ever to have been convicted of such charges. ‚ÄúI realise the harm I have caused to the party and to the people,‚Äù a silver-haired Zhou told the court, according to CCTV, the state broadcaster.
‚ÄúI broke the law and party rules incessantly and the objective facts of my crimes have resulted in grave losses to the party and the nation,‚Äù he added, according to Xinhua. Zhou‚Äôs trial, which was held about 80 miles from Beijing in the north-eastern city of Tianjin, began on 22 May but was only revealed on Thursday evening. The fallen Communist party titan was convicted of taking 129m yuan (¬£13.4m) worth of bribes as well as leaking ‚Äútop secret files‚Äù, Xinhua reported. While Zhou had taken ‚Äúparticularly huge bribes‚Äù, he had also ‚Äútruthfully confessed, pleaded guilty and repented his wrongdoing when brought to justice‚Äù, the court said. The son of an eel farmer, Zhou was born in Jiangsu province in 1942, seven years before Mao Zedong‚Äôs Communist troops swept to power. He joined the party in 1964 and forged a successful career in the oil industry, eventually becoming the general manager of CNPC, the state-run energy giant. Some knew him as China‚Äôs Dick Cheney. Zhou went on to reach the highest echelons of the Communist party. He was named minister for public security in 2002 and then head of the party‚Äôs political and legislative affairs committee, giving him control over China‚Äôs courts, police and secret police. His position at the helm of the country‚Äôs feared security apparatus meant he was widely loathed by human rights activists but also immensely powerful. In 2007, he became one of nine members of the politburo standing committee, the body that rules China, a position he held until his retirement in 2012. By then, Zhou‚Äôs future appeared to be in jeopardy. He was last seen in public in October 2013, amid frantic speculation that his purge was imminent. Zhou was eventually indicted on corruption charges in April this year, after months under house arrest.
Xi, who became Communist party chief in late 2012 just as Zhou stepped down, has been portrayed as China‚Äôs most powerful and authoritarian leader since Mao. Some experts described the verdict as a victory for a president Chinese spin doctors call ‚ÄúXi Dada‚Äù, which translates as Uncle or Big Daddy Xi. However, Steve Tsang, an expert on Chinese politics from the University of Nottingham, said Beijing‚Äôs decision to try Zhou in secret suggested Xi was not as dominant as some observers suggest. ‚ÄúHe is still powerful, he is still confident ‚Äì but not as much as we were all giving him credit for,‚Äù Tsang said. Communist party leaders appeared to have struck a ‚Äúpolitical deal‚Äù with Zhou, said Wu Qiang, a politics professor from Beijing‚Äôs Tsinghua University. ‚ÄúJudging from the fact that Zhou has decided not to appeal and from his final statements, the trial could be understood as a pre-arranged political deal.‚Äù Striking such an agreement was probably intended to spare the Communist party‚Äôs blushes, said Zhang Lifan, a prominent and outspoken Beijing-based historian. As the former head of China‚Äôs domestic spy network, ‚ÄúZhou might hold the secrets of many VIPs which he could use as his bargain chips,‚Äù said Zhang. Xi has made the fight against corruption a key theme of his presidency, vowing to drive thieving ‚Äútigers‚Äù such as Zhou from the party. In his first public address after taking power, Xi warned that rampant corruption could ultimately bring his government down. ‚ÄúThe whole party must stay on full alert,‚Äù he warned.
Since then dozens of high-ranking party officials have been toppled, including top members of the People‚Äôs Liberation Army, powerful energy executives, the mayors of major cities and even a former spy chief. Liu Han, a Ferrari-loving mining tycoon once worth more than ¬£4bn, was executed in February after he was convicted of leading a double life as an ‚Äúevil gangster‚Äù responsible for gangland shootings and turf wars. The ferocity of Xi‚Äôs offensive has been such that there has been speculation over whether even bigger Communist party figures such as Jiang Zemin, the former president, or Wen Jiabao, the former prime minister, might be in the crosshairs of the anti-corruption campaign. But the decision to topple Zhou was largely a political one, said Tsang, who claimed that Xi saw the former security tsar as an obstacle preventing him from asserting ‚Äúhis supremacy within the party‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know what Xi Jinping wants to do in China yet but we do know that he is ambitious. We do know that he wants to leave a mark,‚Äù said Tsang. The anti-corruption campaign has gone down well with the masses who are weary of widespread official corruption. But it has also taken its toll. Now into its third year, the campaign has been blamed for an apparent spike in the number of officials committing suicide. Upscale restaurants and luxury goods retailers complain business is down as suddenly frugal Communist cadres retreat into the shadows. There are also signs of growing pushback among sectors of China‚Äôs Communist elite. Earlier this week the daughter of Chen Yun, a revered revolutionary hero, gave an indication of the divisions opening up at the top of China‚Äôs Red aristocracy when she publicly threw her support behind the president. Xi is implementing the anti-corruption drive ‚Äúto secure the party rule‚Äù, Chen Weili said, according to Hong Kong‚Äôs South China Morning Post. ‚ÄúThe party rule will end otherwise.‚Äù Additional reporting by Luna Lin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-11T15:31:41Z,world,World news,Cameron‚Äôs mission to renegotiate EU membership suffers setback in Brussels,"David Cameron has suffered a setback in his mission to renegotiate Britain‚Äôs EU membership terms after a series of EU leaders raised objections to his plans at a summit in Brussels. Downing Street said the prime minister expected to face tough questions, adding that the EU renegotiations, which Cameron will launch at the European council later this month, would require patience. In his most difficult day since he embarked on the initial, informal stage of his EU renegotiations after his election win, the prime minister was told by his Finnish and Spanish counterparts that they were wary of his calls for ‚Äúfull-on‚Äù treaty change. Cameron was also told by the Romanian president and by the Belgian prime minister of their strong doubts about his plans to impose a four-year ban on EU migrants claiming in-work benefits. Cameron was told that they would not agree to any measure that discriminated against their citizens in the UK.
Downing Street put a brave face on the meetings, which show the monumental challenge the prime minister faces in renegotiating the terms of Britain‚Äôs EU membership. The objections raised in Brussels by the leaders, each of whom will wield a veto in the formal negotiations, go to the heart of Cameron‚Äôs EU blueprint. His proposal on EU migrants was designed to show he could deliver a measure to discourage immigration from Europe without breaching the EU‚Äôs rules on free movement of people. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, warned Cameron last year that she would not countenance any change to free movement, prompting him to propose a measure that will not stop EU citizens working in the UK. Cameron met the four EU leaders on the margins of a summit in Brussels between EU and leaders from Latin American and the Caribbean. The meetings with the Belgian, Romanian, Spanish and Finnish leaders were all described as friendly as they all said they were keen to help Britain remain in the EU. But Cameron faced strong doubts over the substance of his reform plan. His tricky day started with a working breakfast with Charles Michel, the Belgian prime minister, who insisted that there could be no discrimination against EU workers. Michel said after the meeting: ‚ÄúWe believe in Belgium that the principle of free movement of workers is very important, and that non-discrimination and equal rights for European citizens is a very important thing. And on these issues then we will see in a negotiation if it is possible to find an agreement.‚Äù Klaus Iohannis, the Romanian president, echoed those comments, saying: ‚ÄúNo member state is allowed to treat people coming from elsewhere differently from its own people. But of course we have to find a solution. Nobody wants a discriminatory solution. But we are in a position where we have to find practical, non-discriminatory solutions which make it possible to treat these kind of problems.‚Äù
But Downing Street took heart after Iohannis voiced strong support for the prime minister‚Äôs view that the abuse of benefits by EU citizens needs to be tackled. Cameron wants to ensure that jobless EU citizens are effectively barred from claiming benefits. Iohannis said: ‚ÄúAround 4 million Romanians live and work elsewhere in Europe. Most of them, a large majority, are very well-integrated in the societies, in the countries where they live and work. The problem is some try to go there to benefit from social help without really trying to get a job. This is the major problem. ‚ÄúSo in my opinion we have to try to separate these two. Leave the free movement as it is ‚Äì it‚Äôs valuable we have to preserve it ‚Äì and try to extract the part with the social benefit or social welfare ‚Ä¶ and try to solve that problem because it doesn‚Äôt have to come in a package. If you treat the problems separately in my opinion, we ave way better chance to solve it.‚Äù Spain‚Äôs prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, told Cameron that Madrid was opposed to EU treaty change as he voiced concern that the proposed reforms would undermine free movement, according to Spanish diplomats. But Rajoy struck a friendly note in public. He said Cameron had ‚Äúexplained in a general way because he has said he intends to raise the proposed referendum in the next European council. He asked what we can do to keep the United Kingdom in the European Union. I first expressed my desire, agreeing with him, that the UK remains in the EU. Spain will be constructive when trying to help these plans go forward and the UK continuing in the EU.‚Äù Juha Sipil√§, the Finnish prime minister, told Cameron he was uneasy about starting a carousel of negotiations on revising the EU treaty as he spoke of exploring other legal avenues to achieve British aims. It is understood that Sipil√§ believes changing the treaty will encourage other member states to table their demands. Cameron‚Äôs meetings in Brussels were more difficult than his recent tour of four EU capitals. He encountered unease in Paris and Warsaw but had friendlier receptions in The Hague and Berlin where Merkel suggested that treaty change was possible. His spokeswoman said of the talks in Brussels: ‚ÄúThe PM set out the issues that he wants to address as part of this renegotiation. Clearly there are going to be more discussions needed. But we have expected that. We have said that this process is going to take time. It is going to take patience. ‚ÄúThere will be different views expressed along the way. But what matters is the prime minister is determined to address the concerns of the British people and to work with others to find solutions on them ‚Ä¶ We need the European Union to be flexible, not rigid, and be able to accommodate the different issues of member states.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-11T15:26:36Z,world,World news,Switzerland and Austria investigate claims of electronic spying at Iran talks,"Prosecutors in Switzerland and Austria have launched investigations into allegations that a computer virus was used to spy on the recent high-level Iran nuclear talks. It comes a day after a top Russia-based software security company, Kaspersky, said a spy virus dubbed Dugu 2.0 appeared to have compromised computer networks in at least three Swiss hotels that had been host to senior diplomats from Iran and the six major powers ‚Äì the US, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany ‚Äì of the group known as the P5+1. The office of the Swiss attorney general announced on Thursday that police had last month raided unnamed locations in Geneva, where recent talks took place, and confiscated computer equipment and IT material. The allegations have surfaced at a critical moment in the ongoing nuclear talks ahead of an end of June deadline for a comprehensive agreement. An investigation was launched following those raids, federal Swiss prosecutors said, without mentioning which venues had been targeted. Swiss hotels that have hosted the negotiations in recent months include the Palais Wilson and Intercontinental in Geneva, the Beau Rivage in Lausanne and the Royal Plaza in Montreux. ‚ÄúThe aim of this raid was on one hand to gather evidence and to on the other verify if information systems had been infected by malware,‚Äù the Swiss attorney general‚Äôs office said, according to AFP. Austria, which also hosted the Iranian nuclear negotiations, confirmed on Thursday it was investigating separately as well. Vienna‚Äôs Palais Coburg hotel has been a frequent venue for the ongoing talks. ‚ÄúThe federal office for the protection of the constitution and counter-terrorism is aware of the information and is reviewing it,‚Äù said a Vienna-based government spokesman.
Although it is not clear who has carried out the recent cyberattacks, Dugu is related to Stuxnet, a computer worm believed to have been designed by Israel to sabotage Iran‚Äôs uranium enrichment programme. Stuxnet hit Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities in 2010. Iranian authorities initially played down its impact but eventually admitted the malware had damaged the nuclear programme. Israel, which stands firmly opposed to a comprehensive deal with Iran and the lifting of sanctions as a result, has denied any links to the recent attacks. ‚ÄúThe international reports of Israeli involvement in the matter are baseless,‚Äù said Tzipi Hotovely, Israel‚Äôs deputy foreign minister. ‚ÄúWhat is much more important is that we prevent a bad agreement where at the end of the day we find ourselves with an Iranian nuclear umbrella.‚Äù In March, and in unusual comments for US administration officials, the Wall Street Journal cited senior American officials accusing Israel of spying on the nuclear talks and using the intelligence gathered to persuade sceptics in Congress to undermine the talks. Reza Najafi, Iran‚Äôs ambassador to the Vienna-based UN nuclear agency, the IAEA, said the news about the cyberattack was not surprising to Iran. ‚ÄúYou know that there are enemies of these talks and they will do whatever they can, so it‚Äôs not a surprise to us,‚Äù he said in reaction to the news. ‚ÄúWe continue to take precautionary measures not to let any details of the discussion go to the public.‚Äù Kaspersky said in a statement published on its website on Wednesday that it believed the malware included ‚Äúsome unique and earlier unseen features‚Äù which made its creators feel confident no traces could be left. The carefully planned and sophisticated nature of the attacks led the security firm to believe that a nation state sponsored the campaign. ‚ÄúKaspersky Lab researchers discovered the company wasn‚Äôt the only target of this powerful threat actor. Other victims have been found in western countries, as well as in countries in the Middle East and Asia,‚Äù the statement read. ‚ÄúMost notably, some of the new 2014-2015 infections are linked to the P5+1 events and venues related to the negotiations with Iran about a nuclear deal. The threat actor behind Duqu appears to have launched attacks at the venues where the high-level talks took place.‚Äù Symantec, a rival security company, has confirmed Kaspersky‚Äôs findings. Iran and the west reached a tentative agreement on the framework of a comprehensive deal in April. Under its terms, restrictions will be placed on Iran‚Äôs enrichment of uranium so that it is unable to use the material in nuclear weapons. In return, the US and EU will terminate all nuclear-related economic sanctions against Iran once the UN nuclear agency confirms that Iran has complied. Talks resumed earlier this week in Vienna to resolve the remaining issues concerning the final agreement, which was initially expected to be reached by the end of June. Diplomats have since said that the self-imposed deadline could be extended. ‚ÄúIf our interlocutors commit to the agreed parameters, reaching an agreement by the end of June is achievable,‚Äù said Najafi.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-11T15:06:34Z,world,World news,String of losses in Syria leaves Assad regime increasingly precarious,"The regime of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, is under mounting pressure on several fronts in the war, losing swaths of territory to opposition fighters as well as Islamic State, with strategic resources under its control coming under attack. Assad‚Äôs defeats in Idlib, eastern Homs and Deraa in the south, combined with renewed pressure in Aleppo and Deir el-Zour to the east and the possible loss of gas fields to Isis, have left the regime in a precarious position with little choice but to concentrate its forces in its western strongholds, ceding much of the country to the opposition and Isis. Meanwhile the rebels, buoyed by a series of victories against Assad, face new challenges in governing areas under their control as well as aerial bombardment by the regime and assaults by Isis in an increasingly complex battlefield.
‚ÄúThis is definitely the most strategically weak position the regime has found itself in since early 2013, but it should not be entirely overplayed yet,‚Äù said Charles Lister, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Centre thinktank and author of the book Profiling the Islamic State. ‚ÄúWhat seems to be happening is a redrawing of the power map in Syria, with the regime seemingly more willing to cede territory outside of its most critically valuable zones.‚Äù The Southern Front, a coalition of mainstream, western-backed rebels, seized a major military base, known as Brigade 52, in the province of Deraa this week after a lightning six-hour offensive on the facility which lies near a main road to Damascus and contains large caches of ammunition and materiel. The rebels also claimed to have shot down a regime MiG plane with anti-aircraft guns on Thursday.
The regime‚Äôs collapse in the strategic base in Deraa came after similar rapid disintegrations elsewhere in the country. In the historic city of Palmyra, east of Homs, regime forces fled after a week-long siege by Isis militants, leaving behind thousands of civilians and the city‚Äôs ancient ruins to the mercy of the terror group.
In late May, a coalition of rebel forces known as Jaish al-Fateh, which includes the al-Qaida affiliate in Syria, Jabhat al-Nusra, conquered the last major regime stronghold in Idlib province in the city of Ariha in just four hours, leaving nearly the entire province in rebel hands. In Aleppo, a rebel alliance of primarily Islamist fighters is battling both the regime and Isis, and recently announced a joint operations command intending to take control of the entire city, while moving to cut off regime supply lines in what was once Syria‚Äôs commercial capital. The rebels had once appeared weak, losing 1,500 fighters in an offensive last year that ejected Isis from the city. But now the rebels will have to govern the large swaths of territory seized from Assad, under the threat of relentless, punitive air strikes on areas that the regime has lost. The rebel advances came after well-publicised regime offensives in Aleppo as well as in the south, which involved the Lebanese group Hezbollah, faltered in the face of opposition resistance. In a statement released on Wednesday, Jabhat al-Nusra also called for the creation of a unified rebel army in Ghouta, a suburb of Damascus, to take on Assad‚Äôs loyalist forces. The group‚Äôs leader, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, said in a recent interview that they would soon set their sights on the capital, seeing its fall as a mortal blow to the regime.
Analysts say the rapid defeats may be a sign that the regime is no longer willing to hold territory outside its western strongholds and is focusing instead on retrenching in the west, in a stretch of land that includes its coastal Alawite heartland, Homs, Hama and Damascus, straddling the Qalamoun mountain range on the border with Lebanon, where Hezbollah holds sway. The move is a reflection of the demographic reality at play in a civil war involving a minority-led regime. ‚ÄúEven Aleppo city may prove extraneous to its strategic priorities in the coming weeks and months,‚Äù said Lister. ‚ÄúThe regime has undoubtedly suffered some serious losses recently, but until those strategic areas come genuinely under the threat, we‚Äôre a long way away from saying the regime‚Äôs survival looks existentially threatened.‚Äù Isis also threatens some key strategic resources, particularly gas plants to the west of Palmyra, responsible for about half of the country‚Äôs electricity generation. While the militant group already controls the Arak and al-Hail gas fields near Palmyra, it has launched attacks to the city‚Äôs west on the Shaer gas field, and is inching closer to three other facilities in the area ‚Äì Hayan, Jihar and Ebla. The western fields produce roughly 350m cubic feet of gas a day, or half of its wartime national electricity generation. ‚ÄúThey would be really key to the power supply to Damascus,‚Äù said Robin Mills, an oil and gas expert and non-resident fellow at the Brookings Doha Centre. The loss of the gas plants would likely force Iran, which has been supplying Assad with fuel oil and diesel during the war, to step up its contribution, Mills said. It would also allow Isis to deny access to the power supply to the regime, as the militant group doesn‚Äôt have the expertise and equipment necessary to pump the gas out and use it in areas under its control. In addition, control of strategic areas in eastern Homs opens the road for the organisation to attack the regime‚Äôs western strongholds. ‚ÄúThis is more a case of denying the regime an important resource than of Isis gain,‚Äù said Yezid Sayegh, an expert at the Carnegie Middle East Centre. ‚ÄúMy assumption is that Isis‚Äôs primary goal in targeting these areas is military and strategic: it places Isis in a position to threaten the Damascus area, eastern Ghoutah, eastern Qalamoun, and Soueida province, as well as potentially pressure Homs.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-11T14:16:49Z,world,World news,Cruise ship access to Venice at stake in mayoral election,"When George Clooney married Amal Alamuddin in Venice last year, the only snag in the otherwise glamorous affair was a photobomb by an uninvited guest: the Norwegian Jade, a 94,000-ton cruise liner that momentarily stopped the Hollywood star and his entourage in their tracks. The sight of ships trudging along the fragile canals of Venice has long been a source of anger for environmentalists ‚Äì and celebrities ‚Äì who claim they are not only an eyesore, but an ecological disaster waiting to happen in a historic and vulnerable city. But the years-long debate over cruise ships‚Äô access to Venice ‚Äì one that reached fever pitch following the deadly Costa Concordia shipwreck off the coast of Tuscany in 2012 ‚Äì is now nearing a decisive moment. Last year the Italian government moved to ban megaships from entering Venice or passing Piazza San Marco. But the ban was reversed in January and the transport minister who supported it, Maurizio Lupi, has since resigned in the wake of a corruption scandal.
The resignation last year of Venice‚Äôs mayor, Giorgio Orsoni, in another corruption scandal has meant the debate over cruise ships has been on hold. That is likely to end with the election of a new mayor, to be chosen in a runoff election on Sunday, when the debate will recommence as to which kinds of cruise liner will be allowed to dock in Venice and ‚Äì critically for the industry ‚Äì the route they will be allowed to take to get there. The vote pits a businessman who supports the cruise ships, Luigi Brugnaro, against a centrist Democratic party senator, Felice Casson, who has emphasised the need for prudence. Casson supports at least one alternative route for megaships, which would involve the construction of a new offshore platform. The plan has been deemed unsafe and a ‚Äúlogistical nightmare‚Äù by the leading cruise industry association CLIA, whose members include Carnival, Costa, Norwegian and Royal Caribbean. The platform would be located far outside the Venice lagoon and require the cruise liners to ferry passengers and their luggage to and from Venice. It would take more than two years to build. Another option discussed by both mayoral candidates would involve the construction of a new terminal at the port of Marghera, an industrial area that has long been in decline. A third option, supported by the port authority in Venice but opposed by environmentalists, would require the creation of a new channel, Contorta Sant‚ÄôAngelo, so that ships could enter Venice without passing Piazza San Marco.
One thing is clear: whatever the outcome, billions of euros are at stake. The cruise industry has not explicitly said which option it prefers, except that it is dead set against the creation of the offshore platforms. Francesco Galietti, CLIA‚Äôs top official in Italy, said there were two possible future scenarios for Venice: either it benefits from the creation of a new Silk Road, with millions of Chinese and other tourists visiting the city in coming years as massive cruise ships cater to increasing demand in Asia; or the city becomes an afterthought of sorts, with ever expanding cruise ships essentially ignoring Venice ‚Äì and perhaps the whole of the Adriatic ‚Äì if the logistics become too cumbersome. ‚ÄúIf Venice loses the status of home port, you have a huge problem, and this is one of the big issues at stake,‚Äù said Galietti. The designation of home port means that is where cruises initiate their voyage, as opposed to being a port of call, where cruise ships simply stop for a short period. ‚ÄúIf there is no [feasible] alternative route provided to the cruise industry ‚Ä¶ this is a danger for the whole Adriatic region. When you talk to the cruise planners, they will tell you very bluntly: what is even the point of going into the Adriatic without Venice as a home port?‚Äù The cruise industry plays down the role environmentalists have played in blocking big ships from entering Venice. Galietti said environmentalists and the so-called radical chics ‚Äì ‚Äúcounts and bluebloods and VIPs like George Clooney who own property‚Äù ‚Äì had an emotional attachment to Venice that sometimes missed the point. The industry says it has voluntarily agreed to avoid the route megaships have used before, even though they still deem it to be safe. Brugnaro, who says he is neither ‚Äúleft or right‚Äù in his political leanings and does not formally represent any party, sees the debate as part of a large issue in what he deems to be a ‚Äúculture of no‚Äù that can dominate important decisions in Italy. ‚ÄúThe culture of no has stopped the economy in [the region of] Veneto. No to this and no to that and no to TAV [a high-speed rail line] ‚Äì with the ‚Äòno, no, no‚Äô we have stopped our economy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI became a candidate to find solutions, to create a situation where the environment, the protection of Venice, but also the jobs of Venetians, can coexist. Otherwise you will kill the city.‚Äù He said the development of the port of Marghera, which CLIA‚Äôs Galietti said was ‚Äútoxic‚Äù ‚Äì had been hampered for years by strict environmental rules. ‚ÄúWe have to be more pragmatic, more operational, and there has to be less chatter in Italy.‚Äù While Brugnaro says his rival for the job of mayor has not firmly backed any solution to the stalemate, Casson in turn says Brugnaro‚Äôs proposal ‚Äì which would involve the dredging of the Vittorio Emanuele canal ‚Äì is not formally among the options being examined. ‚ÄúI think that cruise activity is very important for Venice and needs to be protected ‚Äì that way we protect jobs, too,‚Äù Casson said. ‚ÄúBut we also need to preserve the lagoon, which is a very fragile and delicate environment. So to dig a big new canal in the lagoon would mean destroying the lagoon and the foundations of Venice. ‚ÄúWhen [Brugnaro] talks about digging the Vittorio Emanuele canal, he means dumping the most dangerous muds into the lagoon, because this is part of the industrial zone of Marghera, developed in the 1950s and 1960s, when the worst poisons were around,‚Äù Casson added. The decision on the way forward is likely to rest with the next mayor of Venice. Experts say new projects will still require a green light from the government in Rome, but that officials there are waiting for the local authorities to take a decision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-11T14:14:03Z,world,World news,'The spirits don't like what they did' ‚Äì Malaysians voice anger at naked prank,"Residents in the Malaysian city where a group of tourists are being held after posing naked on the country‚Äôs highest mountain have spoken of their anger at the stunt. Four western tourists, including a 23-year-old Briton, Eleanor Hawkins, appeared on Wednesday handcuffed and dressed in purple prison uniforms in a court in Kota Kinabalu, the capital of Sabah state. They were part of a group of 10 trekkers who were last month photographed stripping on Mount Kinabalu. Malaysian officials later linked the stunt on the sacred mountain to an earthquake six days later which killed 18 people.
The four tourists were remanded in custody in the city, which lies about 55 miles (90km) south-east of Mount Kinabalu, while investigations are carried out. Fendi Adam, a teenager, is a member of the Dusun tribe, which believes spirits live in the mountain and that the naked tourists caused the earthquake. ‚ÄúThe spirits don‚Äôt like what they did. They should be kept in jail for a long time,‚Äù he told the Guardian. Others accept that the tourists‚Äô behaviour was unconnected to the earthquake. But they see it as a display of disrespect on one of their most revered sites. Locals tell stories of mountain guides who died in the earthquake while trying to save tourists. ‚ÄúSome village people think that the earthquake was caused by the tourists, but they are superstitious,‚Äù said Anna, who works at a tour agency that takes visitors to the national park where the mountain is located. ‚ÄúMost people are angry. Their beliefs are strong,‚Äù she said. At a police station in Kota Kinabalu, a guard said the authorities were also trying to track down the group‚Äôs tour agency to ask why the foreigners were not prevented from stripping.
None is eligible for bail. All are being investigated by a civil prosecutor for public indecency, which carries a sentence of up to three months in jail with the possibility of a fine. But indigenous elders, including the Dusun, are also considering whether to try them in a native court, as they are accused of breaching customary law. It is not clear what type of punishment they would receive in a native court, which can order community work and fines for offences. Sabah‚Äôs chief tribal priest, Tindarama Aman Sirom Simbuna, told Malaysia‚Äôs Star newspaper that the tourists should be fined 10 head of buffalo in line with local customs.
It quoted him saying: ‚ÄúAccording to local beliefs, the spirit of the mountain is very angry,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis fine, called sogit in the native tongue, should be in the form of 10 male or female buffalo.‚Äù Catherine Allerton, an anthropologist from the London School of Economics who specialises in the region, explained the status of Mount Kinabalu. ‚ÄúThe people who live nearby the mountain, the Dusun people, really see the mountain peaks as the resting place for the souls of the dead,‚Äù she told BBC Radio 4‚Äôs World at One programme. ‚ÄúAnd even people who don‚Äôt share those beliefs see it as a very sacred and special place. It is the real symbol of Sabah within the Malaysia nation.‚Äù Allerton, who has climbed the mountain, added: ‚ÄúEven before the earthquake there was a lot of anger about what the tourists had done and the sort of insensitivity that they had shown by stripping naked on his very special place. ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs offence has been heightened by the fact that four of the people who died in the earthquake were very local Dusun guides who take people up the mountain, and are really revered in Sabah for the wonderful job that they do.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-11T13:56:13Z,world,World news,A question of trust? Anderson report lays out tests for surveillance laws,"The key official report on the future of Britain‚Äôs surveillance laws clears the way for the introduction of the ‚Äúsnooper‚Äôs charter‚Äù ‚Äì the unwarranted bulk collection of personal communications data that tracks everyone‚Äôs use of their phones, the web and social media. It is true, David Anderson‚Äôs report insists the security agencies need to make out a ‚Äúdetailed operational case‚Äù before any further extension of their mass surveillance data powers to the collection of everyone‚Äôs personal web browsing history, for example. But the home secretary, Theresa May, will be encouraged by his key finding that the power to require internet and phone companies to retain everyone‚Äôs communications data ‚Äì bulk data collection ‚Äì should continue to exist. Anderson, the official reviewer of the terror laws, reaches this conclusion even though, as he rightly points out, such data ‚Äúcan be quite revealing of personal habits and characteristics‚Äù. May will be more than satisfied with this. Anderson makes clear that he is not keen on the ‚Äúsnooper‚Äôs charter‚Äù. He demands that the security agencies also make a ‚Äúrigorous assessment‚Äù of the intrusiveness, effectiveness, cost and legality of extended snooping powers before they can go ahead.
Privacy campaign groups regard this as a high hurdle to clear, but the Home Office, which has revised its proposals since 2012, appears confident it will meet these tests when the proposals are published this autumn. Anderson makes clear the crucial issue of securing the cooperation of US technology companies, such as Google and Facebook, on handing over their customers‚Äô communications data to British police and security services in what is known as ‚Äúretention of third party data‚Äù is unresolved. He recommends the compulsory retention of this data ‚Äì ordering UK internet companies to seize it as it passes through their servers ‚Äì should only happen when a compelling case is made. He says ‚Äúthe decisive voice here will be that of Sir Nigel Sheinwald, the former British ambassador to the US, who is the PM‚Äôs special envoy‚Äù on this matter. As the Guardian has revealed, Sheinwald has secretly recommended that a new international treaty needs to be negotiated to secure cooperation. Some parts of Anderson‚Äôs report are refreshing. He warns against scaremongering over the nature of the terrorist threat, pointing out that it is not unprecedented. He even quotes evidence from the uncle of murdered drummer Lee Rigby to remind us that mass casualty events are a feature of every age and that the Black Death killed a third of the British population, in an attempt to keep a sense of proportion.
His is also the second major report ‚Äì parliament‚Äôs intelligence and security committee made the same point ‚Äì to state clearly that the current framework of surveillance laws ‚Äì ‚Äúincomprehensible to all but a tiny band of initiates‚Äù ‚Äì needs to be swept away. Like the ISC, he says that ‚Äúeach intrusive power must be shown to be necessary, clearly spelled out in law, limited in accordance with international human rights standards and subject to demanding safeguards‚Äù. The security services may well be willing to spell out their general powers, as they have done recently with computer hacking and snooping on lawyers, but they won‚Äôt detail their Prism or Tempora programmes on the face of any bill. On the very vexed question of encryption of the net ‚Äì which David Cameron has vowed to ban in 2016 ‚Äì Anderson says that companies should hand over the keys only after properly authorised requests but says that a master key held by the state or ideas for all data to be held locally in a unencrypted form are non-starters. His main proposal to require the judicial rather than ministerial authorisation of individual, targeted intercept warrants will be welcomed by many.
But while the home secretary held her tongue in her immediate response to this key proposal, the official position is likely to end up reflecting the view of Sir David Omand, the ex-head of GCHQ, who said on Thursday it would be ‚Äúunconscionable for a judge to authorise a very sensitive intelligence operation where the political risk, if it went wrong, fell on the home secretary, or overseas the foreign secretary, who would know nothing about it and wouldn‚Äôt have approved it‚Äù. Some of Anderson‚Äôs other proposals appeared to muddy the waters a little between the bulk collection of communications data with or without a judicial warrant. He proposes a new judicial warrant for communications data to be obtained in bulk, for example, for specific operations or missions such as preventing attack planning by Islamic State. However, in paragraph 14.74 Anderson makes clear that this additional power by warrant ‚Äúis not intended to replace the existing Ripa powers for law enforcement agencies to obtain large volumes of data directly from communication service providers for cell-site analysis when it is necessary and proportionate to do so, for example when searching for or tracking the movements of a suspect.‚Äù This pretty much covers what is already going on. He also recommends a new judicial authorisation for ‚Äúnovel and contentious requests‚Äù for communications data, such as privileged emails involving lawyers or journalists, but as he makes clear, this is not intended to be a routine event or apply to the mass collection of communications data. Anderson‚Äôs report is significant because he has clearly laid down the tests the government will have to pass when it drafts legislation this summer to build the next stage of the surveillance state. Perhaps that is why he called it A Question of Trust.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-11T12:58:57Z,world,World news,"UK intelligence agencies should keep mass surveillance powers, report says","UK intelligence agencies should be allowed to retain controversial intrusive powers to gather bulk communications data but ministers should be stripped of their powers to authorise surveillance warrants, according to a major report on British data law. The 373-page report published on Thursday ‚Äì A Question of Trust, by David Anderson QC ‚Äì calls for government to adopt ‚Äúa clean-slate‚Äù approach in legislating later this year on surveillance and interception by GCHQ and other intelligence agencies. However, Downing Street hinted that David Cameron was unlikely to accept one of his key recommendations: shifting the power to agree to warrants from home and foreign secretaries to a proposed new judicial commissioner. The prime minister‚Äôs spokeswoman said the authorities needed to be able ‚Äúto respond quickly and effectively to threats of national security or serious crime‚Äù, which appears to suggest ministers are better positioned to do this than judges.
Anderson‚Äôs report, commissioned by Cameron last year, comes in response to revelations two years ago by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden about the scale of government surveillance. Anderson, introducing his report, said: ‚ÄúModern communications networks can be used by the unscrupulous for purposes ranging from cyber-attack, terrorism and espionage to fraud, kidnap and child sexual exploitation. A successful response to these threats depends on entrusting public bodies with the powers they need to identify and follow suspects in a borderless online world. ‚ÄúBut trust requires verification. Each intrusive power must be shown to be necessary, clearly spelled out in law, limited in accordance with human rights standards and subject to demanding and visible safeguards.‚Äù
GCHQ and other intelligence agencies are likely to be satisfied with the recommendations. GCHQ successfully fought to retain its bulk collection powers and Anderson agreed. In contrast with the UK, the US Congress last month placed curbs on bulk collection of phone records by the intelligence agencies. Privacy campaigners also largely welcomed Anderson‚Äôs recommendation to scrap existing surveillance legislation ‚Äì the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa), the proposed new judicial commissioner and other proposals. Anderson said that the existing legislation had reached the end of its useful life. ‚ÄúRipa, obscure since its inception, has been patched up so many times as to make it incomprehensible to all but a tiny band of initiates. A multitude of alternative powers, some of them without statutory safeguards, confuse the picture further. This state of affairs is undemocratic, unnecessary and ‚Äì in the long run ‚Äì intolerable.‚Äù The new judicial body, the Independent Surveillance and Intelligence Commission, would be responsible for all surveillance warrants, according to the report. There would be some new curbs on warrants, including ‚Äúa tighter definition of the purposes for which it is sought, defined by operations or mission purposes‚Äù.
Anderson also proposed safeguards against snooping on journalists, lawyers and other groups. The report says that when communication data is sought from people handling privileged or confidential information, including doctors, lawyers, journalists, MPs or ministers, ‚Äúspecial consideration and arrangements should be in place‚Äù. As well as approving individual warrants, the judicial commissioner would also be responsible for a new bulk data collection warrant in limited circumstances. Anderson gives an example of bulk data collection under the heading of ‚Äúattack planning by ISIL [Islamic State] in Iraq/Syria against the UK‚Äù. Anderson also makes clear that this would not affect existing programmes of communications data surveillance. But the removal of the power to approve warrants from ministers may never fly. Ministers will argue that democratically elected politicians are better placed to make these decisions rather than judges who do not have access to up-to-date information on terrorist threats. The home secretary, Theresa May, speaking in the Commons after the report was published, said she would publish a draft surveillance bill in the autumn and legislate before the end of 2016. She promised there would be a proper overhaul of investigatory powers legislation and not ‚Äúsimply rebranding existing law‚Äù.
She described the threats facing the UK as considerable. ‚ÄúIn the face of such threats, we have a duty to ensure that the agencies whose job it is to keep us safe have the powers they need to do the job,‚Äù she said. May was immediately questioned by David Davis, one of the leading Conservatives on civil liberties issues, who praised the report and the prospect of judicial control over warrants, saying that, with the exception of Zimbabwe, the UK has the world‚Äôs worst record in allowing politicians to authorise surveillance. May said the government would consider the idea of transferring responsibility to judges. ‚ÄúI am not in a position to say whether the government will do one thing or another,‚Äù she said.
The intelligence agencies, including GCHQ, have been expressing concern about the increasing use of encryption to protect privacy, with internet providers beginning to offer this as standard. Anderson, in his report, does not propose legislating on the issue. He said few propose a master key to all communications be held by the state. ‚ÄúFar preferable, on any view, is a law-based system in which encryption keys are handed over [by service providers or by the users themselves] only after properly authorised requests.‚Äù Anderson said he could not condone Snowden‚Äôs disclosure. National security had suffered, he added, but there had also been benefits from the disclosure of some of the intelligence agency capabilities. ‚ÄúThe opening up of the debate has, however, come at a cost to national security: the effect of the Snowden documents on the behaviour of some service providers and terrorists alike has, for the authorities, accentuated the problem of reduced coverage and rendered more acute the need for a remedy,‚Äù the report says. Jo Glanville, director of English PEN, welcomed the report. ‚ÄúWhile we would have liked to see the recommendations go even further in relation to GCHQ‚Äôs bulk collection of data, we welcome the recommendations for judicial authorisation and the call for a rigorous assessment before any further powers are given to the intelligence services in a revived snooper‚Äôs charter.‚Äù Eric King, the deputy director of Privacy International, said: ‚ÄúThis is the final nail in the coffin for Ripa ‚Ä¶ David Anderson‚Äôs strong recommendations for improvement are the first step towards reform, and now the burden is on the government, parliament and civil society to ensure that reforms go further and ensure that once and for all, our police and intelligence agencies are brought under the rule of law.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-11T12:42:46Z,world,World news,Zakes Mda: I feel like a dancing monkey at European literary festivals,"A leading South African author has said he boycotts literary festivals in Europe because he is made to feel like ‚Äúa dancing monkey‚Äù in front of white audiences. Zakes Mda, an award-winning novelist and playwright, was lending support to fellow black author Thando Mgqolozana, who said he believed that audiences come to watch him perform at books festivals such as the one in wealthy Franschhoek near Cape Town. ‚ÄúI share his experience to a very large extent,‚Äù Mda told South Africa‚Äôs City Press newspaper. ‚ÄúIt is the same thing that one gets in Europe when you attend these literary festivals ‚Äì which I no longer do, by the way, not for a few years now. Oh no, no. If you see me in Europe, it‚Äôs not at a literary festival. It‚Äôs at the launch of my own book or my own book tour.‚Äù Mda, a creative writing professor at Ohio University in the US, backed Mgqolozana‚Äôs claim that black writers are treated as anthropological subjects. ‚ÄúYou feel like you‚Äôre a dancing monkey ‚Ä¶ You are some figure that is being scrutinised and studied. Some amazing animal. ‚ÄòOh look, they can write too.‚Äô And even the questions they ask you are very patronising ‚Ä¶ A place like Franschhoek replicates that kind of situation and I can understand how he felt.‚Äù Mgqolozana‚Äôs stand has a triggered a debate that puts South Africa‚Äôs own white-dominated literary establishment under unprecedented scrutiny. More than 21 years after the end of racial apartheid, there is frustration among black writers who cannot get published or whose works are not available in their own communities. They point to the expense of books and a continued lack of diversity in bookshops, publishing houses, awards committees, and among event organisers and audiences. Some have called for a boycott of literary festivals. The faultlines were exposed this week during a panel discussion at Wits University in Johannesburg. Corina van der Spoel, an Afrikaner who organises literary festivals, prompted anger and accusations of racism from the audience by questioning whether black parents provide books to their children. ‚ÄúEverything is not all right, as Thando [Mgqolozana] says: the society is still in the making,‚Äù said Van der Spoel, whose independent bookshop went out of business. ‚ÄúBut I also think Thando‚Äôs decision to opt out of South African literary festivals and his lashing out at the so-called white literary system is racialising the debate and polarising people in ways that they never were before. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pernicious kind of racism. It‚Äôs a blame culture which shifts responsibility and shouting that detracts from the real issues in South Africa, namely that our education system is failing both black and white learners. It also detracts from questions such as: ‚ÄòAre black parents buying books for their children?‚Äô‚Äù One audience member responded sharply: ‚ÄúHere we all sit thinking, ‚ÄòThat was so racist,‚Äô right? I think part of the reason why [Van der Spoel] has to do what she‚Äôs doing is kind of propping up the establishment she defends, because it needs to be an establishment that protects white hegemonic culture, so that she can continue to purport that black people aren‚Äôt readers and therefore not good producers of literature.‚Äù She added: ‚ÄúEverything that we hear from that lady is indicative of what is in the colonial subconscience of this country, which is blacks don‚Äôt read, black parents don‚Äôt do a good job of making readers out of their children, and if you kick out white people then literature is not literature.‚Äù Mngqolozana, also taking part in the panel discussion, declined to trade insults with Van der Spoel. ‚ÄúWe need an alternative to the existing literary system,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I believe the system will be changed by readers, and in South Africa that‚Äôs black readers and black book buyers. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a distinction between black people who buy books and those who read them. Black households have the phenomenon of the travelling book. A book will be read until it has lost all its pages. Which is why it is nonsensical to say black people don‚Äôt read.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúI feel horrible that for the last seven years or so I have been begging to be integrated into this system in a more comfortable way. What the fuck was that about? I‚Äôm horrified!‚Äù Fellow author Siphiwo Mahala told the audience: ‚ÄúMy rejection of the white literary system does not mean I will embrace black mediocrity. ‚ÄúFranschhoek is the embodiment of all that is white. It is a private initiative. They created that festival for themselves. And after they created it, they thought, ‚ÄòHa, so we will also need maybe some black monkeys to come and entertain us.‚Äô And then they extend invites to us. So it was on those grounds that I declined the invite in 2011. But the circus will not stop because of the absence of one monkey.‚Äù American-born Ben Williams, books editor at South Africa‚Äôs Sunday Times newspaper, noted that the country‚Äôs book sales are dominated by international fiction, Afrikaans fiction, local cookbooks, sports biographies and Christian titles. Among the bestselling 88 books in the country, he said, only one is by a black writer ‚Äì in 87th place. And as far as he was aware, there is only one formal trade publisher with a black editor. But Williams added: ‚ÄúIn 1976 the worm turned on apartheid. In 2015 I feel like the worm may have started to turn on the white literary system.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-11T11:31:33Z,world,World news,"UK leads Europe for wealthy female earners, survey finds","The UK leads the rest of Europe in terms of women being the main earner among affluent households, according to a survey. The Ipsos Affluent Survey Europe, now in its 20th year, reveals that Britain, which once lagged other European countries in terms of the number of women qualifying as the main income-earner in well-off families, is now in pole position. In 2006, the figure in the UK was 33.6%, compared with 36% in continental Europe. Since then, the percentage has increased across Europe, but the UK is in the lead: 44.1% v 41.2%. The survey covers the top 13% of income earners in Europe. However, the gender gap in pay persists. The survey shows that mean income for women still lags behind that of men. In the past 10 years the gap has remained fairly constant at 30%. Affluent Europe measures the habits of Europe‚Äôs richest consumers and tracks what they do for business and pleasure, what they buy and why, as well as their media consumption. The survey shows that affluent Britons take more trips abroad than their counterparts in France, Germany, Italy or Spain. Last year, 31.9% of well-off Britons took three or more flights for pleasure. Spain came a distant second with 22.6%. Golf is more popular with rich Brits (21.5% say they are interested in the sport) than their fellow Europeans, while Germans are appear to be the most avid restaurant goers: 78% ate out more than once last year, compared with 41% for Britons. When it comes to fancy goods, Britain‚Äôs highest earners are particularly fond of luxury handbags, jewellery, Rolex and Breitling watches. Italians also like Rolex and Breitling as well as having a yen for designer clothes. Russians have a particular passion for designer shoes and Germans love Mercedes. In other findings, the survey found a closer correlations between affluence and higher education over the years. In 2014, more than half of Europe‚Äôs well-off have at least one degree and almost 80% have English either as a first or second language. Unsurprisingly, as baby boomers move towards retirement age, the average affluent person is now older and less inclined to work long hours. More surprising, however, is that contrary to widespread perception, time spent reading offline media (newspapers and magazines) has not declined. In terms of media consumption, Britain‚Äôs affluent spend more time online and watching TV than their continental counterparts. Turks are the heaviest consumers of all media, spending 150 minutes consuming media in an average day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-11T11:09:26Z,world,World news,Why is Vladimir Putin always late?,"Patience may be a virtue, but few people would keep the pope waiting. Vladimir Putin is an exception, however, with the Russian president showing up an hour late to his meeting in the Vatican on Wednesday. Putin‚Äôs tardiness is legendary, with journalists working in the Kremlin pool detailing regular waits of several hours as meetings rarely start on time. His lateness varies from leader to leader, and in Putin‚Äôs terms, an hour‚Äôs wait is a sign of respect. He was 50 minutes late for his first meeting with Pope Francis in 2013. Ukraine‚Äôs ousted president Viktor Yanukovych, however, was once kept waiting for four hours, while European leaders regularly report a wait of an hour or more. The lateness goes back to the early days of Putin‚Äôs presidency. He was 14 minutes late for the Queen in 2003, and a year earlier kept parents of children killed in a plane crash waiting at a cemetery for two hours. In 2012, Putin was three hours late for a meeting with John Kerry in Moscow, leaving the US secretary of state to take a walk in Red Square and twiddle his thumbs before the green light came from the Kremlin. There are no known cases of leaders simply giving up rather than sticking it out.
Given that Putin manages to make it on time to televised press conferences and set-piece events, the general assumption is that his tardiness when meeting with Russian and international politicians is a calibrated psychological policy. But being late is something Putin has done for a long time. His former wife Lyudmila Putina once recounted how his lateness to their first dates reduced her to tears. ‚ÄúI was never late, but Vladimir Vladimirovich always was. An hour and a half was normal. I remember standing around in the metro. The first 15 minutes of lateness are OK, half an hour also fine. But when an hour goes by and he‚Äôs still not there, you start crying.‚Äù In a possible sign that even Putin felt awkward at keeping the pontiff waiting, the Kremlin took the unusual step of explaining Wednesday‚Äôs delay. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true that the meeting with the pope happened a little after the planned time,‚Äù Putin‚Äôs spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian journalists. ‚ÄúThis was because talks in Milan went on longer than expected and our motorcade was quite slow moving through the streets of Milan and Rome. Of course, during the whole time we kept in touch with the Vatican and explained our lateness.‚Äù Peskov said Francis and Putin had a ‚Äúdeep‚Äù discussion for about an hour, touching on Ukraine and international affairs, as well as ‚Äúuniversal human values which unite the Catholic and Orthodox worlds‚Äù. The Vatican said the discussion had mainly focussed on Ukraine and the pope‚Äôs calls for peace in the country. Putin was also given an ‚Äúangel of peace‚Äù medallion. Putin‚Äôs spokesman had strong words for Kenneth Hackett, the US ambassador to the Holy See, who had said in the runup to the meeting that he hoped the pope ‚Äúcould say more about concerns on territorial integrity‚Äù in Ukraine. ‚ÄúTo think you have the right to lecture the pope, this is quite something,‚Äù said Peskov. ‚ÄúIn seriousness, it‚Äôs an outrageous attempt to quash the sovereignty of another state.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-11T10:53:13Z,world,World news,French PM Manuel Valls retreats in row over football trip,"The French prime minister, Manuel Valls, has expressed regret and said he will pay back part of the cost after taking a government jet to travel to Berlin to watch his favourite football team, Barcelona, play in the Champions League final. The Barcelona-born Socialist was criticised by political opponents and some within his own ranks after it emerged that he had slipped away from his party conference this weekend to watch the match with two of his sons. After five days of pressure, Valls addressed the issue on a visit to the Indian Ocean island of La R√©union. He said the Berlin trip, estimated to have cost around ‚Ç¨15,000 (¬£11,000), was an official visit in the runup to France hosting the Euro 2016 tournament. ‚ÄúSince this was an official trip, I used the means available to a prime minister. But I am of course sensitive to the reaction of the French people and I have to behave in a completely rigorous way. If the chance came up again, I wouldn‚Äôt do it again,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd to remove any doubt, I have decided to pay the costs for my two children, amounting to ‚Ç¨2,500.‚Äù He said flying his children with him on the official plane had led to no additional costs. The scandal has been extremely damaging for Valls and is likely to dent his popularity ratings, which had been high. One poll found that 77% of French people were shocked by his use of the jet. The row was worsened by three days of muddled explanations for the trip. Valls, who is normally considered one of the most astute communicators in the Socialist party, at first said it was an official trip, then added fuel to the fire by talking about his passion for football and insisting he was entitled to moments of relaxation given his hectic workload. It didn‚Äôt help when he attended the men‚Äôs final of the French Open tennis tournament the next day. On the weekend of the Champions League final, Valls had been in Poitiers for the Socialist party congress, tasked with smoothing over cracks in the party and winning back MPs from the left who have opposed his economic policy. This delicate exercise had gone better than expected, with the prime minister winning applause for a rousing speech. But within 24 hours, the fractured party had returned to sniping. The trip is being seen as Valls‚Äôs first serious political gaffe since he became prime minister last year. It was all the more damaging because the Socialist president, Fran√ßois Hollande, had promised that his term in office would be ‚Äúirreproachable‚Äù in contrast to that of Nicolas Sarkozy. Valls himself has always taken a tough line against abuse of power by France‚Äôs political elite. Despite Hollande‚Äôs promise of a squeaky clean republic, other ministers have been caught out. J√©r√¥me Cahuzac, Hollande‚Äôs trusted tax tsar and budget minister, who vigorously led a crusade against tax-dodging millionaires, confessed to hiding ‚Ç¨600,000 (¬£510,000) from the taxman in a secret foreign account for 20 years and lying about it. Then the French trade minister, Thomas Th√©venoud, caused astonishment when he blamed his failure to pay rent or taxes on ‚Äúadministration phobia‚Äù.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-11T10:21:47Z,world,World news,Mount Kinabalu 'naked prank':  UK reviews advice for travellers to Malaysia,"The UK government is reviewing its advice for tourists travelling to Malaysia in light of the arrest of a British woman for posing naked on a mountain, as her family issued a fresh statement on her behalf to apologise for the stunt. Eleanor Hawkins, a 23-year-old former head girl from Derby, who recently graduated with a master‚Äôs degree in aeronautical engineering from Southampton University, was one of 10 trekkers who were photographed stripping on Mount Kinabalu, south-east Asia‚Äôs highest peak, last month. Malaysian officials later linked the stunt on the sacred mountain to a deadly earthquake. Her family issued a statement on Thursday saying she knew what she did was ‚Äústupid and disrespectful‚Äù and that she was very sorry for the offence caused. The UK Foreign Office confirmed it was reviewing its advice to avoid a repeat of the incident. Hawkins is being held in a police cell after being remanded in court on Wednesday with three others ‚Äì Canadian siblings Danielle and Lindsey Petersen, and a Dutch man, Dylan Snel. Police in Malaysia are continuing to hunt for the other six in the photograph, but it is understood that most if not all of the group have since left the country. A third Canadian has reportedly been charged in connection with the nudist stunt. It has been speculated that self-styled ‚Äúperpetual backpacker‚Äù Emil Kaminski, 33, led the group of tourists up the mountain. The New Straits Times reports he is facing charges of indecent exposure and insulting the local culture and people through social media postings. The travel blogger posted a video in which he criticised officials for linking the stunt and the earthquake. ‚ÄúTo say something that fucking stupid you really need to have lobotomised yourself on a piece of heavy machinery,‚Äù Kaminski said. ‚ÄúJesus Christ people, it‚Äôs just a fucking mountain,‚Äù he said, before reading out some of the insults he had received in response to an earlier post about the affair. It is unclear whether Kaminski was actually involved in the stunt, or is seeking to profit from its notoriety. The New Straits Times had said he was arrested on Wednesday, but its report has since been amended to make clear that he is not in custody.
The British woman‚Äôs father, Tim Hawkins, said: ‚ÄúShe knows what she did was stupid and disrespectful and is very sorry for the offence that she has caused the Malaysian people.‚Äù His statement added: ‚ÄúShe has never been in any sort of trouble before.‚Äù Officials in Sabah state, in the northern half of the island of Borneo, accused the tourists of showing ‚Äúdisrespect to the sacred mountain‚Äù. It has been reported that Sabah‚Äôs indigenous Kadazan Dusun people believed the tourists‚Äô behaviour angered the spirit of the mountain and was the reason for a magnitude 5.9 earthquake which six days later struck near the mountain, killing 18 climbers. The family statement repeats a plea for clemency that Tim Hawkins made to the Malaysian authorities in an interview with the Guardian on Wednesday. It said: ‚ÄúWe hope that the Malaysian authorities deal with the misdemeanour and not link it to the unfortunate tragic events that occurred the following week.‚Äù It added that Eleanor had been travelling in south-east Asia since January as part of a gap year. She went to Malaysia at the start of May and later that month travelled to Borneo, it said.
The Foreign Office, which is providing consular assistance to Hawkins, said: ‚ÄúThe travel advice team are going to discuss with the Malaysian desk how best they think the travel advice should be updated in light of this incident. They are going to review it ‚Ä¶ they may include [reference to] it as a warning so that it doesn‚Äôt happen again.‚Äù The current travel advice to Malaysia makes no mention of the incident. But it urges tourists to ‚Äúrespect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they don‚Äôt offend‚Äù. It adds: ‚ÄúYou should also dress modestly, particularly in conservative and rural areas and when visiting places of worship.‚Äù Hawkins was a head girl at a private school in Derbyshire, it emerged on Thursday. Headmaster Tom Brooksby confirmed that Hawkins was head girl, that she attended the school from 1995 and 2010, and that the school would be making a statement later.
In a statement Brooksby said the school had an ethos of tolerance and understanding. He said: ‚ÄúOne of the key things we teach our students is that making mistakes is an unavoidable part of their lifelong learning ‚Ä¶ It appears that Eleanor has made an error of judgment in this case and her actions have angered many people as well as attracting press coverage.‚Äù He said the school hoped the incident ‚Äúis dealt with swiftly, fairly and proportionately‚Äù. Hawkins‚Äô cellmate Danielle Petersen, 22, and her brother Lindsey, 23, are from Wood Mountain, Saskatchewan, Canada. The Toronto Star said their father, Floyd Petersen, only learned of their predicament when it contacted him on Saturday. He confirmed they were travelling together in Malaysia and said they rarely phoned home.
Masidi Manjun, Sabah‚Äôs state tourism minister, said Malaysians ‚Äúespecially those in Sabah were very upset‚Äù at some tabloid reports which suggested the tourists were arrested for angering the mountain gods and for causing the earthquake. ‚ÄúThey were remanded for four days for further investigation for alleged offence or offences under the penal code. Definitely they were not arrested for causing a ‚Äòdeadly earthquake‚Äô. In fact the idea of linking the strippers with the earthquake comes from various FB/Twitter postings by Emil Kaminski, who is one of the alleged ‚Äòstrippers‚Äô. It is reliably learnt that he left Sabah immediately after his mountain stunt. ‚ÄúWe never said the naked stunt caused the earthquake. Sabahans were boiling hot for their total disrespect of Mt Kinabalu, considered sacred by Sabah‚Äôs largest indigenous tribe (Kadazan Dusun who make up over 30% of the state‚Äôs 3.2 million population) even before the earthquake happened. The earthquake multiplies their anger 1,000 times.‚Äù On Thursday, the park ranger who reported Hawkins and her fellow travellers to police called them arrogant and selfish. Daikin Anam said they need to ‚Äúpay the price‚Äù for their actions. ‚ÄúI feel offended as a Dusun,‚Äù Daikin was quoted as saying by the Telegraph. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about the naked body I saw, but the action they did. That‚Äôs our holy mountain. What they did showed disrespect to our mountain, and our people in Sabah.‚Äù Anam‚Äôs complaint, seen by the Telegraph, was filed to police on 2 June. It said: ‚ÄúAround 7am, while the group were on their way back from the summit, they started to strip off their clothes ‚Äì ignoring their guide. ‚ÄúThe guide warned them not to do so, but they replied: ‚ÄòStupid man, go to hell.‚Äô He could not stop them. They even took a group photo and a selfie. Then they dressed and returned to the backpacker lodge.‚Äù Sabah‚Äôs chief tribal priest, Tindarama Aman Sirom Simbuna, told Malaysia‚Äôs Star newspaper that the tourists should be fined 10 head of buffalo in line with local customs. It quoted him saying: ‚ÄúAccording to local beliefs, the spirit of the mountain is very angry,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis fine, called sogit in the native tongue, should be in the form of 10 male or female buffaloes.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-11T10:01:35Z,world,World news,Pacific islanders try to stop US military's plans for a simulated war zone,"If the Pentagon gets its way, a pair of idyllic Pacific islands have just two years before their tranquillity is pierced by the roar of US B-52 bombers, fighter jets and artillery fire. Faced with the destruction of their homeland, residents are to take their appeal directly to Barack Obama in an attempt to block US military plans to turn Tinian and Pagan ‚Äì US territories that form part of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands ‚Äì into a simulated theatre of war.
Campaigners say the arrival of thousands of navy seamen and marines on the tiny islands would obliterate rare coral ecosystems and wildlife, and force some residents to relocate. Juanita Mendiola, a local resident, said the US military would do ‚Äúirreparable damage‚Äù to the islands‚Äô people and environment. ‚ÄúThese little islands cannot be the only alternative,‚Äù she told the Guardian. ‚ÄúThere is no justification in taking small islands with very little resources ‚Ä¶ and destroying them for military purposes.‚Äù The islands, located north of the US Pacific territories of Guam and Saipan, are home to pristine black sand beaches and rare animal species that experts say would not survive the arrival of troops and their hardware. A change.org campaign has so far attracted more than 109,000 signatures; the petition will be presented to the US president once it reaches 150,000. Resistance to a US military ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù among residents ‚Äì who are American citizens ‚Äì has intensified since the US navy proposed using all of Pagan, which is largely uninhabited, and two-thirds of Tinian for live-fire exercises at least 16 weeks a year. The marines are among about 8,000 US troops who will be moved from the southern Japanese island of Okinawa and sent to Guam and other US Pacific territories under a controversial relocation agreement between Tokyo and Washington.
Some of Tinian‚Äôs 3,000 residents own homes on land already leased to the US military and fear the arrival of troops could force them to leave or squeeze into the 10 sq miles of the island that will be left for civilian use. The whole of Pagan, a 10-mile-long island that has been uninhabited since a volcanic eruption in 1981, would be turned into a simulated war zone to enable troops to prepare for possible confrontations sparked by increasingly assertive Chinese claims on islands in the East and South China Seas. The US defence department seized on Pagan as a potential site after public opposition forced local officials to abandon plans to turn it into a dumping ground for debris created by the March 2011 tsunami in north-east Japan.
Last month, the Pentagon released a 1,300-page draft environmental impact assessment in which it said it ‚Äúwould seek to acquire a real estate interest for the entire island of Pagan‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe US is rebalancing military forces in the Asia-Pacific region,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúIn support of this, the US military is proposing to increase joint military training capabilities by developing live-fire ranges and training areas on the islands of Tinian and Pagan.‚Äù The mayor of Pagan and other neighbouring islands, Jerome Aldan, said residents of the islands were ‚Äú100%‚Äù opposed to the live drills. Aldan said that 50 families evacuated from Pagan after a volcanic eruption still hoped to return. Although the island had no permanent residents, people returned temporarily to fish and farm. ‚ÄúOur history goes back as far as the 1300s, and the military keeps coming out and stating in every press conference or document that the island is uninhabited, but that‚Äôs not really true,‚Äù Aldan added. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of people who consider Pagan island their homeland.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are mere guardians of a legacy left behind by our ancestors and we are entrusted to keep these islands safe for future generations,‚Äù he added. Under the plan, hundreds of marines would simulate battles on Pagan‚Äôs beaches and in its forests, possibly alongside allies such as Australia and Japan, as part of Obama‚Äôs mission to pivot US forces towards the Asia-Pacific. ‚ÄúThis is a perfect training opportunity for us,‚Äù Craig Whelden, executive director of Marine Corps forces in the Pacific, told the Los Angeles Times. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also a beautiful island with some endangered species. We would protect it like it was our own.
‚ÄúThe economy is going to benefit. There‚Äôs going to be hundreds of millions of dollars in construction contracts, and to the extent we can use local contractors, use local food, it will maximise the benefits.‚Äù Pagan, which housed a Japanese air force unit during the second world war, is home to rare indigenous wildlife ‚Äì including fruit bats and tree snails ‚Äì that would be at risk of extinction from the live-fire exercises, said Mike Hadfield, a professor emeritus of biology at the University of Hawaii who conducted fieldwork on the island. Despite military occupation by the Japanese and the 1981 eruption of Mount Pagan ‚Äì which forced the permanent evacuation of 300 indigenous Chamorro people to Saipan 200 miles away ‚Äì Hadfield and his team found a ‚Äúbiological treasure trove‚Äù. ‚ÄúI came away knowing that I had been to a beautiful place with biological richness,‚Äù he told the Guardian. ‚ÄúAnyone who believes the US marines and navy when they say they‚Äôll leave the place better than they found it must be slightly crazy.‚Äù The Republican governor of the Northern Marianas, Eloy Inos, has yet to decide if he will back the Pentagon or residents. Locals say he is weighing up protests from indigenous groups and environmentalists against lucrative construction contracts that could boost the island chain‚Äôs flagging economy. ‚ÄúPressure is being applied in Washington but the key is to get the ear of President Obama,‚Äù Hadfield said. ‚ÄúThe people of the Mariana Islands don‚Äôt want this. It is far from a done deal.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-11T09:33:00Z,world,World news,Briton who spent months fighting Isis wanted to 'shine a light' on the conflict,"A former currency trader who has returned to the UK after spending five months in northern Syria fighting against Islamic State has explained that he decided to join Kurdish forces to ‚Äúshine a light‚Äù on the conflict. Harry said he gave up his job in the City to join the Kurds after being ‚Äúshocked to the core‚Äù while watching the rise of Isis and thought the west was not doing enough to counter it. ‚ÄúI wanted to shine a light and to show the Kurds aren‚Äôt alone,‚Äù Harry told BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Today programme. ‚ÄúI was ready to die and kill. I knew what I was getting myself into. I spent five months there, I saw a great deal of fighting and took part in two large operations. Islamic State shot at me, I shot at them.‚Äù Harry, 28, a public school-educated former Tory councillor who went out before Christmas to join the YPG, or Kurdish People‚Äôs Protection unit, gave details of the death of Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, the first Briton to die while fighting Isis. A former Royal Marine, Scurfield died in March in al-Hol, in Hasaka province, near Syria‚Äôs border with Iraq. Harry said Scurfield died from shrapnel after his armoured personnel carrier (APC) was hit a by a rocket-propelled grenade.
‚ÄúI knew him well, he was a wonderful, wonderful person,‚Äù said Harry. ‚ÄúHe was incredibly brave and died for British values ‚Ä¶ he was attacking IS positions going back and forth, firing RPGs at Isis, spurring people on. An RPG hit the side of his vehicle and he was hit by shrapnel. When the APC came back, he was already dead. He was well loved by Kurds and foreign fighters.‚Äù Harry, who had no military experience and speaks no Arabic, said he received small arms training along with other foreign fighters, which included former Foreign Legion soldiers and former US Rangers special forces. The British-based Syrian Observatory, which monitors events in Syria, has said the estimated 100 foreigners in YPG come from the UK, France, Spain, Austria, Australia, Denmark, America and Canada. Of the 100, a handful are British and about 10 are from the US.
The YPG has not released official numbers on foreign soldiers, but they are dwarfed by the estimated 16,000 fighters from about 90 countries who have joined Isis since 2012, according to the US state department. Foreign Policy magazine has reported that Isis is having no trouble recruiting fighters to replace those killed by US air strikes ‚Äì estimated at 13,000 in the period from September to October. The Home Office has warned that taking part in the conflict in Syria and Iraq could amount to an offence, even for those fighting against the jihadis. Asked what he would tell police should he be arrested, Harry said he would say he went to help people and that IS was a brutal organisation. In another interview with the BBC on Wednesday night, Harry ‚Äì who uses the nom de guerre Macer Gifford ‚Äì said: ‚ÄúWhatever information they need, I‚Äôll give it to them. But more than that, I‚Äôll tell them why I came, what kind of person I am. And then I‚Äôll go along with the practicalities and say to them: ‚ÄòDo you think I am a threat to the British people? Do you think that I‚Äôm a terrorist? If you think that it is in the public‚Äôs interest to prosecute me, then do your worst.‚Äô The people we were up against in the Islamic State, well, they are barbaric. People will understand why I went out.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-11T08:20:04Z,world,World news,Yeb Sa√É¬±o: climate change is the biggest problem we face as a human family,"The Filipino environmentalist Yeb Sa√±o is just one of many of the world‚Äôs 1.2bn Catholics who, on 18 June, will read Pope Francis‚Äôs encyclical on the environment which is likely to call for strong action on climate change. Sa√±o is in Sydney as a spiritual ambassador for OurVoices, a faith-based climate activist group that aims to ‚Äú[bring] faith to the climate talks‚Äù. He predicts the pope‚Äôs letter will be ‚Äústrong on stewardship, on economic justice, and the moral responsibility for all of us to be a part of caring for creation‚Äù. In 2012, Sa√±o shot to worldwide fame when a video of his emotional plea to the UN climate talks went viral. At the time he was leader of the Philippines‚Äô delegation, with the country still reeling from the devastating impact of typhoon Haiyan. Sa√±o broke down in tears halfway through his address. He will walk with other members of Sydney‚Äôs faith communities across the harbour bridge on Friday, as part of the people‚Äôs pilgrimage, a worldwide, multi-faith climate campaign. He says religion helps bring a weighty moral dimension to ‚Äúthe biggest problem we face as a human family‚Äù, one that has ‚Äúbeen missing‚Äù for more than two decades.
Jacqui Remond, director of Catholic Earthcare Australia, the ecological agency for the Catholic church in Australia, will walk beside Sa√±o. She says the Catholic faith sees creation as ‚Äúa gift from God‚Äù and inspires church leaders to speak out strongly about climate change. The pope‚Äôs last encyclical, released in 2013, was 88 pages long. What the letters lack in frequency, they more than make up for in importance, written when the pope feels he has something vital to say about church doctrine. The topic of this encyclical was determined in 2014, after the pope‚Äôs March visit to Tacloban, a Philippine city devastated by Haiyan. A week before its release, the pope has already faced a backlash for his decision, with conservative US thinktanks and evangelical Christian leaders criticising him for getting involved in what they view as a ‚Äúpolitical issue‚Äù. A spokesman for the conservative Cornwall alliance for the stewardship of creation, Calvin Beisner, said the pope should ‚Äúback off‚Äù in a December interview with the Guardian.
‚ÄúThe Catholic church is correct on the ethical principles but has been misled on the science. It follows that the policies the Vatican is promoting are incorrect. Our position reflects the views of millions of evangelical Christians in the US,‚Äù he said. Closer to the pope‚Äôs inner circle is Cardinal George Pell, former archbishop of Sydney and a climate change sceptic. In 2011 he addressed a powerful group of climate sceptics and argued the jury was still out on man-made climate change. But for many Christians, such as Remond, science and religion are not incompatible world views. ‚ÄúGeorge Pell holds an opinion that is not congruent with the science,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs his opinion and he‚Äôs entitled to it. But it‚Äôs not what the majority of bishops [think].‚Äù And if the pope‚Äôs upcoming edict feels progressive, it still follows a bishops‚Äô position paper released by the Catholic church in Australia 10 years ago, titled Climate Change: Our Responsibility to Sustain God‚Äôs Earth. Remond says strong faith is built on intellectual, emotional and psychological rigour, and that to ‚Äúseek God in our world, lives and in all things ‚Äì that is a journey of great discovery, great risk, great struggle, and times of great doubt are part of that journey. ‚ÄúTo come through with strong faith means that it has been seriously probed and robustly questioned.‚Äù Faith communities bring a different dimension to the climate change discussion, she says. They ‚Äúspeak from different wisdom sources and unify this message of caring for the Earth. And that‚Äôs something for all of us [to] recognise and hold in whatever way.‚Äù When the pope calls to defend ‚Äúthe poor of the planet‚Äù, this extends beyond humankind to include all species and resources of Earth, Remond says. ‚ÄúThe core message will remind us of our responsibility to respect natural balances, cycles and rhythms. We live an embodied sense of doing God‚Äôs work on Earth, aligning ourselves with that deep, spiritual way of being.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-11T07:32:44Z,world,World news,Four 'left-behind' children in China die of poisoning after being abandoned,"Police in China are investigating the death of four impoverished siblings who reportedly drank pesticide after being abandoned by their parents, a tragedy exposing the hardships facing millions of so-called ‚Äúleft-behind‚Äù children. The children ‚Äì one boy and three girls aged between five and 13 ‚Äì were found on Tuesday night in Bijie, a city in the south-western province of Guizhou, according to Xinhua, China‚Äôs official news agency. Both parents were migrant workers who had abandoned one of the country‚Äôs poorest regions to seek employment, it reported. The children had dropped out of school one month ago and had virtually no food ‚Äúbecause they are too poor‚Äù, Zhang Shigui, a relative, was quoted as saying. The children‚Äôs father had left a contact number but it had not been possible to reach him, Zhang added. Police said they were investigating the precise causes of the children‚Äôs deaths but Xinhua suggested they had deliberately poisoned themselves. The tragedy is not the first of its kind to hit Bijie, a notoriously deprived city that is 1,120 miles (1,802km) south-west of Beijing and has around 8.5 million residents. On the night of November 15, 2012 ‚Äì the same day Xi Jinping became leader of China‚Äôs Communist party ‚Äì another group of left-behind children took shelter from the cold in a rubbish bin. The next morning, an elderly lady found the bodies of those five boys ‚Äì aged 13, 12, 11 and nine. They had died of carbon monoxide poisoning after lighting a fire inside the bin to keep warm. ‚ÄúThese children wandered the streets for three weeks, but no helping hand was extended,‚Äù Caixin, a current affairs magazine, argued at the time, warning: ‚ÄúThe tragedy in Bijie is bound to happen again.‚Äù The latest deaths have again highlighted the plight of the estimated 60 million children who are left behind ‚Äì often without proper supervision ‚Äì when their parents leave their rural villages to find jobs in China‚Äôs booming cities. ‚ÄúThe kids in both cases were left-behind children who had dropped out of school and had been left at home,‚Äù said Li Yuanlong, a local journalist who was detained in 2012 after reporting on the five children‚Äôs deaths. ‚ÄúI think there must be problems at every level of society for this tragedy to have repeated itself. Had the parents, the school and village folk ‚Ä¶ paid more attention to them and cared more about them, such deaths could have been prevented,‚Äù he added.
Experts say nearly 50% of China‚Äôs left-behind children suffer from depression and anxiety, compared with 30% of children in cities. Li Yuanlong said Bijie officials had promised to take action to protect the city‚Äôs youth. ‚Äú[But] all those measures publicised by the local authorities after the 2012 case ‚Äì the help lines and the others policies ‚Äì stopped working long ago,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very heartbreaking ‚Äì but it‚Äôs not completely unforeseeable.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere must be something wrong with our child protection system, otherwise this wouldn‚Äôt have happened again,‚Äù said Chen Fucai, an expert on child welfare from the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. ‚ÄúUnless we have a proper child protection system, similar tragedies will repeat themselves whether it be in Bijie, in Shanghai or in Guangzhou.‚Äù Additional reporting by Luna Lin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-11T06:13:04Z,world,World news,Israel's strategic position 'enhanced by chaos of Arab neighbourhood',"Israeli generals, ministers and ex-Mossad chiefs were milling around at this week‚Äôs Herzliya conference talking national security at a time of unprecedented turmoil across the Middle East. Binyamin Netanyahu, now prime minister for the fourth time, deployed his signature phase about living in a ‚Äútough neighbourhood.‚Äù But a cursory glance around the Arab world left even the hyperbole-prone Netanyahu, on that point at least, sounding like a master of understatement. Israel‚Äôs strategic position has never been so good, argued one senior official ‚Äì thanks to the diversions and divisions of the wars in Syria and Iraq, the jihadis of the Islamic State, collapse in Libya and conflict in Yemen. It has benefited too from the Egyptian military‚Äôs crushing of the Muslim Brotherhood and the squeeze on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Jordan has come though the Arab spring unreformed and maintains discreet but intimate security links with the Jewish state. Opposition by the Gulf states to the impending Iranian nuclear deal has added to this sense of comfort. Last week a senior Israeli and a senior Saudi even shared a platform in Washington to articulate their anxieties about the Islamic Republic. Israel has been hawkish ‚Äì Netanyahu attracting ridicule for the cartoon bomb he displayed at the UN; Arab critics have been more discreet. But both condemn Iranian backing for Hezbollah in Lebanon, Houthi rebels in Yemen and Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza. Both are alarmed by Iran‚Äôs role in Iraq and are seeking compensation from Washington for Barack Obama‚Äôs tilt to Tehran. Israel never believed it would benefit from democratic change in the Arab world. In the age of rampaging sectarianism in the region, it stands with the Sunni autocracies. In military terms, Israel looks unassailable. Moshe Yaalon, the defence minister, said that Syria no longer posed a conventional threat ‚Äì its chemical weapons arsenal neutralised after the 2013 attacks near Damascus. Hezbollah‚Äôs arsenal remains a danger ‚Äì but the assessment is that it is too committed to Bashar al-Assad to risk another full-scale war with Israel. Still, a wargame at Herzliya featured Hezbollah launching a rocket salvo and Israel inflict massive destruction on Lebanon, and suffer hundreds of casualties at home in just a few days. Ministers and officials ranged far and wide across the region but mentioned the conflict in Israel‚Äôs backyard almost as an afterthought. Yaalon was pleased that the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank has its own parliament ‚Äúso they don‚Äôt vote for the Knesset‚Äù and praised its cooperation on security. But he did not expect a peace agreement ‚Äúin his lifetime.‚Äù (He is 65 and looks in robust health.) Netanyahu won a brief ripple of applause for declaring that he supported a two-state solution (after saying he did not on the eve of the March election). But he then went on to list all the reasons there is not going to be one. Ehud Barak, the former Labour prime minister, warned of being on a ‚Äúslippery slope‚Äù towards a one-state solution. That means occupation past the half-century anniversary of the 1967 war. Herzliya is Israel‚Äôs annual strategic talkfest. In 2004 Ariel Sharon used it to announce unilateral ‚Äúdisengagement‚Äù from the Gaza Strip and a few small West Bank outposts, holding out the prospect of future withdrawals. Sharon‚Äôs illness, continuing settlement activity and Palestinian divisions blocked any progress since. Now, a year after Operation Protective Edge left 2,200 dead in Gaza. (Israelis have got into the habit of calling it ‚ÄúHamastan‚Äù) - the same catastrophic scenario could easily be replayed. Netanyahu called on Mahmud Abbas to resume peace talks and complained that the Palestinian president had asked only for a freeze on settlements ‚Äì as if that was deeply unreasonable rather than the issue at the very heart of his concerns. Abbas is vilified for trying to use international law and institutions to pressure Israel as an alternative to being locked into an endless ‚Äúpeace process‚Äù that never delivers and erodes his increasingly threadbare credibility. Ron Prosor, Israel‚Äôs UN ambassador, accused the Palestinians of ‚Äúdiplomatic terrorism‚Äù - a novel concept even for a seasoned practitioner of hasbara (Hebrew for PR/propaganda). If Netanyahu is prepared to make nice, however unconvincingly, his Likud colleagues are not: Tzipi Hotobely, his deputy as foreign minister, ruled out any concessions in ‚ÄúJudea and Samaria‚Äù and painted the landmark 1993 Oslo agreement between Israel and the PLO as an historic error. Increased Jewish immigration, she suggested, was the best way to deal with those pesky Palestinians. But the issue that really grabs Israelis across the political spectrum is the international movement for boycott, disinvestment and sanctions (BDS), now gathering momentum in Europe and the US. That was discussed in a Herzliya session entitled ‚ÄúIsrael: Scapegoat or Culprit?‚Äù Demonisation and de-legitimisation were described as a strategic threat greater than Hezbollah missiles or Syrian tanks. Netanyahu‚Äôs line is that Israel is under attack ‚Äúbecause of who we are‚Äù by a coalition of anti-semites, jihadis, leftists and the credulous who are applying the lessons of the campaign against apartheid in South Africa. Cooler conference heads suggested it is largely about ‚Äúwhat we do‚Äù - especially maintaining the occupation and continuing Jewish settlement while blaming the Palestinians for not negotiating. Netanyahu‚Äôs improbable romance with the Saudis has led to talk of Israel finally responding to the 2002 Arab peace initiative. That offers the glittering prize of recognition by all Arab states in return for a just peace with the Palestinians. Yet the combination of regional mayhem and the most right-wing government in Israel‚Äôs history suggest it is not going to happen any time soon. Unlike the prime minister and his team, Labour Party and other centrist politicians queued up in Herzliya to urge a return to the idea of two states for two peoples ‚Äì and not just to ‚Äúmanage‚Äù the deadly but unequal conflict between them. Heading off international pressure on Israel, observed Shlomo Avineri, a wise thinker and former foreign ministry official, needs far more than more effective hasbara.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-11T06:00:04Z,world,World news,Charities fear Ebola resurgence after spike in cases,"A rise in Ebola cases on the border of Sierra Leone and Guinea has sparked fears that efforts to rid the countries of the deadly virus are ‚Äúback to square one‚Äù. The spike in infections comes weeks after the World Health Organisation reported a 10-month low, with just nine cases in both countries in the week ending 10 May. But, since then, the WHO has said: ‚ÄúBoth the intensity and the geographical area of Ebola virus disease transmission have increased.‚Äù In its latest situation report, it said 31 confirmed cases of the virus had been reported in the week ending 7 June -16 cases in Guinea and 15 in Sierra Leone. ‚ÄúThis is the second consecutive weekly increase in case incidence, and the highest weekly total number of cases reported from Sierra Leone since late March,‚Äù it said.
International Medical Corps says the new hot spots on the coastal border region are demoralising for all, particularly as Liberia, on the opposite border, was declared Ebola free on 9 May. ‚ÄúIt feels like we are back to square one. The world has moved on, but it is still a very real problem here. With Liberia Ebola free, we thought we were not far behind, but that isn‚Äôt the case,‚Äù said a spokesman. ‚ÄúGuinea is a problem and as long as Guinea has Ebola, Sierra Leone will continue to struggle. The border is meaningless, with families straddling both countries,‚Äù he added. The Red Cross in Guinea said there were 16 new cases in the past week in six prefectures, four of them on the border with Sierra Leone. In Sierra Leone, there have been cases in Kambia, the coastal district bordering Guinea, Port Loko, a district to the south, and Freetown. A spokesman for the charity said in the last two months the virus had moved from the country‚Äôs forested areas to lower Guinea for the first time, with communities expressing the fear and denial seen during the 18-month battle against Ebola elsewhere in the region. There have also been several reported incidents of violence directed at field staff during the last week, the WHO has said. A summit between the two countries‚Äô presidents last Friday identified surveillance of border trade and traffic as one of their biggest challenges. Some of the new cases have only been diagnosed after postmortem testing, making contact tracing of relatives and friends who have been in touch with the victim challenging. Alarmingly, one of the cases was a stillborn child, born to a woman who had survived Ebola and was carrying antibodies. ‚ÄúDeaths in the community, postmortem diagnosis and new cases without links to old ones all indicate there are undetected chains of transmission present in the country,‚Äù said International SOS. ‚ÄúThere are 56 entry points between the two countries, this makes the surveillance work very difficult,‚Äù said a Red Cross spokesman. The spike has also been blamed on not just porous borders but a return to traditional burials, which had been banned after they were identified as one of the key factors in the spread of Ebola earlier in this epidemic. The disease has killed 11,147 people since the first reported case in March 2014, with more than 27,000 people infected.
On Monday, the G7 nations said they would work together to combat future epidemics with promises of disease detectives on standby. But medical charities have said this is not enough. Florian Westphal, general director of M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res Germany, said the leaders had done little to ensure epidemics would not spiral out of control in future. ‚ÄúNo concrete measures have been decided to strengthen emergency response, meaning the world is no better prepared to face major health crises and save thousands of lives,‚Äù he said. Oxfam was also disappointed, saying fighting pandemics like Ebola required ‚Äúmore than simply putting the emergency services on standby‚Äù. Meanwhile, an Italian nurse who contracted Ebola while working in Sierra Leone with medical charity Emergency has been cured and has left hospital, Italy‚Äôs health ministry said on Wednesday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-11T04:00:00Z,world,World news,Intimate spaces: coming out in Iran,"I never thought I‚Äôd find a boyfriend in Iran. After all, homosexuality is technically illegal here. Consensual sex between two adult males is punishable by death. Tafkhiz - defined as the rubbing together of thighs or buttocks - is punishable by 100 lashes. If two men not related by blood are found ‚Äúunder one cover without necessity‚Äù they can be given 99 lashes (for some reason the same offence with two women is 100 lashes). Curiously, ‚Äúlustful‚Äù kissing between two men is punishable by only 60 lashes. Despite this draconian statutory prohibition, homosexuality is an open secret. My friends tell me that since President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad - who infamously denied the existence of gay people in Iran - left office, there has been a thaw in official policy towards LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) people. More and more, I see gay and lesbian couples being openly affectionate on the streets. Transgender individuals live and work openly in Tehran, the government will even pay for sex reassignment surgery for those who want it. Gay hook-up apps like Grindr, Scruff, and Hornet are easy to access and increasing in popularity. The government even offers an exemption from compulsory military service for men who have sex with men. They classify it as a mental illness, but at least this is an acknowledgement.
In recent years small pockets of gay public life have established themselves around the city. Most nights a well known park near the City Theatre and the university of Tehran becomes a vibrant cruising ground for gay men. They come to trawl the park, to look, to show off, exchanging furtive glances in the dark, occasionally meeting for a few minutes in the public facilities or heading to some third location for more comprehensive interaction. Gay couples recline in remote corners, arms around each other, stealing kisses. Sometimes I don‚Äôt even see them until I‚Äôm alerted by their giggles. If you sit on a bench and have a certain look, eventually someone will sit next you and offer a knowing ‚Äúkhaste nabashi‚Äù - a common greeting - that depending on your mood and the moonlight can lead anywhere. Down Revolution Street, men lean against the shuttered store front of the Institute For The Compilation and Publication of the Works of Imam Khomeini making eyes at passing motorists. Sometimes a car stops, a conversation ensues through a rolled-down window, someone gets in, and off they will go to perform acts punishable by violent flogging. Police do patrol the park, going about in packs of three and four, but they seem to show little interest in disrupting proceedings. ‚ÄúThe police can‚Äôt do anything,‚Äù said one man I met in the park. He was wearing women‚Äôs shoes, heavy make-up, with a jewelled barrette in his hair and a small black leather purse in the crook of his elbow. ‚ÄúYou need three people over the age of eighteen to go to court and swear on the Qur‚Äôan that they actually saw you having sex.‚Äù As he spoke he had his arm around his male friend‚Äôs waist. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the police I‚Äôm worried about,‚Äù said another. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the reaction of the people that‚Äôs unpredictable, they‚Äôre so homophobic.‚Äù
It‚Äôs not the police or the mullahs who are the biggest obstacles to having a successful homosexual relationship in Iran. It‚Äôs the utter lack of opportunities for any kind of intimate contact with your significant other. This is a combination of two factors: the first is that most unmarried Iranian men seem to live with their families, the second is that public spaces are no-go zones for anything above hand-holding. Every relationship I‚Äôve pursued has run into this problem. There was M, a 26-year-old branding and advertising consultant who lived with his parents and sister. We used to meet at the movie theatre and make out in the back row, but it was usually too crowded to attempt anything more serious. There was P, a 30-year-old waiter who lived with his grandmother. We would get a hotel room sometimes, but he always insisted on going in separately and besides it got to be way too expensive. And then there was A, my boyfriend. I met him at a party at a villa in Lahejan, near the Caspian Sea. We were both pretty sloshed on arak cocktails. He was wearing a ‚Äò93 Bulls Michael Jordan T-shirt and green camouflage pants. His hair was dyed red and he had a scar across the whole right side of his head, which I later found out was from a piece of shrapnel when a motorcycle engine exploded. From the moment I saw him, I knew in the marrow of my spine. There was just no question about it. The infinite possibilities of the universe collapsed in that moment into a singular inescapable fact: we were going to have sex. I wasn‚Äôt sure when or where exactly, but I knew it would happen. I was so certain that I didn‚Äôt even feel the need to pursue it. This was a done deal. We made heavy eyes at each other the across the room. He came over and we had a forgettable conversation laden with pregnant pauses, lingering eye contact, and lots of incidental touching. When we were finally able to get into a room by ourselves, we didn‚Äôt even need to say anything, we just started making out. That lasted about a minute. Then we heard the doorknob turning and A ripped himself away from me and pretended to be looking at a pile of papers on the desk as one of our friends walked in. I was left standing not sure what gear to be in. I didn‚Äôt know it then but that initial encounter was emblematic of our relationship. When we walk in public, he refuses to let me hold his hand or even walk too close to him. Kissing or other public displays of affection are off limits. Occasionally when we spend a long weekend in one of our friends‚Äô houses in Oshun or Lavasan, we manage to abscond to a bedroom with a locked door and yet he is still preoccupied by the notion that ‚Äúsomeone might see us‚Äù. I can‚Äôt count how many time I‚Äôve been forced to bail mid-make out and pretend to be sleeping because he has heard footsteps down the hall. Sometimes he‚Äôll do ridiculous things like sit at the opposite end of a long dinner table just for appearances. When he does that, I wink at him from across the table just to watch him get flustered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bit paranoid, I don‚Äôt know why, I know it‚Äôs not a big deal,‚Äù he tells me. ‚ÄúBut I just can‚Äôt help it.‚Äù A has never even considered telling his father, a working-class house painter and devout Muslim, about his sexual orientation. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the same here, people don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù Even among our friends - who take absolutely no issue with homosexuality and who have expressed their support - he bristles when I try to be affectionate. When we walk through the Gay park he takes a step away from me. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt touch here,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThis is the gay part of town, everyone will know.‚Äù Despite these issues, I‚Äôve decided to pursue the relationship, and in every other respect it‚Äôs been great. When I met A, being just a stupid khareji (foreigner) I‚Äôd mostly been exposed to overpriced caf√©s in Tajrish and the posh high rises of Niavaran. A has shown me another side of Tehran. He took me to the south, to the old parts, to Gomrok, Berynak and Doolab. He showed me around his neighbourhood of Darveseh Dolat, down narrow winding alleys, past buildings that haven‚Äôt changed in a generation. We went to the local Sufi khanegah (‚Äòinstitute‚Äô), tucked away in dark side street, to see their ecstatic religious dancing. He showed me how to light candles in the sagh-e khane, little alcoves built into walls around the city that are usually covered by metal bars and may feature an image of an Imam or famous martyr. I rode around Haft-e Tir and Enghelab on the back of his motor scooter. He took me to the avant-garde studios of young artists where we smoked hash and engaged in meandering discussions of Bruce Nauman and abstract expressionism.
We have talked about all the trips we plan on taking, to Mashhad, and Esfahan, and Bandar Abbas, about how we are going to buy a motorcycle and ride it to India together. None of which we have actually done. But still it is magical. Everything is great, but we have kept running into one big problem: intimacy. The whole first month we were dating, we spent most days together but we managed to have sex only once. No matter how well things are going in our relationship, there‚Äôs always an 800lb gorilla in the room. We say we love each other regularly, we call each other azizam (my darling) - when no one is listening of course - and all I want to do is grab him and kiss him when we greet each other but we have to pretend we‚Äôre just friends because he has a debilitating fear of stigma, because he‚Äôs grown up in a society that systematically delegitimises our sexual orientation. The constant code switching is dizzying. One minute we‚Äôre in the shower together, the next minute we‚Äôre sitting on opposite ends of an empty couch. I grew up in Los Angeles, and have been living in New York, so there‚Äôs simply no way for me to empathise with the years of destructive internalisation that he must have experienced growing up gay in the Islamic republic. I try to sympathise, but at times it‚Äôs just too frustrating. ‚ÄúThings are definitely getting better,‚Äù said Sina, a gay 32-year-old Tehrani, ‚Äúbut we never touch and kiss in public.‚Äù I‚Äôve met a lot of nice gay men in my time in Tehran. I‚Äôve loved at least one of them. And yet I have not been able to find one who has ever introduced a boyfriend to his parents. It‚Äôs striking how universal it is. Men in their 30s who are successful, well-adjusted, and live alone: they still would never consider telling their parents about their sexual orientation. This is the strange grey area that gay men in Iran find themselves in. The government appears to be loosening its grip, it‚Äôs becoming easier for LGBT people to move in Iranian society without fear of arrest and prosecution, but a deeply engrained shame lingers, stunting the development of a truly ‚Äòout‚Äô LGBT culture. ‚ÄúWe all want to be more open in public,‚Äù A said to me once, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs just not the proper place or the proper time.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-10T23:57:52Z,world,World news,Immigration department defied advice not to transfer babies back to Nauru,"A baby was sent to the Australian-run detention centre on Nauru in defiance of advice given to the immigration department, Guardian Australia has learned. Last week the immigration department began its first transfer of an infant born into detention in Australia ‚Äì a five-month-old girl known as baby Asha ‚Äì to Nauru, despite widespread concerns about the adequacy of conditions at the centre. But high-level department sources have told Guardian Australia that several weeks ago Save the Children, which is contracted to provide welfare services on the island, conducted a detailed risk assessment for the planned transfer of up to 10 babies to area 9 of regional processing centre 3 at the Nauru detention centre.
The risk assessment outlined that the transfer of babies back to that part of the centre would be potentially catastrophic and recommended the transfer not occur. Incident reports have previously detailed the presence of rats and mice in area 9, and recent pictures of the area obtained by Guardian Australia show the compound remains in poor conditions. But the immigration department disputed the assessment and requested that it be changed, Guardian Australia was told. Instead it opted to rely on a Transfield risk assessment that outlines a slightly lower level of risk. Following this, the first baby was sent to Nauru last week with more transfers imminent. The infant child has now developed gastroenteritis, while both parents are being monitored heavily due to concerns about their wellbeing. Asylum seeker mothers are generally transferred from Nauru to the Australian mainland to give birth.
Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said she has written to the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, asking him to act immediately to remove the baby from Nauru. ‚ÄúIt is horrific that baby Asha, born in Australia, is now in detention in Nauru. The trauma being experienced by this family is cruel and the government should bring them back to Australia immediately,‚Äù Hanson-Young said. ‚ÄúThe parents of baby Asha are so desperate that they are considering suicide so she can be brought back to Australia. This is the human tragedy of Australia‚Äôs asylum seeker detention policies. ‚ÄúThis family were awaiting specialised trauma counselling and medical treatments when they were forcibly removed to Nauru last Thursday and their situation is now even more tenuous.‚Äù Prior to the transfer, the mother and father of the infant were restrained using cable ties on their hands, and the atmosphere in the Melbourne detention centre remains highly charged after their removal. The removal of the infant and her parents last week caused serious distress to other asylum seekers at the centre, a staff member said. The group of infants facing removal back to Nauru with their families were all born in Australia after 4 December 2014. This date represents a cutoff point as part of a ‚Äúone-off deal‚Äù made by then immigration minister Scott Morrison with crossbench senator Ricky Muir to pass the federal government‚Äôs temporary protection visa legislation. As part of the deal, a group of 31 babies born into detention before this date, along with their families, were eligible to apply for protection visas in Australia. Those born after this date faced being sent offshore. The immigration department has not responded to requests for comment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-10T23:01:06Z,world,World news,Dresses on washing lines pay tribute to Kosovo survivors of sexual violence,"A conceptual artist is transforming a football pitch in Kosovo into a giant art installation, with thousands of dresses hung on washing lines in a powerful and poignant tribute to survivors of sexual violence. The exhibition, Thinking of You, will go on show in the city stadium of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, on Friday, the 16th anniversary of Nato forces entering the city after a three-month bombing campaign. Estimates vary, but some sources have calculated that 20,000 Albanian women ‚Äì and some men ‚Äì were victims of sexual violence during the 1998-99 Kosovo war as Albanian separatists fought against the Yugoslav regime led by Serb strongman Slobodan Milosevic. Alketa Xhafa-Mripa, a Kosovo-born artist and British national, said the idea for her installation came as she listened to interviews given by survivors of sexual violence who said their voices were rarely heard. Anna Di Lellio, a Kosovo expert, worked with Xhafa-Mripa on the concept and helped implement it.
‚ÄúI started questioning the silence, how we could not hear their voices during and after the war and thought about how to portray the women in contemporary art,‚Äù said Xhafa-Mripa, who came to London in 1998 to study art and has lived here ever since with her husband and three children. Xhafa-Mripa, 35, chose the dress or skirt to symbolise fragility and purity, and by hanging out 5,000 dresses on washing lines, she has given a new spin to a familiar expression. ‚Äú‚ÄòAir dirty laundry in public‚Äô is a way of saying ‚ÄòTalk about your private issues in public‚Äô, but in this case the laundry is washed, clean, like the women survivors who are clean, pure ‚Äì they carry no stain,‚Äù she said in an interview in London. The dresses are to be hung on 45 washing lines on a football pitch, which could be seen as a symbol of masculinity and machismo. By assembling so many dresses and skirts, Xhafa-Mripa seeks to convey the scale of the problem of sexual violence during the war. Women and men, not just survivors, will be encouraged to come to the stadium to help in the installation, sponsored by the National Council for the Survivors of Wartime Sexual Violence, as an act of solidarity. ‚ÄúI want those thousands of dresses to hit you with the reality of what happened and I want people to talk about it. The installation can be grasped by anyone, no matter what language they speak,‚Äù she said. As in the Bosnian war, Serb forces used rape to terrorise and humiliate the civilian population, according to Human Rights Watch. The rapes ‚Äì often perpetrated in front of victim‚Äôs families ‚Äì were carried out mainly by paramilitary forces. Kosovar militants were also accused of rape, but the number of such cases is believed to be far lower. To date, there has been only one conviction at the international criminal tribunal for former Yugoslavia based partly on sexual assaults. In Kosovo itself, there have been only two rape case prosecutions ‚Äì by the war crimes unit of Eulex, the EU rule of law mission in Kosovo. Few women have spoken publicly about their trauma for fear of being ostracised or bringing shame upon their family in a highly traditional society, although there are groups such as the Kosova Women‚Äôs Network that have provided help. Last year, the law on war veterans was changed to include survivors of sexual violence as being eligible for compensation.
‚ÄúSurvivors of sexual violence are still stigmatised and denied recognition,‚Äù said Atifete Jahjaga, Kosovo‚Äôs first female president and a sponsor of the exhibition. ‚ÄúWith this artistic installation, we show that society supports them, that there is no ‚Äòus and them‚Äô. The language of this installation is universal and goes beyond Kosovo. We dedicate it to women and men all over the world who are subjected to sexual violence, a crime against humanity.‚Äù In the runup to the installation, Xhafa-Mripa has been attending events in Pristina and other towns, collecting clothes from people and hearing harrowing stories from survivors. People have been encouraged to contribute items of clothing imbued with special meaning. President Jahjaga was an early donor. One woman donated her wedding dress. Another gave a pair of trousers she wore while on the run from Serb forces. Cherie Blair, wife of former prime minister Tony Blair, also made a donation, as did Lady Anelay, the UK‚Äôs new special representative on preventing sexual violence in conflict, who will carry on the work begun by William Hague, the former foreign secretary. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs contribute together and dedicate this to the survivors of rape during the war,‚Äù said Xhafa-Mripa. ‚ÄúThe beauty of this artwork is that everyone is so willing to be involved. They want to be part of it ‚Äì that‚Äôs my biggest achievement.‚Äù This article was amended on 21 July 2015. An earlier version said an estimated 20,000 Albanians were raped by Serbian army, police and paramilitaries during the Kosovo war. Estimates vary, and the article has been amended to reflect that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-10T21:30:04Z,world,World news,Al-Qaida 'cut off and ripped apart by Isis',"Two of al-Qaida‚Äôs most important spiritual leaders have told the Guardian that the terror group is no longer a functioning organisation after being ripped apart by Isis. In a wide-ranging interview, Abu Qatada, a Jordanian preacher who was based in London before being deported in 2013, and Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, regarded as the most influential jihadi scholar alive, say the al-Qaida leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, is cut off from his commanders and keeping the group afloat through little more than appeals to loyalty.
Senior insiders in Jordan add that al-Qaida around the Middle East has been drained of recruits and money after losing territory and prestige to its former subordinate division. The ongoing war between al-Qaida and Isis has left the US struggling to catch up with the tectonic shifts within the global jihadi movement, intelligence insiders told the Guardian. Maqdisi, who Zawahiri counts as a close friend, is frank about the 63-year-old Egyptian‚Äôs situation. ‚ÄúHe operates solely based on the allegiance. There is no organisational structure. There is only communication channels and loyalty,‚Äù Maqdisi said. Qatada, who was born Omar Mahmoud Othman and has been described by the British government as a ‚Äútruly dangerous individual‚Äù, also says Zawahiri is ‚Äúisolated‚Äù and admits that Isis have been winning the propaganda and ground war against al-Qaida. Qatada was deported from the UK to Jordan to face terror charges after a court battle lasting nearly 10 years with a series of British home secretaries. Last summer he was released from custody after being acquitted of all charges. Since his release, he has become an increasingly vocal critic of Isis. He told the Guardian its members were extremists and a ‚Äúcancer‚Äù growing within the jihadi movement following their assault on al-Qaida over the last two years. ‚Äú[Isis] don‚Äôt respect anyone,‚Äù he said. Isis was al-Qaida‚Äôs branch in the heart of the Middle East until the group was excommunicated from the network in 2014 after disobeying commands from Zawahiri and starting an internecine war with fellow jihadists in Syria which left thousands dead on both sides. Today that fight continues and has expanded across Eurasia and the Mediterranean. Since declaring the establishment of its so-called Islamic State a year ago, Isis has gone on to build a global network of affiliates and branches that now stretches from Afghanistan to west Africa and competes with al-Qaida in its scale. Isis leaders, who described al-Qaida as a ‚Äúdrowned entity‚Äù in issue six of their official English-language publication, Dabiq, have declared that they will not tolerate any other jihadi group in territory where they are operating. They have readily delivered on that statement. Last week, Isis fighters in Afghanistan were reported to have beheaded 10 members of the Taliban, and on Wednesday al-Qaida in Libya vowed retaliation after blaming Isis for the death of one of its leaders. But the US has been slow to grasp the implications of al-Qaida‚Äôs decline and possible collapse despite extensive study of Isis, according to intelligence community insiders. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs such a cadre of people so closely tied to the al-Qaida brand within the IC [intelligence community] that I think they don‚Äôt see what else is going on outside the organisation,‚Äù said Derek Harvey, a former intelligence analyst who predicted how resilient the Iraq insurgency would be. Over the past year, a group of junior and mid-level analysts have concluded that Isis advances have pushed al-Qaida to the margins of global jihad. A former senior intelligence official who did not want to speak on the record said they had been tracking the split between the two groups with great attention. Against them is what Harvey described as ‚Äúthe overwhelming majority of senior intelligence officials looking at this‚Äù who he said considered the enmity between Isis and al-Qaida as little more than ‚Äúa squabble within‚Äù. That prevailing view has found expression in repeated public statements by Barack Obama and his senior advisers conflating Isis and al-Qaida or denying that any split between the two organisations is meaningful. That raises questions about whether a US counter-terrorism bureaucracy long focused on al-Qaida as a prime threat can grapple with the group‚Äôs decline and a different one‚Äôs ascent. In a typical comment, Barack Obama in March told Vice that Isis ‚Äúis the direct outgrowth of al-Qaida in Iraq‚Äù. Although factually correct, this is substantively misleading: al-Qaida in Iraq was for 10 years al-Qaida‚Äôs most fractious and disloyal franchise, even before it began waging its violent campaign against the old guard. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, has depicted the rivalry between the two jihadi groups as cosmetic, and his top Iraq policy official, Brett McGurk, has repeatedly stated: ‚ÄúIsis is al-Qaida.‚Äù Kerry‚Äôs new spokesman, John Kirby, said in his old job at the Pentagon that Isis, al-Qaida and al-Qaida‚Äôs Syrian proxy the Nusra Front ‚Äúin our minds, from our military perspective, are very much one and the same‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got counter-terrorist guys who are focused on counter-terrorism and they grew up fighting the al-Qaida networks, but Isis is a different kind of network,‚Äù Harvey said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basing itself on skills and organisational capabilities and objectives that are much more accelerated and capable than what al-Qaida‚Äôs ever had.‚Äù However misleading, the conflation of the two groups has political and legal benefits for Obama. He launched military action against Isis without congressional approval 10 months ago and a push for retroactive legislative blessing is all but dead in Washington. Portraying al-Qaida and Isis as the same thing has allowed the president to claim that the 2001 and 2002 congressional authorisations for attacks on al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein provide the legal foundations for the current campaign. Meanwhile, the US continues to target al-Qaida. So far this year, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the Americans have launched 11 drone strikes in Yemen ‚Äì the most recent came Tuesday night ‚Äì and 11 more in Pakistan, killing between 82 and 122 people. US officials have warned that al-Qaida‚Äôs presence in Yemen, which al-Qaida‚Äôs scholars consider to be its most loyal branch, has benefited from the January coup that displaced the US client government and the Saudi-led war to roll it back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On 3 February, after a few days of tense dialogue, the negotiators finally sent Maqdisi the password to unlock the file.

He watched in horror as Isis soldiers muscled the pilot into a cage, doused him in petrol, and burned him alive. Three hours later, Isis posted the video on the internet. The next day, Sajida al-Rishawi was taken from her cell and executed. * * * At his house on the outskirts of Zarqa, about 25km from Amman, Maqdisi keeps a large model boat on top of one of his overstuffed bookshelves. It‚Äôs a strange object to find there: Islamic extremists are not known for their maritime collectibles. The boat was a gift from a very senior member of Isis, who built it from pencils and matchsticks while incarcerated in Abu Ghraib. Above the boat‚Äôs sails hangs a banner that reads ‚ÄúJourney with us,‚Äù a quotation from the Quranic retelling of the story of the flood, when Noah reaches out to beckon his son aboard. For Maqdisi, it is a symbol of salvation and unity. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs meant as a message for all Muslims,‚Äù he said ‚Äì one with a special significance for jihadis today, as the factional bloodshed rages on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maqdisi and Abu Qatada continue to hope that the unity that once prevailed under bin Laden will return ‚Äì but they admitted openly that Isis is winning the war on the ground and the propaganda struggle alike. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a fluid state of affairs,‚Äù Abu Qatada suggested hopefully. ‚ÄúAt the moment, Isis are drunk on power.‚Äù But at some point, he believes, they will need to negotiate with al-Qaida again. He pointed out that al-Qaida‚Äôs branch in Syria had achieved some recent successes against Assad‚Äôs forces, while Maqdisi observed that there were several other branches, including the one in Yemen, whose allegiance remains unquestioned. ‚ÄúIts loyalty is strong and clear,‚Äù Maqdisi said. ‚ÄúWhen Zawahiri sends a message to Yemen, he knows his orders will be obeyed.‚Äù But the two men believe that the events of the past decade ‚Äì and especially the war with Isis ‚Äì are a sign that al-Qaida needs to reappraise its tactics. Maqdisi believes that al-Qaida should no longer aim to recruit followers in large numbers; it needs ‚Äúpeople of quality‚Äù, he said, who thoroughly understand Islamic scholarship, and will not merely deploy it in the furtherance of their own personal ends. In recent years, Maqdisi has even come to believe that al-Qaida‚Äôs conception of jihad ‚Äì one licensed in part by his own scholarship ‚Äì may have been incorrect, a jihad of ‚Äúspite‚Äù rather than ‚Äúempowering believers‚Äù. Even the attacks of 9/11, Maqdisi said, were part of a misguided strategy. ‚ÄúThe actions in New York and Washington, no matter how great they appeared to be ‚Äì the bottom line is they were spiteful.‚Äù Maqdisi now wants al-Qaida to begin providing social services, as Hamas has done in Gaza. ‚ÄúThat kind of enabling jihad will establish our Islamic state. It will enable it to become a place of refuge for the weak,‚Äù he said. Al-Qaida branches in Tunisia and elsewhere have been putting this suggestion into practice ‚Äì with jihadis guarding hospitals, building infrastructure, and even picking up litter. And yet, as one al-Qaida veteran who did not want to be named told the Guardian, local commanders have reported that their soldiers are impatient with these new duties; many would prefer for Zawahiri to swear allegiance to Baghdadi. Munif Samara, the jihadi doctor and close associate of Maqdisi and Abu Qatada, worried that al-Qaida may be crippled by its difficulty attracting new recruits. Young soldiers, he said, ‚Äúwant action, they want blood, they want explosions. They are sitting in their countries, and either they will be in jail or something like this, and they are waiting for al-Qaida [to do something], and al-Qaida is doing nothing.‚Äù For these young men, the lure of Isis is strong. Al-Qaida has long maintained that while the establishment of the caliphate is the ultimate goal, conditions are not yet right: ordinary Muslims need to be educated about ‚Äútrue Islam‚Äù for many more years before it can return. But it has now been a year since Baghdadi declared his own caliphate ‚Äì and the longer that Isis can hold its territory and broadcast its military successes to the world, the more credibility it will steal from al-Qaida. As ideologues steeped in almost 1,400 years of Islamic scholarship, Maqdisi and Abu Qatada tend to the long view ‚Äì for them, the proper perspective on al-Qaida‚Äôs present crisis is one of decades rather than months, which may explain their relative optimism about its possibility for renewal. For now, however, their fierce attacks on Isis have done little to halt its advances. Given the group‚Äôs ruthlessness and disdain for criticism, it is hard not to imagine, as one walks away from Maqdisi‚Äôs house, that if the war continues," it may not be long before he and Abu Qatada find themselves in the crosshairs. ‚Ä¢ Follow the Long Read on Twitter: @gdnlongread""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-10T21:06:04Z,world,World news,Australian 'baby bundles' cut maternal deaths in PNG province by 78%,"An Australian initiative distributing ‚Äúbaby bundles‚Äù to women in a Papua New Guinea province has lowered the maternal death rate by 78%, new peer-reviewed research has revealed. In PNG, between 200 and 500 women die during childbirth per 100,000 live births (pdf), compared with Australia‚Äôs six. In 2010 Australian doctor Barry Kirby conducted a study of all maternal deaths in Milne Bay province ‚Äì where the rate is as high as 700 ‚Äì and in response to his findings began a program of distributing essential items to expectant mothers and running education and training programs. Peer-reviewed research published by the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology this week showed Kirby‚Äôs program had had a ‚Äúdramatic‚Äù effect. In his research, Kirby travelled by boat to remote villages scattered throughout the province‚Äôs 160 islands to interview family members of women who had died during childbirth. Most of the mothers died of blood loss in their home because they did not go to a clinic for the birth. The paper released this week noted: ‚ÄúAccess to supervised birth is well recognised as a key component of any strategy aimed at improving outcomes, including mortality, for women and babies in developing countries.‚Äù Kirby found that, among other contributing factors, women were overwhelmingly reluctant to go to a clinic because they felt ‚Äúshy at presenting in an impoverished state and not having baby‚Äôs clothes‚Äù. With the support of an Australian charity, Send Hope Not Flowers, Kirby began distributing ‚Äúmother baby gifts‚Äù, which included basic supplies for new mothers, such as nappies, underwear, sanitary pads and baby powder, as well as funds for medical treatment. Staff at health centres were also offered reward payments for extra supervised births and training in emergency medical care and obstetrics was also increased. As a result the 10 health centres servicing Milne Bay province have seen supervised deliveries increase from 845 a year in 2012 to 1,449 in 2014. The research was undertaken by the Hands of Rescue Foundation one year into Kirby‚Äôs program, and found the number of women coming to Milne Bay health clinics for a supervised birth had increased by 80%, and recorded deaths in childbirth has dropped from between 25 and 30 in 2011, to just five. ‚ÄúShort-term, follow-up data reveal that a relatively inexpensive intervention, such as providing women with a practical mother and baby gift, increased the rate of supervised birth in all [health clinics] surveyed,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúThere were no other interventions during the study period that might have accounted for the observed increase.‚Äù Professor Steve Robson, an obstetrician and board member of Send Hope Not Flowers, told Guardian Australia the results were ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù, particularly for a pilot program in a specific area. ‚ÄúThis was such a profoundly simple solution, and an elegant solution, to a disastrous problem,‚Äù said Robson, who co-wrote the paper with Kirby and others. ‚ÄúI think the message from the paper is if you empower local people with local knowledge to explore local problems and come up with local solutions, you really can make a big difference.‚Äù Robson estimated Send Hope Not Flowers had raised about $120,000 for the program so far. With its assistance, Kirby has distributed about 3,000 baby bundles. Robson said: ‚ÄúIt may not be the solution everywhere but the powerful message from this is if motivated people take the time to look at what treatable local issues are, often relatively simple and inexpensive things can make a big difference.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-10T20:44:03Z,world,World news,Pope Francis tells Putin: 'sincere' peace efforts needed for Ukraine,"Pope Francis spent most of an hour-long meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin on Wednesday night discussing the crisis in Ukraine, with the pontiff calling for a ‚Äúsincere and great effort to achieve peace‚Äù in the region. The meeting, for which Putin was more than an hour late ‚Äì as he has been in other meetings with world leaders ‚Äì included an exchange of gifts, with the pope giving Putin a medallion of an ‚Äúangel of peace‚Äù. A similar gift stirred controversy when it was given to Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas.
The Vatican said in a statement that both Pope Francis and Putin agreed on the need to ‚Äúrestore a climate of dialogue‚Äù and that Russia and Ukraine should implement a peace plan negotiated in Minsk. ‚ÄúThe Holy Father affirmed that it is necessary to make a sincere and great effort to forge peace,‚Äù the Vatican said. This week, US president Barack Obama said that G7 nations would toughen sanctions against Russia if the conflict in Ukraine escalated. The meeting with Pope Francis was far less confrontational, but the pontiff appears to have taken a more direct approach to the Russian leader than he has in the past. Francis spoke to Putin about the ‚Äúgrave humanitarian crisis‚Äù in the region and the need for victims of the conflict to be given access to aid. The two also discussed the crisis in the Middle East and the persecution of Christians, a topic of great importance to Francis ‚Äì he has chided global leaders for diminishing the scale of the problem ‚Äì and to the Russian president. The meeting occurred hours after a top American diplomat, Kenneth Hackett, told reporters that he hoped the pope ‚Äúcould say more about concerns on territorial integrity‚Äù and that Francis had ‚Äúcertainly‚Äù been made aware of the violence in Ukraine. Hackett is the US ambassador to the Holy See. In February, the pope referred to the bloodshed in the Ukrainian conflict as fratricidal, a comment seen as controversial in Ukraine, where the violence is viewed as a direct consequence of Russian aggression.
Putin arrived at the Vatican meeting in a stretch limousine after flying into Rome from Milan, where he had been treated to a warm welcome by Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi. The presidential visit underscores Russia‚Äôs cosy relationship with Italy at a time when Putin is otherwise being treated as a pariah on the world stage. Renzi even made some jokes about vodka ‚Äì saying he hoped the two would not be drinking Russia‚Äôs national drink on an empty stomach ‚Äì and football. Renzi noted that Russia would soon host a major international event ‚Äì the 2018 World Cup ‚Äì without making any reference to the scandal that has engulfed Fifa or the controversy over the selection of Russia as a host nation. At a press conference after the meeting, Renzi said that even though different countries within Europe had ‚Äúdifferent ideas‚Äù about how the sanctions were reached, all of the EU was ‚Äúin the same place‚Äù. He said that the implementation of a peace plan agreed in Minsk would end the phase of ‚Äúdiatribes and sanctions‚Äù against Russia. The two leaders also discussed how sanctions had prevented Italy and Russia from working together on a number of projects involving Italian companies, Renzi said. Putin was expected to end his whirlwind trip to Italy with a meeting with billionaire Silvio Berlusconi, the former Italian premier. The two are known to be good friends. The last time that Putin visited Berlusconi in Italy, after a summit in Milan in October, he did not leave Berlusconi‚Äôs villa until 3am, according to reports at the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-10T18:48:37Z,world,World news,How hitmen and high living lifted lid on looting of Honduran healthcare system,"At first, the attempted murder of a travel agent by two gunmen on motorbikes seemed to be just another grim example of the lawlessness that plagues San Pedro Sula, the second largest city in Honduras ‚Äì and one of the most of the most violent in the world. But the intended victim, John Bogr√°n, is widely believed to have been targeted for his alleged role in a massive fraud involving high-ranking government officials who were reportedly involved in the theft of hundreds of millions of dollars from the social security system using a network of sham companies which left dying patients without life-saving medicines.
As the scale and audacity of the fraud in the Honduran institute of social security (known by its Spanish initials as the IHSS) has come to light in recent weeks, thousands have taken to the streets to demand the resignation of President Juan Orlando Hern√°ndez. The protests ‚Äì led by non-partisan groups fed up with blatant political corruption ‚Äì have parallels with a similar movement in neighbouring Guatemala, where a separate corruption scandal has already led to the fall of the vice-president and several ministers. The twin scandals have unfolded even as the Obama administration urges Congress to approve a $1bn aid package for Central America‚Äôs northern triangle of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador in an effort to curtail undocumented migration to the US by creating jobs through US-funded infrastructure projects. But allegations of criminal wrongdoing in the highest echelons of both governments challenge the assurances given to Congress about improved governance in both countries ‚Äì which are also key allies in America‚Äôs war on drugs.
‚ÄúThe gravity of the evidence is shaking to the roots the legitimacy of both governments and producing mass protests,‚Äù said Annie Bird, Central America expert at the Center for Political Ecology. ‚ÄúThe US Congress must seriously examine the responsibility of appropriating large sums of taxpayer dollars to governments in which top officials are implicated in major corruption.‚Äù The IHSS is a government-run national insurance system which until a few years ago provided good quality healthcare for those in the formal labour market, from factory workers to public servants, who made monthly payments linked to salary levels. Allegations of corruption first emerged in 2013 amid reports of major shortages of medicines, equipment and staff at IHSS hospitals. Prosecutors said the institute‚Äôs director, Mario Zelaya, and his cousin Jos√© Zelaya, the head buyer at the IHSS, had embezzled millions of dollars to pay for extravagant lifestyles which included mansions, flashy cars and foreign travel for themselves, their wives and model girlfriends. Mario Zelaya was named as IHSS director in early 2010, just a few months after a military-backed coup d‚Äô√©tat deposed the elected president, Manuel Zelaya (no relation), and created a law-and-order vacuum that enabled organised crime to proliferate in the country. By 2014 the list of IHSS officials and associates wanted for money laundering, fraud and misuse of public office had grown, and Interpol issued several arrest warrants. Mario Zelaya was arrested in Nicaragua in September. His girlfriend, model Natalia Ciuffardi Castro, was arrested in Chile in December. Prosecutors say she received cash and real estate through contracts with sham companies ‚Äì set up to launder IHSS money, but as there is no extradition treaty between Chile and Honduras, Ciuffardi has yet to be charged and denies any wrongdoing.
Jos√© Zelaya is still on the run, but his wife and girlfriend have both been detained. His girlfriend, Honduran model Ilsa Vanessa Molina, was arrested by US immigration officers in January while trying to enter illegally through New Mexico. Molina, who allegedly received almost half a million dollars, is seeking asylum in the US. As the drama unfolded, the governing National Party ‚Äì which won the 2013 election following a multimillion-dollar campaign ‚Äì distanced itself from the scandal. But in early May, Globo TV revealed a cache of leaked documents, including cheques that purportedly showed that in the runup to the election the National Party secretly received hundreds of thousands of dollars, including large amounts from at least 10 sham companies that were given IHSS contracts approved by Congress ‚Äì led at the time by the future President Hern√°ndez ‚Äì during late-night parliamentary sessions. Hilda Hern√°ndez, the president‚Äôs sister, was one of three officials in charge of party funding at the time. She has not been arrested or questioned. In total $350m was allegedly stolen from IHSS. The scams included overpaying almost $400,000 for 10 ambulances and buying overpriced medicines which were then repeatedly stolen and resold to the IHSS.
The drip-drip of damaging evidence has continued for the past month. At first, the president accused opposition parties of orchestrating the revelations to destabilise the government, but prosecutors said the leaked cheques were genuine. Amid growing public outrage, Hern√°ndez then appointed a commission to investigate the scandal alongside 11 other old and new corruption cases. He has accepted that his election campaign received money from companies linked to the scandal, but denies any personal knowledge. The case has prompted fury among ordinary Hondurans over the collapse of the IHSS ‚Äì which before the fraud had provided good quality healthcare to 1.6 million Hondurans ‚Äì and its imminent privatisation. Even as the scandal unfolded, the government was negotiating a $188m loan with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which insisted that the IHSS ‚Äì now saddled with huge debts thanks to the embezzlement ‚Äì should be privatised. ‚ÄúThe IMF knows the privatisation of all our public institutions has been preceded by huge deficits and insolvencies created by government-appointed corrupt and incompetent officials,‚Äù union leader Carlos Reyes told the Guardian. ‚ÄúA functioning hospital system was dismantled and sick people died unnecessarily in order to win an election and justify privatisation.‚Äù The IMF said its prerequisite reforms also include steps to eliminate waste and fraud in the IHSS.
The political fallout of the scandal has yet to be established. Protesters are angered by prosecutors‚Äô unwillingness to acknowledge political links to the fraud until the documents were leaked.They have called for the establishment of an independent criminal investigative body like the UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (Cicig), which also promotes witness protection. Keeping witnesses alive to testify is a serious problem in Honduras, which has one of the highest murder rates in the world. Bogr√°n, the travel agent accused of selling the Zelayas flights to US cities at inflated prices, was shot alongside his bodyguard days after the allegations first came to light. At the time, he was wanted by Interpol and, allegedly, also a protected witness working with prosecutors. That same week, model Ilsa Vanessa Molina‚Äôs mother filed a case with the National Commission of Human Rights claiming two men had threatened to kill her and her daughter if they cooperated with investigators. Meanwhile ordinary Hondurans continue to suffer the consequences of the fraud. Pedro Amador, an English teacher, said his father Jos√© received no treatment from the IHSS after he was diagnosed with cancer two years ago. He died at home last month. ‚ÄúMy father paid into IHSS all his working life but since he got cancer two years ago, they did nothing apart from give us prescriptions,‚Äù said Pedro. ‚ÄúWe had to buy every medicine he needed and my elderly mother and sister basically nursed him at home as there were no staff to attend to him. He died from negligence, because all the money was stolen.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-10T18:46:05Z,world,World news,David Cameron to brief EU leaders on treaty renegotiation plans,"David Cameron is to brief fellow EU leaders on Britain‚Äôs proposals for renegotiating its membership terms in the formal setting of the European council in Brussels later this month. As the prime minister left the door open to an early EU referendum on the same day as other elections next year, British officials confirmed that a slot has been set aside on the summit agenda for Cameron to outline his plans.
A draft of the summit guidelines ‚Äì the forerunner of the formal summit agenda ‚Äì simply says that item four on the agenda is, underlined, ‚ÄúUK‚Äù. This will give the prime minister a speaking slot but allows him to keep his options open by steering clear of outlining highly detailed demands. British officials said they welcomed the news that the prime minister had been awarded a formal speaking slot after the summit guidelines were published by the Financial Times. A British official said: ‚ÄúWe welcome this. Obviously the prime minister has been talking to leaders one to one and this offers a further opportunity to raise with all 27 [EU leaders] the concerns of British people that we want to address.‚Äù The agreement of Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, to grant the prime minister a speaking slot will come as little surprise. EU leaders agreed at a summit before the election to set aside time to consider the UK‚Äôs concerns. It is understood that the prime minister will outline some of the areas he has identified in recent months. These are a four-year ban on EU migrants claiming in-work benefits; providing greater protections for non-eurozone countries to ensure they cannot be outvoted in the single market by eurozone countries; giving Britain an opt-out from the EU‚Äôs historic commitment to create an ‚Äúever-closer union‚Äù of the peoples of Europe; and giving national parliaments the ability to club together to block EU legislation. It is understood that officials and lawyers working for Tusk and for Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president who acts as the formal guardian of the EU treaties, will then examine the legal avenues for introducing the prime minister‚Äôs demands. Cameron, who has been told that his plans to restrict access to benefits would have to be underpinned by treaty change, has demanded what he calls ‚Äúfull-on‚Äù treaty change. The prime minister, who told MPs on Wednesday that the negotiations would take place over the ‚Äúcoming months‚Äù, kept his options open on holding a referendum in May next year when he said he saw no difficulty in holding the poll on the same day as other elections, even though the Election commission prefers referendums to be held on separate dates from major elections. The most high profile elections next May are the Scottish parliamentary and London mayoral elections. The prime minister told MPs: ‚ÄúMy view is the timing of the referendum should be determined by the timing of the renegotiation. When the renegotiation is complete, we set a date for the referendum. I don‚Äôt myself think it should be determined by the timing of other elections.‚Äù He said he had been satisfied with the referendum on whether Britain should adopt the alternative vote electoral system, which was held on the same day as other elections, telling MPs: ‚ÄúI think people are capable of making those two decisions.‚Äù Harriet Harman, the interim Labour leader, said she strongly agreed with the Electoral Commission that referendum polling day should not coincide with other elections and urged the prime minister to agree a separate voting day. Harman also tackled Cameron over his decision not to impose a period of purdah on the government, which would prevent the publication of official documents during the formal phase of the referendum campaign. The prime minister replied by making the case that the campaign could not obscure the ability of ministers to engage with EU summits, European court judgments or other issues emanating from Brussels. He added: ‚ÄúThe second issue I would raise ‚Äì and I think this is a bigger issue ‚Äì is when the negotiation is complete and the government has a clear view, I don‚Äôt want us to be neutral on this issue. I want us to speak clearly and frankly on this issue. ‚ÄúWhen it came to the Scottish referendum, I actually felt in the last few weeks before the referendum the UK government was often being advised it couldn‚Äôt take a view on the future of the UK. I think that was a ridiculous situation, which is why we have put forward the change to the purdah rules.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-10T18:42:25Z,world,World news,Obama's new and 'nimble' anti-Isis strategy met with scepticism on all sides,"It was not clear how a new US plan to fight Isis militants in Iraq would correct the problems of the old plan, analysts and lawmakers said following a White House announcement of the strategy on Wednesday. In a conference call with reporters, the White House billed the plan, which calls for 450 additional US troops to train Iraqi forces at a base in Anbar province, as a way to speed up the progress of air strikes against Isis positions in the region and to improve what it called the ‚Äúsituational awareness‚Äù of Iraqi forces ‚Äì helping them to asses the size and scope of offensives by Isis. The idea was to ‚Äúbe more nimble, because, clearly, this is a nimble enemy‚Äù, said Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser. The announcement was greeted with indifference and scepticism in Iraq, where efforts to arm local Sunnis opposed to Isis have foundered and training programmes by the US have made little progress in producing disciplined Sunni fighters capable of challenging the militant group. ‚ÄúThe increase doesn‚Äôt have an effect,‚Äù said Hisham al-Hashimi, an Iraqi scholar and expert on Isis. ‚ÄúIt is a weak step to reduce pressure from the media.‚Äù The air base where the additional US forces are to deploy, at al-Taqqadum, sits about halfway between entrenched Isis positions in Ramadi, about 40 kilometers to the west, and Fallujah, to the east. Elissa Slotkin, assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, said having US forces positioned so close to the front lines could have ‚Äúa deterrent effect‚Äù on Isis. ‚ÄúThe idea that the US is close to the actual combat role that the Iraqis will be taking, that we‚Äôre closer to the fight, that we shortened the strings on support for those forces, when it comes to providing overhead cover, all of those things ‚Äì I think certainly, if I were [Isis], I would be factoring into the equation,‚Äù Slotkin said. ‚ÄúThe [US] forces will not be in a combat role themselves,‚Äù Rhodes said. US forces have been attempting to train Iraqi forces to fight Isis since last year, when Barack Obama announced the deployment of 1,500 additional troops to the country. The latest deployment would bring the total number of US troops in Iraq to about 3,550. The plan was also met with deep scepticism in the United States. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to change a thing in Iraq,‚Äù Lindsey Graham, the senator and Republican presidential candidate, told CNN. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, warned in a statement that the mission ‚Äúcannot succeed ‚Ä¶ unless it is accompanied by significant governance changes by the Iraqis themselves,‚Äù and he expressed concern ‚Äúthat the president has decided to expand the American role in the battle against [Isis] when the war still lacks an authorization from Congress.‚Äù Thousands of Iraqi security forces retreated from Ramadi without putting up a fight after being challenged last month by Isis militants, who captured the city. Defense secretary Ash Carter said the Iraqi forces lacked a ‚Äúwill to fight‚Äù. It was additionally unclear how increasing the number of US soldiers available to train Iraqi fighters would overcome a central problem to the training effort most recently spelled out on Monday by Obama: a lack of recruits to train. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got more training capacity than we‚Äôve got recruits,‚Äù Obama said at the close of a G7 summit in Germany. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not happening as fast as it needs to.‚Äù Hashimi said that only 1,100 Sunnis had taken part in the US training programme, and none of them have graduated from it. In total, about 9,500 fighters have completed the training. ‚ÄúTraining is not a Sunni need or requirement, but arming is,‚Äù Hashimi said. As part of the new plan, the White House said it would expedite the delivery of ‚Äúessential equipment and materiel‚Äù to Iraqi forces, Kurdish Peshmerga forces and tribal fighters. There was little official response in Iraq to the US announcement. Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi met with General Lloyd Austin, the commander of US Central Command and the former commanding general of US forces in Iraq. After the meeting, Abadi said in a statement that the efforts of the international community must continue to support Iraq against Isis, but made no reference to the announcement of additional trainers. The American advisers began arriving after Isis conquered much of northern Iraq in a lightning advance last summer. They are based in Kurdistan, the Habbaniya air base near Ramadi, Ain al Assad air base, and a number of other facilities in the country. Hashimi, who advises the Iraqi government on Isis, said their roles vary from consulting on military operations, to trainers and experts on communications and aerial reconnaissance, intelligence and experts on national reconciliation and tribal affairs. The focus on retaking Ramadi represented a shift in strategy from April, when General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, downplayed the importance of defending the city. ‚ÄúThe city itself it‚Äôs not symbolic in any way,‚Äù Dempsey told reporters at the Pentagon. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not been declared part of [the Isis] ‚Äòcaliphate‚Äô on one hand, or central to the future of Iraq. ... I would much rather that Ramadi not fall, but it won‚Äôt be the end of a campaign‚Äù if it does. An official with US Central Command told reporters in February that a counteroffensive to retake the northern city of Mosul, which Isis militants claimed one year ago, was planned for the spring. That counteroffensive never materialized, and officials now say Mosul is behind Ramadi as a priority.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-10T17:42:09Z,world,World news,Father of British tourist held after 'naked' prank asks for clemency,"The father of a British woman arrested in Malaysia for posing naked on Mount Kinabalu has appealed to the authorities not to make an example of her, amid fears for her safety after the prank was blamed for causing a deadly earthquake. Eleanor Hawkins, 23, from Derby, was one of 10 trekkers who stripped on the mountain on 30 May in a stunt that a local official said was insulting to indigenous people, suggesting it may even be considered the cause of an earthquake that killed 18 people days later. Hawkins was arrested at Tawau airport on Tuesday before she was due to depart for Kuala Lumpur. She appeared in court on Wednesday with Dylan Snel, a Dutch tourist, and Lindsey and Danielle Petersen, two Canadian siblings, court sources have confirmed. The four were remanded for four days pending further investigations into alleged indecency.
Hawkins‚Äô father, Tim, who runs his own mechanical engineering business in Derby, said: ‚ÄúI would like to appeal to the Malaysian authorities. I have got every faith in their judicial system. I just hope they don‚Äôt make an example of them after the tragic earthquake.‚Äù Tim Hawkins told the Guardian that he spoke to his daughter on Wednesday morning: ‚ÄúShe is obviously upset. She‚Äôs pretty scared. But it was good to speak to her.‚Äù He also spoke of his daughter‚Äôs relief to be in the hands of the Malaysia authorities after the stunt prompted an angry backlash among the Malaysian public. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs kind of relieved because she saw it coming. It‚Äôs good to know where she is. It is not the kind of situation you envisage when your daughter goes travelling.‚Äù Eleanor Hawkins is understood to be held in a cell with Danielle Petersen. Ronny Cham, Hawkins‚Äô lawyer, told the Guardian he requested the group be held separately for their own safety because of the level of public anger generated by the alleged stunt. Hawkins was educated at the independent Ockbrook school in Ockbrook, Derbyshire, which she left with four A-levels at grade A. She graduated last year from the University of Southampton with a masters in aerospace engineering, according to her LinkedIn profile. She worked as a barmaid in a Southampton pub while studying, as well as spending the summer of 2013 on a Camp America summer placement. Her duties as a riding instructor at Pompositticut Farm Day Camp in Hudson, Massachusetts, included ‚Äúbeing a responsible role model for all children and younger members of staff at all times,‚Äù her LinkedIn profile said.
Hawkins‚Äô cellmate Danielle Petersen, 22, and her brother Lindsey, 23 are from Wood Mountain, Saskatchewan, Canada. The Toronto Star said their father, Floyd Petersen, only learned of their predicament when it contacted him on Saturday. He confirmed they were travelling together in Malaysia and said they rarely phone home. Both siblings are believed to be current or former students at the University of Regina, also in Saskatchewan. The university told CTV News Regina it was monitoring the situation. The area‚Äôs MP, Ralph Goodale, said the Canadian government was trying to free the pair. ‚ÄúThe incident, obviously, was ill advised,‚Äù he said. Malaysian authorities arrested a third Canadian in connection with the stunt on Wednesday. Emil Kaminski, a 33-year-old adventure travel blogger, allegedly led the group up the mountain. Described by the New Straits Times as a ‚Äúnotorious Canadian nudist‚Äù, he is said to be facing charges of indecent exposure, as well as further charges of insulting local culture and people through social media postings. Kaminski was the original source of one of the photos circulating online showing the group of 10 naked on the mountain, it has been widely reported. Officials in Sabah state, in the northern half of the island of Borneo, accused the tourists of showing ‚Äúdisrespect to the sacred mountain‚Äù, which at 4,095 metres is south-east Asia‚Äôs highest peak. Sabah‚Äôs indigenous Kadazan Dusun people believe the tourists‚Äô behaviour angered the spirit of the mountain and was the reason for a 5.9-magnitude earthquake, which six days later struck near the mountain, killing 18 climbers. Hawkins was third to enter the court on Wednesday, as the group was ushered in handcuffed together and dressed in purple prison uniforms.
The four were remanded until 14 June. Cham said they are likely to be charged with ‚Äúcausing annoyance by conducting obscene acts in a public place‚Äù. He said they could face three months in prison if found guilty, or a fine, or both. He said if charged, the defence was likely to argue that the top of the mountain should not be defined as a public place where annoyance could be caused to the public. Cham accused local state officials of of stoking a public backlash against the tourists. He said: ‚ÄúI asked the court they be held in separate custody from other detainees. Because of the sentiment in this case, we want to protect their safety. People are laying blame on them for offending the mountain. There is a lot of stupidity involved and unfortunately politicians have jumped on the bandwagon to condemn them for causing the earthquake, which is ridiculous.‚Äù The Foreign Office in London confirmed that a British national had been arrested and consular assistance was being provided. Sabah‚Äôs deputy chief minister, Joseph Pairin Kitingan, said a special ritual would be conducted to ‚Äúappease the mountain spirit‚Äù.
Sabah‚Äôs state tourism minister, Masidi Manjun, tweeted that legal proceedings against the four foreigners had begun and that they would be remanded for four days.
Masidi said the suggestion that the tourists‚Äô actions had caused the earthquake was ‚Äúmisconstrued‚Äù. ‚ÄúI never said that they actually caused the earthquake, but their actions were against the people of the largest tribe in Sabah. The mountain is a revered and sacred site,‚Äù he said. Myths of the peak Mount Kinabalu is the subject of many competing myths and legends about its name and spiritual significance. The local Kadazan-Dusun people believe its name derives from the words ‚ÄúAki Nabalu‚Äù, meaning ‚Äúthe revered place of the dead‚Äù. The Kadazan-Dusun have left tributes for their ancestral spirits that roam the peaks for hundreds of years, a practice that was first recorded by British colonialist Sir Hugh Low in 1858. Popular folklore differs, claiming the mountain‚Äôs name actually means ‚ÄúChinese widow‚Äù. Legend tells the story of a Chinese prince who scales the peak in search of a pearl guarded by a ferocious dragon. The prince kills the dragon and marries a local woman, but abandons her and returns to China. The woman‚Äôs spirit is said to wander the mountain lost in grief. Despite these differences, the need for respect for Mount Kinabalu and its spirits is frequently emphasised to all that travel to the Unesco World Heritage site.

2015-06-10T17:38:31Z,world,World news,Pope Francis urged to take tougher stance against Vladimir Putin,"Pope Francis was encouraged by a top American diplomat to take a tougher stance against Vladimir Putin before his meeting with the Russian president on Wednesday evening. The pope, a frequent critic of military action, has taken a cautious approach to criticism of Russia since its annexation of Crimea, and Kenneth Hackett, the US ambassador to the Holy See, said the Vatican ‚Äúcould say more about concerns on territorial integrity‚Äù. ‚ÄúMaybe this is an opportunity for the Holy Father to privately raise those concerns,‚Äù Hackett said. Pope Francis had ‚Äúcertainly‚Äù been made aware of the violence in Ukraine and was not unaware of the crisis, he added. His comments, which were made in response to reporters‚Äô questions at a briefing on an unrelated matter, came hours before the Argentinian pontiff hosted Putin, in the first meeting between the two leaders since 2013. Putin arrived in a stretch limousine at the Vatican more than an hour late for his meeting, after flying from Milan, where he had met Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi earlier in the day. In February, the pope referred to the bloodshed in the Ukrainian conflict as fratricidal, a comment seen as controversial in Ukraine, where the violence is viewed as a direct consequence of Russian aggression. Pope Francis has also sought to strengthen ties with the Russian Orthodox church as part of a broader aim to promote Christian unity. Hackett added that Putin had in the past discussed his concern for Christians who were being persecuted in the Middle East, particularly in Syria. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to see if he has a proposal. That would be very useful,‚Äù Hackett said. ‚ÄúPutin has a role ‚Ä¶ to step up and address some of the major issues.‚Äù In relation to Ukraine, Hackett said: ‚ÄúIt does seem that Russia is supporting the insurgents and it does seem that Russian troops are inside Ukraine. So this is a very serious situation and I believe that the G7 has pretty well decided that they are going to continue the sanctions [against Russia].‚Äù Barack Obama, the US president, warned at the G7 summit this week that world leaders were prepared to tighten sanctions against Russia if the conflict in Ukraine escalated. Putin has been treated to a far warmer welcome in Italy than he would get in any of the other large EU countries. In remarks in Milan, where Putin visited the Russian pavilion at the city‚Äôs expo on the eve of Russia Day, Renzi noted that the next big international event ‚Äì the 2018 World Cup ‚Äì would be hosted by Russia. The comment could raise eyebrows given the controversy over Russia‚Äôs selection as a host nation in the wake of a massive corruption scandal that has forced the resignation of Fifa president Sepp Blatter. The presidential visit underscores Russia‚Äôs cosy relationship with Italy at a time when Putin is otherwise being treated as a pariah on the world stage. At a press conference after his meeting with Putin, Renzi said that even though different countries within Europe had ‚Äúdifferent ideas‚Äù about how the sanctions were reached, all of the EU was ‚Äúin the same place‚Äù. He said that the implementation of a peace plan agreed in Minsk would end the phase of ‚Äúdiatribes and sanctions‚Äù against Russia. The two leaders also discussed how sanctions had prevented Italy and Russia from working together on a number of projects involving Italian companies, Renzi said. In earlier remarks, the Italian prime minister said: ‚ÄúWe are in a difficult international situation, not just on account of issues which do not unite us but also for issues which should see us ever more on the same side in a very complicated international scenario, starting with the global threat of terrorism.‚Äù Putin‚Äôs affinity for Italy and his friendship with billionaire Silvio Berlusconi, the former Italian premier, are so well known that the biggest news out of a critical summit in Milan last October ‚Äì which included a meeting between Putin and Petro Poroshenko, the president of Ukraine ‚Äì was the late-night rendezvous between Putin and Berlusconi at the former premier‚Äôs villa that lasted until 3am. In March, Renzi became the first European leader to be hosted in a bilateral meeting in Moscow since Russia‚Äôs annexation of Crimea last year ‚Äì a meeting that was met with displeasure by the US, according to an American official at the time. The meeting with Renzi came only days after Boris Nemtsov, the Russian opposition politician, was murdered near the Kremlin as he was walking home. Another Italian politician, Matteo Salvini, who heads the anti-euro, anti-immigrant Northern League party, has been an outspoken critic against sanctions against Russia. The Northern League has even shepherded a movement to create a parliamentary group called Friends of Putin, which has praised the Russian leader as an essential counterweight to the Obama administration. No Italians were included in the list of 89 EU citizens who were banned from entering Russia by Russian authorities, according to a list that was published by Finnish state broadcaster YLE earlier this month. It appeared to be another sign of close ties between the two countries. Giancarlo Aragona, a former Italian ambassador to Russia who heads the Italian Institute for International Political Studies, a thinktank, told the Guardian that Italy had maintained a dialogue with Russia but that did not contradict the fact that Italy was ‚Äúfully committed‚Äù to the European policy in relation to Russia, including the implementation of sanctions and decisions related to the crisis in Ukraine. Aragona acknowledged there was a perception that Italy was somehow ‚Äúmore sympathetic‚Äù to Russia than other European countries. But he added: ‚ÄúI think that is not really a fair representation of the situation. I think the real issue is that [the Italian government] considers the Ukrainian issue a cause of very serious tension but also a symptom of a European order, [or] European architecture, which has not found its stability at the end of the cold war.‚Äù Aragona then added: ‚ÄúWe see the European evolution probably more clearly and objectively than some of our European partners.‚Äù In an interview with Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, Putin emphasised the strong trade relationship between Italy and Russia, noting that it had increased elevenfold in recent years from $4.2bn to nearly $49bn, as well as mutual interests in the energy and hi-tech sectors. While the meeting with Renziwas closely watched, the talks between Putin and Pope Francis are sure to have Rome riveted. The Argentinian pontiff caused controversy last month when he met with Mahmoud Abbas ‚Äì an encounter in which he might or might not have referred to the Palestinian president as an ‚Äúangel of peace‚Äù, according to conflicting news reports. His meeting with Putin is being followed just as closely. A report in Crux, the online news site, noted that Francis and Putin were something of an ‚Äúodd geopolitical couple‚Äù who had formed an ‚Äúimprobably strong partnership‚Äù. It began after the pope sent a letter to Putin in 2013 ‚Äì before the G20 meeting in Moscow ‚Äì urging leaders to find a non-military solution to the conflict in Syria. In his talk with other world leaders, Putin reportedly quoted from the pope‚Äôs letter, saying: ‚ÄúWe might listen to the pope.‚Äù No military action was taken. Putin has also spoken out about the ‚Äúdire‚Äù situation facing Christians in the Middle East who are being persecuted and killed ‚Äì a topic that is frequently also mentioned by the pope. The pontiff has chided world leaders for seeking to diminish anti-Christian violence and the topic was likely raised on Wednesday. Asked what the pope and Putin were likely to discuss at their meeting on Wednesday, the Vatican told the Guardian: ‚ÄúYou can only speculate on the topics of the discussions.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-10T16:52:45Z,world,World news,Obama approves plan to send 450 new troops to Iraq in fight against Isis,"The Obama administration is preparing to send hundreds of extra troops to help bolster the Iraqi army in its fight against Islamic State. Barack Obama authorised ‚Äúup to 450 additional military personnel‚Äù to be deployed to the eastern Anbar province, the White House announced on Wednesday. The reinforcements will bring the number of US military forces in Iraq to 3,550. ‚ÄúThese additional US troops will not serve in a combat role,‚Äù the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said in a statement.
The deployment comes less than four years after the US pulled out its troops from Iraq. The move reflects the extent to which Iraqi forces are struggling against Isis, even with the help of air strikes by the US and its allies, including the UK. In spite of almost daily air attacks on Isis, the US-trained Iraqi army has largely failed to stem the group‚Äôs advance. Isis took Ramadi, in Anbar province, last month and the Iraqi army has failed to retake Mosul, lost to Isis last year. The White House said the new military ‚Äúadvisers‚Äù would work with Iraqi forces to ‚Äúimprove their ability to plan, lead and conduct operations‚Äù in the fight against Isis. The focus of the additional forces will be ‚Äúoperational advice and planning support to Iraqi forces‚Äù ‚Äì not combat ‚Äì said Elissa Slotkin, assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, on a call with reporters. The extra troops are heading for Anbar province to block Isis advances from Ramadi to Baghdad and to try to resurrect a US strategy employed from 2006 of arming and training an alliance of Sunni tribes to fight al-Qaida, which was dubbed the ‚ÄúAnbar Awakening‚Äù.
The Obama administration faces an awkward dilemma, caught between accusations of mission creep and fear of seeing Isis expand further. The president acknowledged on Monday at the G7 that the US has not yet worked out a ‚Äúcomplete strategy‚Äù for retaking ground from Isis, other than further training of the Iraqi army. ‚ÄúWe have been working,‚Äù said the deputy national security advisor Ben Rhoddes, ‚Äúto evaluate what is going well ... and also to look at setbacks.‚Äù The Pentagon has proposed to the White House a combination of more trainers and advisers and more and better equipment. The president is resisting calls from Republican senators such as John McCain to send thousands more troops to Iraq. The UK is to send an extra 125 troops to Iraq as trainers, also to Anbar. The UK will have 1,000 trainers and advisers in Iraq, most of them in the Kurdish-controlled area in the north. The US began its drawdown from Iraq in 2007, when it had a force of 170,000 in the country.

2015-06-10T15:54:53Z,world,World news,"Earthquakes caused by nudity, short skirts, gay marriage and other scapegoats","Natural disasters are, by definition, natural. Which might lead you to assume they are one of the few areas of life in which no one is at fault. Not so, according to some in Malaysia who blamed last week‚Äôs earthquake ‚Äì in which 16 climbers died ‚Äì on a British woman posing naked for pictures at the top of the country‚Äôs highest mountain. The peak is sacred, and the spirits were supposedly angered enough to unleash tremors of a 6.0 magnitude. The woman has been arrested along with three men and her lawyer has requested they are held separately amid fears for their safety. It‚Äôs not the first time that women ‚Äì who, along with children, are more likely to die as a result of natural disasters than men ‚Äì have been blamed for earthquakes. In 2010, a prayer leader in Tehran put Iran‚Äôs seismic activity down to the way women dress. ‚ÄúWhen promiscuity spreads, earthquakes increase,‚Äù he warned. It is worth noting that, to date, no straight white man has ever been blamed for a natural disaster. Apart from God. In the aftermath of a disaster, it can sometimes seem as if the hunt for a culprit is happening at the same time as the hunt for survivors. And way ahead of the cleanup. When Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans ‚Äì killing 1,800 people and submerging 80% of the city ‚Äì it wasn‚Äôt long before political and religious leaders started finger-pointing. An ultra-orthodox rabbi called it ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs punishment for Bush‚Äôs support of the 2005 withdrawal of Jewish settlers from the Gaza strip‚Äù. Rightwing pastor Pat Robertson held legalised abortion to blame for Katrina, others said the same because the swirls on the satellite map of the hurricane resembled an image of a foetus. Meanwhile, a Northen Irish DUP politician put one of America‚Äôs five worst hurricanes in history down to a gay street festival due to take place in New Orleans when Katrina hit. Despite being deemed ‚Äúunnatural‚Äù by those who hold them responsible, in the blame game otherwise known as divine retribution, it‚Äôs gay people who seem to wield the most power over natural disasters. Indeed, it‚Äôs hard to find a natural disaster that hasn‚Äôt been attributed to the LGBT community and, increasingly, their right to marry each other. Last year, Ukip councillor David Silvester (not Sylvester, sadly) said David Cameron had acted ‚Äúarrogantly against the Gospel‚Äù in supporting same-sex unions and that ‚Äúit is his fault that large swaths of the nation have been afflicted by storms and floods‚Äù. Fortunately, the aftermath of this manmade disaster was a deluge of mockery, with Nicholas Pegg‚Äôs spoof Radio 4 Ukip shipping forecast warning of ‚Äúrain, moderate, or gay‚Äù and ‚Äúhomophobic outburst, back-pedalling westerly and becoming untenable‚Äù. Which you might call the most fitting example of divine retribution of all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-10T15:14:38Z,world,World news,Bilderberg,"The clock has struck midnight. The dream is over. Back at the G7 summit, barely a day and 20 miles from here, I was treated like a prince. I was one of the chosen 3,000 journalists who were primped, pampered, fed and burped, given free T-shirts, gallons of goulash, buckets of booze, and all the cheesy footage of world leaders we could swallow. We lay back on our branded beanbags and were tickled silly by the gentle fist of the G7 PR machine. But not any more. The beanbag has burst. ‚ÄúStep out of the vehicle and show me your identification!‚Äù A group of Austrian police officers took up position round my car. I pulled on the handbrake and opened the door. I swear to God one young officer shifted his hand to the butt of his sidearm, like I was about to rush them. All 12 of them. All armed. Maybe if there had only been 10 I might have taken them down using a slingshot improvised from my shoelaces, but not 12. I might be crazy but I‚Äôm not nuts. Bear in mind, this checkpoint is all part of the same security operation, using the same police, that covered the G7. That much was admitted months ago by the Austrian authorities. It‚Äôs the exact same government-run operation that found room in its half-billion--or-so-euro budget to set up an air-conditioned accreditation centre in Garmisch and hand out branded lanyards and glossy press passes to journalists who had been duly checked out. But for some reason they can‚Äôt quite manage to do the same thing here.
Don‚Äôt worry, there‚Äôs enough money sloshing about to pay for the same military-grade security; the same military helicopters are circling the same skies around a slightly different alp. There‚Äôs a military radar station not 100 yards down from my hotel room. The beaming owner of a local schnitzel house told us how happy he was because all his 20 rooms had been filled with military personnel. That‚Äôs right: Bilderberg has its own military radar station. It has its own no-fly zone. Nothing gets near it: there are police, right this minute, up on the surrounding mountaintops stopping hang gliders from getting airborne. Presumably to avoid them being shot down by the itchy security detail of the secretary-general of Nato. The security operation is even using the same officers: policemen who two days ago had been making sure I had enough water on my protest walk and offering me a lift down the hill in their van are now searching my car and staring at me like I‚Äôm Jack the Ripper. I completely understand the need to accredit us, but why isn‚Äôt that being done once, and done properly? They managed it in Garmisch, why not in Telfs? After all, we‚Äôve got the head of Nato here, meeting for three days with the German defence minister (and her deputy), three european prime ministers, the president of Austria and the CEO of Europe‚Äôs second largest arms company. They‚Äôll be thrashing out policy on terrorism and Russia. You think they shouldn‚Äôt expect journalists to be here covering this? The Bilderberg summit gets state security, but there‚Äôs no quid pro quo. No state-run press centre. Media organisations, or at least the few that aren‚Äôt owned by the people inside the conference, need to start making a fuss. We need to be the ones doing the harassing for a change. At one point, in my umpteenth roadside check, I turned round to see an officer taking my picture on his phone. I trotted over and gave him a card with my email address. ‚ÄúDo you mind sending me that photo? Just so I can remember this moment.‚Äù He mumbled something about not taking one, so I got my own camera out. ‚ÄúNo photographs! You must not take pictures of police.‚Äù No, no, I assured him. Not my intention at all. I handed him the camera. ‚ÄúCould you take one of me?‚Äù A bit confused, he obliged ‚Äì and promptly took one of me and his colleague. I wonder if he‚Äôll be charged under anti-terror legislation and thrown into jail for seven days for taking a photo of a policeman, because that‚Äôs what journalists here have been told. Back in Garmisch, the same cops being paid from the same budget were posing for photographers with heart shapes on their uniforms to show how loving and caring they are. Anti-terror legislation is a wonderfully flexible thing.
A friend of mine, a Swiss journalist who has been covering Bilderberg for longer than most, found himself surrounded by police in the supermarket car park as he finished his shopping. Another tired old ‚Äúshow me your papers‚Äù routine began. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve checked me out a dozen times already,‚Äù he grumbled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be here all week, I don‚Äôt want to be checked every five minutes.‚Äù The lieutenant in charge of the checking shrugged: ‚ÄúWe can check you as many times as we want. Open your car please.‚Äù My Swiss friend stood his ground: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you need probable cause?‚Äù The lieutenant shook his head and smiled: ‚ÄúNo, we don‚Äôt.‚Äù I remember at the Watford conference in 2013, we had a relationship with the Hertfordshire constabulary that was every bit as open and tolerant as Will Smith‚Äôs marriage. In fact, our presence wasn‚Äôt just tolerated, it was actively supported. They had a team of liaison officers. They even gave us portable toilets, for goodness sake. The same in Copenhagen last year: the cops allowed us right up to the edge of the hotel. They made a genuine (if not always successful) effort to communicate with us, and meet our needs. Needs which are pretty simple: we just want to try and report on the conference as a news event. An event worthy of attention. It certainly gets enough attention from the police, military and intelligence services. All it needs now is a half a dozen toilet cubicles, a press hut and a laser printer. We can even recycle the G7 lanyards. We‚Äôre not fussy. We just want to be treated like journalists. It‚Äôs extremely simple, but really rather important. And speaking of being simple but important, George Osborne will arrive at the Bilderberg summit tomorrow in his official capacity as chancellor of the exchequer. What Osborne perhaps doesn‚Äôt realise yet is that he‚Äôs about to land in the middle of an extremely serious Bilderberg-based news story. One word, George.

2015-06-10T14:30:45Z,world,World news,Paraguay under pressure to ensure health of pregnant 10-year-old,"Paraguay‚Äôs government has been advised to take ‚Äúprecautionary measures‚Äù to ensure the health of a 10-year-old girl who is pregnant after allegedly being raped by her stepfather. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights recommended an intervention with a report suggesting the girl ‚Äì known only as Mainumby ‚Äì is four times more likely to die from childbirth than an adult woman. Although it did not use the word ‚Äúabortion‚Äù, the commission‚Äôs declaration adds to the growing pressure on the authorities in this predominantly Catholic country to allow the girl to terminate the pregnancy.
Paraguayan law prohibits abortions except in cases where the mother‚Äôs life is in immediate danger, and health authorities in the country have refused to terminate the girl‚Äôs pregnancy. But doctors and women‚Äôs rights activists have argued that potential hazards for very young mothers are considerable ‚Äì a risk that is clearly spelled out in the IACHR‚Äôs report. The commission, which is a body within the Organisation of American States, warned that giving birth at such a young age could violate the right to life of Mainumby, as well as threatening her physical and psychological wellbeing. Citing earlier studies, it noted that the girl is already suffering from malnutrition and anaemia and now faces a 60% higher risk than normal of post-natal bleeding as well as eclampsia, infections and damage to her reproductive system. Mainumby‚Äôs case has prompted a national debate in Paraguay about abortion and the prevalence of underage childbirth. There is also a growing international clamour for the authorities to do more to protect the child. Last month, United Nations human rights officials said the government is wrong to deny the option of a ‚Äúsafe and therapeutic abortion‚Äù. The global online campaigning organisation Avaaz has collected half a million signatures in a petition calling for the decriminalisation of abortion for women under 15 years of age. Several NGOs, including Amnesty and Equality Now, have issued appeals for Mainumby to be allowed an abortion. ‚ÄúThe government of Paraguay has disregarded the outcry of voices around the world calling for potentially life-saving care for this young rape survivor. It must not ignore the orders of the Inter-American Commission,‚Äù said Lilian Sep√∫lveda, vice-president of the Global Legal Program at the Center for Reproductive Rights. ‚ÄúDenying a young girl essential medical care is nothing short of cruel and inhumane treatment, and a gross violation of her fundamental human rights.‚Äù
But medical authorities in Paraguay insist the girl will have to give birth unless there are complications that put her life at risk. Now five months into the pregnancy, local doctors say a premature cesarean birth is under consideration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-10T12:48:47Z,world,World news,Suu Kyi touches down as China rejects calls to release its own Nobel laureate,"Nobel peace prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi arrived in Beijing on Wednesday as China rejected calls to release its own laureate, the jailed writer Liu Xiaobo, from prison. Beijing has released few details of the Burmese opposition leader‚Äôs five-day visit ‚Äì her first to China ‚Äì although officials from her National League for Democracy (NLD) party have said she will meet Xi Jinping, the president, and Li Keqiang, the prime minister. ‚ÄúThe upcoming trip reflects a common wish of the two nations to improve ties,‚Äù Xinhua, China‚Äôs official news agency, said in an editorial published on the eve of her arrival. The visit proved the Communist party was ready to engage with any political party as long as they were ‚Äúwilling to promote the sound development of relations with China‚Äù. For China, the visit represents an important chance to interact with a woman likely to play a pivotal role in its neighbour‚Äôs political future. Burma should hold its most free election in decades in November and, while Aung San Suu Kyi is banned from becoming president, candidates from her party are expected to do well. ‚ÄúThe sorts of multibillion dollar investments that China has made over the last few years indicate to me that China is in Myanmar [Burma] for the very long haul and sees the country as one of the really key parts of its broader jigsaw puzzle,‚Äù said Nicholas Farrelly, a south-east Asia expert from the Australian National University. ‚ÄúEverywhere you go you can find a Chinese road, or bridge or dam.‚Äù Sean Turnell, an expert in Burma‚Äôs economy from Macquarie University in Sydney, said that for Aung San Suu Kyi, who turns 70 this month, the visit was an opportunity to reassure Beijing that it would be able to work with her and her party. ‚ÄúI think she would be anxious to get across the message that she is willing to be a friend of China and that there is nothing for them to fear from her coming to prominence or even becoming president at some point.‚Äù Chinese state media have heralded the trip as a chance to reboot relations between Beijing and Rangoon. Tensions have frayed in recent months because of the spillover of deadly fighting between Burmese rebels and government forces into south-west China. ‚ÄúChina welcomes anyone with friendly intentions and it bears no grudge for past unpleasantness,‚Äù Xinhua‚Äôs editorial said. However, Aung San Suu Kyi‚Äôs status as one of the world‚Äôs most revered pro-democracy campaigners means her presence on Chinese soil is sensitive. Hu Jia, an outspoken Chinese activist, urged the Burmese politician, who received the Nobel peace prize in 1991, to speak against the imprisonment of Liu Xiaobo, the writer who was awarded the same prize in 2010, after being jailed for calling for democratic reform. ‚ÄúIt is her moral duty. I would certainly do so if I were her,‚Äù Hu told the Guardian. ‚ÄúShe will not be arrested or silenced. On the contrary, the action would win her praise and support.‚Äù Beijing rejected those calls to free Liu as the Burmese opposition leader flew into the Chinese capital. ‚ÄúThere is no reason to alter the judgment made in accordance with the law by China‚Äôs judicial organs,‚Äù Hong Lei, a spokesperson for the foreign affairs ministry, told reporters. Farrelly said it was unrealistic to expect a ‚Äúpragmatic and astute‚Äù Aung San Suu Kyi to criticise her hosts. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a politician. The sooner we all start appreciating [her] as a political figure, I think the better it will be for everybody, including for her and for her team,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShe will probably take flak wherever she goes, whatever she says, whatever she does. Her appreciation, as far as I can tell, is that to win the election in 2015 and to set her National League for Democracy up for period in government is going to require them to do some things differently.‚Äù Turnell said the Burmese opposition leader might not publicly criticise her hosts but that did not mean she was oblivious to such concerns. ‚ÄúI think she would hold the idea that a truly democratic Burma ‚Äì if that is what it is to become after the next elections ‚Äì might hold out some lessons for China.‚Äù Additional reporting by Luna Lin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-10T12:21:22Z,world,World news,'It's a political failure': how Sweden's celebrated schools system fell into crisis,"Gustav Fridolin, Sweden‚Äôs rather youthful education minister, emerges from behind his desk in a pleasant office in central Stockholm wearing what looks like a pair of Vans and the open, fresh-faced smile of a newly qualified teacher. The smile falters when he begins to describe the plight of Sweden‚Äôs schools and the scale of the challenge that lies ahead. Fridolin, it turns out, is the man in charge of rescuing a school system in crisis. Sweden, once regarded as a byword for high-quality education ‚Äì free preschool, formal school at seven, no fee-paying private schools, no selection ‚Äì has seen its scores in Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) assessments plummet in recent years. Fridolin acknowledges the sense of shame and embarrassment felt in Sweden. ‚ÄúThe problem is that this embarrassment is carried by the teachers. But this embarrassment should be carried by us politicians. We were the ones who created the system. It‚Äôs a political failure,‚Äù he says.
Observers in the UK may well be vexed upon reading about Sweden‚Äôs problems, since its friskolor policy ‚Äì privately run schools funded by public money ‚Äì was one of the key inspirations behind the introduction of free schools in England under the coalition government.
Prior to the 2010 election, Tory politicians including Michael Gove, who went on to become education secretary, visited Sweden to see the free-school revolution in action. ‚ÄúIf we had Swedish-style reforms there is every reason to believe that we would have up to 3,000 new schools, all of them high quality and with an independent ethos,‚Äù Gove enthused in 2008. ‚ÄúThe example of Sweden shows that it is not a distant utopia, it is a deliverable reform.‚Äù And so it came to pass. Under the coalition government, 254 free schools opened, and the new Tory administration is promising 500 more in the coming parliament. Pisa is the modern measure of a nation‚Äôs educational success and between 2000 and 2012 Sweden‚Äôs Pisa scores dropped more sharply than those of any other participating country, from close to average to significantly below average. In the most recent Pisa assessment, in 2012, Sweden‚Äôs 15-year-olds ranked 28th out of 34 OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries in maths, and 27th in both reading and science, significantly below their Nordic neighbours. Morale among teachers is low, there are concerns about unqualified teaching staff, discipline in some schools is poor and according to a damning report published by the OECD last month, the system is in need of ‚Äúurgent change‚Äù.
Fridolin, who has a degree in teaching, says not only have scores in international tests gone down, inequality in the Swedish system has gone up. ‚ÄúThis used to be the great success story of the Swedish system,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe could offer every child, regardless of their background, a really good education. The parents‚Äô educational background is showing more and more in their grades. ‚ÄúInstead of breaking up social differences and class differences in the education system, we have a system today that‚Äôs creating a wider gap between the ones that have and the ones that have not.‚Äù
Sweden‚Äôs decline follows a raft of changes in the late 1980s and early 1990s that transformed the educational landscape. A system that had been largely centralised was devolved to municipalities, teacher training was changed, exams and grades changed, and a voucher system was introduced giving parents the power to choose which school to send their child to. Each child was funded by the state, and if the child chose to go do a different school, the money would follow. Since then, almost 800 publicly funded private schools ‚Äì or free schools ‚Äì have been set up across Sweden, many of them by companies who are allowed to make a profit. In England, the education secretary, Nicky Morgan, has ruled out allowing free schools to be run for profit. This is one of key concerns in the current education debate in Sweden.
Critics on the left in Sweden blame the voucher system for declining results, saying it has opened the door for schools more interested in making a profit than providing education. Conservatives who support free choice say students have been given too much influence in the classroom, undermining the authority of teachers. Fridolin‚Äôs line is that it was not one single change that caused the problems, but a combination that helped create a ‚Äúfragmentary school system‚Äù which lacked steering and sowed the seeds for growing inequality. ‚ÄúThe school system is not a market where everyone has the same possibilities and the same information. It becomes that some parents, the educated parents with strong resources, use the possibility to choose schools.‚Äù His government‚Äôs aim, he says, is to make sure that public money spent in schools stays in schools. But it will not be easy. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a genie-in-the-bottle situation. How do we change a system that has gone on so long in allowing quite big profit in schools?‚Äù Fridolin has a fight on his hands. On the opposing side is Barbara Bergstr√∂m, founder and chair of Internationella Engelska Skolan (IES), one of the largest providers of free schools in Sweden. IES currently educates 20,000 pupils in 30 schools across Sweden. Its success is such that a further 94,000 children are on its waiting lists, some as young as three weeks have their names down for a place.
We meet in the polished corridors of the first IES school to open, in Enskede, a suburb of Stockholm. It‚Äôs almost the end of term and many of the children are going to visit museums around the city. The school is orderly, the pupils courteous ‚Äì the regime is stricter than in many of Sweden‚Äôs state schools ‚Äì and results are strong, exceeding those of neighbouring municipal schools. ‚ÄúThis is more organised than my last school,‚Äù says one 12-year-old girl. ‚ÄúIt was all relaxing on the table there.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn my last school they were really messy,‚Äù says her friend. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt really listen to the teachers. Here it‚Äôs more respectful.‚Äù When Gove visited this school he liked what he saw, and when Bergstr√∂m met him in London later he asked her: ‚ÄúHow many schools are you going to open in the UK? A hundred, 200?‚Äù In fact IES has opened just one, IES Breckland, in Brandon, Suffolk, which was placed in special measures by Ofsted but is now making ‚Äúreasonable progress‚Äù. Bergstr√∂m, a former science teacher from Buffalo, New York, says there will be no more schools in England for the time being. She has had meetings with Fridolin. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an awful lot of rhetoric about for-profit companies. If we were not for profit we would not be where were we are today. There‚Äôs no way we would be able to do what we are doing in our schools without the security of a solid financial base.‚Äù Ulla Hamilton, chief executive of the Swedish Association for Independent Schools, agrees. ‚ÄúThe market is working,‚Äù she says. The theory is that competition forces flagging schools to up their game. She says the decline in Sweden‚Äôs schools has nothing to do with the introduction of free choice or the emergence of independent schools. Hamilton quotes research by the IFAU, the Swedish Institute for Evaluation of Labour Market and Education Policy, which suggests that results had started to drop even before the changes. ‚ÄúThe free schools are not the cause,‚Äù she says. But as the postmortem continues into what has gone wrong in Sweden‚Äôs education system, the free school movement is faltering. Because of the uncertainty about the future, fewer companies are coming forward to open new schools, banks are afraid to provide loans, and the numbers being approved to set up schools is going down. Meanwhile, waiting lists for places in many of Sweden‚Äôs independent schools are going up. Like Bergstr√∂m, Hamilton is in favour of profit. ‚ÄúYou need to be able to make a margin otherwise people will not be interested in setting up,‚Äù she says. She adds that the payback for shareholders is tiny compared with public preconceptions. There are no profits at Frejaskolan, a state school in Gnesta, just south of Stockholm. There‚Äôs a happy, informal atmosphere (uniforms are unheard of in Sweden, in any school) but in the last two years a small number of parents have chosen to take their children out and put them in an independent school 25 miles away. ‚ÄúThe parents know about the school,‚Äù says one of the teachers. ‚ÄúIt stands up quite well. There‚Äôs good marketing. When they go, we lose the money we get from the state. I‚Äôm a parent myself and I‚Äôm a little bit worried. ‚ÄúMy youngest is 10 years old. Will she have teachers who are really qualified? We don‚Äôt really know how it will be.‚Äù The Guardian asked Andreas Schleicher, the OECD‚Äôs director for education and skills, what lessons the UK might learn from the Swedish experience. He said: ‚ÄúWhen establishing school autonomy and choice, the Swedish system did not strengthen oversight and intervention functions (which were traditionally weak in Sweden). So the system had no means to learn from successful schools and scale their success, and it had no means to detect and address educational underperformance. ‚ÄúI think the UK needs to watch out for that as well, unless it is willing and able to upscale Ofsted by dimensions. Successful school systems are more than a collection of independent schools.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-10T10:39:07Z,world,World news,Life in Mosul one year on: 'Isis with all its brutality is more honest than the Shia government',"Dr Firas Ghalib Neurologist, 45, father of two children Mosul was on a volcano‚Äôs edge a couple of months before Islamic State‚Äôs militants crawled into the city. The Shia government in Baghdad always viewed Mosul as a hub of Ba‚Äôathists, undoubtedly because most senior army officers in the time of Saddam were from Mosul.
When Isis took control of Mosul, they treated locals decently, clearing out all checkpoints imposed by the army and opening roads. People could not believe their eyes that there was no Shia army in the city, no more detainees and bribes. I was in a mosque attending Friday prayers when the Isis imam said: ‚ÄúAfter prayers you all have to pledge your allegiance to Caliph al-Baghdadi, your emir.‚Äù I and many men wanted to flee to avoid pledging allegiance but we were stopped by militants who were guarding the mosque. The imam started to recite the pledge and we had to repeat after him: ‚ÄúWe pledge our allegiance to the emir, that we would obey him and not rise up against him.‚Äù The second Friday, the imam said: ‚ÄúCaliph al-Baghdadi has set a deadline for Christians in Mosul to withdraw by Saturday afternoon. We asked their priests to come and discuss the tax they should pay to us, and they declined.‚Äù One of my Christian friends was a doctor and churchgoer. I asked him: ‚ÄúWhy did your priests not go to the meeting with Isis?‚Äù He replied: ‚ÄúOur priests had a terrible experience with Isis in Syria. Two priests went to negotiate with them in Aleppo and they never came back. Quite simply, there is no trust.‚Äù Christians were given three choices: either convert to Islam or flee Mosul or get killed. My Christian friend told me that many Christian families in Hay al-Baker in Mosul converted to Islam because they were poor and could not afford to flee to Irbil.
The hospitals began to bleed doctors who were not able to cope with the unusual situation, especially female doctors and nurses who had to wear a veil all the time. My hospital was also full of Isis militants who were monitoring all the wards and medical staff. The hospital began to run out of anaesthetics, which we were using primarily for Isis militants who get wounded during the battles. Some of the cleaners in the hospitals engaged with Isis to gain some authority, warning doctors who were not obeying the rules. One would shout that he would ‚Äúsmash your head with my shoes‚Äù if a doctor was late. All female dentists were prohibited from treating men and vice versa. I used to receive both sexes in hospital and my private clinic, but I was haunted by the nightmares of being lashed in public. I wrote a note and hung it on the door saying: ‚ÄúI examine men only.‚Äù Isis monitors in the hospital told me that being the only neurologist in the hospital, I was allowed to examine both sexes. I refused and insisted on getting a fatwa that guaranteed I would not be lashed. I was told there was no such fatwa. A few of my old female patients were begging me to examine them, but I apologised. I can‚Äôt forget when the only female anaesthetist in the hospital quit her job and we had women who needed caesarean operations, and we asked for the help of another hospital who sent us one of their male anaesthetists to save the lives of the patients. When the male anesthetist reached the hospital, the Isis monitor denied him access for being male. Two women died that night. I know a professor at Mosul University who was caught by the Isis hisbah (religious police) in a room with his female colleague correcting students‚Äô final exams notes. The penalty was that he had to marry his female colleague or get 30 lashes. The professor refused as he already had a wife and children, and he accepted the lashes. I was with my wife in the car driving towards my parents house, and my wife had to take off her veil to breastfeed our little baby. The veil was keeping the blowing air off the baby, who was also terrified of her mother‚Äôs face being covered. Not that long after, an Isis hisbah patrol saw me and maintained that my wife should wear the veil under whatever circumstances, otherwise I would be in trouble. I left Mosul with my wife and two children recently and went to Irbil. Basheer Aziz College graduate, 26, supports Isis Mosul before Isis was like a grand, horrifying prison. It was a daily bet, who could make it to the first lecture in the morning, considering the long journey to the College of Sciences in Mosul, which was almost like travelling to another province. The bus had to stop by countless army checkpoints where there were feverish hunts for men‚Äôs IDs. Often, the whole bus would wait for an hour or two while a soldier was engaged in beating a passenger who happened to be not holding his ID. Islamic State is the dream and utmost desire of any Muslim. We longed to be governed by the holy Qur‚Äôan‚Äôs rules and the prophet Muhammad‚Äôs sunnah. Now, with any call to prayer, all shops are shut down. Men have to grow their beards. Any act of adultery will be dealt with either by stones or lashes. The penalty of looting is a hand cut and men are imprisoned for publicly harassing women. Then Isis diwans (departments for health, complaints, preaching and mosques, education, almsgiving, hisbah and services) were established. The almsgiving department is in charge of collecting taxes to divide among needy families. Each family receives $25 a month, an amount that will be raised to $50 with the harvest season, in addition to a good portion of wheat, rice, sugar, pickles, food oil and fuels. The health department runs all hospitals in Mosul, Raqqa and Anbar and divides military medical staff and treatment among all fighting zones. Isis does not hire any doctor if he does not pledge his allegiance to Islamic State and never sends doctors to other provinces if they prefer to stay in their towns. Recently, an exclusive market for women was opened in Mosul to allow them to do their shopping at ease. There is no ban on women driving. The Isis municipality is doing its best to keep roads clean and paved, setting up lampposts, providing water and power and repairing the damage from coalition air strikes. I feel so proud being part of Isis, it granted me freedom. We live in glory now except for the coalition air strikes that spread panic and fear among the civilians. I disagree with Isis practices against Christians, Yazidis and other minorities in Mosul. I‚Äôm still in touch with our Christian neighbours and wish they would come back shortly. All people in Mosul are in disagreement with the demolition of ancient sites in Mosul, and some Isis militants are not happy either. I discussed that with some of the young men of Mosul who joined Isis, and they said: ‚ÄúWe did not know where these orders were coming from, the sharia court in Mosul was in astonishment too.‚Äù Amazingly enough, they told me that Isis is on its way to set up an archaeology department to excavate ancient sites in Mosul.
There is an acute financial crisis in Mosul now due to lack of jobs. Only those who receive monthly salaries from the government in Baghdad are surviving in Mosul. People do not know if Isis will last forever, or if another military organisation will come and exact revenge on those who were working for Isis. Depression is widespread among people of Mosul now. At the same time, most of the people are against the return of the corrupt politicians or Shia militias who will destroy the city, not liberate it as they claim. Isis with all its brutality is more honest and merciful than the Shia government in Baghdad and its militias. Shaima Yousif Widow and mother of four, 33, whose hand was chopped off for stealing
I did not have that much freedom to determine the pattern of my own life, coming from a middle-class family in one of the oldest districts in Mosul that is packed with people living in shabby little houses. My father, who had a grocery store in the neighbourhood where we used to live, thought school was good for my brother, Yasser, but not for me or my two sisters. ‚ÄúIt is a waste of time and money,‚Äù my father told me once. I was hardly permitted to complete my primary school education, as my father was impatient to have me at home helping my mother with housework. A relative who used to work in a store for car repairs in Mosul city came to ask for my hand. The moment my eyes fell on him, I felt I could not live with such a man who looked almost like my father, being 10 years older than me. He seemed tough, rigid and uneducated. Simply speaking, he was not the man of my dreams. I told my father: ‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôm not in a hurry to get married.‚Äù My father‚Äôs response was: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in a hurry, you are 18 now. I prefer you marry a man I get to know with a good income.‚Äù Last June, Isis took over Mosul and dominated the scene in the city. I advised Kareem, my husband, to leave his job and for us to flee together to Turkey. He was nearly convinced, but learned that he would be murdered soon if he did not assist Isis in repairing damaged vehicles left by the Iraqi army to use in their military operations. I will never forget the day when my husband rushed out early in the morning to a deserted military camp in the suburbs of Mosul to fix damaged military equipment belonging to Isis. He was killed by an air strike. Isis men kept coming to my husband‚Äôs parents‚Äô house during the funeral in a pickup loaded with food for us and for the mourners. They also brought $300 in cash for the kids with a promise to keep sending $100 a month as a pension.
I struggled to cope with my children‚Äôs daily demands. I sold my daughter‚Äôs bracelets at the jewellery shop, and went back the next day and slipped on a ring and walked out, hoping the owner would not recognise me with all the women wearing the veil. I walked out of the shop but the owner stopped me, and a woman from the Isis female security forces took me to their centre. ‚ÄúWhy did you steal the ring?‚Äù an Isis interrogator asked me. I answered in tears, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a widow of an Isis martyr with four children. I needed money to feed my children and pay the rent. Please forgive me.‚Äù I was questioned by two judges. The second day after my last hearing, I was taken from my room by three Isis women to another room where an old man was standing. He said: ‚ÄúTie her to the table.‚Äù I was tied firmly, and another man came with a sword in his hand. When I saw him, I began to shout, ‚ÄúMercy, have mercy on me.‚Äù I screamed and begged him to leave me alone. He looked so determined. I wanted to run away but couldn‚Äôt. I couldn‚Äôt believe the whole scene, and thought it was a nightmare. The man did not hesitate before chopping my left hand at the wrist. The whole world turned into black in my eyes and my legs were numb. No words in humanity‚Äôs dictionary can describe my pain and feeling at that horrifying moment. I fainted immediately. My eldest daughter wept all the time whenever her eyes met mine in the hospital. I was discharged and went home. I tried to commit suicide a few times by strangling myself but the image of my little children kept stopping me. I live now for them and have vowed to make sure they all finish their education and marry only the men they love. Ghazwan Abdul Rahman High school graduate, 19, supports Isis I was chatting with my friend about college when all of a sudden I received a hell of a push on my back. A towering man in Isis clothing was pushing aside any man obstructing his way towards the owner of the bakery. ‚ÄúI want some bread now, I can‚Äôt wait and need to go back to my other fighter brothers,‚Äù he said. But the owner told him to join the queue like the others. The argument heated up and the Isis fighter lost his patience, and directed a kick to the face of the owner, filled his bag with bread and dashed away after leaving some money on the table. We were all in an absolute silence watching without being able to say a word or do anything. The owner was bleeding from his nose. Two or three men ran to help and stop the bleeding while the owner vowed that he would complain to the sharia court. After two days, Isis police from the sharia court were in the bakery asking witnesses if the fighter or the owner provoked the situation and attacked first. All the men in the bakery confirmed that the fighter was the offender and the owner was merely trying to be fair and keep customers in queue. The sharia court verdict was in favour of the bakery owner and the Isis fighter had to apologise to him publicly. Then he was kicked out of the caliphate for his uncivilised behaviour. Isis succeeded in winning people‚Äôs hearts in Mosul from the first day they liberated the city for being modest, unprejudiced and cooperative. They restored the dignity and pride of the Sunni man in Mosul after enduring a great deal of humiliation and revenge under successive Shia governments since the US occupation of Iraq. Corruption was widespread and eroding all the city facilities, which were like a huge military barracks suffocating people. The city did not witness any reconstruction for the entire last 10 years despite all the billions that were poured into the city council.
Mosul now lives in a golden era. Though world media is in an effortless campaign to mar the image of Isis fighters, show them as brutal terrorists and monsters, on the contrary they are most welcomed in Mosul for the great sacrifices they have offered to protect Sunni people from the Shia army‚Äôs inhuman practices in Mosul and other Sunni provinces in Iraq. Isis locals and foreign fighters deserve all the love and respect by people in Mosul. Why is it all right for Shia militias in Iraq to have Lebanese, Iranian and Afghan fighters while it is unacceptable for us to have foreign fighters to defend us? Foreign fighters have integrated excellently within the Mosul community now, and have become a fundamental part of some families in Mosul. Lots of tribes in Mosul whose men joined the Isis army last year have accepted marriage offers by some foreign fighters as they prove to be most reliable and courageous. They are utterly untrue, all these stories about forced marriage by Isis foreign fighters to women in Mosul. None of the people in Mosul who pledged their allegiance to Caliph al-Baghdadi want Shia militias to get close to Mosul. I would be the first to fight these militias who come to sow destruction and killing among Sunnis. We have seen their atrocities in Tikrit and Jurf al-Sakher against isolated civilians. Mosul is more stable and safe now, my father can leave his shop open and go for prayers, and no one dares to steal a straw from the shop. Civil services are better now, like power and water, and roads are more clean. I spend most of my free time praying in mosques and attending courses in Islamic sharia and hadith. Hashim Zakei 33, heavy smoker whose hand was cut off for stealing cigarettes The unavoidable three-year military service was the inevitable future for any confused student like me. I became more interested in learning cooking skills than military fitness and training. Serving officers and soldiers at least three meals a day, I was in the kitchen section all the time. Furthermore, I picked up a really dreadful habit, smoking heavily. After serving in the army, I purchased a wooden cart to sell hummus and bread. I was busy selling sandwiches to students after an extended school day when a hisbah patrol parked by my cart, checking everyone in the street including me. ‚ÄúSir, I have nothing to hide, why are you searching me?‚Äù I asked. The man held the cigarette packet in his hand, and asked, ‚ÄúWhat about this?‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I bought it for my old dad. As you know he is old, trying his best to quit.‚Äù On another day, I was busy setting up my cart with 10 cigarettes in my pocket, when a hisbah patrol came again to check the area. Tobacco smuggling in the city never stopped after the Isis takeover. One morning, I saw a vendor selling men socks on the floor, hiding cigarette packs underneath. The vendor began to run as soon as he saw a hisbah patrol coming towards him. Some of the men picked cigarettes out of the socks, others were firing in the direction of the fleeing vendor. I looked at the cigarette packs dispersed on the floor. I could not restrain myself from picking up five of them to put in my pockets. Within five minutes, hisbah militants were rounding me up as the intelligence man who spotted me was briefing them that I had stolen some of the cigarettes from the vendors. I was taken to sharia court. After a few questions, the judge said to me: ‚ÄúYou are a thief, the court decided to cut your right hand by the wrist.‚Äù Before the judge would complete his words, I felt like being hit by an electric shock all over my body. I began to cry out with terror, begging the judge for mercy, that I have a family. The judge said: ‚ÄúIslamic sharia rules are beyond any discussion.‚Äù After three days I was taken by hisbah militants to a public park. My feet were tied to a wooden table as well as my left hand. An Isis man who was in a white Afghan dress holding a big sword said to me: ‚ÄúDo you want anything?‚Äù I said: ‚ÄúMercy.‚Äù He said: ‚ÄúAnything else?‚Äù I said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the only breadwinner for my kids, please forgive me.‚Äù His answer was: ‚ÄúYou shut up.‚Äù Immediately afterwards he turned fast to cut my hand and severed it off my arm. I was bleeding heavily. Once my eye fell on my chopped hand, I fainted. When I regained consciousness, I found myself in an Isis hospital with Iraqi doctors. When I got home, my father received me weeping and said: ‚ÄúThank God, it was only your hand.‚Äù All names of interviewees are pseudonyms.

2015-06-10T10:23:25Z,world,World news,Vatican bank agrees to open its books to US tax authorities,"The Vatican bank will automatically report information about American holders of its accounts to US tax authorities under an agreement signed on Wednesday that the American ambassador to the Holy See said was a ‚Äúvery significant step‚Äù to combating tax evasion. The agreement ‚Äì the first inter-governmental deal between the Vatican and the US ‚Äì was hailed as a ‚Äútype of stamp of approval‚Äù of the Vatican bank‚Äôs efforts to be more transparent, said the US ambassador, Kenneth Hackett. The bank, which is formally known as the Institute for Works of Religion, has been dogged for years by accusations that it has helped launder money for rich Italians, among others, who were seeking to evade taxes and carry out other illicit activity. It began a clean-up process at the end of Pope Benedict‚Äôs tenure, following intense pressure by the Bank of Italy, which essentially sought to cut the bank off from working with other banks in Italy if it did not change its ways and adopt internationally recognised anti-money laundering regulations. Pope Francis has also put financial reform at the top of his agenda, and the bank has spent millions of euros on consultants, including US advisory firm Promontory Financial Group, in its effort to implement a modern compliance programme and weed out problematic accounts. Under the terms of Wednesday‚Äôs agreement, the Vatican will be party to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act in the US, which was passed in 2010 to target non-compliance with US tax obligations. Under US law, American citizens who live abroad or have foreign bank accounts are required to report those accounts to the Internal Revenue Service. In a signing ceremony at the Vatican, Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher, secretary for relations at the Holy See, emphasised the importance of paying taxes as a matter of charity and justice. ‚ÄúAs Pope Francis frequently reminds us, evading just taxes is stealing both from the state and from the poor,‚Äù he said. Signing the agreement was a step in the Vatican‚Äôs long-term strategy to ‚Äúensure and promote legality, transparency and ethical behaviour in the economic and financial fields‚Äù he added. US holders of Vatican bank accounts will not be caught off guard by the new arrangement. Marji Christian, an official at the US embassy to the Holy See, said the negotiations that led to the agreement had been continuing for two years, but declined to comment on areas of contention between the parties. The US embassy would not comment on the number of Americans who hold accounts with the Vatican bank, but the figure is believed to be in the hundreds, not thousands. A spokesman for the IOR did not immediately return a request for comment. Similar agreements have been arranged between the Vatican and other countries, including Italy, though none includes automatic notification requirements. Under the Italian agreement, the Vatican must simply comply with requests for information. As part of its clean-up effort, the board of superintendence that has oversight of the Vatican bank determined in 2013 that it would restrict the kinds of clients it would accept to certain categories. Those that are acceptable include Catholic institutions, clerics, employees or former employees of the Vatican with salary and pension accounts, and embassies and diplomats accredited to the Holy See. At the end of last year, the IOR had 15,181 clients. Since 2013, it has closed nearly 5,000 accounts that were either dormant or did not comply with the new standards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-10T08:31:10Z,world,World news,Chinese feminists hold armpit hair photo contest,"Weeks after China drew global condemnation for detaining five feminists who planned to protest against sexual harassment, activists have launched a fresh campaign for gender equality ‚Äì by asking women to photograph their armpits and post the pictures online. Xiao Meili, a prominent women‚Äôs rights activist, said her online ‚Äúarmpit hair contest‚Äù was designed to fuel discussion of ‚Äúthe definition of feminine beauty‚Äù. ‚ÄúI hope to raise the issue of the ownership of female body and to dispel the belief that it is wrong for girls to keep their armpit hair,‚Äù Xiao, 25, told the Guardian. ‚ÄúKeeping armpit hair should not be seen as uncivilised or dirty ‚Äì it is nothing of the sort.‚Äù Organisers of the competition, which ends on Wednesday, have invited Chinese women to publish photos of their armpits on Weibo, China‚Äôs equivalent of Twitter. Prizes will be awarded to the top three entries. So far there have been about 40 submissions. ‚ÄúThe greater message here is about discussing the ownership of female body and challenging the stereotyping of femininity,‚Äù said Xiao. Liu Hongqiao, a 25-year-old NGO worker who was among those to upload an image of her underarm, said: ‚ÄúMy understanding is that the contest seeks to challenge people‚Äôs misconceptions about beauty and their hatred of armpit hair.
‚ÄúMy message is that it should be the girls themselves rather than anyone else who decide whether to shave their armpit hair or whether their bodies are beautiful.‚Äù For all its humour, the armpit contest comes at a troubling time for feminist activists and civil society groups as a whole in China. Xi Jinping, the Communist party‚Äôs leader since 2012, has presided over a wide-ranging crackdown against groups and individuals seen as potential opponents. Activists, academics and journalists have been targeted as have human rights lawyers such as Pu Zhiqiang, who is awaiting trial. In March, on the eve of International Women‚Äôs Day, China‚Äôs feminists found themselves targeted by Xi Jinping‚Äôs clampdown when police detained five activists who had planned to protest against domestic violence and sexual harassment. The women were released on bail after more than a month in detention but still face the threat of criminal charges. NGOs that were once tolerated or even supported by authorities appear to be facing increasing pressure from public security officials. The Beijing offices of Yirenping, a public health group, were raided after its members called for the release of the feminists. There are fears that proposals for new legislation regarding the management of foreign NGOs could force many such groups out of the country or into extinction. ‚ÄúThings are getting worse. The repression will continue and will expand,‚Äù said Eva Pils, a legal scholar and human rights expert from King‚Äôs College London. Three of the five feminists who were detained in March have sent photographs to the armpit contest. Xiao, who made headlines last year after trekking 1,200 miles across China to raise awareness of sexual violence, said activists were still reeling from recent events. The detentions had underlined ‚Äúthe changes in government‚Äôs attitude towards feminism‚Äù, she said. ‚ÄúWe need time to recover and to adjust ourselves to the new situation.‚Äù Additional reporting by Luna Lin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-10T07:00:02Z,world,World news,Palestinian Salafists pose dangerous new problem for Hamas,"There are two conflicting accounts of how Younis Hunnar, a young militant Salafist leader in Gaza, died. The official version recounted by Hamas officials, whose security forces killed Hunnar, is that the 27-year-old militant leader was caught at his house in the Sheikh Radwan area of Gaza City with weapons and a suicide vest. Called to surrender, he instead attempted to set off his bomb vest and was killed in an ‚Äúintense exchange of fire‚Äù. A family member tells a different story. In this version Hunnar, a former member of Hamas‚Äôs armed wing ‚Äì the Qassam brigades ‚Äì who left two years ago to join a new faction notionally aligned with Islamic State, was hiding at home, fearful of being jailed again. When Hamas security forces stormed his house he was wounded first, then shot with two bullets to the head. Whatever the truth about the exact circumstances of Hunnar‚Äôs death, what is certain is that it has become emblematic of resurgent tension between Gaza‚Äôs Salafists and Hamas, which governs the coastal strip. The conflict with the militant Salafists ‚Äì totalling a few hundred at most ‚Äì has led to a Hamas crackdown and, in reprisal, three rockets fired by the Salafists at Israel. This has in turn drawn air strikes in response, including against targets associated with Gaza‚Äôs ruling faction.
And it is the Salafists‚Äô successful attempts to draw a military response from Israel that has escalated the problem in recent weeks from a local rivalry marked by a series of minor bombings to something more dangerous. Violence by Gaza‚Äôs Salafists ‚Äì some now aligning themselves with Isis ‚Äì is not a new phenomenon but in the past it has been seen as a limited threat that Hamas found easy to control. The first serious confrontation occurred in 2009 when Hamas fighters stormed a mosque in the southern town of Rafah, which a group called the Warriors of God had taken over. Six of them were killed. Another crackdown followed the abduction and murder by Salafists in 2011 of Vittorio Arrigoni, an Italian activist resident in Gaza. But since the end of the last summer‚Äôs war in Gaza ‚Äì and amid growing dissatisfaction over the failure to secure any relief from Gaza‚Äôs long Israeli- and Egyptian-imposed blockade ‚Äì small militant Salafist groups have become active again. A series of bomb attacks in recent months has targeted both foreign offices and Hamas, leading to the latest Hamas crackdown, which has seen dozens of Salafists rounded up and jailed, and a Salafist-linked mosque destroyed in Deir al-Balah in May. In response, Salafist groups fired rockets at Israel in an attempt to put pressure on Hamas to release their members, a tactic that ‚Äì so far ‚Äì has singularly failed. And although many Salafists have been rounded up, others are still at large. ‚ÄúWe are different to Hamas,‚Äù a young Salafist militant, who gave the nickname of Abu Bilel, said last week.
A friend of Hunnar, he had agreed to meet the Guardian along with one of Hunnar‚Äôs cousins, who gave the name Abu Khalid. ‚ÄúHamas looks for power and money,‚Äù said Abu Bilel. ‚ÄúPeople are fed up with Hamas. We only care about religion. We don‚Äôt understand why they are arresting us.‚Äù Abu Khalid explained why his cousin left Hamas‚Äôs armed wing: ‚ÄúHe went to be with the Qassam brigades but found them to be corrupted. So two years ago he left and joined the Salafists. He was arrested many times and beaten. Before he died he was told to surrender himself but he did not want to return to jail.‚Äù Abu Bilel at first said that the Salafists had been attempting to press Hamas to release colleagues. ‚ÄúWe tried threats and some explosions but it seems it is not easy to pressure Hamas.‚Äù Later, however, he blamed the explosions on Hamas itself. He was equally vague about his own group‚Äôs announced sympathy to Isis. ‚ÄúWe are not like the Daesh,‚Äù he said, using the Arabic name for Isis. ‚ÄúWe are not interested in beheadings. We are only interested in the appeal to people to be better Muslims.‚Äù When asked about statements by the group aligning itself with Isis, he did not answer. Experts disagree over the trajectory of the latest surge in Salafist-related violence in Gaza and on how Hamas will deal with it. While the different Salafist groups seem to be small and loosely structured, lacking clear policies and leadership, some observers believe they are being sustained, to a degree, by former members who fled to the Egyptian Sinai after the last campaign against them by Hamas three years ago. Within Gaza too ‚Äì according to Abu Bilel ‚Äì they have benefited from financial backing from wealthy individuals.
One suggestion is that Hamas had been willing to tolerate limited activities by Salafist groups while they ‚Äúplayed by the rules of the game‚Äù ‚Äì rules that by any estimate have been broken by the recent rocket fire. ‚ÄúThey are personally serious,‚Äù said the Gaza analyst Omar Shaban. ‚ÄúThey are serious in how they see themselves. But are they a serious phenomenon in Gaza? I don‚Äôt believe so. Salafist groups in Iraq and Syria are serious because they are strong and face a weak enemy. Here in Gaza it is the reverse. They are weak and face a very strong enemy.‚Äô Where Shaban, however, sees a problem is in how Hamas negotiates the challenge that they pose. ‚ÄúIt is not good for Hamas to be seen fighting another Islamist group. But they are well monitored.‚Äù Usama Antar, another analyst, disagrees. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it is a question of how big they are. I think it is a question of ideology, because it is so widespread [in the Middle East]. They are people who are not interested in normal life and they have a message. The situation here in Gaza is optimal for them to spread their message with the blockade and a sense of hopelessness. It is easy for them.‚Äù What is true is that unlike other Salafist groups that have risen to prominence since the Arab spring, those in Gaza have not had the benefit of porous and chaotic borders, or the ability to access weapons and support. But what does appear to be a problem for Hamas is that a number of Salafist activists ‚Äì such as Hunnar ‚Äì are former members of Hamas, including one of the movement‚Äôs leading ideologues and preachers, Adnan Mayyat, who was recently released from jail. According to Abu Bilel ‚Äì in claims that could not be independently verified ‚Äì the rockets fired recently at Israel were originally Hamas rockets diverted by those sympathetic to the Salafists. The site of one rocket launch, say those familiar with it, was one used by Hamas during last summer‚Äôs war. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have our own rockets,‚Äù he explained, adding that members of his group had also had ‚Äúmilitary training‚Äù from former members of Hamas who had defected.
Taher al-Nounou, an adviser to the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, believes Israel‚Äôs response to the recent Salafist rocket fire has complicated the matter by allowing the Salafists to leverage the Israeli response in their favour: ‚ÄúIsrael did exactly what the Salafists wanted them to do in bombing in response to the attacks. The Salafists were looking for an escalation [to put pressure on Hamas]. ‚ÄúThe situation is also different in Gaza from places where Salafist groups have come to prominence. Palestinians are united in seeing Israel as the enemy and there is no desire among people in Gaza for more internal problems and clashes between factions. ‚ÄúIt is also the case that not everyone who believes in the Salafist ideology supports this. If you look at the map of who is Salafist here, not everyone who shares their ideology has a problem with Hamas. ‚ÄúInstead the difficulties are being driven by those who have personal problems with Hamas. Those are the people who have been behind the recent explosions. It is not political, but people with personal issues, and we know how to deal with those people.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-10T05:02:16Z,world,World news,Former Japanese PM tells Shinzo Abe to confront wartime atrocities in Asia,"The two key architects of Japan‚Äôs official wartime apologies have urged the country‚Äôs prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to confront atrocities committed on mainland Asia or risk disgracing the honour of the Japanese people. Tomiichi Murayama, who as prime minister issued an official apology to mark the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, said Abe should ‚Äúhonestly spell out‚Äù Japan‚Äôs wartime record when he releases a statement to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the Pacific war in August.
Concern is growing in Asia and the US that the nationalist leader will replace previous apologies with a ‚Äúforward-looking‚Äù statement that omits key expressions of contrition and glosses over wartime atrocities. ‚ÄúInternational society is watching what he is really thinking,‚Äù Murayama said. ‚ÄúIt is important to clear up any doubts that he has raised overseas.‚Äù Murayama‚Äôs 1995 statement included recognition that Japan had ‚Äúthrough its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations‚Äù, as well as a ‚Äúheartfelt apology‚Äù to victims of Japanese militarism. In a TV interview earlier this year, Abe suggested he would drop those key phrases, a move that would anger China and South Korea, where the scars of Japanese occupation have yet to heal. Abe has also refused to repeat an official apology to as many as 200,000 young women, most of them from the Korean peninsula, who were forced to work as sex slaves in Japanese military brothels.
Yohei Kono, who issued the original ‚Äúcomfort women‚Äù apology while chief cabinet secretary in 1993, warned that any attempt by Abe to whitewash history would damage the international reputation of the Japanese people. Appearing alongside Murayama at a press conference in Tokyo on Tuesday, Kono said it was ‚Äúvery unfortunate‚Äù that the comfort women controversy had soured relations between Japan and South Korea. He said of revisionists who claim Japan behaved no differently from other countries during the war: ‚ÄúThey reject admitting the truth; they deny the truth based on some minor detail they found, when everyone else believes it with no doubt. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre even saying, ‚ÄòEveryone else has done it, so what‚Äôs the problem?‚Äô. I deeply regret this because they don‚Äôt know how much they‚Äôre disgracing the honour of the Japanese people by doing such a thing.‚Äù The Kono and Murayama statements were welcomed by South Korea and China as evidence that Japan had come to terms with its past and wished to display genuine remorse. Abe, however, belongs to a new generation of conservative politicians who believe that Japan‚Äôs ‚Äúmasochistic‚Äù postwar culture of contrition should be replaced by a less critical assessment of its wartime actions. He and other revisionists do not deny that comfort women existed, but insist there is no evidence that they were coerced by the Japanese military. He has also questioned whether Japan‚Äôs occupation of the Korean peninsula and part of China could be described as an ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù. While Abe has said he ‚Äúupholds‚Äù the thinking behind the apologies, speculation is mounting that he will resist pressure to include the terms ‚Äòaggression‚Äô, ‚Äòcolonial rule‚Äô and ‚Äòatrocities‚Äô when his statement is released on the anniversary of Japan‚Äôs defeat on 15 August. The rising influence of the revisionist right in official Japanese views of the war has soured relations with China and South Korea. Although there have been signs of a rapprochement between Abe and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in recent months, he has not yet held bilateral talks with the South Korean president Park Geun-hye.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-10T05:00:11Z,world,World news,Putin's trip to Rome underscores Russia's special relationship with Italy,"Vladimir Putin might not have been welcome at the G7 meeting of world leaders in Germany this week, but when he touches down in Milan on Wednesday, the Russian president is likely to receive a far warmer welcome than he would in any of the other large EU countries. Putin is travelling to Italy to visit the Russian pavilion at the expo in Milan on Russia day (the Russian Federation‚Äôs national holiday) and will then head to Rome. His itinerary includes meetings with Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister, Sergio Mattarella, the Italian president, and Pope Francis, whom Putin will meet at the apostolic palace in Vatican City in late afternoon. It will be their first meeting since 2013, when Francis and the Russian leader met in St Petersburg at a G20 meeting hosted by Russia. The presidential visit underscores Russia‚Äôs cosy relationship with Italy at a time when Putin is otherwise being treated as a pariah on the world stage. Barack Obama, the US president, warned at the G7 summit this week that world leaders were prepared to tighten sanctions against Russia if the conflict in Ukraine escalated.
Putin‚Äôs affinity for Italy and his friendship with billionaire Silvio Berlusconi, the former Italian premier, are so well known that the biggest news out of a critical summit in Milan last October ‚Äì which included a meeting between Putin and Petro Poroshenko, the president of Ukraine ‚Äì was the late-night rendezvous between Putin and Berlusconi at the former premier‚Äôs villa that lasted until 3am. In March, Renzi became the first European leader to be hosted in a bilateral meeting in Moscow since Russia‚Äôs annexation of Crimea last year ‚Äì a meeting that was met with displeasure by the US, according to an American official at the time. The meeting with Renzi came only days after Boris Nemtsov, the Russian opposition politician, was murdered near the Kremlin as he was walking home. Another Italian politician, Matteo Salvini, who heads the anti-euro anti-immigrant Northern League party, has been an outspoken critic against sanctions against Russia. The Northern League has even shepherded a movement to create a parliamentary group called Friends of Putin, which has praised the Russian leader as an essential counterweight to the Obama administration. No Italians were included in the list of 89 EU citizens who were banned from entering Russia by Russian authorities, according to a list that was published by Finnish state broadcaster YLE earlier this month. It appeared to be another sign of the countries‚Äô close ties.
Giancarlo Aragona, a former Italian ambassador to Russia who heads the Italian Institute for International Political Studies thinktank, told the Guardian that Italy had maintained a dialogue with Russia but that did not contradict the fact that Italy was ‚Äúfully committed‚Äù to the European policy in relation to Russia, including the implementation of sanctions and decisions related to the crisis in Ukraine. Aragona acknowledged there was a perception that Italy was somehow ‚Äúmore sympathetic‚Äù to Russia than other European countries. But he added: ‚ÄúI think that is not really a fair representation of the situation. I think the real issue is that [the Italian government] consider the Ukrainian issue a cause of very serious tension but also a symptom of a European order, [or] European architecture, which has not found its stability at the end of the cold war.‚Äù Aragona then added: ‚ÄúWe see the European evolution probably more clearly and objectively than some of our European partners.‚Äù In his interview with Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, Putin emphasised the strong trade relationship between Italy and Russia, noting that it had increased elevenfold in recent years from $4.2bn to nearly $49bn, as well as mutual interests in the energy sector and hi-tech. While the meeting with Renzi will be closely watched, the talks between Putin and Pope Francis are sure to have Rome riveted. The Argentinian pontiff caused controversy last month when he met with Mahmoud Abbas ‚Äì an encounter in which he might or might not have referred to the Palestinian president as an ‚Äúangel of peace‚Äù, according to conflicting news reports. His meeting with Putin will be followed just as closely. A report in Crux, an online news site that closely follows the Vatican, noted that Francis and Putin were something of an ‚Äúodd geopolitical couple‚Äù who had formed an ‚Äúimprobably strong partnership‚Äù. It began after the Pope sent a letter to Putin in 2013 ‚Äì before the G20 meeting in Moscow ‚Äì urging leaders to find a non-military solution to the conflict in Syria. In his talk with other world leaders, Putin reportedly quoted from the pope‚Äôs letter, saying: ‚ÄúWe might listen to the Pope.‚Äù No military action was taken. Putin has also spoken out about the ‚Äúdire‚Äù situation facing Christians in the Middle East who are being persecuted and killed ‚Äì a topic that is frequently also mentioned by the pope. The pontiff has chided world leaders for seeking to diminish anti-Christian violence and the topic is likely to be raised on Wednesday. Pope Francis has also sought to strengthen ties with the Russian Orthodox church as part of a broader aim to promote Christian unity. But he is not expected to ignore the biggest source of criticism against Putin internationally: the crisis in Ukraine. In February, the pontiff referred to the bloodshed in the ongoing war as ‚Äúfratricidal‚Äù, a comment seen as controversial in Ukraine, where the violence is viewed as a direct consequence of Russian aggression. Anatolij Babynskyj, editor of a prominent Greek Catholic journal, told Crux: ‚ÄúIt shows the ignorance of the pope about the situation in Ukraine.‚Äù Asked what the pope and Putin were likely to discuss at their meeting on Wednesday, the Vatican told the Guardian: ‚ÄúYou can only speculate on the topics of the discussions.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-10T01:05:59Z,world,World news,Wisconsin senate passes controversial bill banning abortions after 20 weeks,"The Wisconsin state senate passed a controversial bill on Tuesday that would ban abortions in the state after 20 weeks. The bill posits that fetuses can feel pain after 20 weeks, contrary to most scientific evidence. It has been criticized by the Wisconsin section of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, as well as by the Wisconsin Medical Society and the Wisconsin chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Governor Scott Walker, who is positioning himself for a presidential run, has said he will sign the legislation if it reaches his desk. Under the bill, the father of the fetus may bring a claim for damages against a physician who performs an abortion on a woman after the 20 week cutoff. Only 1% of the abortions performed in Wisconsin happen after 20 weeks. Nearly half ‚Äì 48% ‚Äì take place in the first eight weeks of pregnancy. Doctors found guilty of violating the law by performing abortions could be fined $10,000 and sentenced to three years and six months in prison. The legislation offers no exceptions for rape or incest and only permits an abortion in the event of a medical emergency. This is defined as risk that the woman will die or have a major bodily function impaired. The legislation, sponsored by Republican senator Mary Lazich and assembly member Jesse Kremer, mandates that the gestational age of the fetus be calculated as the ‚Äúpost-fertilization age‚Äù. Physicians, however, point out that the standard method for determining fetal age is different, counting from the last menstrual cycle. Legal experts have said that the bill, if passed as written, would likely be struck down by a lower court in the event of a lawsuit, burdening taxpayers with those costs. Whether the US supreme court would change its position on permitting abortions prior to viability, currently deemed to be 24 weeks, is unclear. Residents testified for and against the bill last week at the state capitol in Madison. Jessica Roulette, 45, an attorney who had a life-threatening pregnancy 11 years ago, spoke in opposition to it. ‚ÄúI worry that if this legislation had been in place when I was facing my crisis pregnancy, that day when everything went to hell, my doctors might not have been able to save my life.‚Äù Speaking to the Guardian by telephone, she added: ‚ÄúJust sitting in the hearing room waiting to testify, I didn‚Äôt feel like the people who want to vote for this bill are considering the lives of mothers with high-risk, difficult pregnancies are of equal value to the child the woman is trying to have, and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs right.‚Äù In an interview with Wisconsin Eye, assembly member Jesse Kremer, a Republican from Kewaskum, said that the bill protected ‚Äúchildren that can feel that pain, that torturous, barbaric ripping limb from limb‚Äù. But Dr Steven Leuthner, a national expert on neonatal and infant end-of-life care, said most abortions after 20 weeks were performed through induced labor and delivery because of lethal issues with the fetus or jeopardy to the mother‚Äôs life. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very disturbed by the nature and tone of the bill for a number of reasons,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey make it sound like there‚Äôs no patient-physician relationship in these decisions and discussions, and everything is punitive to the doctor. There‚Äôs kind of this tone of the women being subject to the doctors doing these procedures, and that was kind of disturbing.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-09T21:37:12Z,world,World news,"Ireland's abortion law violates women and girls, says Amnesty International","Irish abortion law treats women and girls like ‚Äúchild-bearing vessels‚Äù and endangers their lives and their health when pregnant, Amnesty International has said. A new report which analyses the impact of Ireland‚Äôs abortion law documents testimony from women, some of whom have suffered miscarriages, who have sought abortions abroad after being forced to carry a dead or unviable foetus for weeks.
Ireland‚Äôs abortion law, which only allows abortion if the mother‚Äôs life is at risk, is one of the most restrictive in the world. It has resulted in 4,000 women and girls travelling abroad for healthcare, the report said. Ireland‚Äôs legal framework has been left unchanged, the report says, despite recent reforms in the aftermath of the highly publicised death of Savita Halappanavar, a 31-year-old Indian woman who was denied a medically-induced abortion in 2012 in a hospital in Galway after a miscarriage. Instead, the ongoing lack of clarity in the law, combined with the threat of sanctions and criminal prosecution for healthcare providers, means that ‚Äúpregnant women and girls in need of an abortion for medical reasons are essentially forced to wait until their condition deteriorates sufficiently in order to justify a medical intervention‚Äù. Irish women are not allowed abortion in cases of rape, severe or fatal foetal impairment or a risk to their health; even giving them information about the procedure is a crime. The human rights charity has called for an amendment to Ireland‚Äôs constitution to decriminalise abortion. ‚ÄúThe human rights of women and girls are violated on a daily basis because of a constitution that treats them like child-bearing vessels,‚Äù said Amnesty International‚Äôs secretary-general Salil Shetty. ‚ÄúWomen and girls who need abortions are treated like criminals, stigmatised and forced to travel abroad, taking a serious toll on their mental and physical health. The Irish state can no longer ignore this reality and the appalling impact it is having on thousands of people every year.‚Äù The Amnesty International report, called ‚ÄúShe is not a criminal: the impact of Ireland‚Äôs abortion law‚Äù, details the religious and social framework that has helped shape the laws which make procuring or administering an abortion a criminal act, except where there is a substantial risk to a mother‚Äôs life. Medical experts say they cannot always predict the point or speed at which a problem can escalate into a risk to life. The result, the report found, is ‚Äúa situation where healthcare providers have withheld medically indicated treatment, including abortion‚Äù. It found cases where providers ‚Äúwaited for a pregnant woman‚Äôs health to seriously deteriorate‚Äù, ‚Äúrefrained from providing a suicidal woman with critical mental healthcare‚Äù, forced medical care on a woman without her consent and kept a clinically dead pregnant woman on life support, denying her the right to die with dignity. In 2012, there were protests over Ireland‚Äôs abortion laws after the death of Halappanavar. The Health Information and Quality Authority ruled in 2013 that her death was preventable and identified 13 missed opportunities to intervene. The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was introduced, intended to clarify the law by allowing terminations where there is a threat to the life of the mother or when doctors agree the expectant mother may take her own life over her pregnancy. But, the Amnesty report notes, the Eight Amendment which protects the life of the foetus still stands. ‚ÄúFor a doctor to say ‚Äòyou are not dying enough yet,‚Äô like Savita Halappanavar was not dying enough, until she was and they couldn‚Äôt pull her back from the brink because the infection had ravaged her body ‚Äì it is barbaric,‚Äù Alison Begas, chief executive of Dublin Well Woman, told Amnesty. Dr Peter Boylan, an obstetrician, gynaecologist and former master and clinical director of Ireland‚Äôs National Maternity Hospital said the law had created legal and ethical dilemmas for medical staff: ‚ÄúUnder the [current law], we must wait until women become sick enough before we can intervene. How close to death do you have to be? There is no answer to that.‚Äù One woman who was carrying a foetus that had no heartbeat for 14 weeks told Amnesty International that she had to travel to her home country of Spain for medical treatment. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt feel safe at all,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI was really scared. It became clear that if any complication was raised, these people would let me die.‚Äù The Amnesty International report said: ‚ÄúIreland must amend the constitution and remove the protection of the foetus.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-09T18:57:30Z,world,World news,UK lab among recipients of live anthrax shipment from US defence department,"A laboratory in the UK is among a growing list of those accidentally sent samples of live anthrax by the US department of defence in 2007, officials have confirmed. The UK lab that received the anthrax is run by a private company, which destroyed the deadly pathogens soon after they arrived from the US without ever realising they were live rather than inactivated. It is understood that none of the workers who had contact with the anthrax fell ill.
The Health and Safety Executive refused to name the laboratory where the incident took place, on the grounds that it would pose a security risk if the anthrax research carried out at the facility became public. At the time the pathogen was sent to the lab, private companies ran at least 98 labs in the UK with sufficient containment to handle bugs as dangerous as anthrax. The company that runs the lab only learned that the anthrax sample was potentially live when the US Department of Defense got in touch about the shipment during their current investigation, the Guardian understands. The HSE said that together with other government agencies, it was ‚Äúready to support the company as necessary‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe do not believe there is any continuing health risk to staff or to the public. If anyone would have been exposed in 2007, symptoms would have presented shortly after. No such reports of ill health were apparent in the workforce,‚Äù the HSE said. The DoD breaches, which occurred at Dugway Proving Ground ‚Äì a US military laboratory in Utah ‚Äì appear to have occurred over several years. The DoD have said their investigation is ongoing, but so far live samples of the pathogen have been found to have been sent to a total of 68 laboratories across the US, Australia, South Korea and now the UK. Dugway is a facility which produces anthrax ‚Äì a weaponised version of a naturally occurring deadly bacteria ‚Äì in industrial quantities. From there, samples of the pathogen are sent to labs across the world for use in testing for detection equipment and treatments. In theory the samples are ‚Äúinactivated‚Äù by radiation first, but experts told the Guardian that the system may not have been properly calibrated, potentially over an extended period of time. In a statement, DoD spokesperson Maj Eric Badger said that there were ‚Äúno suspected or confirmed cases of infection, and no known risk to the general public‚Äù. ‚ÄúConcurrently, DoD is performing a comprehensive review of its laboratory procedures, processes, and protocols associated with inactivating spore-forming anthrax, by order of deputy secretary of defense Bob Work,‚Äù Badger added. A similar breach was revealed in 2014 at the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia, when up to 70 staff were thought to have been accidentally exposed to the live toxin because the lab failed to use an approved sterilisation technique. It is not known whether the breaches at Dugway ‚Äì which appear to be much larger in scope, and happened over a much longer period of time ‚Äì may have had a similar origin. ‚ÄúObviously there‚Äôs going to be a lot of discussion and investigation into what went wrong here,‚Äù said Stephen Morse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Columbia university in New York, who is an expert in bio-defence. ‚ÄúTo me the surprising thing is that it didn‚Äôt just happen for a short period of time, it was a problem that went on for a while.‚Äù Richard Ebright, an expert in bio-weapons at Rutgers university, said there was little or no direct danger to the public. Instead, he said, ‚Äúthe major concern is the security breach‚Äù of not knowing where the weaponised spores ‚Äì from even a small amount of which a dangerous amount can be grown ‚Äì have gone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-09T18:39:31Z,world,World news,Sisters fight to save ancient African language from extinction,"A 95-year-old woman is helping a last ditch effort to preserve an ancient African language before it goes extinct. Hanna Koper and her two sisters are thought to be the last remaining speakers of the San language N|uu, rated as critically endangered by Unesco. The San, also known as ‚Äúbushmen‚Äù, were the first hunter-gatherers in southern Africa. N|uu, which has 112 distinct sounds, was passed on orally down the generations but never written down. Now Koper and her siblings have worked with linguists to design alphabet charts with consonants, vowels and 45 different ‚Äúclicks‚Äù that are typical of San languages, as well as rules of spelling and grammar. Matthias Brenzinger, director of the Centre for African Language Diversity at the University of Cape Town, who is working on the project with British academic Sheena Shah, said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the most indigenous language of southern Africa.‚Äù N|uu and related languages were spoken in most parts of southern Africa, he added, but were wiped out by white settlers, sometimes with the support of locals. ‚ÄúVery often they kept the young girls, but they killed all the men. Genocide is the major reason for these languages in southern Africa to be extinct now, and then forced assimilation. Farmers were taking their land so there was no subsistence for them any more.‚Äù
Brezinger has overseen the teaching of N|uu at a local school, where pupils learn basics such as greetings, body parts, animal names and short sentences. One teenage girl in particular is showing huge promise in the language but ‚Äúat one stage there will be no fluent speaker any more‚Äù, he said. That does not mean N|uu will necessarily be doomed to the archives, however. ‚ÄúWith these languages, you never know,‚Äù said Brezinger. ‚ÄúHawaiian was extinct basically, and then there was a movement 35 years ago and you have 2,000 mother tongue speakers of Hawaiian. ‚ÄúThis is why it‚Äôs very important now for us to record as much as possible with the speakers so we have material, spoken language on video tape and so on.‚Äù N|uu has one of the biggest speech sound inventories in the world, he added, including more than 45 click phonemes, 30 non-click consonants and 37 vowels. ‚ÄúLanguage is the most important cultural asset, so if you lose your language, you lose your culture. In Canada, there is a clear link between those indigenous people who lose their language and suicide rates. In this globalised world, local identity is essential,‚Äù Brezinger. Koper, who lives near Upington in Northern Cape province, told South Africa‚Äôs Sunday Times newspaper that when she was a girl in the days of white minority rule, she and her siblings were told their language was ugly. ‚ÄúWe were told not to make noise and the baas [a Dutch word for supervisor] would shout at us if we spoke the language because they believed we were gossiping,‚Äù she was quoted as saying. ‚ÄúThis is my language. This is my bread. This is my milk. I didn‚Äôt learn it, but I ate it and this is how it is my language.‚Äù Koper‚Äôs sister Katrina Esau, 82, who has received an award from President Jacob Zuma for her work to preserve San language and culture, added: ‚ÄúOther people have their own languages. Why must my language be allowed to die? It must go on. As long as there are people, the language must go on.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-09T18:13:48Z,world,World news,Azerbaijan holds activist who attacked European Games as 'BP's games',"A British activist working for a leading human rights organisation that has been strongly critical of the relationship between oil and gas giant BP and the Azerbaijan regime has been barred from entering the country to monitor this week‚Äôs European Games, which start this Friday. Emma Hughes, of London-based Platform, was detained at Baku airport on Tuesday afternoon after her plane landed from Rome. Her passport was taken from her and she was informed that she would be put on a plane back to Rome within 24 hours. She told the Guardian she was ‚ÄúOK‚Äù and still able to make phone calls, but had been informed that she was on a ‚Äúred list‚Äù that barred her from entering Azerbaijan. Her detention is part of a widespread crackdown by the autocratic Azerbaijan regime, which has been accused of using the European Games to ‚Äúblind‚Äù countries to its ‚Äúappalling‚Äù human rights record. In the buildup to Friday, Platform has been severely critical of the relationship between BP, an official partner of the games, and the country‚Äôs authoritarian president, Ilham Aliyev. A new book produced by the organisation, All That Glitters, outlining the relationship between the oil company and the Azerbaijan regime is due to be published on Friday. Leading human rights groups, including Amnesty International and Index on Censorship, have accused the Aliyev regime of systematically attacking Azerbaijani civil society by jailing journalists, lawyers, academics and democratic activists.
Speaking before she was detained, Hughes declared: ‚ÄúThese Oil Games are BP‚Äôs games. Their success will be BP‚Äôs success. They are using sport to blind the world to a horrific reality. Civil society has been stamped on hard in Baku. Journalists, lawyers, academics, writers and activists have all found themselves behind bars. And yet the games carry on regardless. The future of this country is imprisoned, yet BP still work hand in hand with this regime.‚Äù
However, BP, which is the largest foreign investor in Azerbaijan, has strongly defended its presence in the country. There is no suggestion BP had anything to do with Hughes‚Äôs detention. ‚ÄúWherever we do business we endeavour to operate in such a way as to deliver durable benefits to the societies and communities which host us,‚Äù a spokesman said. ‚ÄúIn the particular case of Azerbaijan, we have made a substantial socio-economic contribution to the country over the decades we have worked there, by creating jobs, generating tax revenues, providing significant commercial opportunities for local suppliers and making major investments in sustainable development.‚Äù Human rights activists within the country allege that sport is ‚Äúbeing used to goldwash a corrupt regime and the oil company that serves it‚Äù. Arzu Geybulla, a journalist with Radio Free Europe, said: ‚ÄúBP was in Azerbaijan at the very early stage of its development and yet it has contributed very little. It doesn‚Äôt really care. As a British company you would expect some interest in the human rights dimension. Hosting an event like the European Games in a country where you have vast discrepancies between life standards, contributing to that and keeping that injustice going is simply unacceptable.‚Äù Platform claims that the aim of the games is to present the Aliyev family ‚Äúas progressive and open to the world‚Äù when ‚Äúin reality it has an appalling record of human rights abuse, crushing freedom of speech and assembly, and incarcerating any voices of opposition‚Äù. There are more than 100 political prisoners in Azerbaijan, including investigative journalist Khadija Ismayilova, whose imprisonment has been condemned by the US State Department, the UK Foreign Office and the EU.
In June 2014 Ismayilova voiced criticism of BP. ‚ÄúBP bear a responsibility for what is happening in Azerbaijan,‚Äù she told Platform. ‚ÄúBP is one of the reasons why the west is very hesitant about any changes in this country. The Aliyev regime is good for BP. It allows their operations and they can sort out issues with the regime. Political influence is part of the bargain. BP is blamed for bringing Aliyev senior to power but it‚Äôs not just historic ‚Äì the UK government is silent about problems with democracy in Azerbaijan. BP‚Äôs interests are dictating the agenda.‚Äù But the BP spokesman denied the charge. ‚ÄúHuman rights are an important element in our approach to responsible business conduct,‚Äù the spokesman said. ‚ÄúWe have a group human rights policy which articulates our commitment to respect internationally recognised human rights and to align the way we do business with the UN guiding principles on business and human rights, which we support. Wherever we work, we concentrate on identifying and managing potential human rights impacts and risks in our own projects and operations or those directly linked to our activities.‚Äù And he added: ‚ÄúIt is the duty of states to protect human rights and the responsibility of companies to respect human rights. Where adverse human rights impacts are not directly linked to our business activities, we do not consider that it is our role to influence how states protect, respect and fulfil human rights.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-09T18:11:04Z,world,World news,Turkish PM steps down as ruling party mulls possibilities for coalition,"Ahmet Davutoƒülu, the Turkish prime minister, resigned on Tuesday in a procedural move following Sunday‚Äôs parliamentary election but is to remain in his post until a new government is formed, according to a statement published by President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan‚Äôs office. The ruling Justice and Development, or AK, party (AKP) lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since it swept to power in 2002. Having garnered 40.9% of the vote, it faces the option of forming a coalition government with an opposition party, or trying to rule as a minority government.
‚ÄúMr President accepted today the resignation of the cabinet that was presented by Mr Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu,‚Äù Erdoƒüan‚Äôs office said in a brief statement. ‚ÄúMr President, who thanked the cabinet for its services so far, asked the cabinet to remain in charge until a new government is formed.‚Äù The three opposition parties in parliament have shown little enthusiasm for joining the AKP in a coalition government. The rightwing Nationalist Movement party (MHP), thought to be the AKP‚Äôs most likely coalition partner, has rejected the possibility. ‚ÄúNobody has a right to drag Turkey into [AKP] minority and some circles‚Äô scenarios,‚Äù Devlet Bahceli, the MHP party leader, said in a statement after the elections. ‚ÄúA snap election will happen whenever it will happen.‚Äù He suggested the AKP and the pro-Kurdish and leftist Peoples‚Äô Democratic Party (HDP) or, alternatively, the AKP, HDP and second-placed Republican People‚Äôs party (CHP) should try to form a coalition. The CHP has suggested it could lead a coalition government if both of the other opposition parties maintain their strategy not to cooperate with the AKP.
Selahattin Demirta≈ü, the HDP co-chair, who was the surprise star of this year‚Äôs elections, underlined his party‚Äôs rejection of a coalition with the AKP on Tuesday. ‚ÄúWhat kind of alternatives we will have in that case? We will be discussing all of these alternatives,‚Äù he said. The HDP‚Äôs breakthrough was greeted with jubilation in Turkey‚Äôs predominantly Kurdish south-east, where it attracted its greatest support. In Batman, a petrol-rich but poor province, the party garnered 72.37% of all votes. Bahar, a 19-year-old student, said the HDP victory would help affirm Kurdish identity in Turkey. ‚ÄúThis is an important first step in Turkish politics. For the first time, a party that is not discriminating on the basis of race has met with electoral success. We are happy that the HDP will be able to oppose the ruling party.‚Äù Mahmut Akat, a shop owner, agreed. ‚ÄúThe HDP carried off a great victory at the elections,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe fact that the HDP got so many votes in the west [of Turkey] shows that the existence of the Kurds has been accepted to a degree by Turkish society.‚Äù He added that the election results gave him renewed hope for the ongoing peace process between the Turkish government and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers‚Äô party (PKK): ‚ÄúThe guerrilla fighters are our people, and the soldiers are our people, too. Why should we kill each other? I have much higher hopes for peace.‚Äù Four people were killed as clashes between rival Kurdish groups erupted on Tuesday in the main Kurdish city of Diyarbakir. Aytac Baran, the head of the Ihya-Der, an Islamist charity with close links to the political party H√ºda-Par, was shot by unknown gunmen, triggering a firefight that killed three more people and injured four, including three journalists, AFP reported. H√ºda-Par emerged from the Turkish Hezbollah, an outlawed Islamist militant grouping with no links to its Lebanese namesake. Its supporters clashed last year with PKK followers during violent protests over the Turkish government‚Äôs hostile attitude to Kurdish fighters defending the Syrian-Kurdish city of Kobani against Isis militants. The HDP strongly condemned the attack and called for an investigation of the incident. On Tuesday night, three people were detained in relation to the killings, according to the state-run Anatolian news agency. Turkish media reported that Baran had received threats by the PKK just before his assassination.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-09T16:57:12Z,world,World news,Victor Ponta says he would face court as Romanian MPs uphold immunity,"Victor Ponta, Romania‚Äôs prime minister, said on Tuesday that he was prepared to go to court to answer allegations of money-laundering, forgery and tax evasion as the country‚Äôs president called on him resign. Prosecutors announced on Friday that they had launched an investigation into the prime minister over suspected money laundering and tax evasion, sending one of the EU‚Äôs poorest countries into a political crisis. Ponta denies the allegations and says he has documentary proof of his innocence. In an interview with the Guardian, he rejected a renewed demand by Klaus Iohannis, Romania‚Äôs president, for him to resign, saying that neither Romania nor Europe could afford political instability in the face of Russian expansionist moves to the East. ‚ÄúRomania is in the most sensitive area of Europe,‚Äù Ponta said. ‚ÄúWe hope we will close this small but intense political crisis and we will get back to work, because Europe requires Romania to be stable and predictable in this region. I think only Russia will open the champagne bottles if Romania will be in long political crisis.‚Äù Ponta was speaking in his office minutes after the country‚Äôs senate voted by a large majority against lifting his immunity to criminal investigation, drawing a stinging rebuke from the president and the prospect of a constitutional stand-off. ‚ÄúI regret that has parliament has turned into a shield for the protection of an individual, Victor Ponta, who is suspected of criminal acts,‚Äù Iohannis said in a written statement. ‚ÄúIt is conclusive proof of huge irresponsibility and defiance towards the public, because the majority MPs are obstructing justice and will destroy the parliament as an institution, harming the image of Romania, in order to save one person.‚Äù The president added: ‚ÄúI furthermore consider the key to getting out of this situation is the resignation of Mr Victor Ponta as prime minister.‚Äù Ponta, the leader of the majority Social Democratic party, rejected the president‚Äôs demand for his resignation as politically motivated, intended to rally support for the Liberals in elections due next year. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure that president Iohannis will simply do his job and his statements were simply statements to support his party who are in opposition and who want to win elections next year,‚Äù Ponta said. ‚ÄúBut the president should be the president of all citizens not just of his party.‚Äù The parliamentary vote to maintain the prime minister‚Äôs immunity only protects Ponta against some of the potential charges raised on Friday by the National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA) ‚Äì specifically those alleging conflict of interest while he has been in office. It does not apply to DNA allegations that Ponta was involved in money-laundering, forgery and tax evasion in 2007 and 2008 when he was working as a private lawyer. According to a statement issued on Friday by the agency, he is said to have falsified invoices for work he never performed to help a business associate dodge tax. ‚ÄúI am still being investigated ... and I will answer to all the prosecutor‚Äôs questions regarding the allegation that eight years ago as a lawyer I was accomplice to another lawyer for a ‚Ç¨10,000 tax evasion. I will go in front of the prosecutor and if it‚Äôs going to be the case, in front of a judge as an absolutely normal citizen,‚Äù he said. Ponta vowed that, if he was found guilty on those charges, he would resign. ‚ÄúIf I am declared guilty by a judge, of course. That‚Äôs absolutely clear,‚Äù he said. But he added that he could prove his innocence in court, and had not yet been asked to give his version of events. ‚ÄúI did have all the checks by the fiscal authorities and the national integrity agency and both said everything was perfectly legal so I will just present all these papers to the prosecutor. I will give all the explanations, and I‚Äôm sure everything will be clear then.‚Äù The DNA confirmed that it was still pursuing the investigations into Ponta‚Äôs role in the tax evasion case. That case will be passed to an investigating magistrate who will decide whether it should go to court. Meanwhile, Ponta said he stuck by his earlier call for the law to be changed to lift the immunity of MPs in cases of corruption. That did not apply to him, he insisted, as the allegations against him while prime minister involved alleged conflict of interest rather than corruption. He also said he did not support legislative changes being considered in parliament to limit the power of state prosecutors, arguing that judicial self-policing was the answer to occasional over-zealous prosecutions. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the problem is the legislation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI just think we should find a mechanism that avoids abuses and mistakes.‚Äù Laura Stefan, an anti-corruption expert at the Expert Forum, a Bucharest thinktank, expressed scepticism over Ponta‚Äôs claims he was not behind the legislative push to curtail the DNA‚Äôs powers. ‚ÄúHe is the leader of the ruling party pushing for the changes. So how can he be against them when his party is pushing for them ‚Äì he just showed us all how he holds his party with a very strong grip,‚Äù she said. ‚Ä¢ This article was amended on 11 June 2015. An earlier version described President Klaus Iohannis as the leader of the opposition National Liberal party. Alina Gorghiu took over that post in December 2014.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-09T16:55:12Z,world,World news,Magaluf's new drinking laws flouted and doubted in first 24 hours,"David is sitting on the pavement, tucking into a polystyrene tray of chips and gravy, two cans of Stella Artois propped up against his foot. Behind him, his mate leans against the wall, pale, swaying and being violently sick. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be alright,‚Äù said the 19-year-old through a mouthful of chips. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre in Magaluf, you keep going.‚Äù Tapping the beer cans, he grins and adds: ‚ÄúThe drinking‚Äôs not gonna stop here.‚Äù It is 2am on the Mallorcan resort‚Äôs infamous Punta Ballena strip and David is far from the only one on this street of bars, clubs and strip-joints clutching a drink. Large plastic cups filled with clear, pink, blue and green liquids can be spotted in the hands of hundreds of the late-night revellers, the majority of whom are British.
Yet, while this is scene is hardly out of the ordinary during the summer season in Magaluf, midnight on Monday marked the introduction of a series of new laws designed to crackdown on the behaviour of the island‚Äôs British visitors. An estimated 1 million of them holiday here every year, bringing hundreds of millions in tourism ‚Äì but also a reputation for drunken debauchery and sexual depravity. Drinking has now been banned on the street between 10pm and 8am, while fines between ‚Ç¨750 (¬£550) and ‚Ç¨3,000 will be issued to anyone caught urinating in public, flashing or swimming naked. Bar crawls, which are one of the most popular and profitable activities on the strip and can attract more than 100 people at a time, are now to be restricted to a maximum of 20 ‚Äì and bars are only allowed to have one a day having given the authorities seven days‚Äô notice.
In an attempt to prove it is serious about clamping down on the ‚ÄúShagaluf‚Äù culture that has shamed Mallorca and occupied the British press for the past year, the local Calvi√† council has promised a greater police presence on the streets and will bring in an extra 36 officers to ensure the laws are enforced.
But the raucous scenes on the strip on Monday night proved they have a challenging task ahead of them and most locals and holidaymakers are united in their belief that it will not work. In a quiet bar off the strip, David, a waiter who was born in a town neighbouring Magaluf, said 36 extra officers were nowhere near enough to enforce real change, adding that drinking on the street was not where police efforts should be focused. ‚ÄúWe are talking over 5,000 people in a single road, how many more police do you think you need to actually make any changes? A lot more than 30, that‚Äôs for sure. It would be good if it made a difference but it has to start in the hotel when they [tourists] arrive, making sure British people who come here know the rules and know they will have to pay if they break them. That hasn‚Äôt happened so I am not very convinced.‚Äù The source of the drunken troubles, he added, lay more with the cheap prices of the alcohol in the bars and not the drinking between the bars. Blazoned across numerous clubs and British bars up and down the strip are deals such as ‚Ç¨7 for two hours‚Äô unlimited open bar, while pints of vodka and Red Bull, and sex on the beach cocktails sell for between ‚Ç¨3 and ‚Ç¨5. While there is already a law in place that bans drunk people being served, a quick scan of any bar on Monday night proved this was being virtually ignored. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think these new rules will stop people coming to Magaluf,‚Äù said David. ‚ÄúIt is so cheap. They all stay in all-inclusive hotels where they get unlimited alcohol. So it doesn‚Äôt matter if they have a drink in their hand or not, by the time they get to the strip at night they are already drunk, they will already kick that bin, cause chaos, start smashing windows or whatever. ‚ÄúBut they will still get served more alcohol in the bars. So what‚Äôs the point of bringing in new laws when the old ones aren‚Äôt even getting followed?‚Äù
One British migrant, who worked in a club on the strip and did not want to be named, said there was so much competition between the bars that they all broke the laws that ban promoters from serving obviously inebriated customers to get people into the clubs and venues. The one shift many locals said they hoped the laws would bring about was an end to the destructive pub crawls, which often result in scores of drunk holidaymakers tearing through the streets. Jos√©, a waiter from the island‚Äôs capital, Palma, said he had already seen police stop a group of about 50 on Monday night and issue them with a warning. He hoped it was the beginning of a new era, but predicted there wouldn‚Äôt be any real change for years. ‚ÄúYou think when you see 150 people walking down the street, drinking, screaming, shouting, being sick, that is nice for Magaluf? I don‚Äôt think so. I hope this will put a stop to it,‚Äù he said. But on the main beach on Tuesday afternoon, Vanessa and Toni, both in their early twenties and from the UK, were among the numerous promoters still illegally canvassing to get people to sign up for various pub crawls and parties happening that night. Neither believed that the new laws were anything other than hot air and said that, for now at least, the 20-person rule for pub crawls looked like it was being ignored.
Back on the strip, Hayley, 32 and from Surrey, works behind the bar at Alex‚Äôs, pre-slicing limes to accompany the hundreds of tequila shots that will be knocked back that night. This is the venue that made headlines last year as the club where an 18-year-old woman performed oral sex on 24 men to get a free drink. A video of the act, known as ‚Äúmamading‚Äù, went viral. Having spent 11 summers in Magaluf, Hayley said she had noticed an increased police presence on the strip on Monday, but added that she was unconvinced it would have any long-term impact on the ‚Äústreet of shame‚Äù. She said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good that they‚Äôre doing it but there are other things they should be concentrating on if they want to clean up Magaluf. The prostitutes are a real problem and muggings are so much worse than people carrying a drink from one bar to the next. And frankly, the fact they are carrying a drink in the two seconds it takes to get from one bar to the next bar is hardly what‚Äôs causing the problems. They get there and buy another drink anyway.‚Äù Magaluf, Hayley insists, is no different from any other resort favoured by young Britons looking for a good time. She believes the town has an unfair reputation in the UK press. ‚ÄúThey made a big deal about what that girl did to 24 guys for a drink, but it‚Äôs not like that‚Äôs happening all the time,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúWhen they come here they let their hair down ‚Äì and yes, I‚Äôve seen things over the years that‚Äôs made me think, ‚ÄòBloody hell, if I was your mother‚Ä¶‚Äô.. ‚ÄúBut I can‚Äôt see this as the beginning of some radical change or Magaluf ever being a quiet place just for families where nothing bad is going on and no one‚Äôs getting naked.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-09T16:26:55Z,world,World news,Canadian police officer originally from UK shot dead in Edmonton,"A Canadian police officer originally from the United Kingdom has been shot dead while trying to execute an arrest warrant in a hate crime investigation, officials announced on Tuesday. Daniel Woodall, a 35-year-old married father of two from Salford, was shot several times with a high-powered rifle in Edmonton on Monday night. ‚ÄúConstable Woodall gave his life tonight in the service of citizens of this city and our country,‚Äù said the city‚Äôs police chief, Rod Knecht, at a press conference on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThis strikes at the very heart of every police officer and certainly their families and loved ones.‚Äù A second officer, Sergeant Jason Harley, 38, was also shot in the lower back during the incident, but has been released from the hospital. The officers were attempting to enter the home of 42-year-old Norman Raddatz, a suspect in a hate-crimes investigation, when they came under fire. The shooting went on for at least 10 minutes, Knecht said, and at some stage in the incident the house caught fire.
Raddatz is believed to have died in the house as it burned. More than 50 bullet holes were later found in a home across the street. Knecht said the officers were investigating a campaign of harassment against a local family. ‚ÄúThe online hatred and bullying of an Edmonton family had become extreme, and the family members were increasingly worried about their personal safety, at which time the Edmonton police service became involved,‚Äù Knecht said Woodall, an eight-year veteran of the Edmonton police, moved to Canada in December 2006 after working for the Greater Manchester police for four years. Detective Inspector Jim Faulkner of GMP said that Woodall was a ‚Äútruly ebullient man‚Äù. ‚ÄúHe was extremely keen to learn and always had a smile on his face,‚Äù Faulkner told the Press Association. ‚ÄúHe would do anything for any of his colleagues, every one of whom liked him and were sad when he decided to leave for Canada.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis was done purely for the benefit of his young family,‚Äù Faulkner said. He also noted a memorable job where Woodall had to chase a person suspected of serious assault. ‚ÄúUnperturbed, Dan gave chase and threw his torch at the offender‚Äôs back, which caused him to stumble and fall,‚Äù Faulkner said. ‚ÄúDan promptly arrested him.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-09T15:50:49Z,world,World news,Spain forced to drop inquiry into 2003 killing of cameraman by US shell in Iraq,"Spain‚Äôs high court has closed a 12-year inquiry into the killing of a TV cameraman by a US tank shell in Iraq in 2003, after the judge concluded a change in Spanish law made the case impossible to pursue. Spanish judicial authorities had sought the arrest and questioning of three US soldiers accused of involvement in the death of Jos√© Couso, who worked for the Telecinco television station. Reuters cameraman Taras Protsyuk, a Ukrainian, was also killed by the shell that crashed into a Baghdad hotel. Couso‚Äôs family filed a lawsuit in 2003 against Captain Philip Wolford, Lieutenant Colonel Philip de Camp and Sergeant Gibson, all of the US 3rd infantry. The Spanish high court had sought to detain the men using universal justice, the concept that some crimes such as genocide and torture are so serious they can be prosecuted across borders. The law, pioneered by Spain, famously led to the detention in London of Chilean former dictator Augusto Pinochet in 1998 through an arrest warrant issued from Spain. However, Spain‚Äôs centre-right government last year curbed the powers of judges to prosecute human rights cases across borders using the law after countries like China bristled at Spanish judicial investigations into crimes like alleged genocide by former Chinese officials in Tibet. Reforms to the law made it impossible to prosecute any war crime carried out against a Spaniard unless the accused had sought refuge in Spain, high court judge Santiago Pedraz said in the court document seen by Reuters on Tuesday. Pedraz said last year it had been impossible to bring the US soldiers to Spain to get them to testify in a Spanish court. The three men had been cleared of wrongdoing by a US military investigation. The US said it would not extradite the three.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The man said the damage occurred during the primetime show Tiger Mom, the Legal Daily reported. Zhao Wei, one of China‚Äôs most famous actors, stars in the hit drama about a divided couple‚Äôs struggle to raise their daughter. The Shanghai Pudong new district court refused to state whether it had accepted the case, but an official criticised the lawsuit, saying: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not necessary to waste our judicial resources on cases like these.‚Äù The case has raised fresh concerns over frivolous lawsuits in China, after regulations making it more difficult for courts to reject claims took effect on 1 May. Courts must now provide clearly stated reasons for rejection and citizens have the right to appeal the decisions. The change has lead to a 29% increase in cases compared with the same period last year, to just over a million cases, according to the supreme people‚Äôs court. The new registration system was implemented to end ‚Äúobstructive behaviour by courts and officials meddling in cases‚Äù, but the Zhao case has been cited as an example of citizens abusing their right to file lawsuits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-09T13:54:29Z,world,World news,Murders of LGBT and HIV-positive people in the US rise 11% in 2014,"Homicides targeting LGBTQ and HIV-positive people rose by 11% in the US last year, making 2014 the deadliest year for people in those communities since 2012, a new report has shown. The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP) published its comprehensive report on hate violence experienced by LGBTQ people in the last year. While the report shows that non-lethal attacks against LGBTQ and HIV-positive people has decreased, transgender women of color were still found to be at high risk of murder. The report, which drew from data across 14 states, comes after a transgender woman was thrown on to subway tracks in New York City, the same week Caitlyn Jenner introduced her new identity as a transgender woman to the world, to a largely positive reception. ‚ÄúThis year, the report reconfirms some of the trends we‚Äôve seen for multiple years and that includes a high number of homicides,‚Äù Chai Jindasurat, co-director of community organizing and public advocacy told the Guardian.
‚ÄúHomicides against LGBT people remain high with transgender people of color bearing the brunt of it,‚Äù he said. There were 20 homicides last year, according to NCAVP‚Äôs data, with 80% being people of color and more than half being transgender women. So far in 2015, there have been eight confirmed killings of transgender women of color. The FBI just began documenting hate crimes towards transgender people for the first time in 2014, thoughthe NCAVP called the FBI‚Äôs numbers ‚Äúincredibly low‚Äù. According to the NCAVP, the decrease in non-lethal attacks reported by police doesn‚Äôt mean the violence is necessarily going down. Rather, police are not labeling crimes as bias-motivated. The report found that just 6% of hate violence being reported to police is being labeled as such. ‚ÄúWith biased crimes, it seems like pulling teeth to get them to check that extra box in the paperwork,‚Äù said Justin Shaw, executive director of the Kansas City Anti-Violence Project, a partner organization of the study, said last year, after the murder Dionte Greene, a young gay black man in Kansas City, Missouri. ‚ÄúWe hear so many incidents that happen and get labeled simple assault when there is an obvious hate component ‚Äì it feels as if we are stuck in a paperwork cycle with people‚Äôs lives.‚Äù Overall, 54% of LGBTQ people reported violence to police when it occurred, according to the report, a nine-point increase from 2014. They were also 2.4 times more likely than any other group to experience violence from the police when reporting. ‚ÄúReports to police increased in 2014, but that is not surprising in a year where homicides and severity of violence are high, situations in which police are intervening or being called to intervene,‚Äù said Lynne Sprague from Survivors Organizing for Liberation (formerly the Colorado Anti-Violence Program). ‚ÄúWith this report, we are calling for an end to the profiling, police violence, and misconduct that happens when LGBTQ and HIV-affected survivors do report.‚Äù NCAVP‚Äôs 2014 hate violence report documented 1,359 incidents of anti-LGBTQ violence in 2014 ‚Äì a 32% decrease from the 2,001 total incidents reported in 2013. The network has been reporting on violence targeting LGBTQ and HIV-positive people since 1989, and while many may see this decrease assomething to celebrate, NCAVP sees the opposite. ‚ÄúThis decrease should not be an indication that anti-LGBTQ hate violence is declining,‚Äù said Jindasurat. ‚ÄúIn fact it should be a call to action for policymakers, funders, and service providers to increase funding, legislation, public awareness and outreach that encourages reporting of hate violence incidents and promotes safety for LGBTQ and HIV-affected.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think that is why this report is important, because we know that a lot of progress has happened and we are very happy with the culture change happening in the country,‚Äù Jindasurat said. ‚ÄúBut it is still a deadly risk to be LGBTQ.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-09T13:47:53Z,world,World news,What's it like arriving in Europe as a refugee?

His hopes were set on Sweden, where immigration policies ‚Äì automatic residency if successful and relatively streamlined family reunification processes ‚Äì would give him and his family the best chance of being reunited. We want to hear from other people who have shared a similar experience to Hashem or been part of a refugee‚Äôs journey to Europe. Do you have a related story ‚Äì either as someone who arrived in Europe as a refugee, or someone who works with refugees after their arrival? Share your story using GuardianWitness. Hashem‚Äôs journey brought him to Sweden, whose policies towards refugees have been praised by the UN. The country receives the highest number of Syrian refugees per capita than any other country in the EU. In the 12 months preceding March 2015, the country of 9.5 million people processed 81,410 asylum cases. This number is second only to Germany, with its population of 80.2 million, who processed 202,815 applications in 2014 ‚Äì over six times as many asylum applicants as the UK and twice as many as any other country in Europe. Germany, Sweden, and Austria, who take the highest number of refugees in Europe, are in support of the EU imposed immigration quotas ‚Äì which aims to relocate refugees from Italy and Greece. The number of migrants to have arrived in Italy by boat this year passed 50,000 at the weekend as over 5,800 people were rescued in the Mediterranean. The UK has no plans to participate in the EU scheme.

2015-06-09T12:09:15Z,world,World news,The gender politics of Iran‚Äôs nuclear policy,"‚ÄòDignity‚Äô has been an indispensible part of discussions in Iran over nuclear talks with world powers. ‚ÄúIran, with millennia of history, will not be intimidated,‚Äù said Mohammad Javad Zarif, the foreign minister in late May, as he dismissed any solution that was ‚Äúless than respectful, less than dignified‚Äù. Honour and dignity are mostly framed in reference to historical events, including the US and British-led overthrow of Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953 and the western support for Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988). Some conservatives have even compared Iran‚Äôs nuclear concessions to world powers with the humiliating 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay, through which the country gave up parts of its northern territory to Tsarist Russia. Often lurking within discussions about Iran‚Äôs prestige and international standing are terms carrying deep associations with gender. Potency, firmness and resistance are all perceived as masculine characteristics, hence embraced and affirmed, while weakness, flexibility and softness are all associated with femininity, therefore to be avoided and disowned. The masculine thus constructed needs to protect the feminine in order to prove itself, and, at the same time, avoid being contaminated with feminine characteristics. Along these lines, one of the key concepts used to assert the inalienability of Iran‚Äôs nuclear rights is namous. Promoted mainly by conservatives, namous is a term of Greek origin referring in Iranian popular usage to the female side of emotional or family relationships. It is widely regarded as a significant, even sacred, carrier of honour. It is the violation or desecration of namous that provokes masculine violence in acts of honour killing. Honour is thought to be preserved by killing the adulterated female and also making attempts to punish the violator. Framing the Iranian nuclear project in terms of namous helps construct an aura of sanctity and inviolability around it, meaning that any profane, penetrative or possessive treatment of it by outsiders can elicit a radical response. In a television interview on 18 April, Brigadier General Hossein Salami, deputy head of Iran‚Äôs Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), stressed that Tehran would respond with vigour to any attempt at visiting its military sites. ‚ÄúI believe that we will not only not allow foreign countries to visit our military centres, but we will not even allow any thought about this issue,‚Äù he said, likening such a visit by nuclear inspectors to ‚Äúoccupation of land‚Äù and ‚Äúnational humiliation‚Äù. ‚ÄúAnybody who broaches such remarks‚Äù, Salami concluded, ‚Äúwe will respond to them with hot lead‚Äù. Closely allied with the concept of namous are two other highly gendered keywords, harim (sanctum) and gheirat (manly moral courage). As projected in the Iranian atomic discourse, military sites are nodes of national power and potency and therefore constitute an integral part of the nation‚Äôs harim, which should stay free from alien access and, worse still, inspections. The same rule applies to the nuclear scientists as ‚Äúsons‚Äù of the motherland. The term harim in Iranian popular culture brings to fore the notion of female privacy, which is perceived to require protection and so warrant guardianship. In an address to military alumni of the IRGC-affiliated Imam Hossein university in Tehran on 20 May, the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ruled out agreeing to any permission for foreigners to inspect military sites or to interview Iranian nuclear scientists. ‚ÄúNow in these negotiations, once again they are raising new issues, such asÔÅù inspections; we said we will not allow strangers to conduct any sort of inspection of our military centres; they say we ought to come and interview your scientists, that is indeed, interrogate them‚Äù, he said. ‚ÄúWe will not allow the smallest insult to the harim of our atomic scientists and scientists in any other important and sensitive subject.‚Äù To leave no room for doubt, Khamenei continued: ‚ÄúI will not allow strangers to come here, sit and talk to our scientists, the prominent and dear sons of the Iranian nation who have taken this vast science to this point.‚Äù The resonance of this nationalist-paternalist discourse with conservatives and their constituencies has been shown in the formation of a gathering calling itself ‚ÄúWe Won‚Äôt Allow‚Äù - following the hardline group ‚ÄúThe Solicitous‚Äù (Delvapasan) - which has organised demonstrations in several Iranian cities including Tehran, Mashhad, and Isfahan. Such guardianship of the national sanctum, and its protection from insult and alien hands, is usually carried out through demonstrating gheirat: a type of virile moral courage with an occasional religious touch that is intended to guard namous or harim against external adulteration. Safeguarding honour is widely regarded as proof of gheirat. And those who fail to do so stand accused of pofyouzi (an abstract noun, and swear word in Farsi), the defining characteristic of a man lacking gheirat. In other words, pofyouz (a subject noun in Farsi) is a man with loose and dishonourable morals, particularly when it comes to the social or sexual life of the female members of his kin. Reformist academics in Iran who have questioned the costs of the nuclear policy have been accused by certain conservatives of pofyouzi.
‚ÄòFlexibility‚Äô yes, but of the ‚Äòheroic‚Äô sort When flexibility (narmesh) and compromise (sazesh) ‚Äì usually perceived as feminine characteristics ‚Äì are to be exercised, they need to be ‚Äúheroic‚Äù in order to compensate for the dilution of masculinity. It took the supreme leader‚Äôs speech on ‚Äúheroic flexibility‚Äù ‚Äì with references to Imam Hassan, the 7th-century Shia leader who negotiated a peace treaty with the Sunni caliph Muawiyah ‚Äì that paved the way for the Rouhani government to persist with the nuclear talks in the face of stiff opposition from ‚Äòprinciple-ist‚Äô critics of rapprochement with the west. This ‚Äúhegemonic masculinity‚Äù is not limited to conservatives. It but has been employed, in a more subtle and veiled fashion, by moderates including Rouhani himself. In a speech to Iranian ambassadors in August 2014, he called opponents of nuclear negotiations ‚Äúpolitical cowards‚Äù, literally the ‚Äúchicken-hearted...[who]...say we are trembling as soon as the issue of talks comes up.‚Äù Rouhani dismissed their cowardice with some force. ‚ÄúTo hell with it,‚Äù he burst out. ‚ÄúGo find a warm place for yourselves! God has created you timid and trembling.‚Äù For Rouhani, those prepared to negotiate over the nuclear programme were the ones with real courage and fortitude, those who had put themselves at the forefront of the fight to secure the nation‚Äôs honour and rights. It is clear that for many in the Iranian body politic - not least the leadership ‚Äì the nuclear programme reeks of masculinity, and denuclearization raises fears of emasculation. But what is the relevance of all this, and how can an understanding of it help facilitate the nuclear negotiations in their most critical phase? In a nutshell, Iran‚Äôs nuclear dignity is predominantly of a masculine nature. While this holds true of many other nation-states and their foreign policies, western negotiators will be well advised to take these nuances into account. The choice of terminology can be of paramount importance. Indeed, the international controversy over Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme is, in a way, a clash of masculinities, caught up in an array of coercive instruments and escalatory policies like economic sanctions, sabotage and threats of military action. The bottom line is that negotiations and dialogue can rupture this vicious circle of confrontation and prevent it from degenerating into the most rabid exertion of masculinist power - war.

2015-06-09T11:35:52Z,world,World news,Hashem's journey: a lesson in humility and heroism | Patrick Kingsley,"About nine months ago, I was trying to find out how a boat sank in the middle of the Mediterranean, killing most of the 500 migrants who were on board. The story led me and my translator, Manu, to a man called Hashem Alsouki, a 40-year-old Syrian refugee living in an isolated town in the desert outside Cairo. Hashem, his wife, Hayam, and their three young sons had almost got on that boat. But they were arrested on the beach while waiting to board the dinghies that would have taken them to where it was anchored. They escaped a drowning, but were instead locked in an Egyptian police station for more than a week.
As a journalist, you have the privilege of meeting and learning from many inspiring people. Unfortunately, many of them you never meet again. But for some reason, I stayed in touch with Hashem and his family well beyond the publication of that story. I would visit their flat in the desert every few weeks, and bit by bit we became friends. To my shock, earlier this year Hashem said he wanted to risk the sea again. I was amazed, given the trauma of his last attempt. But Hashem was adamant: in febrile Egypt, his three sons have no future. In Europe, they might win one. Hashem did not want to take them with him this time. But he was willing to risk his life in the hope that he would get to Europe, earn asylum and then apply for his family to be reunited with him there. The journalist in me wanted to document this amazing act of heroism, and I will always be humbled that Hashem agreed. So prior to his departure, he let me, Manu and the brilliant photographer Sima Diab even further into his life, to document his final days in Egypt. Once he arrived in Italy, we dropped everything and flew to join him (an almost farcical privilege, given the lengths he had had to go to to get there himself). Then I followed him alone as he made his way through Europe to Sweden.
I don‚Äôt have many heroes, but Hashem is definitely one of them. I‚Äôm honoured to have got the chance to tell his story, and I hope it shines a light on the travails of not just Hashem, but the thousands of other refugees crossing the Mediterranean this year in search of a better life.

2015-06-09T11:25:03Z,world,World news,Ukrainian soldiers killed in land mine blast,"Eight Ukrainian soldiers have been killed ‚Äì seven of them by a single land mine ‚Äì in the past 24 hours in eastern Ukraine where government forces are battling pro-Russia separatists, Kiev‚Äôs military spokesman has said. ‚ÄúWe have lost eight servicemen. One was killed during fighting with rebels while another seven were killed when their vehicle was blown up by a land mine,‚Äù spokesman Andriy Lysenko told Reuters on Tuesday. The land mine explosion took place near Donetsk, he added. The largest city in eastern Ukraine is under the control of the rebels. A ceasefire between the two sides brokered in Minsk in February by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France remains technically in force, but regular skirmishes are claiming lives almost daily on both sides. On Monday Barack Obama used the close of the G7 summit in Germany to deliver his strongest criticism yet of Vladimir Putin, lambasting the Russian president‚Äôs isolationist approach as the seven leaders signalled their readiness to tighten sanctions against Russia if the conflict escalates. ‚ÄúDoes he continue to wreck his country‚Äôs economy and continue Russia‚Äôs isolation in pursuit of a wrong-headed desire to recreate the glories of the Soviet empire? Or does he recognise that Russia‚Äôs greatness does not depend on violating the territorial integrity and sovereignty of other countries?‚Äù the US president said at the close of the intensive discussions in Bavaria as world leaders, including the summit‚Äôs host, Angela Merkel, presented a united front against Putin.
The German chancellor stressed that while she hoped the situation in Ukraine would not worsen, the G7 leaders were prepared to implement tougher sanctions if it did. We are ‚Äúready, should the situation escalate ‚Äì which we don‚Äôt want ‚Äì to strengthen sanctions if the situation makes that necessary but we believe we should do everything to move forward the political process of Minsk‚Äù, Merkel said. Obama warned that if Russia were to ‚Äúdouble down‚Äù on what he called its ‚Äúaggressive behaviour‚Äù in Ukraine, additional steps could be taken. Merkel, who maintained a sporadic line of communication with Putin through the early stages of the conflict, stressed that current sanctions would remain in place until Russia cooperated with implementing the peace plan agreed in Minsk in February. The European members of the G7 ‚Äì Britain, Italy and France ‚Äì said they would support the extension of the main EU sanctions when they meet this month.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-09T09:33:59Z,world,World news,"Brazil‚Äôs economy falters, but worse may be to come","The signs that Brazil‚Äôs economy is in trouble have been visible for a while now, but the worst could be still to come. The figures published last month for gross domestic product in the first quarter of 2015 confirmed the absence of growth that has plagued Latin America‚Äôs powerhouse for the past five years. With GDP down by 0.2% since the new year ‚Äì a fall of 1.6% compared with the same period of 2014 ‚Äì Brazil has registered its worst result in six years. Even if it has actually fared better than the 0.5% drop forecast by the markets, the outlook for the world‚Äôs seventh-largest economy nevertheless looks gloomy. The figures are bad enough to reduce the already limited room for manoeuvre available to the newly appointed and ever so orthodox finance minister, Joaquim Levy. Last month he announced far-reaching austerity measures, with cuts amounting to 69.7bn reals ($22.4bn), prompting an outcry from members of his own party, who want a more flexible line.
The government led by President Dilma Rousseff is expecting a 1.2% fall in GDP, higher than the 1% forecast by the International Monetary Fund. If the first forecast is right, it would be Brazil‚Äôs worst performance in the past 25 years. ‚ÄúEveryone was hoping that the economy would bottom out in the first quarter,‚Äù says economist Paulo Gala, ‚Äúbut confidence is still deteriorating, [and] the volume of road transport is plummeting, as are car sales. The recession seems to be deepening.‚Äù The figures for household spending, which fell by 1.5% in the first quarter, were the most disappointing since 2008 and largely responsible for the overall decline. Falling demand for energy in industry and lower water consumption also played a part. Service sector earnings were down 0.7% on 2014, and government investment and spending dropped 1.3%. With the exception of exports, which rose by 5.7%, and farming, up 4.7%, Brazil has reported a long list of negative macro-economic data. Inflation for the past 12 months is high, at 8.17%, with an 8.26% increase forecast for 2015. The official target is 4.5%. Meanwhile, investment has steadily shrunk over the past two years; production of motor vehicles has dropped by a stunning 20% since January. Although unemployment is still remarkably low, it is rising, with 100,000 jobs lost in April alone. Despite this economic gloom, Levy has managed, with staunch support from the president, to push through measures to balance the budget, before stimulating fresh growth. Shortly after his appointment on 1 January, he undertook to achieve a 1.2% primary budget surplus in 2015, raising it to 2% the following year. Drastic cuts to many budgets followed, including welfare programmes, an unprecedented move since the Workers‚Äô party (PT) came to power in 2003, led by Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva. In its plan for budget adjustment, announced on 22 May, the government has trimmed some of the benefits to which retired public servants and their dependents were entitled. And, after a tussle with Congress, it has tightened up the rules on unemployment benefit, shelved subsidies for electricity utilities and raised various taxes. To curb spending it has also frozen some public-sector investment. Finally, 25.7bn reals ($8.2bn) was sliced off the growth acceleration package, which includes funding for major infrastructure projects ‚Äì previously touted as a flagship programme. At a press conference in Rio de Janeiro last month, Levy nevertheless seemed upbeat, insisting that ‚Äúmuch has changed‚Äù since the new government took office in January. He said the second quarter would be a ‚Äútransition‚Äù, there already being many ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù signs that could bear fruit before the end of the year. He added that the fall in GDP reflected the ‚Äúuncertainty‚Äù in early 2015, a reference no doubt to the tensions and contradictions that have plagued the governing majority for months. Part of a fragile government, dependent on a hostile congress, and with a private sector still reluctant to invest, Levy criticised the PT‚Äôs misgivings and failure to support his initiatives unconditionally. He even complained about growing pressure from close allies of former president Lula to make the fiscal agenda more flexible. Senator Lindbergh Farias was one of the PT stalwarts who voted against Levy‚Äôs plans to rein in unemployment benefits. Farias, known to be close to Lula, told the business daily Valor that ‚Äúthe government is playing with fire‚Äù and should change its strategy, which was driving the country into recession. ‚ÄúPart of what we have achieved in the past 12 years [in power] is under threat,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to believe in this policy, but I can‚Äôt.‚Äù It remains to be seen what will happen after the second-quarter transition.

2015-06-09T08:56:25Z,world,World news,Russia says it will build on Southern Kuril islands seized from Japan,"Japan‚Äôs attempts to resolve a decades-old territorial dispute with Russia took a step backwards this week after Moscow said it would speed up the construction of military facilities on a group of islands claimed by both Moscow and Tokyo. Days after Shinzo Abe became the first Japanese prime minister to visit Ukraine ‚Äì where he voiced support for the country‚Äôs president Petro Poroshenko ‚Äì Russia‚Äôs defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said building work on civilian and military infrastructure on the disputed Southern Kuril islands would be accelerated. Soviet forces seized the islands ‚Äì known in Japan as the Northern Territories ‚Äì 70 years ago towards the end of the second world war. Russia‚Äôs refusal to return them has prevented the two countries from concluding a permanent peace treaty and soured ties between successive Russian and Japanese administrations. Analysts said Shoigu‚Äôs remarks, made during a visit on Monday to the Russian far east city of Vladivostok, were intended to communicate Moscow‚Äôs annoyance at Abe‚Äôs visit to Kiev ahead of last weekend‚Äôs G7 summit in Germany. Japan is already embroiled in a long-running row with China over ownership of the Senkaku islands in the East China Sea, and has backed the Philippines and other South East Asian nations alarmed by the Chinese military build-up near disputed territory in the South China Sea.
During talks with Poroshenko, Abe said he supported the rule of law in Ukraine, amid reports of renewed fighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian rebels. Abe‚Äôs attempts to build closer ties with Russia since he took office in 2012 registered some success until Tokyo threw its weight behind G7 sanctions following Russia‚Äôs annexation of Crimea last year, and increased aid to Ukraine. ‚ÄúWe have attached importance to G7 solidarity,‚Äù Abe said in Kiev. ‚ÄúJapan has maintained sanctions against Russia and urged Russia through dialogue and pressure to play a constructive role.‚Äù In addition, Japan has pledged US$1.84bn (¬£1.2bn) in economic assistance to Ukraine. Poroshenko said Abe‚Äôs visit to Kiev was of great ‚Äúhistoric and symbolic value‚Äù, adding: ‚ÄúWe highly value Japan‚Äôs resolute decision not to recognise Russia‚Äôs annexation of Crimea.‚Äù Abe, though, is still hoping that Russian president Vladimir Putin will visit Japan this year for a summit, with the future of the Northern Territories expected to be high on the agenda. Under Abe, a nationalist whose father, Shintaro Abe, promoted closer ties with Moscow as foreign minister in the 1980s, Japan has refused to budge from its demand that all four islands be returned. Japan has rejected a compromise that would grant Japan sovereignty over the two smallest territories of the Habomai chain and Shikotan, but only after the countries sign a peace treaty. Numerous rounds of talks have failed to bring the two sides closer together. James Brown, an assistant professor at Temple University in Tokyo and an expert on Japan-Russia relations, said: ‚ÄúShoigu‚Äôs statement definitely sent a message to Japan. Japanese officials tried to emphasise the economic side of Abe‚Äôs visit to Ukraine, but the Russians were annoyed.‚Äù A senior Russian official said the Northern Territories could become an obstacle to better economic and diplomatic ties with Japan. ‚ÄúThe issue of territorial claims will only be an irritant in relations and an obstacle to the development of cooperation in other areas, including economy, politics and humanitarian affairs,‚Äù Sergei Naryshkin, speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament, told Rossiya-24 TV last month after an official visit to Japan.
By supporting G7 sanctions against Russia, Japan is hoping to win international understanding for future territorial negotiations with Russia. While France and Germany reportedly approve of Abe‚Äôs desire to discuss the islands with Putin, the US has warned Japan not to seek closer ties with Moscow as long as the Ukraine crisis continues. While Abe has said Putin should visit Tokyo ‚Äúat an appropriate time‚Äù, he conceded that Russia‚Äôs banishment from meetings of major industrialised nations was likely to continue into next year, when the G7 will be held in Japan. Brown played down the prospects of a Putin‚ÄìAbe summit, and for resolution of the Northern Territories dispute. ‚ÄúAbe has said he hopes to make a breakthrough, but at the same time Japan doesn‚Äôt want to risk having Putin here while something flares up in Ukraine,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEven if Putin does come, there‚Äôs not much chance of a deal being made. The Japanese are kidding themselves if they think Russia will return more than the two smallest islands‚Äù, which make up only 7% of the disputed territory. The foreign ministry in Tokyo told the Guardian in a statement that it would monitor any build-up of military facilities on the islands, adding that Japan was committed to resolving postwar disputes through negotiation. Located in the northwest Pacific, the Northern Territories ‚Äì known in Japanese as the Shikotan, Kunashiri, Etorofu and the Habomai islets ‚Äì are surrounded by rich fishing grounds, mineral deposits and possibly offshore oil and gas reserves. Many of the 17,000 Japanese living there at the end of the war were forced to leave. The islands are now inhabited by about 14,000 Russians.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-09T06:48:35Z,world,World news,Ten percent of Rohingya in Burma have fled on boats,"As many as one in 10 of all Rohingya in Burma have fled by boat, making a dangerous voyage with human smugglers who have left them trapped at sea for weeks or forced them into secret jungle camps. The claim is made by Chris Lewa, whose Arakan Project tracks the movement of Rohingya as they have fled persecution over the past three years, cramming into primitive boats as part of a lucrative smuggling trade. ‚ÄúAt least 100,000 Rohingya have left ... which is about 10% of the Rohingya population,‚Äù she told the Guardian by phone. The government of Burma does not recognise the roughly 1.1 million Muslim Rohingya as citizens, creating a stateless people. In 2012, deadly clashes with Buddhists in the western state of Rakhine caused 140,000 Rohingya to flee their homes. Lewa‚Äôs organisation relies on a network of local sources in Burma and Bangladesh, which borders Rakhine, who discreetly count migrant numbers at the point of embarkation. From there Rohingya hope to reach Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Rights groups accuse Burmese authorities of ethnic cleansing, systematically forcing Rohingya Muslims from the country through violence and persecution, a charge the government denies and says is ‚Äúone-sided‚Äù.
‚ÄúThe figures give an idea of the situation after three years,‚Äù Lewa said, adding that her organisation‚Äôs numbers are conservative as there are several other smuggler ports in Burma that are not being monitored. She said Rohingya using land routes are also not counted. ‚ÄúThis does not cover all forced migration of Rohingya,‚Äù she said. Eight five percent of those who have left are young men, Lewa said. This has meant the cost of a dowry for women in Rakhine has soared. Families are now sending their daughters on boats to Malaysia to get married, she said, further compounding the human smuggling tragedy. Crackdown on smuggling A Thai crackdown on illegal detention camps where Rohingya are held along its border with Malaysia in May shook the trade, making it too risky for people smugglers to dock. Smugglers abandoned boats full of migrants in the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea, leaving Rohingya and Bangladeshi migrants thirsty and exposed. Thai, Malaysian and Indonesian authorities have also turned away migrants. Vivian Tan, spokeswoman for the UN refugee agency UNHCR, said the world body was working to triangulate how many people could still be stuck at sea. ‚ÄúOur very rough estimate is that some 2,000 people could still be stranded on smugglers‚Äô boats,‚Äù she told the Guardian by email.
Burma has denied that persecution is the cause of south-east Asia‚Äôs migrant crisis. The Rohingya are refused citizenship in Burma and face restrictions on movement, family size and jobs. Authorities consider them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, despite many living in ethnically diverse Burma for generations. The country has said that it is cracking down on smuggling. The state-backed Global New Light of Myanmar reported on Monday that Burmese police had arrested 93 people for human trafficking offences this year, but said no arrests were made in Rakhine state, from where the Rohingya have been fleeing. ‚ÄúThere have been no reports of human trafficking cases in ‚Ä¶ Rakhine state this year,‚Äù the newspaper said. The persecution of the Rohingya has stalled Burma‚Äôs attempts to open to the world after nearly 50 years of military rule. US president Barack Obama has made a personal effort to promote Burma‚Äôs transition to democracy, travelling there twice in the past three years. ‚ÄúI think one of the most important things is to put an end to discrimination against people because of what they look like or what their faith is. And the Rohingya have been discriminated against. And that‚Äôs part of the reason they‚Äôre fleeing,‚Äù he said this month. The issue of the Rohingya is sensitive in Burma, and anti-Rohingya rallies have taken place in the capital this year. Even Burma‚Äôs opposition leader and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has not spoken out against her country‚Äôs treatment of the minority group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-09T06:31:05Z,world,World news,Iceland to lift capital controls to help boost economy,"Iceland will impose a tax on creditors seeking to reclaim assets from the country‚Äôs failed banks, as it unwinds capital controls imposed at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. In an attempt to prevent foreign investors rushing en masse to withdraw billions currently frozen in Iceland‚Äôs financial system, withdrawals will be subject to a 39% tax. ‚ÄúToday is a milestone, a very happy milestone,‚Äù Iceland‚Äôs finance minister Bjarni Benediktsson said. The government, he said, was ‚Äútackling a cloud in the economic sky in Iceland‚Äù and laying foundations for better living conditions and economic growth. ‚ÄúI expect we will see a complete change of the landscape in 6-12 months,‚Äù he told the Guardian. Currently, Icelandic pension funds are unable to invest abroad and access to foreign currency for holidays is tightly controlled. Capital controls were introduced in November 2008 after the failure of the Icelandic banking system brought the country to the brink of financial meltdown. The three largest banks ‚Äì Glitnir, Landsbanki and Kaupthing ‚Äì collapsed in October 2008, having amassed assets worth 10 times more than Iceland‚Äôs annual economic output. The government hopes ending the controls will allow the country to draw a line under the financial crisis, which poisoned relations with European neighbours. It fell out with the UK and the Netherlands over bank guarantees given to British and Dutch savers who had ploughed money into Icesave, part of Landsbanki‚Äôs international banking operations. After Landsbanki collapsed and its guarantees proved worthless, the British and Dutch governments had to use their own taxpayer funds to compensate ordinary savers, triggering a rancorous four-year legal dispute.
In 2013, an international court upheld Iceland‚Äôs decision not to reimburse British and Dutch governments, raising questions about the effectiveness of bank-guarantee schemes. However, 85% of UK claims have now been repaid. Iceland‚Äôs finance minister Benediktsson said he expected all UK claims to be settled by the end of the year. Iceland‚Äôs economy is now growing again, boosted by tourism and the fishing industry. The International Monetary Fund said in March that the government had made good progress in improving financial stability but gaps remained in banking supervision and financial safety nets. On Sunday, Iceland‚Äôs parliament voted 56-0, with one abstention, in favour of a plan seen as paving the way for the end of capital controls. Although the measures tighten controls on some transactions related to failed banks, they are intended to stop people circumventing the controls before they are finally lifted. Capital controls were imposed on the advice of the International Monetary Fund, which provided Iceland with a $2.1bn (¬£1.4bn) loan at the height of the financial crisis to stave off economic collapse. The controls, introduced to protect the krona, were intended to expire after six months but have been in place for more than six years. They quickly became a headache for the centre-right government, which was elected in April 2013, on a promise of ending austerity and bringing debt relief to households. The Icelandic authorities are keen to ensure capital controls do not become a permanent fixture, because they deter foreign investment and increase borrowing costs. But lifting them too quickly could jeopardise the country‚Äôs fragile economic recovery. Around 1,200 billion Icelandic krona are frozen as a result of capital controls, the equivalent of $9bn or ¬£5.8bn, although currency controls mean there is no precise exchange rate. If investors decided to withdraw their money en-masse, Iceland could be plunged into a balance-of-payments crisis, sparking a wave of bankruptcies and cash-flow problems. ‚ÄúThere is not sufficient foreign currency to release 1,200bn [krona] in foreign currency,‚Äù said Benedikt G√≠slason, an advisor to the government on capital controls. ‚ÄúThe Icelandic economy would not survive.‚Äù Critics have argued that Iceland could become embroiled in years of legal wrangling over the tax plans, but Benediktsson said he thought legal challenges were unlikely. ‚ÄúIt would not be in the Icelandic interests to be dragged into a long legal battle, but if it is challenged we will defend it.‚Äù The government expects to raise 850bn Icelandic krona from the tax, which will be levied in April 2016. Investors in Icelandic assets could also reinvest their capital in newer government debt that will be convertible out of crowns at maturity. ‚Ä¢ This article was amended on 10 June 2015 to correct a conversion of krona to sterling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-08T22:24:17Z,world,World news,Yemen drone strike lawsuit forces US to face non-western 'war on terror' victims,"If Barack Obama can publicly apologize for the accidental killings of two al-Qaida hostages ‚Äì one American and one Italian ‚Äì by a US drone strike, the White House should extend the same courtesy to a pair of Yemeni civilians killed by US Hellfire missiles. That is the hope of the wrongful death lawsuit filed late on Sunday by the families of Salem bin Ali Jaber and Waleed bin Ali Jaber, two men killed by a US drone strike in August 2012 in the eastern Yemeni village of Khashamir. And although it‚Äôs unclear if the case will even be heard, human rights groups who have long criticized the use of armed and unmanned aircrafts for counterterrorism operations believe the families of the two victims were left with no other option but to sue.
‚ÄúIn terms of exhaustion of remedies, we‚Äôve tried everything,‚Äù Alka Pradhan, a counter-terrorism counsel for Reprieve US who has represented the families, told the Guardian in a phone interview. Pradhan added that Obama‚Äôs apology in April over the deaths of American development expert Warren Weinstein and Italian aid worker Giovanni Lo Porto, two hostages being held by al-Qaida at a compound in Pakistan, showed a double standard for how western lives are treated as opposed to civilians in countries ravaged by the broader ‚Äúwar on terror‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe saw the president get up on a podium at the White House and give a statement talking about the horrible mistake that had been made by the US, and the lengths to which the US government was going to go to make that mistake right for the families,‚Äù said Pradhan, pointing out that in nearly three years there had been no such remorse shown over the killings of Salem and Waleed. The families ‚Äúhave basically been begging for an acknowledgment of exactly that kind. The message of over two years is that their lives ‚Äì the lives of Yemeni citizens ‚Äì don‚Äôt matter as much as those of western lives‚Äù. A spokesman for the US national security council did not immediately return a request for comment. Obama‚Äôs recognition in April of the hostage killings was an unprecedented admission for the US government, which typically keeps information surrounding its drone policy shrouded in secrecy. While the Obama administration has long insisted that the lethal use of drones occurs with as much precision and intelligence available, the revelations were a rare moment in which the White House conceded the CIA does not always know whom it specifically seeks to kill. The president, who has faced criticism for the trail of civilian deaths left by record drone strikes under his watch, expressed his ‚Äúprofound regret‚Äù over Weinstein‚Äôs and Lo Porto‚Äôs deaths, called for an investigation of what went wrong, and announced compensation for the hostages‚Äô families. Relatives of Salem and Waleed received $155,000 in compensation from the Yemeni government last year, which human rights groups like Reprieve have said came from the US government. But the families, who are not seeking financial compensation in their 43-page lawsuit, said they want only to clear the names of two men whom civil liberties advocates have dubbed ‚Äúmodel citizens‚Äù ‚Äì Salem was a cleric who preached against al-Qaida, Waleed a police officer. Both men were inadvertently killed amid a meeting with three youths, who had requested a meeting with Salem near a local mosque. Drone operators said they had evidence that the three youths were members of al-Qaida, leading them to assume the same of Salem and Waleed at the time of the strike, according to the New York Times. US courts have a mixed record with respect to drones. Last year, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit against the Obama administration over a drone strike in Yemen in 2011 that killed three US citizens, including the teenage son of former al-Qaida leader Anwar al-Awlaki. An appeals court nonetheless released a redacted version of a long-secret Department of Justice memo that lays out the legal rationale for targeting American citizens overseas. Legal experts declined to speculate on whether the case of Salem and Waled would be heard. But Pardiss Kebriaei, a senior attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, said the lawsuit is significant because it ‚Äúputs a face on some of the hundreds of Yemenis killed by US drones‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt gives further lie to the claim that they‚Äôre all ‚Äòmilitants‚Äô killed in precision strikes. It raises basic questions we need to keep asking about the legality and efficacy of these strikes,‚Äù Kebriaei said, adding that the ‚Äúknee-jerk reaction‚Äù of the US government has been to frame any legal challenge over its torture, detention and counterterrorism practices within the context of its ‚Äúwar on terror‚Äù. The goal has been ‚Äúto prevent claimants from being heard at all, and the lower courts have largely deferred, but that‚Äôs not a track record to be proud of. The government isn‚Äôt defending its conduct on the merits and winning. It‚Äôs simply slamming the door in victims‚Äô faces‚Äù. Letta Tayler, a senior researcher on terrorism and counter-terrorism at Human Rights Watch, said regardless of whether the strike was lawful or unlawful, it ‚Äúclearly was counterproductive, and the US silence compounds the backlash‚Äù. ‚ÄúThis case serves as an important reminder that the Obama administration can‚Äôt keep hiding its head in the sand and only acknowledge accidental deaths of westerners in its secret drones program, as if the Yemeni and Pakistani civilians it kills in such strikes simply did not exist,‚Äù said Tayler in an email. ‚ÄúPresident Obama should immediately grant their request, apologize, and publish the findings of US investigations into this strike, and he should offer compensation as well.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs shocking that family members would have to take a request as basic as an acknowledgement of death of loved ones to a court almost halfway around the world, simply because they are not American.‚Äù In April, a collaborative report from the Open Society Justice Initiative and researchers from the Yemeni nongovernmental organization Mwatana Organization for Human Rights documented nine US air strikes between May 2012 and April 2014 that caused civilian harm. While the US government has said reports of civilian casualties are inflated by outside groups, the report cited several drone strikes that killed innocent civilians based on interviews with victims and their relatives, eyewitnesses, doctors and hospital staff. Among them were a US drone strike that killed 12 people, including a pregnant woman and three children, as well as another strike on a house that contained 19 people, including women and children.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-08T20:26:38Z,world,World news,'El Bronco' wins historic election as Mexico's first independent governor,"Mexico‚Äôs president, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, has fought off the political crisis surrounding his government, results from Sunday‚Äôs election show, after the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) secured the biggest block in the country‚Äôs national congress ‚Äì and a shot at a working majority thanks to alliances with smaller parties. But the nationwide poll also brought landslide victories for independent candidates in two key local votes, reflecting public disgust at a party political system which critics say has lost touch with the country‚Äôs citizens. In a simultaneous local election in the country‚Äôs richest region, Nuevo Leon, an independent candidate made history, becoming the country‚Äôs first elected state governor not affiliated with either Pe√±a Nieto‚Äôs PRI or the opposition National Action party (PAN). ‚ÄúThis is a very good result for Pe√±a Nieto who was saved from the election becoming a referendum on him and his government,‚Äù said political analyst Jesus Silva-Herzog M√°rquez. ‚ÄúBut the victory of independents is an important shakeup that obliges us to think about elections differently for the future.‚Äù With 87% of the ballots counted, the PRI had about 29% of the vote in the midterm elections. The share was lower than in the 2012 general election, but better than many had predicted following months of public anger at rampant violence, a sluggish economy and a series of corruption allegations stretching right up to the president. Analysts said the PRI‚Äôs success was also a reflection of a failure of opposition parties to capitalize on discontent ‚Äì not least because they have also been hurt by numerous scandals. Meanwhile the PAN obtained just 21%. The leftwing Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, polled a disastrous 11%, thanks to the defection of former presidential candidate Andres Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, whose newly formed party Morena won a very respectable 8.5%. The PRI‚Äôs position is further strengthened by the success of its staunch but controversial ally, the Green party, which won 7%. Throughout the election campaign, the Greens lived up to their reputation of political dirty tricks and opportunism, repeatedly breaking rules on political advertising despite several fines from the electoral authorities. The allegations of unfair play continued on election day itself after national football team manager Miguel Herrera tweeted ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going with the Greens‚Äù to his 1.4 million followers hours ahead of a friendly match with Brazil. Herrera has denied any wrongdoing, saying he was merely expressing his personal opinion. Support from the Greens and other smaller parties may be enough for Pe√±a Nieto to build a working majority in congress, but results from simultaneous regional elections reflected voters‚Äô disaffection with mainstream parties.
In the border state of Nuevo Leon, the independent candidate Jaime Rodriguez ‚Äì campaigning as ‚ÄúEl Bronco‚Äù ‚Äì won 48% of the vote in a gubernatorial election, despite a shoestring campaign and the overt opposition of most local media outlets. Candidates from the PRI and the PAN each won less than half of that. ‚ÄúThere will be no more corruption,‚Äù he told his victory rally. ‚ÄúNobody else will be able to steal one more peso of public money without going to prison.‚Äù Enrique Alfaro, another maverick candidate attached to a tiny new party called Citizen Movement, obtained a similarly overwhelming triumph in the election for mayor of Guadalajara, the country‚Äôs second largest city. While the victory of independent candidates has the potential to shake up future elections, including the 2018 presidential poll, Sunday‚Äôs elections also contained more radical and immediate reminders to Pe√±a Nieto that the second half of his six-year term is unlikely to be comfortable. Protesters attacked polling stations and burned ballot papers in several southern states. The tension was highest in the drug war-torn Guerrero, the state in which 43 student teachers disappeared after they were attacked by local police allied with a drug cartel, and in Oaxaca, where radical teachers have led a string of protests against educational reform. The disruption, however, fell far short of the catastrophic levels teachers had threatened, leading to speculation about secret deals reached in 11th-hour negotiations with the government. Pe√±a Nieto‚Äôs government has repeatedly been accused of depending on back-room deals to secure short-term solutions for long-term problems. ‚ÄúThese elections give the government the possibility of saying that, while there are lots of complaints, we are doing fine and there is no need to change the way we do things,‚Äù said analyst Silva-Herzog. But, he added: ‚ÄúThis election widens the gulf between the governing group and those who criticize it.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-08T19:41:25Z,world,World news,Obama lambasts Putin: you're wrecking Russia to recreate Soviet empire,"Barack Obama has used the close of the G7 summit in Germany to deliver his strongest criticism yet of Vladimir Putin, lambasting the Russian president‚Äôs isolationist approach as the seven leaders signalled their readiness to tighten sanctions against Russia if the conflict in Ukraine escalates. ‚ÄúDoes he continue to wreck his country‚Äôs economy and continue Russia‚Äôs isolation in pursuit of a wrong-headed desire to recreate the glories of the Soviet empire? Or does he recognise that Russia‚Äôs greatness does not depend on violating the territorial integrity and sovereignty of other countries?‚Äù the US president said at the close of the intensive discussions in Bavaria as world leaders, including the summit‚Äôs host, Angela Merkel, presented a united front against Putin. The German chancellor stressed that while she hoped the situation in Ukraine would not worsen, the G7 leaders were prepared to implement tougher sanctions if it did. We are ‚Äúready, should the situation escalate ‚Äì which we don‚Äôt want ‚Äì to strengthen sanctions if the situation makes that necessary but we believe we should do everything to move forward the political process of Minsk‚Äù, Merkel said. Obama warned that if Russia were to ‚Äúdouble down‚Äù on what he called its ‚Äúaggressive behaviour‚Äù in Ukraine, ‚Äúadditional steps‚Äù could be taken.
Merkel, who maintained a sporadic line of communication with Putin through the early stages of the conflict, stressed that current sanctions would remain in place until Russia cooperated with implementing a peace plan agreed in Minsk in February. The European members of the G7 ‚Äì Britain, Italy and France ‚Äì said they would support the extension of the main EU sanctions when they meet later this month. Obama had come to Bavaria on Sunday with the intention of pushing for a tougher approach to Russia. And while Merkel was keen to stress that the Ukraine crisis had not dominated the two days of talks, it was certainly the uppermost topic in the coverage. Russia was suspended from the G8 last year over its occupation and annexation of Ukraine‚Äôs Crimea region and its backing of separatists in eastern Ukraine. The G7 leaders pledged to intensify their support for Ukraine‚Äôs reform and economic growth programmes, but refused to be drawn on the subject of military aid. Some of them already deliver support under bilateral agreements.
In its 17-page communique, the G7 warned: ‚ÄúWe also stand ready to take further restrictive measures in order to increase [the] cost on Russia should its actions so require.‚Äù Obama said it was wrong of Putin to suggest he was protecting the Russian speakers in Ukraine, saying: ‚ÄúRussian speakers inside Ukraine are precisely the ones who are bearing the brunt of the fighting.‚Äù A Kremlin spokesman said earlier in the day that while Russia had paid attention to the latest threats of sanctions, the G7 had produced no ‚Äúnew theses‚Äù.
Dmitry Peskov said he believed the G7 leaders were far from united in their approach to Russia. ‚ÄúWe also draw attention to the fact that among the participants of this meeting there are nuances in their approaches. Some talk about the need for dialogue with Russia and the impossibility of solving serious problems without this dialogue, so we continue watching closely,‚Äù he said. Speaking elsewhere on Monday, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said that western countries were obliged to ensure that Kiev also stuck by the terms of the Minsk agreement it had agreed on, including withdrawing heavy weapons and allowing more autonomy in separatist-held regions. ‚ÄúWe proceed from the point of view that Germany and France, other colleagues in the EU and the United States ‚Ä¶ work with the Ukrainian authorities, encouraging them to honestly fully implement the Minsk agreements,‚Äù he told a press conference. Merkel said that in discussions with leaders from African countries and Iraq, the delegates had ‚Äúagreed to work together to further combat terrorism‚Äù.
Meanwhile it emerged that Russian trolls have been attacking an Instagram account newly-opened by Merkel before the summit, to which she had posted more than 50 photographs. Many of the comments were critical of her and praised Putin. Some warned that Russians would ‚Äúsoon be in Berlin again‚Äù in revenge for Merkel‚Äôs criticism of Putin. Elsewhere the G7 agreed on climate change reforms, including the phasing out of fossil fuels by the end of the century, and pledged to eradicate extreme poverty by 2050. A protest planned to round off the summit fizzled out after organisers complained of fatigue. But the environmental pressure group Greenpeace secured the most publicity of all the protests, with the message it projected in a green laser beam on the escarpment of a local mountain, reading: ‚ÄúG7: Go for 100 per cent renewables.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-08T19:39:06Z,world,World news,"Explainer: US abortion rates drop, but data and reasons behind it are complex","Anti-abortion activists say it‚Äôs a vindication for restricting access to abortion. Reproductive-rights advocates say it‚Äôs all about expanded access to contraception. A new survey from the Associated Press finds abortion rates are down across America and ‚Äì as is almost always the case in debates over abortion ‚Äì the truth is more complicated than that. States with stringent anti-abortion restrictions ‚Äì like Oklahoma and Missouri ‚Äì and those with more liberal reproductive laws ‚Äì like New York and Oregon ‚Äì both saw a marked decrease in abortions between 2010 and 2014, according to the AP. Of the 45 states surveyed, only two ‚Äì Michigan and Louisiana, both of which have imposed numerous restrictions on women‚Äôs access to the procedure ‚Äì saw abortion rates rise during the same period. To put the new survey in broader context, the Guardian caught up with Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues associate at the Guttmacher Institute, a Washington-based thinktank that focuses on sexual and reproductive health. What do you make of the reported drop in US abortion rates? Elizabeth Nash: US abortion numbers have been going down pretty much since the 1980s ‚Äì just about 1982. You have to keep that in mind when you‚Äôre talking about the AP-reported decline. We saw the downward trend kind of stall out in the mid-2000s, but from 2008 to 2011 there was a pretty noticeable decline in the abortion rate.
What the AP seemed to do was go to state health departments and ask for the latest figures on abortions. They got data from 45 states, some reports from 2013 and some from 2014. This is very similar to the Centers for Disease Control‚Äôs methods, though the data is newer. The AP‚Äôs survey is different because they were comparing across several different years and not just one. Do we know why the abortion rate is on the decline? We don‚Äôt know why for this most recent period. But we have data through 2011. Back then, we were able to see that contraception played a significant role. For the period from 2008 to 2011, it looked like the recession had something to do with whether people chose to become pregnant, too. People were putting it off, thinking, ‚Äúmaybe I will do this in a year‚Äù or ‚Äúmaybe I shouldn‚Äôt have my second child right now‚Äù. Since then, there‚Äôs been a renewed interest in family planning, as well as long-acting contraceptive methods [editor‚Äôs note: IUDs and implants]. This could be a contributing factor. Researchers [at Guttmacher or the CDC] haven‚Äôt been able to pull together all the data for the period at which the AP is looking ‚Äì 2012, 2013 and 2014 ‚Äì yet, which makes it hard to know what‚Äôs going on there. And you have to think about pregnancy rates, too, not just abortion.
The issue is: are there fewer unintended pregnancies for that period? Or are fewer women getting pregnant overall? Or is there a population that is getting pregnant less often, like teens? There are a lot of pregnancy issues to think about which have not been unpacked yet. The other issue that needs to be considered is the effect of different laws and initiatives in different states. Some states are pursuing increased access to family planning services, and they‚Äôre seeing a decline. But so are states that are adopting piles of abortion restrictions where clinics are closing. We need to investigate whether both of those approaches are contributing to a decline in abortion. Do we know how state laws restricting abortion, which were passed in record numbers over the past five years, affected abortion rates? In the past couple of years, we‚Äôve seen abortion clinics close at a rapid clip, like in Texas and Ohio. A few have closed in Tennessee and Virginia, too. That has an impact on access, which could play a role in those states‚Äô reduced abortion rate, though it would not explain it in others. But if you close the clinics you‚Äôre doing nothing to reduce need. Simply reducing the number of abortions without limiting need isn‚Äôt a good public health policy. What you want to do is be able to reduce unintended pregnancies overall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-08T18:44:22Z,world,World news,Forget the G7 summit ‚Äì Bilderberg is where the big guns go,"As one summit closes, another opens. Thursday sees the start of the influential Bilderberg policy conference, which this year is being held in Austria, just 16 miles south of the G7 summit, and in a similarly inaccessible luxury alpine resort. The participant list for the conference has just been released by the organisation, and some big names leap off the page. No fewer than three serving European prime ministers will be attending, from the Netherlands, Finland and Belgium. They will be discussing ‚ÄúEuropean strategy‚Äù with the head of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, and the president of Austria, Heinz Fischer. Two European finance ministers are on the list: one Dutch, the other George Osborne. The UK chancellor is a regular attendee of the Bilderberg summit, and this year he will be showing off his post-election glow. Unlike that other Bilderberg regular, Ed Balls, who is being invited back despite having by some considerable distance the weakest job title on the list: ‚Äúformer shadow chancellor of the exchequer.
Europe‚Äôs hottest financial potato, Greece, is on the conference agenda, and it‚Äôs good to know Beno√Æt Coeur√©, a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, will be there to discuss it in strictest privacy with interested parties, such as the heads of Deutsche Bank, Lazard, Banco Santander and HSBC. The scandal-hit HSBC and everyone‚Äôs favourite vampire squid, Goldman Sachs, are both extremely well represented at this year‚Äôs conference. HSBC in particular by its chairman, its busy chief legal officer, and board member Rona Fairhead, who is also on the board of PepsiCo and chair of the BBC Trust. Good to know the BBC is in such safe hands. Other financial luminaries on the list include the vice-chairman of BlackRock, the CEO of JP Morgan Asset Management and the president of the Royal Bank of Canada, which is the nation‚Äôs largest financial institution. Morgan Stanley will be represented in Telfs by board member Klaus Kleinfeld, who also runs the world‚Äôs third largest aluminium producer, Alcoa. From the worlds of industry and manufacturing are some eye-wateringly big names. The CEO of Michelin is invited, along with the head of Roche, the CEO of Royal Dutch Shell, the chairman of BP, the CEO of Siemens Austria and the heads of various industrial conglomerates such as Techint and Investor AB, companies so large they‚Äôre hard to classify. Although ‚Äúgigantic‚Äù goes some way towards it. It‚Äôs a heady step up into the big league for Michael O‚ÄôLeary, the CEO of Ryanair. He‚Äôll doubtless be hoping to thrash out a few last-minute deals over dinner with the head of Airbus, Thomas Enders. Apart from making holiday jets, Airbus is also one of the world‚Äôs biggest arms manufacturers, and the 2015 conference agenda has a distinct whiff of war. Chemical weapons threats and Nato are both set to be discussed. Luckily the head of Nato is there to discuss it. As ever, foreign policy formation is a big part of the conference. Terrorism and Iran both make the agenda this year, and participants can expect a high-level briefing from senior US State Department official John R Allen, the special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter Isil. And it‚Äôs likely that the subject of Russia will be of interest to the German defence minister and deputy defence minister, both of whom have found the time this week to be in Telfs. As has the head of the Danish intelligence service, who will likely have a part to play in the session of cybersecurity.
Finally, it‚Äôs worth noting the growing presence of Google at Bilderberg. The company‚Äôs executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, is on the group‚Äôs steering committee; he‚Äôll be joined in Austria by his vice-president for engineering, advanced technology and projects, and the vice-president of engineering for the not-at-all terrifying sounding Google DeepMind. They, presumably, will be leading the session on artificial intelligence. This will be listened to with great interest by Peter Thiel, the founder of PayPal and director of Facebook, as he continues his quest to merge with computers. But that‚Äôs another story. For now, the story is: Bilderberg 2015 has an extremely high-powered participant list, featuring a large number of senior politicians and public figures. With participants this powerful, and an agenda containing this many hot topics, the Telfs policy conference is sure to be covered in depth by the world‚Äôs press. And by ‚Äúsure to be‚Äù, I mean probably won‚Äôt be. For reasons that, as ever, escape me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-08T18:14:54Z,world,World news,Selahattin Demirta≈ü: thumbing his nose at political convention in Turkey,"When Selahattin Demirta≈ü shrugged off the formal traditions of Turkish political campaigning and went on a television talk show equipped with a saz, a Turkish folk guitar, Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan sensed an opportunity to land a blow. The co-leader of the Peoples‚Äô Democratic party (HDP), sniffed the Turkish president, was a mere ‚Äúpop star‚Äù. But, far from hurting Demirta≈ü, the remark merely served to highlight Erdoƒüan‚Äôs fear of the 42-year-old‚Äôs youthful, telegenic appeal and sense of humour. His musical performance was just one of the ways in which Demirta≈ü ‚Äì the man who has done more than anyone to thwart Erdoƒüan‚Äôs aspirations to build an all-powerful presidency ‚Äì achieved electoral breakthrough by thumbing his nose at political convention. In Sunday‚Äôs parliamentary elections, the HDP broadened beyond its Kurdish roots, to become a liberal umbrella group with particular appeal to women, gay men and lesbians, anxious about Erdoƒüan‚Äôs growing power and deepening conservatism.
In May, Demirta≈ü invited the television cameras into his home, where he made a leisurely Turkish breakfast for his wife, Ba≈üak, and their two daughters. ‚ÄúBreakfast is the only time we truly enjoy each other‚Äôs company,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAfter that everyone goes to either school or work.‚Äù Born in the majority-Kurdish town of Elazƒ±ƒü in 1973, Demirta≈ü did not, however, grow up as a separatist. He says he only became aware of his ethnic identity at the age of 15 when he went to the funeral of a prominent Kurdish politician believed to have been murdered by security forces in Diyarbakir, the country‚Äôs main Kurdish city. Unidentified gunmen opened fire on the mourners, killing eight. ‚ÄúThis was when I learned what it meant to be a Kurd,‚Äù he told Turkish media in an interview last year. Although his brother Nurettin joined the insurgent nationalist PKK party, and was jailed for his membership, Demirta≈ü remained a moderate. When history repeated itself and an HDP rally was bombed in Diyarbakir last month, Demirta≈ü appealed to his followers for calm. He studied law at Ankara University and began his career as a human rights activist, becoming a founding member of the Turkish Human Rights Association. He entered politics eight years ago as a member of the Democratic Society party, a forerunner to the HDP closed down by an order of the supreme court two years later. In 2012, he came to London as part of a Kurdish delegation to highlight the plight of Turkish lawyers who had been jailed for defending dissidents and opposition politicians, and to argue the case of Syria‚Äôs Kurds during the early months of the Syrian civil war.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-08T17:34:27Z,world,World news,Reeva Steenkamp parents condemn decision to free Oscar Pistorius on parole,"The parents of Reeva Steenkamp, who was shot dead by her boyfriend, Oscar Pistorius, have condemned a decision to free the Paralympian on parole in August when he will have served just 10 months in prison. Pistorius, jailed for five years last October for culpable homicide, the South African equivalent of manslaughter, will be eligible for release to house arrest having served a sixth of his sentence and shown good behaviour.
But the parole board at his prison overruled an emotional plea from the 29-year-old victim‚Äôs parents when it sat last week. In their submission, Barry and June Steenkamp said: ‚ÄúWe have forgiven Mr Pistorius even though he took the life of our precious daughter, Reeva. Our lives will never be the same as we live with the sadness of her death every day. ‚ÄúReeva had so much to offer this world and we were all robbed of her life when she was killed. As her family, we do not seek to avenge her death and we do not want Mr Pistorius to suffer; that will not bring her back to us. However, a person found guilty of a crime must be held accountable for their actions.‚Äù The Steenkamps added: ‚ÄúStatistics show that our society is under continuous attack from criminals and murderers. Incarceration of 10 months for taking a life is simply not enough. We fear that this will not send out the proper message and serve as the deterrent it should.‚Äù Pistorius, now 28, became a global sports star known as the Blade Runner after competing in the Paralympics and Olympics on prosthetic limbs. He killed Steenkamp, a model and law graduate, by shooting four times through a locked toilet door at his home in Pretoria on Valentine‚Äôs Day 2013. In a trial that gripped millions, the court accepted his explanation that he had mistaken her for a burglar and therefore did not convict him of murder. Due to his physical disability, Pistorius has been held since 21 October in the hospital ward of Kgosi Mampuru II prison in Pretoria. On Monday the Department of Correctional Services said the prison‚Äôs parole board had met last week ‚Äúand approved the placement of Oscar Pistorius under correctional supervision with effect from 21 August 2015‚Äù. This is in line with legislation stating that ‚Äúan offender may serve only one sixth of his/her sentence in custody, and continue to serve the remaining period of the sentence under correctional supervision‚Äù, it added. ‚ÄúThe family of the victim was invited and participated in the deliberations‚Äù of the parole board. Legal experts say the recommendation is highly unlikely to be opposed. It means that Pistorius will probably be switched to house arrest with one hour of free time each day, and gradually these conditions will be relaxed, for example allowing him to go to church but not socialise at night. The Steenkamps declined to comment further on Monday but their lawyer, Tania Koen, said: ‚ÄúThey are shocked by the fact that Oscar Pistorius will be receiving parole and going out on 21 August. They don‚Äôt think 10 months is enough for taking a life. Whether it was Reeva behind the door or anybody else behind that door, it doesn‚Äôt send out a proper message and it doesn‚Äôt serve as a deterrent.‚Äù June Steenkamp was discharged from hospital on Sunday after a major operation, Koen added. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not in a good place. She‚Äôs very fragile at the moment.‚Äù The parole decision has been condemned by gender rights activists, who note that South Africa has one of the highest rates of intimate partner homicide in the world. In 2009 it was estimated that a woman was killed by her husband or boyfriend every eight hours ‚Äì more commonly than by strangers. Rachel Jewkes, director of gender and health research at the South African Medical Research Council, said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a complete travesty. It sends out a message that, with the right resources, you can kill a woman with impunity. It‚Äôs a setback for the campaign against gender violence in South Africa. ‚ÄúThere have been some very high-profile cases recently serving to remind us what a terrific problem we have of men killing their nearest and dearest in this country.‚Äù Jewkes added: ‚ÄúI feel hugely for Reeva‚Äôs parents going through the trauma of the loss and the trauma of the trial and now this terrible sense that justice has not been done.‚Äù But Pistorius cannot take freedom for granted. It was also announced on Monday that an appeal against his culpable homicide conviction will be heard in November, when prosecutors will argue that judge Thokozile Masipa misinterpreted the law and should have found him guilty of murder.

2015-06-08T17:29:08Z,world,World news,Record number of women elected to Turkish parliament,"Dilek √ñcalan, niece of Abdullah √ñcalan, the jailed founder of the Kurdistan Workers‚Äô party (PKK), is one of a record number of female MPs entering the Turkish parliament. A total of 96 women won seats in Turkey‚Äôs Grand National Assembly in Sunday‚Äôs elections, bringing the proportion of female deputies to a historic high of 17%, compared with 14% after the 2011 elections.
Abdullah √ñcalan is serving a life sentence for his role as one of the founders of the Kurdish separatist PKK, which in the 1980s was involved in armed conflict in which an estimated 40,000 people died. Dilek √ñcalan, 28, of the pro-Kurdish Peoples‚Äô Democratic party (HDP), was elected in ≈ûanlƒ±urfa, in the country‚Äôs south near the Syrian border. The result there is illustrative of how the HDP cut into the vote of the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) in Kurdish regions. In 2011 the AKP won 10 of the available 12 seats in ≈ûanlƒ±urfa; this year it won seven, with the HDP picking up the remaining five. The HDP is the first pro-Kurdish party to achieve more than 10% of the national vote, the threshold for parliamentary representation. It won 80 seats while the AKP failed to amass the 276 required to form a majority government.
The HDP campaigned on leftwing issues such as raising the minimum wage and improving access to university education, and on a platform of gender equality, promising to create a ministry of women and make International Women‚Äôs Day a national holiday. The party has male and female co-chairs and a near-50% quota for female candidates and 10% quota for LGBT candidates. It charges women half as much as men to stand as candidates. Such policies are yielding results: 268 of the HDP‚Äôs 550 candidates were women, and 31 (39%) of its 80 elected MPs.
Along with √ñcalan, the party‚Äôs female MPs include Leyla Zana, a Kurdish politician who spent 10 years in jail after she was deemed to be ‚Äúagainst the unity of the country‚Äù because of her political activism. Zana was first elected in 1991, becoming the first Kurdish woman to win a seat in the Grand National Assembly, and caused controversy by speaking in Kurdish at her swearing-in. At the time it was illegal to speak Kurdish in public places, and until that year it had been illegal to speak Kurdish even in private. Another notable election winner is ≈ûafak Pavey, of the Republican People‚Äôs party (CHP), who retained her seat in Istanbul. Pavey worked as a journalist and then for the United Nations before embarking on her political career. She lost her left arm and left leg in a train accident in Switzerland when she was 20 and was the first disabled woman to be elected to the Turkish parliament. Almost all the parties increased their proportion of female MPs at this election. The CHP, the main opposition party with 25% of the vote, now has 20 female MPs out of its total of 132 (15%), up from 19 out of 135 (14%) at the last election. The ruling AKP has 41 female MPs, down from 46 in 2011 but an improvement from 14% to 16% of its total. Only the Nationalist Movement party (MHP) saw a proportional decrease, from three out of 53 in 2011 to four out of 80 this time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-08T17:00:56Z,world,World news,Sweden's foreign minister unrepentant over Saudi flogging row,"Sweden‚Äôs foreign minister has said she stands by her denunciation of a Saudi blogger‚Äôs flogging as medieval, three months after her criticism of the Gulf kingdom‚Äôs human rights record ignited a diplomatic crisis and infuriated business leaders fearful for trade losses.
Margot Wallstr√∂m, who vowed to pursue a feminist foreign policy when taking office last year, first hit out at the treatment of Raif Badawi earlier this year after the first 50 of 1,000 lashes was inflicted on him in January for allegedly insulting Islam. Saudi Arabia reacted furiously to her comments, blocking a speech she was due to give on women‚Äôs rights to Arab leaders and temporarily breaking off relations with Sweden. But speaking on Monday, a day after it emerged that Saudi Arabia‚Äôs highest court had upheld Badawi‚Äôs punishment, Wallstr√∂m said she was unrepentant and said again that the flogging amounted to medieval methods. ‚ÄúI would not have done things differently,‚Äù Wallstr√∂m told the Guardian when asked about her handling of the crisis in March, which also saw Stockholm tear up an arms trade agreement with the Saudis. ‚ÄúNo, I do not regret the medieval remark; we have not excused ourselves. But we have explained that this was not an attack on Islam.‚Äù
Her words suggested that the criticism Wallstr√∂m faced at home from business leaders concerned about damage to Sweden‚Äôs reputation ‚Äì and to its $900m annual trade with Riyadh ‚Äì had not made her deviate from her fundamental principles. On the contrary, she said, the support she had received for taking a stand helped raise the profile of her feminist approach. ‚ÄúI have almost never in my political career experienced such enormous support from around the world,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe instinct was: if we don‚Äôt defend democracy and human rights, what are we?‚Äù She added: ‚ÄúYou gain respect by saying ‚ÄòThis is our view‚Äô ‚Ä¶ It has definitely given us, and given me, a name for standing up even when it was very difficult.‚Äù And difficult it was. At the time of the row, Arab leaders lined up to support Saudi Arabia, calling Wallstr√∂m irresponsible and unacceptable. The rift came as a shock to Stockholm‚Äôs left-leaning coalition, which had expected plaudits after becoming the first EU member to recognise the Palestinian state last autumn. Relations with Saudi Arabia are now back to normal.
Perhaps inevitably, the affair has shone the international spotlight on Wallstr√∂m‚Äôs advocacy of a feminist foreign policy ‚Äì and, equally inevitably, not all the attention has been flattering. But Wallstr√∂m, a former EU commissioner, is undeterred. She believes that approaching foreign policy from a feminist perspective is an essential tool to ensure humans rights were respected for both men and women. ‚ÄúYou have to see the world from the woman‚Äôs perspective,‚Äù she told journalists in a wider briefing on Monday. ‚ÄúIt means a lot if you keep those glasses on.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is not a magic wand, not a list of political ideas ‚Äì it is tools and ideas you can use to make sure we live up to human rights,‚Äù she said. If you don‚Äôt ask about the situation of women and children, you can overlook possible war crimes in places such as east Ukraine, she said. The UN is at the centre of Sweden‚Äôs foreign policy objectives, Wallstr√∂m added, because global problems need global solutions. The country is campaigning hard to win a seat on the UN Security Council in 2017. Paraphrasing Dag Hammarskj√∂ld, the organisation‚Äôs former Swedish general secretary, she said: ‚ÄúThe UN is not there to take the world to heaven but to prevent it going to hell.‚Äù
Feminism must become part of peace and security issues, with women at the negotiating table, she added. ‚ÄúAre women among the signatories to peace and ceasefire agreements? We have to make sure that the question is being asked.‚Äù However, despite Wallstr√∂m‚Äôs ethics-driven rhetoric, Sweden continues to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia and other countries with poor human rights records, such as Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates ‚Äì much to the disapproval of her own Social Democrat party. ‚ÄúAny country that wants peace and at the same time produces weapons ends up with moral dilemmas. We have to deal with them,‚Äù Wallstr√∂m said. ‚ÄúWe have to live with these kind of contradictions.‚Äù A parliamentary commission on the arms trade is due to report at the end of this month. Wallstr√∂m declined to state her position until the review is public. On Badawi, however, she is clear. Sweden would join the EU in condemning Badawi‚Äôs flogging, she said, and would not dilute its criticism. ‚ÄúYou have to respect the right to free speech,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe protests will not stop.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-08T16:33:22Z,world,World news,"Election result heralds a new Turkey, but not the one Erdoƒüan wanted","Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan is the most formidable vote-winner and election conjurer Turkey has ever seen. He founded his own party, led it to three absolute parliamentary majorities as prime minister, then last year performed a Putinesque sidestep to become the country‚Äôs first directly elected president with more than half of the popular vote. But on Monday Erdoƒüan stared defeat in the face. He had forsaken his famously intuitive feel for the popular mood, miscalculated in his highly aggressive election campaign and paid the price. Even if his Justice and Development party (AKP) retained the biggest parliamentary presence with 41% of the vote, many of his longstanding supporters deserted him, concluding that he was out of touch with their lives and the mood of the country. And in what turned into an unforeseen carnival of pluralism and liberalism, voters hoping to rein in the president turned to a new pro-Kurdish party that oozed youthful exuberance and optimism during the election campaign. The failure of the AKP to secure a parliamentary majority, the backlash against Erdoƒüan and the electorate‚Äôs embrace of the leftist pro-Kurdish Peoples‚Äô Democratic party (HDP) under its charismatic young leader, Selahattin Demirta≈ü, represent a watershed in Turkish politics. Erdoƒüan campaigned to make himself the all-powerful president of what he called ‚Äúthe new Turkey‚Äù. The election result brought forth an embryonic new Turkey, but not the one the president wanted. ‚ÄúThe attempt to block his plans for the presidential system in Turkey made voting for the HDP the most rational choice,‚Äù said Ahmet Insel, a political scientist. Erdoƒüan‚Äôs push for an executive presidency effectively turned the election into a referendum on his plans instead of a choice between political parties. ‚ÄúThe HDP took at least one million votes from the [main opposition] CHP. Many of those voters opted to change in order to stop Erdoƒüan.‚Äù The point was driven home by Demirta≈ü, the moral victor of the election. ‚ÄúThe debate on the presidency, the debate on dictatorship has come to an end in Turkey,‚Äù he said. Instead, the election produced what is tantamount to a cultural revolution in Turkish political life. Women will fill 96 of the parliament‚Äôs 550 seats, up from 79. Openly gay candidates won seats for the HDP. Most of all, the long-repressed Kurdish minority (one in five of Turkey‚Äôs citizens) will be properly represented for the first time with 80 seats. ‚ÄúThis is the first time that feminists in Turkey actively supported a political party,‚Äù said Mehtap Doƒüan, a feminist activist. ‚ÄúUp until now we have always done politics on our own, away from parliament. But this time we ran a campaign supporting the HDP because we believed in their sincerity when it comes to defending the rights of women, LGBTs and ethnic minorities.‚Äù The HDP was the first party to introduce a quota of 50% female politicians, and all party offices and HDP-run municipalities are chaired by both a man and a woman. The party‚Äôs successful attempt to break out of ethnic identity politics and broaden its appeal well beyond the Kurdish issue owes much to Demirta≈ü‚Äô magnetism and his message of outreach. But the mass protest movement, which was born in a central Istanbul park two years ago and mushroomed into national protests that Erdoƒüan crushed mercilessly, also fed into the HDP‚Äôs support. ‚ÄúDuring the Gezi protests, many got an idea of what Kurds had to go through for years: the violence, the repression, the unjust arrests. It opened our eyes to the Kurdish suffering,‚Äù said Doƒüan. ‚ÄúAt the same time, we saw how the pro-government press tried to turn our legitimate, peaceful protests into acts of terrorism.‚Äù Just as Erdoƒüan branded the protesters two years ago ‚Äúriff-raff‚Äù, ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù and ‚Äúforeign agents‚Äù, in the election campaign he stoked division and malice by repeatedly smearing his HDP opponents as ‚Äúterrorists, marginals, gays and atheists‚Äù. He asked religiously conservative voters not to cast their ballots for ‚Äúsuch people who have nothing to do with Islam‚Äù. The tactic backfired as many religiously conservative Kurds shifted their votes from the AKP to a party that promised to represent everyone‚Äôs interests. In the religiously conservative eastern town of Batman, Burhan Saran, an influential local politician, switched from the AKP to the HDP last month. He said he was ‚Äúnot bothered‚Äù by the fact that the HDP sent Yezidi, Christian and gay candidates into the race for parliament. ‚ÄúThis party welcomes everyone, and this is what we need now,‚Äù he said. Insel, the political scientist, said: ‚ÄúThe HDP became the synthesis of the Gezi Park movement. All Gezi Park activists became activists for the HDP. Erdoƒüan‚Äôs new Turkey has lost, and the new Turkey of Gezi Park has won.‚Äù Erdoƒüan‚Äôs violent response to the 2013 protests revealed a leader at odds with large parts of his country. The election confirmed that shift in the public mood. But the president‚Äôs relatively magnanimous reaction to his defeat on Monday was very different to the riot police and teargas tactics of two years ago. Although he will bitterly resent the result, the president can also take some of the credit for creating a Turkey that let it happen. Erdoƒüan is frequently compared to Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin. But there is no chance under Putin of Turkey‚Äôs election result being replicated in Russia. Despite fears of ballot rigging and the overwhelming advantage enjoyed by the government in the national mass media, Sunday‚Äôs election proceeded smoothly, freely and relatively peacefully. ‚ÄúTurks and Kurds are well ahead of the political leaders of the country, and they have a lot of expectations of the democratic process that they have well bought into,‚Äù said Emma Sinclair-Webb, senior researcher for Human Rights Watch in Turkey. ‚ÄúThis is a very impressive outcome. It shows that Turkey is going through an important political maturing process, and that an increasing number of people are interested in a pluralistic society.‚Äù One such person is a 30-year-old teacher and ethnic Kurd from Diyarbakir, the main Kurdish city in the south-east. He asked not to be named but underlined that in his view the HDP was the only party that did not seek to pit certain groups against others. ‚ÄúIt is the first time that a political party openly talks about the rights of LGBTs. I am convinced that they will be able to push through many rights for us, even gay marriage,‚Äù he laughed. ‚ÄúIf someone had told me this five years ago I would have never believed it possible. I am still very astonished, but the proof is right there.‚Äù None of the four parties in the new parliament are able to form a single-party government, meaning Turkey is entering a period of volatility. Erdoƒüan approaches politics as a binary contest between winners and losers in which the decisive aim is to secure a majority. On Sunday he lost one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-08T16:09:18Z,world,World news,Bangladesh Rana Plaza factory fund finally meets target,"The international fund set up to compensate victims of the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh, in which 1,137 people died, has finally met its target of $30m (¬£19.63m) after a significant anonymous donation.
The breakthrough was hailed by labour unions as a major victory after global consumer participation forced many brands and retailers that sourced clothing from the building in Dhaka to finally pay into the fund, backed by the UN‚Äôs International Labour Organisation. The Clean Clothes Campaign has been campaigning sincethe disaster in April 2013, demanding that brands and retailers provide compensation tothose injured and to the families of those who died. Since then more than 1 million consumers from around the world have rallied to publicise the major high street companies whose products were made in one of the five factories housed in the structurally unsafe building. On the eve of the second anniversary in April, Benetton announced it was contributing $1.1m (¬£740,000) to the fund ‚Äì the last major western fashion retailer to donate. But the fund was still left $2.4m dollars short of its target. A large donation received in the past few days has led to the target being met. Ineke Zeldenrust of the Clean Clothes Campaign said: ‚ÄúThis day has been long in coming. Now that all the families impacted by this disaster will finally receive all the money they are owed, they can finally focus on rebuilding their lives.
‚ÄúThis is a remarkable moment for justice. This would not have been possible without the support of citizens and consumers across Europe who stuck with the campaign over the past two years. Together we have proved once again that European consumers do care about the workers who make their clothes ‚Äì and that their actions really can make a difference.‚Äù The Rana Plaza Donors Trust Fund was set up by the ILO in January 2014 to collect funds to cover loss of income and medical costs suffered by the Rana Plaza victims and their families when the eight-storey building collapsed ‚Äì the garment industry‚Äôs worst ever disaster. In November 2014, the Rana Plaza Coordination Committee announced it would need about $30m to pay in full more than 5,000 awards granted through the scheme. However, the failure of some brands and retailers linked to Rana Plaza to provide sufficient and timely donations has, until now, prevented payment of the awards being completed.
The Clean Clothes Campaign has pledged to continue to support victims who are pursuing further payments in recognition of the pain and suffering inflicted as a result of alleged corporate negligence. It is also calling for policy changes to ensure that those affected by future disasters receive more timely support. It welcomes a new initiative by the ILO in Bangladesh to develop a national workplace injury scheme for the country‚Äôs 4m garment workers. They also urge European politicians to develop better regulation of supply chains.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-08T15:35:18Z,world,World news,The G7 media centre ‚Äì a German sausage factory of news | Charlie Skelton,"News of a protest spread like wildfire: head to the square outside the Garmisch train station! It‚Äôs all about to kick off! When I arrived, the square was a heaving mass of bodies: photographers, film crews, radio presenters, police, more police, and about seventeen bemused protesters.
A man in a slightly amusing Bavarian hat cycled up to the throng, and the photographers pounced on him. At last! Some colour from the G7. A man‚Äôs slightly funny hat. That‚Äôll do. They snapped away ‚Äì dropping to one knee, like they learned in camera school, trying to fit an alp or two in the frame. The reality is there are 3,000 accredited journalists here in Germany to cover the G7 meeting, and there simply aren‚Äôt enough protesters to go around. Fortunately, what the G7 lacks in protesters, it more than makes up for in buffets. The G7 press centre is basically an enormous buffet with giant open-plan office attached. It‚Äôs been set up in the Olympic ice skating arena, which has been fitted out with briefing rooms, ISDN lines, delegation offices and hundreds of workstations. There are G7 goodie bags and branded balloons. Branded cashew nuts. Branded breath mints. And, of course, there‚Äôs the food hall. The only thing bigger than the security operation in Garmisch is the catering operation for the journalists. It‚Äôs immense. A constant schnitzel-stuffed Bavarian feast boasting rare roasts, mixed pickles and ‚Äúinternational ham‚Äù, whatever that is. Free flagons of beer, wine on tap, and a serving staff so attentive that I had two lederhosened hands reach for my empty stein before it had reached the table. The carvery here has its own sausage station, with steaming heaps of wurst. The menu, as you might imagine, is fairly sausage-heavy, as are the journalists by now after two days of solid buffet action. After a feed, bloated journalists digest their schnitzels on plump beanbags in the cavernous relaxation room, a giant gazebo with table football, two cocktail bars, and a row of big screen televisions showing exciting footage from the G7 for reporters to doze in front of.
‚ÄúWe want to give journalists the best possible conditions for good work and good broadcasting,‚Äù a government spokesperson told me. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what it‚Äôs all about.‚Äù And the German government has certainly achieved this. They‚Äôve made it incredibly easy. They even provide lots of lovely footage and photos from the summit, shared out between news outlets so journalists (in the absence of protesters) have something to build their reports around. And this is what I find unsettling about all the set-up here in Garmisch. The conditions are too good. It‚Äôs all been made too easy for the journalists. I suspect that if a story is this easy to get, it‚Äôs not worth getting. I watched some of the raw footage from the Schloss, the cheery Bavarian meet-and-greet, and you could see headsetted organisers shoving cameramen around, and pushing extras into the back of shots. It was live theatre, orchestrated to within an inch of its life. Then packaged up and handed out to the world‚Äôs press, who gulp it down with barely a chew. In its essence, the G7 is just a giant press release, with extra sausages. Now I know the buffet is amazing, but the truth is there‚Äôs not a single good reason why any of us are here. It would be far quicker, and involve fewer taxpayer-funded cocktail bars, simply to email all the clips, photos and information to whoever wanted them. That‚Äôs what I find so surreal about this amazing press centre. It doesn‚Äôt need to be here. No one needs to be here. I don‚Äôt need to be here. In fact, I‚Äôm leaving now to head 26km south to the Bilderberg policy summit, where the head of Nato, the prime ministers of Holland, Finland and Belgium, the president of Austria, and the chancellor of the exchequer will be meeting for three days with the heads of HSBC, Shell, BP and Deutsche Bank. It‚Äôs every bit as important as the G7. Some would say more so. But because it‚Äôs a little bit tricky to report on, with nothing except a skeletal agenda handed out, no footage or photos given to the press, the number of mainstream journalists reporting from the event will drop from 3,000 to about 11. Go figure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-08T14:48:38Z,world,World news,G7 leaders agree to phase out fossil fuel use by end of century,"The G7 leading industrial nations have agreed to cut greenhouse gases by phasing out the use of fossil fuels by the end of the century, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has announced, in a move hailed as historic by some environmental campaigners.
On the final day of talks in a Bavarian castle, Merkel said the leaders had committed themselves to the need to ‚Äúdecarbonise the global economy in the course of this century‚Äù. They also agreed on a global target for limiting the rise in average global temperatures to a maximum of 2C over pre-industrial levels. Environmental lobbyists described the announcement as a hopeful sign that plans for complete decarbonisation could be decided on in Paris climate talks later this year. But they criticised the fact that leaders had baulked at Merkel‚Äôs proposal that they should agree to immediate binding emission targets. As host of the summit, which took place in the foothills of Germany‚Äôs largest mountain, the Zugspitze, Merkel said the leading industrialised countries were committed to raising $100bn (¬£65bn) in annual climate financing by 2020 from public and private sources. In a 17-page communique issued after the summit at Schloss Elmau under the slogan ‚ÄúThink Ahead, Act Together‚Äù, the G7 leaders agreed to back the recommendations of the IPCC, the United Nations‚Äô climate change panel, to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions at the upper end of a range of 40% to 70% by 2050, using 2010 as the baseline. Merkel also announced that G7 governments had signed up to initiatives to work for an end to extreme poverty and hunger, reducing by 2030 the number of people living in hunger and malnutrition by 500 million, as well as improving the global response to epidemics in the light of the Ebola crisis. Poverty campaigners reacted with cautious optimism to the news. The participant countries ‚Äì Germany, Britain, France, the US, Canada, Japan and Italy ‚Äì would work on initiatives to combat disease and help countries around the world react to epidemics, including a fund within the World Bank dedicated to tackling health emergencies, Merkel announced at a press conference after the summit formally ended on Monday afternoon. Reacting to the summit‚Äôs final declaration, the European Climate Foundation described the G7 leaders‚Äô announcement as historic, saying it signalled ‚Äúthe end of the fossil fuel age‚Äù and was an ‚Äúimportant milestone on the road to a new climate deal in Paris‚Äù. Samantha Smith, a climate campaigner for the World Wildlife Fund, said: ‚ÄúThere is only one way to meet the goals they agreed: get out of fossil fuels as soon as possible.‚Äù The 350.org campaign group put out a direct challenge to Barack Obama to shut down long-term infrastructure projects linked to the fossil fuel industry. ‚ÄúIf President Obama wants to live up to the rhetoric we‚Äôre seeing out of Germany, he‚Äôll need to start doing everything in his power to keep fossil fuels in the ground. He can begin by rejecting the Keystone XL pipeline and ending coal, oil and gas development on public lands,‚Äù said May Boeve, the group‚Äôs director. Others called on negotiators seeking an international climate deal at Paris later this year to make total decarbonisation of the global economy the official goal. ‚ÄúA clear long-term decarbonisation objective in the Paris agreement, such as net zero greenhouse gas emissions well before the end of the century, will shift this towards low-carbon investment and avoid unmanageable climate risk,‚Äù said Nigel Topping, the chief executive of the We Mean Business coalition. Merkel won praise for succeeding in her ambition to ensure climate was not squeezed off the agenda by other pressing issues. Some environmental groups said she had established herself as a ‚Äúclimate hero‚Äù.
Observers said she had succeeded where sceptics thought she would not, in winning over Canada and Japan, the most reluctant G7 partners ahead of negotiations, to sign up to her targets on climate, health and poverty. Iain Keith, campaign director of the online activist network Avaaz, said: ‚ÄúAngela Merkel faced down Canada and Japan to say ‚ÄòAuf Wiedersehen‚Äô to carbon pollution and become the climate hero the world needs.‚Äù The One campaigning and advocacy organisation called the leaders‚Äô pledge to end extreme poverty a ‚Äúhistoric ambition‚Äù. Adrian Lovett, its Europe executive director, said: ‚ÄúThese G7 leaders have signed up ... to be part of the generation that ends extreme poverty and hunger by 2030.‚Äù But he warned: ‚ÄúSchloss Elmau‚Äôs legacy must be more than a castle in the air. But the Christian relief organisation World Vision accused the leaders of failing to deliver on their ambitious agenda, arguing they had been too distracted by immediate crises, such as Russia and Greece. ‚ÄúDespite addressing issues like hunger and immunisation, it was nowhere as near as ambitious as we would have hoped for,‚Äù a spokeswoman said. Jeremy Farrar of the Wellcome Trust said the proposals would ‚Äútransform the resilience of global health systems‚Äù. But he said the success of the measures would depend on the effectiveness with which they could be coordinated on a global scale and that required fundamental reform of the World Health Organisation, something the leaders stopped short of deciding on. ‚ÄúWe urge world leaders to consider establishing an independent body within the WHO with the authority and responsibility to deliver this,‚Äù he said. Merkel, who called the talks ‚Äúvery work-intensive and productive‚Äù and defended the format of a summit that cost an estimated ‚Ç¨300m (¬£220m), said that the participants had agreed to sharpen existing sanctions against Russia if the crisis in Ukraine were to escalate. She also said ‚Äúthere isn‚Äôt much time left‚Äù to find a solution to the Greek global debt crisis but that participants were unanimous in wanting Greece to stay in the eurozone. Demonstrators, about 3,000 of whom had packed a protest camp in the nearby village of Garmisch Partenkirchen, cancelled the final action that had been planned to coincide with the close of the summit. At a meeting in the local railway station, the head of Stop G7 Elmau, Ingrid Scherf announced that the final rally would not go ahead ‚Äúbecause we‚Äôre already walked off our feet‚Äù. She denied the claims of local politicians that the group‚Äôs demonstrations had been a flop. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not at all disappointed, the turnout was super,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd we also had the support of lots of locals.‚Äù Only two demonstrators were arrested, police said, one for throwing a soup dish, another for carrying a spear.

2015-06-08T14:05:08Z,world,World news,Smile! Glum G7 leaders and guests pose for group photos,"Milling around Schloss Elmau on a distinctly un-sunkissed Bavarian day, the leaders of the G7 group of leading industrial economies, their African ‚Äúoutreach‚Äù guests and assorted global bigwigs look a bit lost and uncertain despite Angela Merkel‚Äôs periodic efforts as host to knock them into shape. Surely they all want a half-decent photo for the world‚Äôs front pages. You wouldn‚Äôt think so by looking at them.
It‚Äôs not easy by the look of it, more like a case of herding cats. Most participants are old hands, so they know they must be friendly towards their nearest neighbour without necessarily knowing who she or he is. Heads of state attending summits are too grand to wear lapel badges saying: ‚ÄúHello, I‚Äôm President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Anji from Berlin‚Äù. Sirleaf is the one with the genuine smile and Merkel is in pink.
Most of the rest are middle-aged blokes in suits, jostling to make sure their media back home can see them schmoozing with Barack Obama, who remains the No 1 man on these occasions despite not being much of a schmoozer himself. At one point David Cameron can be seen seated between a very relaxed Obama (is his arm around the IMF chief, Christine Lagarde?) and Merkel. Well done, Dave! Extra points for gamesmanship.
On the crowded 48-hour agenda are easy issues such as flagging economies, global security, the environment, future Ebola outbreaks, corruption (Cameron‚Äôs thing) and antibiotic resistance. We can see why they‚Äôre glum, but it‚Äôs not going to be a challenge for Private Eye to get a cover page joke out of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But this time we ran a campaign supporting the HDP because we believed in their sincerity when it comes to defending the rights of women, LGBTs and ethnic minorities.‚Äù The HDP is the first party to introduce a quota of 50% female politicians, and all party offices and HDP-run municipalities are chaired by both a man and a woman. The party‚Äôs successful attempt to break out of ethnic identity politics and broaden its appeal well beyond the Kurdish issue owes much to leader Selahattin Demirtas‚Äô magnetism and his message of outreach. But the mass protest movement born in a central Istanbul park two years ago and which mushroomed into national protests which Erdogan crushed mercilessly also fed in to the HDP‚Äôs support. ‚ÄúDuring the Gezi [park] protests, many got an idea of what Kurds had to go through for years: the violence, the repression, the unjust arrests. It opened our eyes to the Kurdish suffering,‚Äù said Dogan. ‚ÄúAt the same time, we saw how the pro-government press tried to turn our legitimate, peaceful protests into acts of terrorism.‚Äù Just as Erdogan branded the protesters two years ago ‚Äúriff-raff‚Äù, ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù and ‚Äúforeign agents‚Äù, in the election campaign he stoked division and malice by repeatedly smearing his HDP opponents as ‚Äúterrorists, marginals, gays and atheists.‚Äù He asked religiously conservative voters not to cast their ballots for ‚Äúsuch people who have nothing to do with Islam.‚Äù The tactic backfired as many religiously conservative Kurds shifted their votes from the AKP to a party that promised to represent everyone‚Äôs interests. You will soon be able to read the rest of the piece on our Turkey page. The aftermath of the election now seems set to hinge on private meetings. And the outcome of those talks and deals could take sometime to emerge, so we are going to bring this blog to a close.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-08T13:15:07Z,world,World news,Turkey election: what happens next?,"Turkey‚Äôs election has resulted in a hung parliament. Since 2002, Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan‚Äôs Justice and Development party (AKP) had always won outright. This year, however, the party lost its parliamentary majority and its share of the vote fell to its lowest level in 13 years. We are in uncharted waters, and it is difficult to anticipate what the next steps will be. Here‚Äôs what might happen: Once the president gives the mandate to form a government ‚Äì which all but certainly will be given first to the prime minister and AKP leader, Ahmet Davutoƒülu, ‚Äì the mandatee will have 45 days to form a government. Erdoƒüan has recognised no single party won a mandate to govern alone in Sunday‚Äôs election. His tone was unusually conciliatory, but also grounded in the simple truth that any government would need to win a confidence vote in parliament ‚Äì and based on provisional results, the AKP is 17 short of a majority.
Initial reports in Turkey suggest the AKP would prefer a coalition government to a return to the polls. But any deal is difficult as the parties have less in common than not. That said, in terms of potential deals ‚Äì on paper at least ‚Äì the AKP could work with the Nationalist Movement party (MHP). Although, due to the MHP‚Äôs hostility towards Kurdish issues, any deal would risk jeopardising Erdoƒüan‚Äôs pursuit (and progress) of a peace deal with Kurdish rebels. A second (also theoretical) possibility is an agreement with the pro-Kurdish Peoples‚Äô Democratic party (HDP), which passed the 10% threshold to enter parliament ‚Äì thus denying the AKP a majority ‚Äì . and became the election‚Äôs biggest winners. The AKP has been more sympathetic to Kurdish demands compared with other parties and previous governments. However, the HDP has been extremely critical of Erdoƒüan‚Äôs meddling in governmental affairs, authoritarian tendencies, and his most recent aspiration of increasing presidential powers. But the MHP and the HDP have ruled out a coalition with the AKP. Another option for the party would be to try to form a minority government and, assuming it can win a vote of confidence, to then seek deals on an ad hoc basis. Such a government would most probably have a limited shelf-life before elections were called again. But if the opposition parties hold their ground and no type of agreement is reached within the necessary 45 days, then elections might be the only option. These would be called by the supreme election board in two months. A grand coalition between the AKP and the the main opposition party, the Kemalist Republican People‚Äôs party (CHP) is highly unlikely, as is the possibility of an agreement between all opposition parties (the CHP, MHP and HDP) due to the strife between the nationalist party and Turkey‚Äôs Kurdish population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-08T12:47:23Z,world,World news,G7 leaders agree on new insurance fund after Rana Plaza disaster,"G7 leaders meeting in Bavaria have agreed to establish a new fund to help improve the global supply chain in the wake of the Rana Plaza disaster in Bangladesh in 2013 in which 1,137 people died when a building housing garment workers collapsed. The fund would help provide compensation in the event of further similar disasters and provide cash to improve fire inspection and building safety regulations. The G7 will recommend that western consumers have access to apps that better inform them about whether clothes they intend to buy were manufactured in decent working conditions. It has take more than two years for a compensation fund for relatives of the Rana Plaza victims to reach its target of ¬£20m. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, put the issue of textile industry working conditions on the G7 agenda, and the leaders‚Äô communique calls for a ‚Äúvision zero fund‚Äù ‚Äì in essence an insurance fund ‚Äì to compensate victims of future disasters and improve working conditions. The fund would be administered in conjunction with the International Labour Organisation, and require contributions from trade associations in developed countries represented at the G7. It would act as an insurance system for firms that commit to prevention measures and help implement labour, social, environmental and safety standards, such as better-trained fire prevention inspectors. Extremely low wages have led global brands and retailers to choose Bangladesh over China and other developing countries in recent years, but in many cases the big brands have either turned a blind eye to working conditions in pursuit of profit or knowingly taken no interest in how their clothes are manufactured. The Rana Plaza collapse prompted demands for reforms in a sector that helps Bangladesh earn more than ¬£12bn a year from exports, mainly to the US and Europe. The G7 communique states: ‚ÄúGiven our prominent share in the globalisation process, G7 countries have an important role to play in promoting labour rights, decent working conditions and environmental protection in global supply chains. Unsafe and poor working conditions lead to significant social and economic losses and are linked to environmental damage. We will strive for better application of internationally recognised labour, social and environmental standards, principles and commitments.‚Äù The communique says it is the responsibility of governments and business to foster sustainable supply chains. National governments must persuade companies headquartered in their territory to conduct due diligence on how their clothes are manufactured. Germany‚Äôs federal development minister, Gerd M√ºller, one of the politicians behind the initiative, said seamstresses in Vietnam or Bangladesh who worked on jeans that could be sold in Berlin for ‚Ç¨100 (¬£73) a pair worked at an hourly rate of 15 cents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-08T12:29:23Z,world,World news,Erdoƒüan to struggle on despite thumbs down from Turkey's electorate,"Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan may be down, but he‚Äôs not out. Turkey‚Äôs president is a fighter and will not give up easily, despite the slap in the face he received from voters in Sunday‚Äôs elections. Erdoƒüan‚Äôs reputation and standing have suffered, but he remains a formidable figure. He still has the means and the motivation to dish all the excited talk about a new dawn for Turkish democracy and try again to extend his presidential powers. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, it will be Erdoƒüan who will decide whether to begin an era of political chaos and instability, or to aid the normalisation of Turkish politics,‚Äù said the H√ºrriyet Daily News columnist Serkan Demirta≈ü.
Erdoƒüan has a choice, Demirta≈ü said. He could abandon his political ambitions and leave the newly elected party leaders to form the next government; or he could try to manipulate an uncertain, unstable situation to his advantage, as he has in the past. In his first public statement since the vote, Erdoƒüan adopted an unaccustomed air of calm neutrality. He said the poll verdict must be respected, but appeared to suggest new elections might be necessary if attempts to form a coalition failed. At present, all the opposition parties have ruled out a deal with his Justice and Development party (AKP), which remains the single largest party despite significant losses. ‚ÄúOur nation‚Äôs opinion is above everything else,‚Äù Erdoƒüan said. ‚ÄúI believe the results, which do not give the opportunity to any party to form a single-party government, will be assessed healthily and realistically by every party ... In this new process, it is of great importance that all the political forces show responsible behaviour.‚Äù Erdoƒüan‚Äôs outward calmness may not survive a scheduled internal inquest with AKP chiefs. Ahmet Davutoƒülu, who took over as nominal party leader last year and led the election campaign, may be among the first to pay the price. Davutoƒülu‚Äôs sacking as prime minister could form part of a wider bloodletting within the AKP as Erdoƒüan secures his base prior to going back on to the political offensive, commentators suggested. ‚ÄúA comparison of leadership performances between Erdoƒüan and Davutoƒülu will be inevitable,‚Äù H√ºrriyet reported. ‚ÄúThere is speculation that the results could bring about a leadership change in which Erdoƒüan could leave his presidential office to head the party to an early election.‚Äù If that happened, it would be a sensational development. Meanwhile, Davutoƒülu is soldiering on manfully, declaring that although the AKP lost millions of votes, the result is in fact a triumph. ‚ÄúEveryone should know that the AKP is the winner ... This election has shown that the backbone of Turkey is the AKP,‚Äù he said. Davutoƒülu indicated the AKP would continue to push for the constitutional changes that critics say would, if enacted, give Erdoƒüan quasi-dictatorial powers ‚Äì even though voters gave the proposals a big thumbs down. Such chutzpah suggests Erdoƒüan is not minded to abandon his executive presidency plan. And this in turn makes new elections within the next three months more likely. A minority AKP government, or a coalition ‚Äì the other options under discussion on Monday ‚Äì could not deliver what he wants.
If he goes down this path, Erdoƒüan will try to exploit the divisions and relative inexperience of the opposition parties while appealing to Turkey‚Äôs vast heartlands ‚Äì still undisputed AKP territory. As elected president as well as de facto party boss, he still has access to many levers of power, including control of the security forces. He can also count, for now, on the loyalty of pro-government national TV stations and media outlets, which on Monday were dutifully calling for new elections. And despite denials, he may yet gain informal backing from the nationalist MHP. Erdoƒüan is practised at conjuring up foreign and internal threats as a way of polarising voters and rallying support. An early election could thus be fought against a backdrop of alleged international conspiracies, traitorous plots and anti-Islamic machinations. Events in neighbouring Syria and Iraq provide plenty of opportunities to stoke such paranoia. The president is also not averse to threatening his opponents and locking them up if it suits his purposes, as numerous lawyers, journalists, writers, civil rights activists and army officers have found since he first came to power in 2002. Resurrecting the spectre of violent Kurdish secession is another possible tool. If push came to shove, the very success of the pro-Kurdish People‚Äôs Democratic party (HDP) could be used negatively to rekindle old fears about the enemy within. And then there is always the possibility of fraud if and when the next election is held. Many Turks feared Sunday‚Äôs polls would be stolen and the HDP‚Äôs vote deliberately undercounted. It didn‚Äôt happen. But that is no guarantee it will not happen next time. For now at least, Erdoƒüan is on the back foot. His aura of invincibility has been shattered. But at 61, he is relatively young for a president. In 1999, he was convicted of ‚Äúinciting hatred based on religious differences‚Äù and went to prison rather than back down. It would be wholly out of character for him to throw in the towel now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-08T11:36:56Z,world,World news,Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian appears in second hearing in Tehran,"Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post reporter held in Iran on charges of spying and collaborating with hostile governments, has appeared at a second, private, hearing in Tehran. The Iranian-American journalist, who has been in jail for more than 10 months, is standing trial alongside two other defendants who have not been named, the IRNA state news agency reported. Rezaian‚Äôs first hearing was held last month but little information has been released in public about what had been discussed during that session. Rezaian has been held largely incommunicado since his detention in July 2014. Iran‚Äôs semi-official Mehr news agency quoted Rezaian as saying during the first hearing: ‚ÄúI am a journalist, and all of my activities have been conducted as a journalist, and all were legal.‚Äù Mehr did not explain how it had access to information from a trial held in camera. The case is being presided over by Abolghassem Salavati, a hardline judge notorious for issuing heavy sentences. The 39-year-old reporter was arrested at his home in Tehran along with his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, also a journalist, and two friends, an Iranian-American couple. The two friends, who are believed to have close ties to the family of the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, were released shortly after their arrests and Salehi too was subsequently released on bail in October. It was not clear which two of the remaining three were in court with Rezaian on Monday. It is also not clear why Rezaian, who was working in Iran with appropriate accreditation, is being tried for espionage, a charge his family and the Washington Post have vehemently denied. Although he holds Iranian and US citizenship, Iran is treating him solely as an Iranian as the country does not recognise such dual nationality. Iranian intelligence authorities have a deep suspicion of dual nationals and have arrested a number of them in recent years. According to Rezaian‚Äôs brother, Ali, two pieces of evidence used against him were a visa application he had lodged for his Iranian wife in order to be able to travel to the US and a letter he sent to Barack Obama‚Äôs 2008 White House transition team offering help to improve bilateral relations between Iran and the US. Rezaian is also facing the charges of collecting confidential information and spreading propaganda against the Islamic republic. A report carried by a hardline Iranian news agency, Fars, alleged that he provided economic and industrial data to the US government. The case has brought much embarrassment for Rouhani, whose administration is seeking to improve relations with the west. After his election victory in 2013, the Washington Post was the first international newspaper to which Rouhani reached out to publish his opinion piece in which he set out his global vision. Nevertheless, he has remained quiet in defence of Rezaian. Iran‚Äôs conservative-dominated judiciary, which has the full control over Rezaian‚Äôs case, acts independently of Rouhani‚Äôs government. But the president can still use his position as the public face of the Islamic republic to defend those in prison unjustly. Many analysts believe Rezaian is caught up in a high-level feud between Rouhani‚Äôs administration and its internal opponents. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said in April that the case was being used in an Iranian power struggle. ‚ÄúIranian opponents of the nuclear accord with the United States and better relations with the international community have been referring to the Rezaian case since 3 April, and this is no coincidence because Rezaian was arrested with the aim of being used in this all-out war between rival ruling factions,‚Äù said head of RSF‚Äôs Iran desk, Reza Moini. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, the governments led by Barack Obama and Hassan Rouhani let slip an opportunity to include human rights and the release of journalists as one of the priorities in their talks. We call for the immediate release of Jason Rezaian and all the other detained journalists and bloggers.‚Äù
Obama told Rezaian‚Äôs brother in April: ‚ÄúWe will not rest until we bring him home to his family, safe and sound.‚Äù More than 400,000 people have petitioned Iran‚Äôs judiciary to release Rezaian, including Noam Chomsky, Anderson Cooper and Christiane Amanpour. The country has a history of jailing journalists working for the foreign press. Those previously jailed in Iran include Maziar Bahari, whose ordeal in prison was the subject of Rosewater, a film by the US satarist Jon Stewart recently released in the UK. Rezaian‚Äôs hearing was adjourned after three hours. It was not clear when the next session would take place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-08T11:12:19Z,world,World news,Nauru's president and justice minister allegedly bribed by mining company,"The Nauruan government is facing a major crisis as new documents emerge that place the president, Baron Waqa, and justice minister, David Adeang, at the centre of bribery claims. On Monday the ABC published extracts from emails that appear to disclose that Waqa and Adeang were allegedly bribed by Australian mining company Getax. The email extracts from the ABC show in a 2009 email that Adeang emailed a former Getax director and said: ‚ÄúWe can create a new business relationship that can take this country to a higher level of development and of course taking also your business to even more success‚Äù. In response the director said: ‚ÄúWe give you full authority to mobilise or lubricate the MPs to secure the vote and win the battle‚Äù. In a press release last week the Nauruan government preemptively attempted to discredit the ABC program, and suggested it was an opposition plot. Adeang said in a statement: ‚ÄúWe were shocked to hear that the opposition has gone to Australian media with baseless claims going back six years, all of which have been consistently disproven, and to be honest are of no interest to Australia as they are Nauruan domestic matters. ‚ÄúThe journalist effectively bailed up our president in a house in Brisbane and attempted to intimidate him. This was orchestrated by our own opposition MPs who refuse to put Nauru‚Äôs interests ahead of their own.‚Äù Separately, proceedings relating to human rights violations at the Australian-run detention centre on the island have also edged one step closer, after a motion to strike out the claim by the government failed on Monday. The Australian government has maintained that it has foreign immunity and can not be joined as a party to the case surrounding human rights, but the motion to strike out the asylum seekers‚Äô case failed. The outcome of the case could see the Australian run detention centre on the island closed. A contempt of court application has also been filed against the Nauruan secretary of justice over abuse of process in the proceedings. The Australian barrister who was scheduled to appear for the asylum seekers and in separate proceedings relating to the deportation of former Nauru resident Rod Henshaw had his visa denied by the secretary, with no clear justification provided. Guardian Australia also understands there is growing dissent among the island community, and protests may take place at the next sitting of the Nauruan parliament on 18 June. Further concerns continue to be raised about Nauru, with the blocking of several websites including Facebook and the recent deportation of the general manager of telecommunications provider Digicell. The Nauruan government also passed a new law that could see people jailed for speaking out against the government.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-08T08:20:24Z,world,World news,30 under 30: Moscow's young power list,"Adult life begins at 30, they say, or slightly earlier if you live in Moscow. As part of our week-long focus on life in the city we‚Äôve taken stock of Muscovites who‚Äôve achieved notoriety in their 20s, contributing to a different Russia from the one we‚Äôre used to reading about.
From the creatives giving a voice to the disenfranchised post-Soviet youth; the young politicians repeatedly harassed and arrested; the independent journalists taking on the might of Russia Today and one of the city‚Äôs newest arrivals ‚Äì a whistleblower responsible for blowing open one of the biggest stories in the last decade, here are Moscow‚Äôs 30 under 30. Politics 1. Maxim Katz, ex-poker player and politician ‚ÄúThis body [Moscow district council] is completely useless. It possesses no power whatsoever.‚Äù With this unusual campaign slogan, Max Katz ran successfully for the Shchukino municipal council in Moscow at the age of 27. He told the media he won because he ‚Äúchose to be honest‚Äù but also because people ‚Äúwanted to see a fresh face‚Äù. Katz, now 30, is not a normal Russian politician by any stretch of the imagination. He‚Äôs a former national poker champion who funnelled his winnings into his campaign.
He has since become a popular opposition politician, activist, blogger in Moscow. In recent who‚Äôs-who guide to the Russian opposition he put forward a strategy for the presidential election in 2018. Victory is possible, he argues, if opposition groups work together. ‚Äú[The opposition] is absolutely not weak, as the state tries to say. And it can win.‚Äù 2. Isabelle Magkoeva, the rising star of Russia‚Äôs left
Twenty-four-year-old Isabelle Magkoeva likes boxing and loves communism, according to her Twitter bio. The former teenage model began to be noticed in opposition protests around 2010 and has since become the rising star of Russia‚Äôs political left. She is often compared to Chilean student protester-cum-communist politician Camila Vallejo, perhaps because both women attract attention for their appearance as well as their politics. Communism suffered a blow with the fall of the Soviet Union, but Magkoeva has been named in the Russian press as integral to a ‚Äúrising red dawn‚Äù and has been quoted calling Lenin a ‚Äúgreat revolutionary‚Äù. 3. Ilya Yashin, opposition politician ‚ÄúBoris Nemtsov was killed in act of terror,‚Äù said Ilya Yashin, his close political ally and friend. The young activist and member of the opposition RPR-Parnas party was at the scene within 20 minutes of Nemtsov‚Äôs murder and led efforts to complete his report, Putin.War, on Russia‚Äôs military involvement in Ukraine. ‚ÄúIt was my duty to the memory of my dead comrade to take this work to its end,‚Äù Yashin told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
Now 31, Yashin developed his political career in his 20s, leading the youth wing of the democratic Yabloko party before joining RPR-Parnas. He was once famously ‚Äúhoney-trapped‚Äù by a woman working for the intelligence services, had faeces dumped on his car and been verbally attacked by pro-Kremlin youth activists. 4. Edward Snowden, whistleblower
Edward Snowden was 29 when he blew the lid on mass snooping at the hands of his employer the US National Security Agency. Two years on, the US senate has just passed a bill to end the mass collection of phone records and the whistleblower says he is working harder than ever before. Within months of talking to the Guardian his revelations had gone stratospheric and he‚Äôd moved from a secret place in Hong Kong to Moscow to request political asylum. Bar a sighting of him on the Moskva river, his life in the city was conducted discreetly until the documentary CitzenFour revealed that his long-term girlfriend had moved to be with him. Snowden‚Äôs original confidente, former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, described their life as a ‚Äúdomestic bliss‚Äù which he hoped would ‚Äúforever put to rest the absurd campaign to depict his life as grim and dank‚Äù. Culture 5. Avdotja Alexandrova, founder of a ‚Äònormal‚Äô modelling agency Lumpen is a Russian modelling agency challenging the contemporary conceptions of beauty. Set up by Avdotja Alexandrova at the age of 24, it now has a look book of models from Moscow to Minsk. Models have frizzy hair, bags under their eyes, and scratches on their faces. Not because they‚Äôve been ‚Äúdressed-down‚Äù to look normal, she says, but because they that‚Äôs the way they are.
For Alexandrova, an ‚Äúemotionally inexpressive face, no matter how regular or symmetrical the features, cannot be beautiful‚Äù. Whilst this is a look favoured by the mainstream fashion industry, there a small signs that things are changing. ‚ÄúA lot young russian brands are interested in our models‚Äù, she says. Alexandrova divides her time between Lumpen and making films, and is currently working on her first feature due to be completed this year. 6. Alina Gutkina, radical youth artist
Alina Gutkina, 30, is a Moscow-based artist focused on the ‚Äúradical youth‚Äù of Russia‚Äôs suburbs. Her photos hone in on the ‚Äúcult of masculinity‚Äù amongst the generation born as the Soviet Union fell apart: they show a disaffected urban existence amongst graffiti, hanging around on train tracks and playing with guns. 7. Gosha Rubchinsky, post-Soviet fashion designer
Clean lines, tattoo inspired socks, white tracksuits and chipped nail polish, Gosha Rubchinskiy‚Äôs fashion has a distinctly post-Soviet feel. The 30-year-old designer‚Äôs creations are stocked from South Korea to Sweden and last year to took a crew of street-cast Moscow skaters to launch his 2015 menswear collection in Paris. Like Gutkina his art focuses heavily on the urban boys of post-Soviet Russia. 8. Katya Quel, street artist
Katya Quel, or Quelish, age 28, is a young street artist based in Moscow who has a particular penchant for painting Octopuses on Moscow‚Äôs city walls, creating mashups of famous images ‚Äì including the infamous Putin-hugs-koala ‚Äì and Instagram selfies. 9. Tigran Avetisyan, fashion designer The 27-year-old Tigran Avetisyan caught the attention of the fashion world by using his designs as walking protests. He chalked ‚Äúno jobs‚Äù, ‚Äústop dreaming‚Äù and ‚Äútoo much pressure‚Äù on his spring-summer collection, reflecting the realities facing students arond the world today. Avetisyan studied at London‚Äôs Central St Martins art school.
‚ÄúHe has always been bit of rebel‚Äù, says The Calvert Journal in a recent profile of his latest work ‚Äì a video mocking the marketing techniques of fashion houses. The designer, originally from St Petersburg, now calls Moscow his home. 10. Masha Demianova, fashion photographer
Born and raised in Moscow, Masha Demianova got her first camera at 14. Now aged 24, she is said to be ‚Äúpioneering female gaze photography‚Äù in Russia. She‚Äôs a fashion photographer by trade but also shoots portraits which, unlike Rubchinsky and Gutkina, lean towards coming-of-age girls not boys. She also curates RYE, a ‚Äúvirtual community‚Äù mentoring young photographers from across Russia and Ukraine. 11. Valeriya Gai Germanika, film-maker The enfant terrible of Russian film, Valeriya Gai Germanika started making movies at 19. By the time she was 30 she had directed eight films and starred in three. She won international acclaim and a slot at Cannes for her first feature in 2008, Everybody Dies But Me, or Vse Umrut A Ia Ostanius.
The coming-of-age Russian drama charts the life and survival of three young teenage girls living a brutalist Moscow suburb. She then turned her hand to TV, filming two series, School, also about teenagers, and A Brief Guide to a Happy Life, Kratky kurs schastlivoy zhizni, a story of love and work in Moscow. She has just turned 31. 12, 13. Maiden Obey, DJ and art duo
Dasha Utchka and Anastasia Pilepchuk, both in their mid 20s, only started DJing in 2013 but their infectious ‚Äúyoung and wild‚Äù style has quickly secured them a place on Moscow‚Äôs notoriously exclusive club scene. They crafted a mixtape for Calvert Journal this month, comprised almost exclusively of Russian producers because ‚ÄúRussian electronic music is developing really quickly and is in quite a good place at the moment‚Äù. The pair also founded of popular erotic online magazine, Areola. 14. Lapti, DJ, ‚Äòthe voice of the Moscow suburbs‚Äô Moscow‚Äôs identikit suburbs are the city‚Äôs most creative hotspots, giving a new generation of Russia creatives the space to be ‚Äúhonest‚Äù about modern life, says Anastasiia Fedorova from the Calvert Journal. Lapti, is one of these, a music visionary who‚Äôs been called the ‚Äúvoice of Moscow‚Äôs suburbs‚Äù.
Lapti specialises in using 80s sci-fi soundtracks, 90s jungle rave tracks and naughties in Russian drum‚Äôn‚Äôbass and making them sound relevant to the city today. Last FM have described him as a ‚Äúcredit to Moscow‚Äôs beat scene‚Äù. Ahead of a recent Boiler Room performance ‚Äì which recently launched in the city, he listed Russian 90s and Soviet pop in his musical influences. Lapti doesn‚Äôt think the world pays enough attention to Russia‚Äôs underground music scene: ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs what makes it underground.‚Äù Media 15, 16, 17. The Dzyadko brothers The Dzyadko brothers are part of a young, liberal media dynasty. Tikhon, 28, works for TV Rain, Timofei Dzyadko, 30, is a correspondent for RBC, an independent Russian broadcaster, and Fillip, 33, runs an online education project. For three years the brothers ran a weekly web news show called Dzyadko 3, described by Newsweek as ‚Äúa de facto anti-Putin brainstorming session‚Äù, but stopped in 2013 because they got tired, says Tikhon.
To be a young journalist in Russia today is to make a choice, he explains. In state media you will get a good salary, wear nice suits, play with shiny cameras, but you are part of a huge propaganda organ. In independent media you will have no money and you must be prepared for a continual onslaught on your character. You are called a ‚Äúfascist‚Äù and a ‚Äútraitor‚Äù, and there will be times when you ask yourself why you are doing this, he says. For Tikhon the answer is simple. If you work for the state you are not ‚Äútrying find the answers to difficult questions‚Äù but simply a purveyor of information, he says. The path the brothers have taken is perhaps not surprising, his mother is a journalist and there are a number of other writers in his family. Will they work together again? ‚ÄúI think maybe, it was a nice experience‚Äù Tikhon says. 18. Rita Popova, editor-in-chief of Look At Me
‚ÄúAge doesn‚Äôt matter in the newsroom,‚Äù says Rita Popova, who was appointed editor-in-chief of cult hipster website Look At Me at 21. She is one of the youngest of her colleagues, aged between 16 and their mid-40s, who were all surprised by the level of Russian media attention about her age, she says. She defines hipsters as young people who have moved from ‚Äúbare consumerism‚Äù to ‚Äúfinding ways to change the world‚Ä¶ Basically it‚Äôs not about drinking flat white to go anymore. It‚Äôs about making your own coffee and starting a business, even a tiny one,‚Äù she explains. But the term hipster is problematic. It has become a label tarnished with negative connotations and ‚Äúlabels, whatever they are, are not cool,‚Äù she says. And her three hot tips for being cool in Moscow? There are no rules; things go in and out of fashion too fast to bother and the most interesting subcultures can be found on the bus, she explains. 19. Daniel Trabun, editor-in-chief of Afisha
Daniel Trabun is at the helm of one of Moscow‚Äôs most influential urban lifestyle magazines, Afisha. Launched in 2000 focusing on listings, the magazine has expanded to include items such as live-streaming from Gorky Park ‚Äì Moscow‚Äôs symbol of gentrification ‚Äì to a feature comparing Crimean rave festival KaZantip to others around the world. The magazine also hosts a yearly festival in Moscow: the Afisha Picnic. Trabun took the helm aged 26 after launch editor Yury Saprykin stepped down expressing a wish to work ‚Äúaway from the Russian media‚Äù. 20. Ilya Klishin, online editor-in-chief of TV Rain Over the past five years TV Rain has established itself as the go-to channel for independent news in a market otherwise sown up by the state. Ilya Klishin, 27, is online editor of the channel, which covers stories that others don‚Äôt dare to touch. Klishin has contributed to a host of Russia‚Äôs other liberal media sites and was credited with the technology behind 2012‚Äôs ‚ÄúBig White Circle‚Äù flashmob, a human chain of individual protests around the capital‚Äôs garden ring. 21. Roman Dobrokhotov, journalist and social activist By the age of 29 Roman Dobrokhotov had been arrested more than 120 times for a string of political performances that took aim at Putin, Russia‚Äôs Orthodox church and country‚Äôs nationalists. ‚ÄúRevolution is me,‚Äù says the Twitter bio of the Moscow-based blogger, friend of Pussy Riot and the editor of The Insider, an online investigative journalism site which launched in 2013. The journalist, now 33, penned a tongue-in-cheek open letter to Edward Snowden on his arrival in Moscow ‚Äì an extended welcome assuring him that the security services were monitoring every conversation leaving ‚Äúnothing here in Russia to expose‚Äù. Entrepreneurs 22. Vladimir Shreyder, digital designer ‚ÄúThere is no Silicon Valley in Moscow,‚Äù says Vladimir Shreyder. ‚ÄúThere are talented guys like Pavel Durov, the Russian Zuckerberg, there‚Äôs Yandex, but they are just Russian versions of famous worldwide projects.‚Äù Moscow-based Shreyder, 30, is creative director of Glitch√©, an app which allows users to ‚Äúturn images into masterpieces of digital art‚Äù, whose fans include Kim Kardashian, Lily Allen and Brooklyn Beckham.
The designer also developed SLMMSK: an ‚Äúanti-selfie‚Äù app that lets users mask their identity with emojis or pixels, and Parking Douche, an app that lets people shame Moscow‚Äôs famously bad drivers ‚Äì and parkers ‚Äì in real time, which won the Cannes Golden Lion mobile award in 2012. For Shreyder, who been working in digital design for 15 years, the future is all about mobile apps. But he has given up trying to get Russian investors interest. Glitch√©‚Äô had no formal marketing or Russian support, it just spread virally: ‚ÄúPeople recommend it because they love it‚Äù he says. 23. Natalia Fishman, urban activist
Moscow has been gentrifying at breakneck speed, from the burgeoning creative industries to the multi-million-pound makeover of Gorky Park. Much of this can be attributed to Sergei Kapkov, the city‚Äôs former culture minister ‚Äì unofficially ‚ÄúMoscow‚Äôs Hipster Minister‚Äù ‚Äì who resigned in March in this year. He was assisted by Natalia Fishman, an urban activist who, by 21 had been involved in cultural projects including Gorky Park and the Jewish Museum and Tolerance centre. Now 24, she is the assistant to the president of the Russian Republic of Tatarstan 24. Eugenia Kyuda, tech entrepreneur Co-founder of Luka, a ‚Äúfriendly restaurant robot taking the pain out of where-to-eat decisions‚Äù. Ask ‚Äúwhere shall I go for dinner?‚Äù and the mobile food app will measure up the options against your search history to give you one suggestion. Moscow-born Eugenia Kudya said the app came out of her desire to put artificial intelligence to practical use. The 28-year-old entrepreneur had previously founded Bribr: an application that allowed users to record ‚Äì anonymously and safely ‚Äì if they were asked to pay a bribe. It was developed with a team of Muscovite volunteers in the wake of the city‚Äôs corruption protests in 2012. 25. Sergei Berezutsky, young chef
Sergei Berezutsky is a global pioneer for modern Russian cuisine. At 28 he was voted the best young chef in the world after a two-day cook out which saw him fuse Russian and Italian ingredients. Like many chefs, he fell in love with food after helping his mother out in the kitchen as a boy. He has described his cooking style as a combination of local produce and modern technology. 26, 27, 28. Anna Bichevskaya, Aliona Ermakova and Liya Mur Anna Bichevskaya, 34, Aliona Ermakova, 26, and Liya Mur, 26, the three women who set up Russia‚Äôs first supper club, Stay Hungry, are committed to promoting local cuisine. The club takes place in a rented apartment with a distinct hipster hangout feel, and is as much about the social experience as the food.
The club is also about the rise of the Moscow ‚Äúfoodie‚Äù, Ermakova told the Calvert Journal. Previously going to a restaurant in Russia was reserved for special occasions or if you were ‚Äúshowing off‚Äù, otherwise people would eat ‚Äúpelmeni and potatoes at home‚Äù, she added. They say they are keen to keep their clubs ‚Äúsmall and special‚Äù. Would-be guests apply through a closed Facebook group in which they impose a ‚Äúface control‚Äù policy favoured by the city‚Äôs bouncers: if you don‚Äôt have the right style or attitude you don‚Äôt get an invite to dinner. 29, 30. Daniil and David Liberman, tech venture capitalists Another set of brothers to cap off the list: Daniil and David Liberman describe themselves as ‚Äúserial entrepreneurs and investors‚Äù. The brothers founded Kanobu, Russia‚Äôs most popular daily gaming site, which was reported to have been brought by the search engine Rambler for $3.5m in 2011.
The pair have since set up their own tech investment site called Brothers Ventures, whose portfolio includes Coub, an app that lets you loop 10 seconds worth of video. Their biggest hit was a 10 second loop of Putin staring down Barack Obama. They have also invested in Knotch.it, a tool to monitor audience reaction to brand content, and Epoxy, a host of tools marketed at YouTubers to build their audiences.

2015-06-08T08:00:23Z,world,World news,Erdoƒüan concedes no party has mandate after shock Turkish vote,"President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan of Turkey has said the country is entering an uncertain period of coalition government after his 13-year-old reign of solid majorities for the Justice and Development party (AKP) was ended by a stunning voter backlash against his increasingly authoritarian rule.
‚ÄúOur nation‚Äôs opinion is above everything else,‚Äù Erdoƒüan said in his first public reaction to the parliamentary elections on Sunday that represented a watershed by shaving nearly 10 points from the governing party and putting a liberal pro-Kurdish party in parliament in Ankara for the first time. Erdoƒüan‚Äôs conciliatory tone contrasted sharply with the highly polarising language he used during the campaign. He said no party had won a mandate to govern alone and urged all political parties to work towards preserving an environment of confidence and stability in the country. Coalition talks will dominate the coming weeks in Turkey after voters snubbed the president‚Äôs plans to change the constitution and extend his grip on power, delivering the biggest blow to the AKP since it swept to power in 2002. The election result wrecked Erdoƒüan‚Äôs ambition of rewriting the constitution to establish himself as an all-powerful executive president, while the country‚Äôs large Kurdish minority has been granted its biggest voice ever in national politics.
‚ÄúI believe the results, which do not give the opportunity to any party to form a single-party government, will be assessed healthily and realistically by every party.‚Äù
The election breakthrough for the leftist HDP, a new party largely representing the Kurds but also encompassing liberals nationally, was greeted with wild celebrations in the Kurdish-majority city of Diyarbakir in south-eastern Turkey. Cars paraded through the city with drivers honking and people hanging out from windows making ‚ÄòV‚Äô signs as occasional gunshots were fired into the air. The results will give the Kurds ‚Äì who, with 20% of Turkey‚Äôs population, are the country‚Äôs biggest minority ‚Äì true representation in parliament. The HDP surpassed the steep 10% threshold for entering parliament to take more than 12% of the vote and around 80 seats in the 550-strong chamber. The party‚Äôs result also denied Erdoƒüan‚Äôs AKP its majority. The 10% hurdle, dating from the military-authored constitution of 1980, had been intended in part to diminish Kurdish representation in the parliament. Sunday‚Äôs vote was the first time in four general elections to see a fall in support for Erdoƒüan. While the AKP comfortably managed to secure the biggest portion of the vote, its 41% share of seats represents a sharp drop from its performance the 2011 elections, when it won nearly half the national vote. For the first time since 2002, the AKP will need to form a coalition government or call new elections. The government‚Äôs deputy prime minister, Numan Kurtulmus, told reporters he was confident that his party would form a coalition with one of the other three parties, calling the idea of a new election a ‚Äúdistant possibility.‚Äù It remains unclear, however, who will be a likely partner for the AKP after the most likely candidate, the rightwing Nationalist Movement party (MHP) ruled out the possibility of a coalition. According to the state-run Anadolu agency, the party leader, Devlet Bahceli, said the party was ‚Äúready to be a main opposition party‚Äù against an AKP-led coalition or minority government during a speech from party headquarters in Ankara early on Monday. ‚ÄúNobody has a right to drag Turkey into [AKP] minority and some circles‚Äô scenarios,‚Äù said Bahceli. ‚ÄúA snap election will happen whenever it will happen.‚Äù He welcomed the election results, with his party gaining 31 seats in parliament.
Selahattin Demirtas, co-chair of the leftist HDP, and surprise star of this election, also dismissed any possibility of a coalition with the AKP. ‚ÄúWe will not form a coalition with the AKP. We stand behind our words. We will be in parliament as a strong opposition,‚Äù Demirtas said in a press conference in Istanbul on Sunday night. He added that the election results had clearly put an end to all plans of an executive presidency. ‚ÄúAs of this moment, the debate on the presidency, the debate about dictatorship, has come to an end in Turkey. Turkey has returned from the edge of a cliff,‚Äù he said. Pro-government newspapers on Monday morning were already calling for early elections. ‚ÄúThe ballot box revealed the ballot box‚Äù, read the headline of the conservateive daily Yeni Safak. Burhan Kuzu, the AK party deputy and head of the parliamentary constitution commission, said snap elections were inevitable. ‚ÄúNo government will emerge from this scenario. Not even a coalition,‚Äù he told BBC T√ºrk√ße. ‚ÄúEarly elections look inevitable.‚Äù He added that the election results reflected the weakness of the parliamentary system. ‚ÄúThe parliamentary system is a curse for the whole world. In Turkey only majority governments ever worked, coalitions always destroyed it.‚Äù He said that the only solution would be an executive presidency. New elections could be called any time in the next 45 days. Official results based on 99.9% of votes counted put the AKP in the lead, followed by the Republican People‚Äôs party (CHP) on 25%, the MHP on 16.5% and the HDP in fourth place with 13%. Turnout was 86%. According to official projections, the AKP will have 258 seats in the 550-seat parliament, CHP 132, MHP 81 and HDP 79.
The AKP has dominated Turkish politics since it first came to power in 2002, but has suffered from a dip in economic growth and controversy over Erdoƒüan‚Äôs perceived authoritarian tendencies. The results wreck Erdoƒüan‚Äôs dream of agreeing a new constitution to switch Turkey from a parliamentary to a presidential system that he had made a fundamental issue in the campaign. Such a change would have required a two-thirds majority in the parliament. Speaking from the balcony of AKP headquarters in Ankara ‚Äì the traditional venue for the party‚Äôs victory speeches ‚Äì the prime minister and party leader, Ahmet Davutoglu, sought to put a brave face on the results. ‚ÄúThe winner of the election is again the AKP, there‚Äôs no doubt,‚Äù he said, pledging to ensure Turkey‚Äôs stability. But he added: ‚ÄúOur people‚Äôs decision is final. It‚Äôs above everything and we will act in line with it.‚Äù But the atmosphere outside the AKP‚Äôs headquarters was muted. Several hundred supporters chanted for Erdoƒüan, the party‚Äôs founder, but there was little sign of the huge crowds that gathered after past election victories. Erdogan‚Äôs divide-and-rule strategy of rallying his religious-conservative base has led to increasing polarisation in Turkey, and in some cases to violence. Erdoƒüan had repeatedly lashed out at the HDP and its charismatic leader Demirta≈ü before the elections. The HDP ran on a platform defending the rights of ethnic minorities, women, and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people - forming an electoral coalition between the Kurdish minority in Turkey‚Äôs south-east and liberals in Istanbul and elsewhere. ‚ÄúThis result shows that this country has had enough. Enough of Erdoƒüan and his anger,‚Äù said Seyran Demir, a 47-year-old who was among the thousands who gathered in the streets around the HDP‚Äôs provincial headquarters in Diyarbakir. ‚ÄúI am so full of joy that I can‚Äôt speak properly.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is a carnival night,‚Äù said 47-year-old Huseyin Durmaz, a Kurd. ‚ÄúWe no longer trust the AKP,‚Äù he said. Another record was set by the number of women MPs set to take a seat in parliament after an unofficial tally estimated a total of 96 female parliamentarians securing a place in the Turkish grand national assembly ‚Äì a record high and up from 79 in 2011.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-08T05:00:08Z,world,World news,Narcissism and terrorism: how the personality disorder leads to deadly violence,"When Man Haron Monis, self-styled Islamic cleric, took 18 hostages in the Lindt cafe in Sydney, he declared himself to be a jihadist on behalf of Islamic State. Reports of the siege immediately went global. But, in fact, Monis had no connection to the group; he had brought the wrong flag to his own siege, and demanded that police bring him the right one in exchange for releasing hostages. In the inquest into the siege, which concluded last week, Monis was described as a ‚Äúman spiralling downwards‚Äù. He had no job but many debts, had lost custody of his children and faced a lengthy jail term. Seeking ‚Äúpower and influence‚Äù, he had even briefly joined a biker gang, but was rejected as too ‚Äúweird‚Äù. ‚ÄúHis constant goal in life,‚Äù junior assisting counsel Sophie Callan summed up, ‚Äúappears to have been achieving significance.‚Äù Pretending to be an important cleric, in reality he was on bail for sordid crimes: as an accessory to his ex-wife‚Äôs murder and for multiple sexual assaults on women, committed while posing as a ‚Äúspiritual healer‚Äù. He claimed to be a refugee fleeing persecution in Iran; it now seems likely he fled after embezzling money. Diagnosed with a number of mental health problems, he was a relentless attention seeker with delusions of grandeur and a con man, who elevated his personal grievances with the heavenly glow of Islamic jihadism. Before he took hostages, Monis sent vicious letters to the grieving families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan. Monis‚Äôs lawyer sternly instructed him not to talk to the press when he was on trial for this crime. It would harm his case. Like a moth to the flame, Monis rushed out to the assembled media and stood gesticulating, long robes fluttering, proclaiming dramatically: ‚ÄúThis pen is my gun and these words are my bullets.‚Äù
It was a humiliation ‚Äì the Australian high court threw out an appeal against his conviction for the defamatory letters ‚Äì that provided the emotional trigger for the subsequent siege. Monis would have been understood, and diminished by being seen, as his lawyer described him, as ‚Äúa damaged goods individual‚Äù. Accordingly, he wrapped his outburst of deadly rage in an Isis flag, and claimed he was acting on behalf of the caliphate. Like other lone-wolf killers, he gained a greater significance to his actions by attaching his personal grievance to a larger ideology. And like so many of this decade‚Äôs most infamous terrorists and murderers, his theatrical crimes suggest he was pathologically narcissistic. Narcissistic personality disorder involves a pervasive grandiosity, an extreme desire for attention, a sense of entitlement, a willingness to exploit or mistreat others, an excessive need for admiration and a lack of empathy. Yet narcissists can be fragile too and prone to outbursts of humiliated rage. Their grandiose self-beliefs are built on foundations as solid as quicksand, hence the need for constant admiration and attention, shoring up their unstable sense of self.
As the co-author of a recent study, Brad Bushman, explains, narcissism is the claim that you are superior to other people. From this core belief, bad things flow. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been studying aggression for about 30 years,‚Äù says Bushman, ‚Äúand I‚Äôve seen that the most harmful belief that a person can have is that they‚Äôre superior to others.‚Äù Narcissists ‚Äúfantasise about personal successes and believe they deserve special treatment. When they feel humiliated, they often lash out aggressively or even violently.‚Äù Psychologists warn that narcissism is on the increase. Invisibility is a central terror of the narcissist, and in our world of hyper-individualism, the competitive pursuit of attention produces winners and losers, those who painfully feel passed over and excluded. One response to the shame of exclusion and marginalisation is violence, which enacts revenge at the same moment that it lifts the person out of oblivion. At the more pathological end of the spectrum, we have what the psychoanalyst Otto Kernberg called malignant narcissism, the source of much ‚Äúevil in the world‚Äù. Disappointed in reality, love turns inward, the self becomes idealised, doted upon, admired and excused. Narcissism becomes deadly when destructive impulses become fused with the conscience, transforming lying, manipulation, murder or even terrorism into noble, moral acts. Malignant narcissists may even kill to slake their thirst for attention.
While we may never know with certainty why the Germanwings pilot Andreas Lubitz flew a plane with 149 other people into a mountain, his behaviour has many resonances with that of Monis and other narcissists. He once warned a girlfriend: ‚ÄúOne day, I will do something that will change the whole system, and then all will know my name and remember it.‚Äù Narcissists can have violent mood swings as they are alternately inflated and deflated, puffed up by hubris, or crushed by a collision with reality that cracks open a cauldron of shame. In Lubitz‚Äôs case, he had just suffered blows to central life goals ‚Äì remaining a pilot, making captain, and keeping a longstanding girlfriend after cheating on her. She and others have said that Lubitz had frightening mood swings and aggressive outbursts. Excessively preoccupied about how he looked and how he appeared to others, he responded to his girlfriend‚Äôs doubts by suddenly buying two prestige Audis ‚Äì a his and a hers ‚Äì just before the crash. Depression is a deeply painful condition, usually marked by withdrawal, ruminative sadness, self-blame and excessive guilt. Those concerned about the stigmatisation of depression after Lubitz rightly point to the fact that self-harm rather than violence is more likely. There is a very different kind of depression however; the shame-rage spiral of the narcissist who reacts to failure with other-directed, humiliated fury. As Jeff Victoroff, neuropsychiatrist at the University of Southern California argued in the LA Times: ‚ÄúWe need to stop talking as if this was a suicidal guy with access to an airplane. This was a murderous guy who probably had elements of a mood disorder and personality disorders.‚Äù In narcissism, an inflated grandiosity is repeatedly punctured by an unbending reality. Depression and even suicide can be the reaction. Elsa Ronningstam, a Boston-based specialist in narcissism, calls this the ‚Äúmy way or no way!‚Äù suicide. The narcissist defends against feelings of catastrophic failure by resorting to a fantasy of specialness, an illusion of mastery and control. Sentiments such as ‚ÄúI fear nothing, not even death‚Äù (Lubitz‚Äôs breathing as the plane hurtled towards the mountain was steady); ‚Äúdeath before dishonour‚Äù (failing to make it as captain); and ‚ÄúI‚Äôll show you‚Äù (the rejecting girlfriend, the wider world) can be elements in the egoistic suicide. In pathological narcissism there is a complete lack of empathy towards those that rage destroys, such as the 149 others he killed. If Lubitz wanted fame, he was rewarded posthumously. Since the crash, searching for his name on Google brings up more than 12m hits. ‚ÄòWho gets to decide who lives or dies?‚Äô ‚ÄòMe‚Äô Or consider Anders Breivik, responsible for the slaughter of 77 people in Norway. He wanted to be the worst mass murderer in history. Psychiatrists did not find that he had paranoid schizophrenia, as first thought, but several disorders, most notably an extreme narcissistic personality disorder. Breivik‚Äôs narcissism is in abundant evidence in Asne Seierstadt‚Äôs new, gripping account of his life and crimes, One of Us. When police tried to take a mugshot of him, he protested. He wanted them to use Photoshopped studio images he had posted online. Foreseeing the humiliation of not looking his best after the massacre, these showed him with makeup and in powerful poses ‚Äì wearing military garb festooned with medals, or aiming a rifle in a tight sports suit with the words ‚ÄúMarxist Hunter‚Äù emblazoned on the sleeve. The police refused and went to take the photo anyhow. They were astonished when Breivik, stripped to his underwear for the shot, with a sudden, grotesque theatricality adopted a proud body-builder‚Äôs pose, side on, hand on hip with muscles flexed.
Like Monis, Breivik also claimed a larger political significance to his crime, only this time as Christian crusader. In his 1,500-page online manifesto, he gave himself lofty titles such as ‚ÄúGrand Commander of the Knights Templar‚Äù. He had not slaughtered innocents but performed ‚Äúpolitical executions‚Äù of ‚Äúcultural Marxists‚Äù. A policeman asked him: ‚ÄúWho gets to decide who lives or dies?‚Äù Breivik‚Äôs answer: me. Malignant narcissists, though devoured by envy and rage, can still idealise powerful figures whose beliefs conveniently justify the destruction of those they denigrate, says Kernberg. This makes them susceptible to taking an ideology such as jihadism to the point of violent extremism. In Terror in the Name of God; Why Religious Militants Kill, Jessica Stern interviewed many terrorists. She found a common theme: ‚ÄúThey start out feeling humiliated, enraged that they are viewed by some ‚ÄòOther‚Äô as second class. They take on a new identity on behalf of a purported spiritual cause. The weak become strong ‚Ä¶ rage turns to conviction.‚Äù As the world is simplified into good and evil, they feel ‚Äúspiritually intoxicated‚Äù. The ‚Äúapocalyptic violence‚Äù on behalf of their spiritual calling, committed as if in a trance, is addictive, the ultimate high. In the deeply troubling phenomenon of suburban jihadists, young people with narcissistic traits may also be attracted to what terrorism expert Raphaello Pantucci calls ‚Äújihadi cool‚Äù. This is a chillingly brilliant marketing exercise via social media: a teenage adventure camp with a Kalashnikov among flowering meadows; a world of belief, purity and struggle; a prefabricated heroic identity to slip into; a tightly woven place in the world; the promise of obliging brides and sex slaves; a secure sense of superiority to the fallen, craven and corrupt world of the impure infidel; a loyal band of brothers; and permission to kill. Above all else, what is promised is significance. He had found his place in the world, as a suicide bomber It is that significance that seems to have attracted another sad, lonely, lost boy, Jake Bilardi, now known as ‚ÄúJihadi Jake‚Äù, from a featureless outer suburb on the plains of northern Melbourne. This tender-faced wisp of a lad, with a cloud of long, soft hair, is now memorialised in a famous photo. Flanked by two burly jihadists, Bilardi‚Äôs pale, skinny arms hold on to an oversize Kalashnikov. From an affluent atheist background, Bilardi was an isolated loner. His search for meaning followed his parents‚Äô divorce, when he lost all contact with his father, then lost his mother to cancer. He was a disturbed boy with mental health issues that his father admitted were never addressed. Young Jake craved attention, had wild rages and attacked his parents with weapons such as scissors. A highly intelligent maths whizz, he found school life an agonising social humiliation. He was horribly bullied and friendless. Capsized emotionally by the death of his mother, he converted to Islam. Bilardi wrote a political blog. His extremism grew. So did his paranoia. One post tells how, sitting in his living room, he looked at his brothers and thought they might kill him. He dropped out of school and isolated himself, but, via the internet, developed new attachments, to a world far away, to an ideal of earthly perfection, the caliphate run by Isis.
Ideology has the capacity to make a butterfly out of a grub. Bilardi managed to find moral perfection in beheadings, sexual slavery and attacks on priceless artefacts from the past. In Isis he would find true ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù who would value him, whom he could impress with his willingness to die, such as the burly jihadists flanking him in that photograph. In Bilardi‚Äôs manifesto, From Melbourne to Ramadi, Australia was condemned as ‚Äúa land full of such filth and corruption that no one in their right mind could live there without a craving to let some heads roll‚Äù. A picture of people shopping is captioned: ‚ÄúThe talking pigs of Melbourne, Australia, in their sty ‚Ä¶‚Äù Dehumanised as pigs, his fellow Australians could be slaughtered. Stockpiled in his Craigieburn home were the ingredients for a bomb. His manifesto told of plan B: ‚ÄúLaunching a string of bombings across Melbourne, targeting foreign consulates and political/military targets, as well as grenade and knife attacks on shopping centres and cafes and culminating with myself detonating a belt of explosives amongst the Kuffar.‚Äù This painfully shy, anxious boy, rejected, taunted and bullied, finally felt he had found his place in the world, part of a glorious struggle that promised him a heroic identity and spiritual immortality as a suicide bomber in Iraq. He described driving into Aleppo, and feeling utterly elated when he saw the Isis black flag flying high. After his death, he was no longer invisible, but infamous, acquiring another kind of immortality. Christopher Lasch wrote in The Culture of Narcissism of how the ‚Äúsociety of the spectacle‚Äù encourages the desire to have one‚Äôs life recorded and transmitted to an unseen audience: ‚ÄúThe prevailing conditions thus brought out narcissistic personality traits that were present in everyone.‚Äù And especially, one might add, in mass killers and jihadists. Fame is not just about being known. It is a fast route to high status and social dominance. Fame delivers the illusion that you matter more than other people. One of the Charlie Hebdo killers, Cherif Kouachi, originally sought to escape his life of petty crime and poverty by becoming a famous rapper. He sought a very western form of fame, and failed, before gaining it by launching an attack on the west.
Fame played a part too for Mohammed Emwazi, the British man now known as ‚ÄúJihadi John‚Äù. Formerly an obscure London lad with modest prospects, he is now a new human type, the celebrity beheader. Stern says: ‚ÄúSome experience a different kind of high: they like weapons and they like to kill, and they would do so for almost any reason.‚Äù The only real clue we have to the mystery of Emwazi is his violent, rage-filled outbursts as a youngster. On joining Isis, however, the sadism that Kernberg warns of in malignant narcissism becomes clear, in the evident pleasure with which he kills aid workers and journalists, and in the exultant torture he metes out beforehand. ‚ÄúFeel it? Cold, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù Emwazi said to freed Spanish journalist Javier Espinosa, holding a blade to his neck. ‚ÄúCan you imagine the pain you‚Äôll feel when it cuts?‚Äù He describes in horrific detail each stage of the beheading; ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen it before, you all squirm like animals, like pigs. The third blow will take off your head. I‚Äôd put it on your back.‚Äù As justly reviled as he is by many, Emwazi is idolised by Isis recruits as the personification of jihadi cool. Such killers get fans. Breivik complains from prison about the ‚Äúhuman rights abuses‚Äù of being given old versions of PlayStation, while his fans send him his favourite perfume, Chanel Egoiste, also the favourite brand of Isis commander Abou Bilel. Such killers may speak as if they are acting piously under the eye of an all-powerful God, but they actually act with a sharp, greedy eye for their audience of human peers. Getting a narcissistic hit of attention is indissolubly part of what Jessica Stern and JM Berger, authors of new book Isis: The State of Terror call the appeal of ‚Äúthe crack cocaine of violent extremism, all the elements that make it so alluring and so addictive purified into a crystallised form.‚Äù Understanding that truth, repugnant as it is, will have to be a part of any effective programme of counter-terrorism. ‚Ä¢ Anne Manne‚Äôs book, The Life of I: The New Culture of Narcissism, is published by Melbourne University Press and available on Kindle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-07T23:51:11Z,world,World news,Hungarian activists arrested for defacing anti-immigration billboard,"Activists in Hungary have been arrested after defacing government billboards which warned immigrants not to take Hungarians‚Äô jobs. The six people arrested are from the Egy√ºtt (Together) opposition party. Police said that five of the six had admitted responsibility for the vandalism and had been released. The posters targeted by the activists were on display in central Budapest and said: ‚ÄúIf you come to Hungary, you cannot take the jobs of Hungarians.‚Äù Hungary‚Äôs government, led by the prime minister, Viktor Orb√°n, and his rightwing Fidesz party, recently launched a national consultation on ‚Äúimmigration and terrorism‚Äù. A series of anti-immigration posters were put up as part of the campaign. As well as cautioning against taking Hungarians‚Äô jobs, the posters demand newcomers to Hungary respect the nation‚Äôs culture and laws. A questionnaire sent to Hungarian voters as part of the consultation appears to connect migration with terrorism, as well as floating the idea of putting all illegal immigrants into internment camps. Last month, Orban, who has ruled Hungary since 2010, described the EU‚Äôs quotas for taking in asylum-seekers as ‚Äúbordering on insanity‚Äù. In response, the EU commission‚Äôs vice president, Frans Timmersmans, condemned Orban‚Äôs questionnaire as ‚Äúmalicious and wrong‚Äù. On Tuesday Orban hit out again, suggesting that mass migration into the EU would amount to the end of Christian Europe and ‚Äúchange the face of Europe‚Äôs civilisation‚Äù. Fidesz has recently been losing ground to the far-right Jobbik party, which is thought to have prompted the government‚Äôs recent anti-immigration push. Orban has also suggested Hungary might consider reintroducing the death penalty, which was abolished following the fall of communism in 1989, again prompting fierce criticism from Brussels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-07T22:57:22Z,world,World news,Turkey election: ruling party loses majority as pro-Kurdish HDP gains seats,"Turkey‚Äôs president, Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, has suffered his biggest setback in 13 years of amassing power as voters denied his ruling party a parliamentary majority for the first time since 2002 and gave the country‚Äôs large Kurdish minority its biggest voice ever in national politics. The election result on Sunday, with almost all votes counted, appeared to wreck Erdoƒüan‚Äôs ambition of rewriting the constitution to establish himself as an all-powerful executive president. Erdoƒüan‚Äôs governing Justice and Development party, or AKP, won the election comfortably for the fourth time in a row, with around 41% of the vote, but that represented a steep fall in support from 49% in 2011, throwing the government of the country into great uncertainty.
The vote was the first time in four general elections that support for Erdoƒüan decreased. The fall coupled with an election triumph for a new pro-Kurdish party meant it was unlikely that the AKP would be able to form a majority government, forcing it to negotiate a coalition, probably with extreme nationalists, or to call a fresh election if no parliamentary majority can be secured within six weeks. The new party, the HDP or Peoples‚Äô Democratic party, largely representing the Kurds but also encompassing leftwing liberals, surpassed the steep 10% threshold for entering parliament to take more than 12% of the vote and around 80 seats in the 550-strong chamber. The HDP victory denied Erdoƒüan‚Äôs party its majority. Erdoƒüan campaigned to secure a minimum of 330 seats in the parliament, a three-fifths majority that would have enabled him to call a referendum on the constitution with a view to converting Turkey into a presidential rather than a parliamentary system. But the AKP appeared unlikely to muster even a simple 276-seat majority.
‚ÄúWe expect a minority government and an early election,‚Äù a senior AKP official told Reuters. The prime minister and nominal head of the AK party, Ahmet Davutoglu, had promised to resign if he failed to obtain a simple parliamentary majority. With internal dissent rumbling in recent weeks within the government ranks and at the top of the AKP, the poor result for Erdoƒüan is likely to embolden dissenters and could spark a power stuggle. The atmosphere outside the AKP‚Äôs headquarters in Ankara was muted. Several hundred supporters chanted for Erdoƒüan, the party‚Äôs founder, but there was little sign of the huge crowds that gathered after past election victories. In the conservative district of Tophane, an AKP stronghold in Istanbul, only a couple of men were sitting in a local teahouse to follow Davutoglu‚Äôs balcony speech. ‚ÄúI am not unhappy,‚Äù, said Nusret Aksoy, 50. ‚ÄúThe AKP came out the strongest party by far.‚Äù Pointing at the TV screen, he added: ‚ÄúLook, do these crowds seem unhappy to you? They are not. These elections were good and democratic.‚Äù
He added that he was satisfied that the HDP managed to get into parliament: ‚ÄúThe people gave them a chance to prove themselves. Now they have to show everyone what they are really made of, that they are not just talking, but also capable of delivering.‚Äù By contrast, thousands of jubilant Kurds flooded the streets of the south-eastern city of Diyarbakir as the results came in. Erdoƒüan had repeatedly lashed out at the HDP and its charismatic leader, Selahattin Demirta≈ü, before the election. Demirta≈ü promptly ruled out a coalition with the AKP. ‚ÄúThis result shows that this country has had enough. Enough of Erdoƒüan and his anger,‚Äù said Seyran Demir, a 47-year-old housewife who was among the thousands who gathered in the streets around the HDP‚Äôs provincial headquarters. ‚ÄúI am so full of joy that I can‚Äôt speak properly.‚Äù In Istanbul, enthused crowds chanted ‚Äúwe are the HDP, we will be in parliment‚Äù outside the press conference Demirta≈ü held in Istanbul on Sunday night. ‚ÄúI am so happy,‚Äù said B√ºlent Aras, 40. ‚ÄúThis means that there will be peace, the war is over. This party represents everyone. We will finally all be equal in Turkey. This will put an end to the corruption.‚Äù He added that he was not surprised about the results. ‚ÄúWe expected to do well. It was time for change.‚Äù ‚ÄúI had hoped for this to happen,‚Äù said 61-year-old painter Mehmet Hakki Sabancali. ‚ÄúI was so nervous that the HDP might not get 10%. This rings in a new Turkey. The HDP will do away with old taboos: with LBGT rights, gay marriage, conscientious objection and non-Muslim minorities.‚Äù As head of state since last August following a triple term as prime minister, Erdoƒüan was not on the ballot. But the election was, in effect, a referendum on whether to give his office extraordinary powers that would significantly change Turkish democracy and prolong his reign as the country‚Äôs most powerful politician.
Voters roundly rejected that ambition, with the Kurdish vote in particular swinging the election against the incumbents on an unprecedented scale. The 10% hurdle, dating from the military-authored constitution of 1980, had been intended in part to diminish Kurdish representation in the parliament. The HDP gambled on breaking the built-in disadvantage and triumphed. If it had fallen short of 10%, it would have forfeited all seats. Erdoƒüan‚Äôs divide-and-rule strategy of rallying his religious-conservative base has led to increasing polarisation in Turkey, and in some cases to violence. In the runup to the election, the HDP reported more than 70 attacks on election offices and campaigners across the country. On Friday, two bombs exploded at an election rally in Diyarbakir, killing three and wounding hundreds of others. Official results based on 99.9% of votes counted gave the AKP 41%, followed by the Republican People‚Äôs party (CHP) on 25%, the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) on 16.5% and the HDP in fourth place with 13%. Turnout was at 86%.
‚ÄúThis is the end of identity politics in Turkey,‚Äù said Gencer √ñzcan, professor for international relations at Bilgi University in Istanbul. ‚ÄúThe election threshold is not the only barrier that was overcome tonight in the elections, but also emotional and identity barriers have been breached. This is a golden opportunity for the HDP. Voters in Turkey endorse democracy in Turkey across identity boundaries.‚Äù The HDP ran on a platform defending the rights of ethnic minorities, women, and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. In a polling station in the predominantly Kurdish suburb of Dolapdere in Istanbul, Hacer Dinler, 25, said that she had high hopes for the HDP. ‚ÄúIf they make it into parliament, everything will be better,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe will have more MPs to speak for us, which in turn will strengthen the peace process.‚Äù The HDP success marked a sea-change likely to have a big impact on national politics. Shackled by the high threshold, pro-Kurdish candidates had previously run as independents in single seats to try to beat the 10% party barrier. But the HDP also successfully sought to reach beyond Turkey‚Äôs roughly 20% Kurdish population, attempting to woo centre-left and secular voters disillusioned with Erdoƒüan.
‚ÄúThe reason the HDP has won this many votes is because it has not excluded any members of this country, unlike our current rulers,‚Äù said 25-year-old Siar Senci. ‚ÄúIt has embraced all languages, all ethnicities and members of all faiths and promised them freedom.‚Äù The secularist Republican People‚Äôs party will be the second biggest group in parliament. Murat Karayal√ßin, the party‚Äôs Istanbul chairman, said the outcome was a ‚Äúclear no‚Äù to the executive presidential system championed by Erdoƒüan. The rightwing MHP, long seen as the AKP‚Äôs most likely partner if it tried to form a coalition government, took close to 17% of the vote. The deputy chairman, Oktay Vural, said on Sunday it was too early for him to say whether it would consider forming a coalition government with the AKP. ‚ÄúIt would be wrong for me to make an assessment about a coalition, our party will assess that in the coming period. I think the AK party will be making its own new evaluations after this outcome,‚Äù Vural said. The high stakes of this year‚Äôs parliamentary elections mobilised a large majority of the population to vote. Aliye Goga, 39, a woman of Armenian descent, said it was the first time she had voted. ‚ÄúI just never saw the point before,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúNow my eyes have opened up. The HDP is the only party for women in this country, and they make realistic promises.‚Äù Leyla √áelik, 38, a part-time student voting in Istanbul‚Äôs conservative Fatih district, hoped the AKP would continue in power. ‚ÄúThis government has exceeded all my expectations. We have good healthcare, and women can go to school and university with a headscarf. They are a party that treats us like human beings.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-07T22:03:07Z,world,World news,Bee forces Flybe flight BE384 to turn back to Southampton,"An aeroplane flown by airline Flybe heading to Dublin was forced to turn back after a bee became lodged inside its instruments. The insect flew into one of the instruments on the outside of the jet shortly after it took off from Southampton on Friday. The pilots, spotting the technical issue, turned the plane around and landed without difficulty, a Flybe spokeswoman confirmed. After the passengers had disembarked, engineers checked the plane from flight BE384 and discovered the rogue bee causing the problem. The spokeswoman said that Flybe was sorry for delaying their customers but added that the airline had to ensure all their planes were safe. It is not the first time bees have affected aircraft. Last year, a swarm of the flying insects clouded the cockpit windows of a domestic flight in the United States and began being sucked into the aircraft‚Äôs engines. The pilots returned the aircraft to the ground safely, but passengers told local media the plane was filled with a burning smell. Wasps were at fault for an air tragedy 20 years earlier in the Dominican Republic. A Boeing 757 carrying 189 people crashed five minutes after taking off in February 1996 because the pitot tube ‚Äì which measures the speed of an aeroplane ‚Äì had become blocked by a wasps nest. Confused by the incorrect airspeed readings, the pilot accidentally stalled the plane before it went into a spin and crashed into the sea, killing all on board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-07T19:23:52Z,world,World news,Juncker vents fury over Greek bailout talks at G7 summit,"European Union officials delivered a blistering attack on the Greek government at the G7 summit in Bavaria, and world leaders including Barack Obama sought to avoid a transatlantic split over Ukraine by agreeing to maintain sanctions against Russia. In a day of secluded talks in the Alpine resort of Schloss Elmau, the biggest drama was provided by a verbal attack on the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, by the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. The summit‚Äôs host, Angela Merkel, had hoped to solve the Greek bailout crisis before the summit, but instead Juncker felt forced to open proceedings by staging a press conference accusing Tsipras of undermining negotiations over new terms for a bailout and of effectively lying to the Greek parliament. A visibly angry Juncker said he had told Tsipras during a meeting last Wednesday evening that there was room to negotiate but said the Greeks had been unwilling to take part in in-depth discussions at the meeting. Instead, he said, Tsipras had promised to send him his proposals the following day, but he was still waiting for them on Sunday. ‚ÄúAlexis Tsipras promised that by Thursday evening he would present a second proposal. Then he said he would present it on Friday. And then he said he would call on Saturday. But I have never received that proposal, so I hope I will receive it soon. I would like to have that Greek proposal,‚Äù he said. He told reporters he had said to Tsipras that he continued to exclude the idea of a Grexit ‚Äì ‚Äúbecause I don‚Äôt want to see it‚Äù ‚Äì but that he could not ‚Äúpull a rabbit out of a hat‚Äù. Athens has been trying to secure an agreement from Europe and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for months for access to more than ‚Ç¨7bn in bailout funds. Greece‚Äôs creditors have put strict conditions on any deal, which the Greek government has so far refused to accept. But with Greece running out of money and needing to secure funds by the end of June if it to avoid defaulting on its debts, tensions are high. Juncker, perceived until now as an honest broker in the crisis ‚Äì taking a softer approach than the Germans, who are viewed in Greece as the architects of austerity ‚Äì has rarely been seen in such an irate state, sources close to the EU in Garmisch-Partenkirchen said. They warned that Greece might have lost its closest ally in its long fight to secure a rosier deal. Juncker said he had been disappointed by a speech Tsipras had given to the Athens parliament on Friday. ‚ÄúHe was presenting the offer of the three institutions as a leave-or-take offer. That was not the case ‚Ä¶ He knows perfectly well that is not the case.‚Äù Juncker said Tsipras had failed to mention to parliament his (Juncker‚Äôs) willingness to negotiate over Greek pensions. He added: ‚ÄúI do not have a personal problem with Alexis Tsipras. He was my friend. He is my friend. But frankly, in order to maintain [the friendship], he has to observe some minimum rules.‚Äù Tsipras is due to attend a meeting of European Union and Latin American leaders on Wednesday and Thursday, when Merkel and Fran√ßois Hollande will also be present. Obama underlined his personal determination to see the euro crisis solved after talks on Sunday morning with Merkel. The prolonged standoff predominantly between Germany and Greece is said to be slowing the return to growth, but Obama is siding with the Germans over the need for the Greek government to do more to co-operate. In return, the White House won German support to maintain sanctions against Russia over Ukraine. It issued a statement saying: ‚ÄúThe duration of sanctions should be clearly linked to Russia‚Äôs full implementation of the Minsk agreements and respect for Ukraine‚Äôs sovereignty.‚Äù Germany, Britain and the US want an agreement to offer support to any EU member state tempted to withdraw backing for the sanctions on Moscow, which they say are hurting the Russian economy. Last September‚Äôs Minsk accord involving Russia, pro-Russia rebels and the Ukrainian government included the establishment of a 30km (19-mile) buffer zone between the two sides. However, fighting has intensified in recent weeks. The president of the EU‚Äôs council of ministers, Donald Tusk, signalled a toughening of sanctions in a statement at the G7. ‚ÄúIf anyone wants to start a debate about changing the sanctions regime, the discussion could only be about strengthening it,‚Äù he said. Antagonism towards Russia, until last year a member of the club of leading industrialised nations, is probably strongest among the G7 in Canada. Stephen Harper, the Canadian prime minister, said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think Russia under Vladimir Putin belongs in the G7. Period. Canada would very, very strongly oppose Putin ever sitting around that table again. It would require consensus to bring Russia back and that consensus will just not happen. ‚ÄúRussia is more often than not trying deliberately to be a strategic rival, to deliberately counter the good things we‚Äôre trying to achieve in the world for no other reason than to just counter them.‚Äù He said the ‚Äúmindset of the guy we are dealing with is that the cold war has never ended and ‚ÄòI‚Äôve got to fight to change the ending somehow‚Äô‚Äù. Beyond Greece and Ukraine, Merkel wants to see progress on a free trade agreement and climate change, two of the staples of these summits. On Monday the G7 nations are expected to endorse the goal of November‚Äôs UN climate conference of limiting warming to 2C above pre-industrial levels. Obama has pledged to reduce US emissions by 26-28% from the 2005 baseline within the next 10 years and last year announced an unexpected agreement with China on capping carbon emission. More difficult than setting the 2C goal is turning promised donations to the Green Climate Fund, a United Nations initiative designed to help poorer countries limit their carbon emissions, into a reality. A 30 April deadline to convert $4.7bn in pledged assistance into specific payment timetables has been missed. In May Merkel and Hollande committed to a goal to cut global emissions by 60% from 2010 levels within the next 35 years. In both 2008 and 2009 the G7 agreed to a goal of 50%. An endorsement of the more aggressive target this time would be a win for the German chancellor. In Athens Mega TV reported that relations between Berlin and Washington over Greece had become increasingly frosty ‚Äì despite the exhortation from Barack Obama at the G7 for a quick solution to the European debt crisis. The Greek television channel, citing a senior German official, described the US treasury secretary, Jack Lew, imploring his German counterpart Wolfgang Sch√§uble to ‚Äúsupport Greece‚Äù only to be told: ‚ÄúGive ‚Ç¨50bn euro yourself to save Greece.‚Äù Mega‚Äôs Berlin-based correspondent told the stationthat the US official then said nothing ‚Äúbecause, as is always the case according to German officials when it comes to the issue of money, the Americans never say anything‚Äù. Meanwhile, negotiations between Greece and Berlin are expected to intensify Monday when the Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis meets Sch√§uble in the German capital. The Greek politician, who will be in Berlin to give a speech, requested the meeting late Friday and is expected to try and smooth over some of the fallout from what Athens‚Äô leftist-led government regards as ‚Äúincendiary‚Äù remarks by Juncker. ‚ÄúThe lenders are trying to rip Greece apart,‚Äù said the energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis adding that while it was not the choice of the governing far left Syriza party to take the country out of the eurozone, neither could it allow ‚Äúthe extinction of Greece‚Äù within the eurozone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-07T18:24:59Z,world,World news,Turkish election outcome is blow to Erdoƒüan and breakthrough for Kurds,"The mould-breaking outcome of Turkey‚Äôs general election on Sunday will be viewed as a personal rebuff for the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, and as a historic political breakthrough for the country‚Äôs 18 million-strong Kurdish minority, which will be represented by a political party in parliament for the first time. With 88% of votes counted, the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP), which Erdoƒüan helped to found, appeared to have lost its overall majority, falling just short of the 276 seats required for control of the 550-seat national assembly. Its share of the vote, at around 43%, was well down on the 49% it obtained in 2011. The AKP had aimed for a total of at least 330 seats, which would have enabled the government to hold a referendum on the constitutional changes that Erdoƒüan needs in order to create an executive presidency. Erdoƒüan personally travelled the country trying to boost the AKP vote. But concerns about a slowing economy, jobs, civil rights and a lack of progress in the Kurdish peace process appear to have combined with worries that Erdoƒüan could assume quasi-dictatorial powers to thwart the president‚Äôs ambitions. Erdoƒüan, a three-time prime minister who has wielded power since 2002, now faces the prospect of continuing in the largely ceremonial post of president, to which he was elected last year, while real executive power is in the hands of his protege Ahmet Davutoƒülu, the current prime minister. Parliamentary democracy in Turkey was also a big winner as the pro-Kurdish, secular centre-left grouping, the People‚Äôs Democratic party (HDP), appeared to slip past the mandatory 10% threshold for representation with about 11% of the vote. Projections suggested that total would translate into about 74 seats.
This result gives Turkey‚Äôs Kurds and the other voters who deserted the AKP and flocked to the HDP banner an unprecedented national platform from which to counter the neo-Islamist AKP‚Äôs assault on Turkey‚Äôs secular tradition, which has gathered pace in recent years. The peace process that followed the 2013 ceasefire with the Kurdistan Workers‚Äô party (PKK) may now also receive a much-needed shot in the arm, after a recent period of stalemate and sporadic violence. But much depends on how Erdoƒüan, still the most formidable figure in Turkish politics, reacts to this reverse. The president is not known as a good loser, and he is certainly unaccustomed to defeat. Rumours abounded before the polls that he was planning a new crackdown on journalists and other opponents who criticised him during the campaign. AKP officials spoke of holding another election if they were forced to form a minority government. Even by his shaky standards, Erdoƒüan‚Äôs behaviour during the campaign was exceptionally boorish. As president, he is expected to adopt a neutral stance. Instead, he barnstormed across the country holding rallies in support of the AKP. The results thus look like a very personal rejection. Erdoƒüan directed insults, accusations and threats at his political opponents, female activists, the media, non-Muslims, and ethnic and cultural minorities of all descriptions. Last week Erdoƒüan dismissed the HDP as a party of gay people and atheists, a description apparently designed to pander to the prejudices of the AKP‚Äôs largely poor, devoutly Muslim working class base. He suggested the HDP supported terrorism and was in league with the PKK. Erdoƒüan notably failed to condemn more than 70 reported violent attacks on the HDP‚Äôs candidates, rallies and offices. After bombs killed two people and wounded more than 200 at an HDP rally in Diyarbakir, in the mainly Kurdish south-east, on Friday, Selahattin Demirtas, the HDP leader, condemned Erdoƒüan‚Äôs silence. ‚ÄúHe should go to Diyarbakir. Is he not the president of 77 million people? He ought to leave flowers where people were killed,‚Äù Demirtas said in Istanbul. Erdoƒüan later offered condolences but said it was Demirtas who should apologise over Syria-related violence last October. Erdoƒüan has also been engaged in a vicious slanging match with opposition media, accusing reporters and commentators who criticise him of being part of a conspiracy to undermine Turkey. This is a familiar Erdoƒüan tactic. He often blames developments he dislikes on the so-called ‚Äúparallel state‚Äù supposedly made up of traitors, misfits and miscreants, more often than not in league with Fethullah G√ºlen, an exiled former ally and fellow Islamist with whom he is now involved in a long-running feud. But this time it seems the ruse didn‚Äôt work. Even allowing for the heightened emotions of a general election campaign, Erdoƒüan‚Äôs extreme behaviour has served to intensify doubts about his reliability and dependability both within Turkey and beyond. Turkey under Erdoƒüan has proved a most reluctant ally in the US-Nato fight against Islamic State. It has played a double game over Syria. Its EU accession talks are at a standstill after Erdoƒüan repeatedly insisted Turkey does not need Europe. Erdoƒüan has fallen out with regional leaders from Baghdad to Jerusalem to Cairo. Meanwhile, he has pursued closer ties with Vladimir Putin ‚Äì a man who, like him, has dictatorial tendencies. As Sunday‚Äôs results confirmed, Erdoƒüan had a bad campaign and was punished for it. His divisive behaviour was rejected by voters and rebounded on him. He emerges a weakened and diminished figure, with his reputation and influence much reduced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-07T17:55:11Z,world,World news,Nepal earthquake survivors get self-defence classes after sexual assaults,"Police in Nepal have started self-defence lessons for women and girls in camps for people displaced by massive earthquakes earlier this year after concerns about a number of sexual assaults and an increase in reports of sexual harassment. More than 8,700 people died in the two major quakes that hit Nepal on April 25 and May 12, destroying nearly half a million houses and leaving thousands camping out in the open. ‚ÄúWhile visiting different camps in Kathmandu, we realised the need for such training so that women can protect themselves,‚Äù said Tara Thapa, deputy superintendent of police in Nepal. ‚ÄúWomen and children are more vulnerable to sexual violence in this situation. The culprits are looking to take benefits of the situation.‚Äù The courses started last week. ‚ÄúWe are teaching them several techniques, including how to kick and punch, as well as various locks. There are some lessons of judo and karate, too,‚Äù Thapa said. ‚ÄúEven a weak woman can fight against a strong man. This will help them to save themselves.‚Äù Bipana Tamang, 24, was one of dozens of women who had gathered at the Boudhanath monastery in Kathmandu for training. From Nuwakot district near Kathmandu, she has been living outside since the earthquake and runs a small restaurant. ‚ÄúI have faced many cases of harassment while dealing with the customers. These techniques will help me to tackle such problems,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis is the third day and I have learnt how to punch and to kick. Now, I am confident I can fight to save myself.‚Äù Narayan Singh Khadka, a Kathmandu metropolitan police spokesman, said the initiative had been launched after several cases of harassment and ‚Äúdrunk people entering camps‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe are receiving overwhelming response from the people‚Äù he said. The police in Nepal are planning to expand the sessions to several other camps in Kathmandu. Widespread unemployment, poverty and the impact of a 10-year Maoist insurgency have made Nepali women and children vulnerable to trafficking networks, and campaigners say that the recent disaster has increased the threat. Police and security agencies have increased vigilance against trafficking in quake-hit areas and along the Nepal-India border. In an effort to prevent the trafficking of children, the government recently imposed a three-month ban on adoption and made it mandatory for travelling youngsters to carry permission letters if they are not accompanied by parents. Authorities in India last month rescued more than 20 children from a human trafficking network targeting families who lost their livelihoods in the earthquakes. The children‚Äôs parents, from poor villages in northern India, had been working as migrant labourers in Nepal and were laid off after the earthquake. As they crossed into India at the Raxaul border post, they were convinced to allow their children, between the ages of eight and 14, to travel with the traffickers, who promised to give them well-paid jobs in comfortable conditions. The children were in fact being taken to a bag-manufacturing factory in Mumbai. Four traffickers were detained by the police. The government of the poor south Asian state has struggled to cope with the magnitude of the disaster. Some analysts estimate rebuilding could cost the country between $10bn to $15bn (¬£6.5bn-¬£9.8bn), almost half its annual GDP, with further costs coming from an economic slowdown as a result of the tragedy. There are already fears that the tourist industry, a major employer, will be hit hard. Trekking and mountaineering is a huge revenue earner for the impoverished country, home to eight of the world‚Äôs 14 peaks over 8,000 metres, with Everest alone attracting hundreds of climbers during the April-May spring season, when weather conditions are ideal for ascents. Hundreds of climbers had to abandon their attempts when an avalanche triggered by the earthquake struck Everest base camp, killing 18 people and marking a second year with virtually no summits after the deaths of 16 Nepalese guides in 2014 led to a shutdown of the world‚Äôs highest peak. The climbers may be allowed to use their climbing permits, which could cost up to ¬£16,000, next year, an official said last week. Many aid agencies remain frustrated by bureaucratic and logistic bottlenecks which have slowed delivery of assistance to the most needy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-07T16:22:54Z,world,World news,G7 protesters unite in opposition to TTIP under the alpine sun,"‚ÄúThe Japanese have a saying‚Äù, said Willi Hartenstein, pausing for a reflective puff on a cheroot. ‚ÄúA snail may climb Kilimanjaro, but slowly. Very slowly.‚Äù We were taking a shady break, halfway up a sunbaked alp, on a protest hike to the gates of Hotel Schloss Elmau. When it comes to climbing mountains, snails have one distinct advantage over Hartenstein. They don‚Äôt tend to set off wearing thick black leather motorcycle trousers. I don‚Äôt know what the temperature was inside Willi‚Äôs trousers, but a helicopter came and hovered directly over us for about five minutes, presumably because they thought someone on the march had brought along a thermonuclear device.
It was too loud to speak, so Willi reached down, plucked a yellow alpine flower, and chewed it up, stalk and all. ‚ÄúArnica,‚Äù he shouted, over the roar. There are so many helicopters hovering over Garmisch right now, I keep expecting to hear the Ride of the Valkyries. I don‚Äôt exactly know what they‚Äôre all doing up there. Trying to avoid each other, I hope. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the largest police operation in the history of Bavaria,‚Äù said Martin J√§schke, a journalist from Der Spiegel. ‚ÄúSuch a huge display of power like this, I‚Äôm afraid people feel it‚Äôs a provocation.‚Äù At the very least, it feels a bit weird. There could not actually be any more police in Garmisch than there are right now. There wouldn‚Äôt be room. There are traffic jams of police vehicles. Every spare inch of tarmac has been commandeered for police coaches, riot vans and operations trucks. The only cars on the road that aren‚Äôt police cars are being driven by plainclothes policemen.
This is the kind of response you might expect. ‚ÄúThe massive police presence is extremely intimidating,‚Äù said Lukas M√ºller, a 16-year-old student from Innsbruck. ‚ÄúIt is a show of political power, but also a suppression of political protest. People have been stopped at checkpoints for so long, for hours at a time, that it‚Äôs really difficult simply to show up here. But that‚Äôs all we can do in this situation. Show up.‚Äù What had made Lukas show up today? ‚ÄúFor me, at this instant, there is one issue. It is TTIP.‚Äù This was the word on everyone‚Äôs lips and placards, young and old. The hikers were from across the political spectrum, from anarcho-syndicalists and libertarians, through greens to communists, but the TTIP trade deal seemed to be the one issue that gave focus to their ideological sprawl. Matthias Kolb, a journalist from Munich, agreed. ‚ÄúThe march is super diverse, super colourful, but it seems everybody agrees that TTIP is bad.‚Äù
Hartenstein is 61, a veteran of the anti-globalisation marches of the 1990s. He talked at length about the power Monsanto and Bayer had over the development of environmental regulation. ‚ÄúThey are global companies, with global power. But today we are told, over and over, that globalism is good. Good for a few, yes, very good.‚Äù He chuckled. ‚ÄúTo call yourself a globalist? You would have to be very stupid. Or very, very rich.‚Äù
I walked for a time alongside Hannes Halles, a mathematician from Munich. For Halles, ‚Äúit is all a question of legitimacy. If laws and regulations are made in private, it limits the possibility of overseeing what the politicians do. It seems the only people overseeing are those who stand to gain by the process: big business. ‚ÄúThe process is not legitimate. That is why I am here, because the job of politicians is to represent the people who elected them.‚Äù He gestured up the mountain. ‚ÄúAnd those politicians are not doing their job.‚Äù The Bavarian sun beat down as we puffed our way up the blisteringly beautiful alp. Halles said nothing for a time. ‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù he asked, as we approached a trestle table of water bottles, laid on by mountain rescue. ‚ÄúDo you think they will listen to us?‚Äù We‚Äôd gone too far up the alp for me to tell the truth, so I swallowed a litre of water in eight seconds, lied and said yes, they might. ‚Ä¢ Charlie Skelton is tweeting from the G7 at @deyook",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-07T16:21:03Z,world,World news,Unsure as eggs: Texas supermarket introduces rationing due to bird flu,"A large Texas supermarket chain has begun rationing eggs, in the face of a growing national shortage brought about by an outbreak of avian flu. Customers shopping at many outlets of the H-E-B chain of supermarkets have been confronted by notices telling them they are restricted to buying three cartons of a dozen eggs per shopper. The move follows an announcement by another Texas-based firm, Whataburger, that it is shrinking the hours during which it will serve egg dishes as part of its breakfast menu. Notices have been going up across H-E-B‚Äôs 350 supermarkets, aimed at stopping commercial businesses, such as restaurants, clearing the shelves of eggs. ‚ÄúThe purchase of eggs is limited to three cartons per customer,‚Äù the notices read, according to a local news report in Texas on Thursday. The company issued a statement that called the situation temporary, but was not able to tell customers when ordinary shopping would resume. The outbreak of bird flu began in the midwest. Across much of the nation, egg prices have been rising, along with prices for chicken and turkey meat. ‚ÄúThe United States is facing a temporary disruption in the supply of eggs due to the avian flu,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúH-E-B is committed to ensuring Texas families and households have access to eggs. The signs placed on our shelves last week are to deter commercial users from buying eggs in bulk.‚Äù Whataburger, a family-owned fast-food chain based in San Antonio and controlling more than 700 outlets. It is now serving a breakfast menu from 11pm to 11am, but items with eggs are only available 5am to 11am. The company originally announced that from 1 June it would cut back breakfast hours to 5am to 9am Monday to Friday. ‚ÄúWe know this is no fun for anyone and hope this doesn‚Äôt last long, and we apologise [that] the supply of eggs currently cannot meet demand,‚Äù a statement said. It continued by saying that if customers found the kitchen was out of eggs ‚Äúwe sure don‚Äôt want you leaving hungry‚Äù.

2015-06-07T16:11:58Z,world,World news,Barcelona mayor-elect Ada Colau calls for more 'feminised' democracy,"Ada Colau, who will be sworn is as Barcelona‚Äôs first female mayor next Saturday, has spoken in her most far-ranging interview yet about the need for a more ‚Äúfeminised‚Äù democracy.
‚ÄúWe can feminise politics,‚Äù she told Amy Goodman, host of the progressive US news programme Democracy Now!, ‚Äúnot just by putting more women in positions of power but also through values and by demonstrating that cooperation is more effective and enjoyable than competitiveness.‚Äù Colau, an anti-eviction activist turned elected politician, said she had a list of 30 tasks to achieve during her first few months in office. These centre on job creation, guaranteeing basic rights and fighting corruption. In her first week she will invite representatives of the city‚Äôs banks to a meeting to discuss how to halt evictions. She said banks that do not allow their empty property to be used as social housing would be sanctioned.
‚ÄúWe have formal democracy but sense that the real decisions aren‚Äôt made in parliament. This awareness of a kidnapped democracy has given rise to grassroots mobilisations, not just here but across southern Europe. ‚ÄúThe main players are not me or Podemos but the people, who have decided to take back their institutions and democratise them. The people are the real players, we are their instruments.‚Äù One of her first tasks will be to slash elected officials‚Äô salaries ‚Äì from ‚Ç¨140,000 to ‚Ç¨28,600 in the case of the mayor ‚Äì and get rid of privileges such as official cars. ‚ÄúThis ending of privileges sends a message that this is the end of a political class removed from the people,‚Äù she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-07T15:51:10Z,world,World news,"Mediterranean migrant crisis: number of arrivals in Italy in 2015 passes 50,000","The number of migrants to have arrived in Italy by boat this year passed 50,000 at the weekend as over 5,800 people were rescued in the Mediterranean. A total of 3,480 people were rescued on Saturday from 15 separate boats that set off from Libya, and more rescues were ongoing on Sunday. The international effort involved the Italian authorities and naval ships from the UK, Ireland and Germany. It has been one of the busiest weekends so far this year for rescues in the Mediterranean, the start of an uptick over the summer months as people-smugglers take advantage of calm seas. As of Thursday the Italian interior ministry had registered 48,905 arrivals, meaning the total for 2015 is now above 50,000. The Royal Navy‚Äôs HMS Bulwark was brought in on Sunday to save more than 1,000 migrants in seven separate operations, including at least 10 pregnant women. Nick Cooke-Priest, the ship‚Äôs captain, said it had been an ‚Äúintense, complex day‚Äù and praised the work of helicopter crews sent out to locate migrant boats. The series of rescues was the HMS Bulwark‚Äôs largest to date since being sent to the Mediterranean by the UK government on 4 May. A second British warship, HMS Protector, was also involved in rescue operations on Sunday as part of the EU‚Äôs Triton sea rescue operation. The Maltese, Spanish and Swedish navies also took part in rescues on Sunday alongside the Italian coastguard and private vessels. Around 2,200 of the migrants were first picked up by rescuers from the Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS), an independent Maltese operation supported by the medical charity M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF). Ian Ruggier, who recently retired after 26 years in the Maltese army, said being part of MOAS rescues went beyond his expectations. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never come across anything of this sort, for a moment it looked like a military exercise. We were expecting contact but not of that magnitude,‚Äù he said from the MOAS ship MY Phoenix. Those saved began to disembark in Sicilian ports on Sunday evening, with further landings expected in the toe of Italy‚Äôs boot on Monday. Despite the high volume of barely seaworthy boats leaving Libya, there were no reported shipwrecks over the weekend. Federico Fossi, a spokesman for the UNHCR, put migrants‚Äô safe passage down to increased EU rescue efforts. ‚ÄúTriton is working well, it‚Äôs a big effort and we have to recognised that,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe most important thing is that they now go into Libya waters, where the majority of accidents happened in the past.‚Äù Fossi said the current situation marked a big improvement since April, when 800 people drowned in a single shipwreck. The tragedy prompted EU countries to commit greater support for Triton, tripling its monthly funding to ‚Ç¨9m (¬£6.5m) and agreeing to expand the operation‚Äôs patrol area. The deaths of around 1,800 people in the Mediterranean so far this year has also led to increasing discussion of how best to stem the flow of migrants from North Africa. The UK prime minister, David Cameron, has asked his officials to see if more of the country‚Äôs aid budget can be urgently redirected to countries bordering Libya. Cameron has asked Justine Greening, the international development secretary, to see if aid to these governments could help stem the flow could stop the cycle of drawings and rescues. The effective collapse of the Libyan government and consequent power vacuum has led to a flow of economic migrants from other countries into Libya and then onto boats bound for Europe. The vast majority of migrants arriving in Italy are not originally from Libya itself but come from countries further afield, including Mali and Nigeria, while significant numbers have also travelled from Eritrea and Syria. Cameron‚Äôs proposal is modelled on the Spanish response to the flow of refugees to the Canary Islands from west Africa. The Spanish government acted as a partner with West African countries to help stop criminal gangs, easing the migratory flows. European governments have additionally sought UN approval to take military action against people-smugglers operating out of Libya, while also outlining plans to relocate 40,000 refugees from Italy and Greece to elsewhere in Europe over the next two years.
Although welcomed by the Italian government, the proposals have done little to deter the anti-immigrant rhetoric of the country‚Äôs rising far right. Northern League made gains in local elections after campaigning against the migrant ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù. The case for helping new arrivals received a further blow this month after a junior minister was put under investigation over alleged contract-rigging at the Mineo migrant centre in Sicily. Giuseppe Castiglione, undersecretary for agriculture, has denied being involved in the ‚ÄúMafia Capitale‚Äù scandal, after investigations revealed that criminal organisations had infiltrated the state-run immigration system. Italy‚Äôs prime minister, Matteo Renzi, is under growing pressure after refusing to call for Castiglione‚Äôs resignation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-07T15:41:16Z,world,World news,Homily to Catalonia: the nun entering Spain's regional politics,"Whether she‚Äôs advocating an audit of the national debt, lamenting the deterioration of Spain‚Äôs public health services or urging the creation of a public bank, the Benedictine nun Teresa Forcades rarely minces her words. Now the Catalan sister, buoyed by recent municipal elections that saw the housing activist Ada Colau voted in as Barcelona‚Äôs first female mayor, wants to hang up her habit in hopes of leading a leftist coalition that could bring the same sort of change to the region. ‚ÄúI think we are in a very particular moment,‚Äù said Forcades, pointing to the Catalan regional elections, slated for 27 September. ‚ÄúAnd in this particular moment, I think we can all agree we need a people‚Äôs constituent process from below. And if we do that, that‚Äôs the real revolution in Catalonia.‚Äù
In 2013, she and the economist Arcadi Oliveres launched Proc√©s Constituent, a social movement guided by a manifesto calling for an independent Catalonia, where banks and energy companies would be nationalised and all citizens would have the right to a home and a dignified wage. ‚ÄúFrom the beginning it was a project to politicise what had become something real in the streets; a social majority that wanted to stop the neoliberal politics that were happening in Spain,‚Äù she said. Proc√©s Constituent was among the backers of Barcelona en Com√∫, helping turn it into the most voted political force in last month‚Äôs Barcelona municipal elections. As Forcades started musing about an even wider coalition of leftist groups to face off against centre-right Catalan leader Artur Mas in the upcoming regional vote, the one thing missing from the picture was a leader. It was exactly the kind of position that Harvard-educated Forcades ‚Äì one of Catalonia‚Äôs most prominent anti-establishment voices ‚Äì had always been attracted to. But she was loath to trade in the solitude of the monastery for a demanding career in politics.
It was her religious community that ultimately proposed a solution, offering her the chance to take a sabbatical of up to three years, the kind given to nuns to allow them to look after a sick parent. ‚ÄúI said, yes, but my mother is not sick,‚Äù said Forcades. ‚ÄúThey said but society is sick so you can go and take care of it.‚Äù Forcades envisions herself leading a leftist movement that could bring together parties as diverse as Podemos and the Catalan republican left. Last week Podemos‚Äôs Catalan branch said it would be open to the idea of a coalition of leftist parties backing one candidate in the regional elections. ‚ÄúIf we could do that, then this would be the most voted options,‚Äù said Forcades. Her candidacy is set to be debated at an upcoming meeting of Proc√©s Constituent in mid-June. Forcades knows the foray into politics won‚Äôt be easy; while campaigning for Barcelona en Com√∫ during the recent elections, she was rivalled by the Dominican nun Sister Luc√≠a Caram, who was campaigning for Mas‚Äôs Converg√®ncia i Uni√≥.
Spain‚Äôs interior minister took aim at the idea of nuns in politics, insisting it was a relic of times past. ‚ÄúUsing nuns to do politics is odd, it‚Äôs not normal in the 21st century,‚Äù Jorge Fern√°ndez D√≠az told reporters. As Forcades readied herself to step out of the monastery and into the political ring, she‚Äôs steeling herself for more of the same. ‚ÄúCriticisms are to be expected. I follow somebody called Jesus and he had a lot of that.‚Äù It‚Äôs a price she‚Äôs willing to pay in order to try and synchronise politics with the demands of the ‚Äúindignados‚Äù, who occupied squares across Spain in 2011. ‚ÄúThe best political system I can imagine is the one that we call democracy ‚Äì but the real one, not the one we have now, where the people really have the say.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-07T15:36:24Z,world,World news,Church of England decline heralds calls for innovative use of church buildings,"Occasionally, someone will stick their head around the huge wooden door of the church of St Peter and St Paul in Great Casterton and, on spotting the vicar, express surprise. ‚ÄúThey say: ‚ÄòOh, does something happen here?‚Äô‚Äù says the Rev Jo Saunders. ‚ÄúWell, yes: services, every week.‚Äù She notices something similar at weddings, where guests hover outside before the service, a little intimidated about entering. Occasionally, after the service, they will ask if the church is very old and be astonished to learn that parts date from the 12th century. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs lovely,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúbecause, who knows, maybe they will come back some day?‚Äù Saunders has been vicar at this ancient Rutland parish for six years ‚Äì and also in the neighbouring villages of Little Casterton, Pickworth, Tinwell and Tickencote. Each has a beautiful ancient church building (though Pickworth is merely Georgian), and each hosts regular services, though not all every week. But while Great Casterton (population 365) can attract up to 50 for a Sunday morning service, its little sibling generally hosts around a dozen. Pickwell boasts the same. Average attendance at Tickencote, once a month, is six. Church of England attendance has been slowly declining for decades, with the proportion of Britons attending their local morning service having fallen by half in 40 years, by some measures, to just 1.5% of the population.
New figures, however, have indicated a much steeper fall in the numbers considering their views to be broadly in line with the church. According to the annual British Social Attitudes survey, in just two years between 2012 and 2014, the number of people describing their beliefs as being Church of England or Anglican fell from 21% to 17%, a loss of 1.7 million people ‚Äì leading the former archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Carey, to repeat warnings that the church is ‚Äúa generation away from extinction‚Äù. Britain is not necessarily becoming more godless ‚Äì in the same period, the number of Muslims grew by a million, amounting to 2.4% of the population ‚Äì just less the proportion of Anglicans. That has implications enough for the church in the inner city, but what are the ramifications in the countryside where, for a thousand years, the Church of England has often been the institution that holds rural communities together? Saunders became a full-time priest after retiring as a teacher at the local girls‚Äô high school, and now works six or seven days a week, which inevitably includes, she says, quite a lot of driving. She insists she feels broadly hopeful about the role of her five parishes, but optimism in this context calls for a determination to look on the bright side. She was hugely encouraged, for instance, when one of her congregations gained four new members, taking its total weekly membership to 12. And then there is the ‚Äúconstant worry‚Äù of maintaining her ancient buildings, one of which, Tickencote, contains a spectacular Norman chancel arch of national importance, but which she admits is only kept financially viable by curious tourists ‚Äúwho put their pound in the collection box‚Äù. While we speak, a security firm is surveying the roof at Great Casterton to fit an alarm against lead theft ‚Äì ‚Äúwe‚Äôre insured but it doesn‚Äôt cover the cost‚Äù. ‚ÄúIf you were running the church nakedly as a business, it would be quite simple ‚Äì you‚Äôd close down the uneconomic branches,‚Äù says Nick Spencer, research director of Theos, a thinktank focusing on religion and society, and the author of a book on the future of the English parish church.
‚ÄúBut the Church of England takes considerable, and I think rightful, pride in being a presence in every community in the country. That is the big challenge it faces ‚Äì maintaining that universal service provision, to use public sector language.‚Äù Nearly two-thirds of Anglican churches, 10,199, are in rural areas, but the population of rural England is just 9.3 million, or just over a sixth of the population. The challenge to those who would like to see them all remain open is obvious. One potential solution is to make the buildings themselves work harder, says Canon Dr Jill Hopkinson, the Church of England‚Äôs national rural officer. ‚ÄúWe need to understand how our buildings can be a positive tool for mission, and how we can make them useful for our rural communities,‚Äù she says. At the very least that might involve adding toilets and kitchen facilities; in some places, the church could be used as a post office or community shop, she says. ‚ÄúSo we do need to think creatively about this. But shutting the doors should always be the last option, not the first.‚Äù Hopkinson, who wrote a report on rural churches earlier this year that called for urgent reforms in some aspects of their administration, says a tiny congregation is not necessarily a cause for gloom: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very important to honour the small. Jesus said: ‚ÄòWhere two or three are gathered, there am I also.‚Äô It‚Äôs not about saying that a small church is not a viable church.‚Äù Rev Canon Jim Mynors, vicar of six rural parishes (two of them Grade I-listed) in Northamptonshire, similarly says it is a mixed picture. At his lowest, he says, just one person will turn up for a service, but a quarter of the village is not untypical for harvest, and at Christmas virtually everybody comes. However, few of those are teenagers, he says, and if that is echoed in urban congregations, that may be a problem in future, ‚Äúbecause they will be the incomers to here 10 years from now‚Äù. But although rural priests may be concerned, there are some, even inside the church, who wonder if it really matters if Britain doesn‚Äôt, any longer, consider itself to be vaguely Anglican. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard it described as ‚Äòpruning‚Äô,‚Äù says Spencer. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a slightly brutal metaphor, but there‚Äôs a certain logic to it. If these people don‚Äôt think like a Christian or attend church like a Christian, in what sense are they Christian?‚Äù While church attendance is in decline overall, recent research found 18% of churches are actually growing and where this is the case, the loss of a few tiny churches in sparsely populated villages may take on another character.
Paul Harcourt, for instance, the vicar of All Saints Woodford Wells in Woodford Green, Essex, which attracts 700 worshippers on Sunday mornings, says he is not particularly concerned if Britain‚Äôs Anglican identity is in rapid retreat. ‚ÄúThe collapse of other things doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean the collapse of the church,‚Äù he says. However, he would regret it if the church lost its ‚Äúcredibility‚Äù among non-attenders who, he says, frequently feel warmly disposed to it ‚Äúthanks to generations of love and service‚Äù. For all the optimism, church insiders privately acknowledge the decline of what are often already tiny rural churches means something will have to change. One suggestion is that struggling parishes are turned into ‚Äúfestival churches‚Äù ‚Äì meaning, the parish ceases to have a regular vicar and the church building is effectively closed, to be opened for services at the major church festivals during the year. The suggestion is viewed as a positive and pragmatic step by many, but there is no question it represents a significant retreat for the Church of England. But in some rural communities, says Saunders, villagers recognise the importance of their local church in giving a heart to their community ‚Äì perhaps, as their only remaining shared facility. ‚ÄúI think, in another generation the church will be different and it may well be smaller, but I don‚Äôt think it will be extinct,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI think the spark is there, and I just feel it will always be there in rural churches.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-07T15:11:23Z,world,World news,Jean-Claude Juncker accuses Alexis Tsipras of lying over bailout talks,"European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has made a blistering attack on Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, accusing him of undermining negotiations over new terms for a bailout and of effectively lying to the Greek parliament. A visibly angry Juncker, speaking on the fringes of the G7 summit in Bavaria, said he had told Tsipras during a meeting on Wednesday evening that there was ‚Äúroom to negotiate‚Äù but insisted the Greeks had been unwilling to take part in in-depth discussions. Instead, Tsipras had promised to send him his proposals the following day, but Juncker was still waiting for them on Sunday.
‚ÄúAlexis Tsipras promised that by Thursday evening he would present a second proposal. Then he said he would present it on Friday. And then he said he would call on Saturday. But I have never received that proposal, so I hope I will receive it soon. I would like to have that Greek proposal,‚Äù he said. He told reporters he had said to Tsipras that he continued to exclude the idea of a Grexit ‚Äì ‚Äúbecause I don‚Äôt want to see it‚Äù ‚Äì but he had told the Greek prime minister he could not ‚Äúpull a rabbit out of a hat‚Äù. Athens has been trying to secure an agreement from Europe and the International Monetary Fund for months over access to more than ‚Ç¨7bn (¬£5m) in bailout funds. Greece‚Äôs creditors have put strict conditions on any deal, that the Greek government has so far refused to accept. But with Greece running out of money, and needing to secure funds by the end of June if it is to avoid defaulting on its debts, tensions are high.
Juncker, perceived until now as the ‚Äúhonest broker‚Äù in the crisis ‚Äì taking a softer approach than the Germans, who are viewed in Greece as the architects of austerity ‚Äì has rarely been seen so irate, sources close to the EU in Garmisch-Partenkirchen said. They said Greece may have lost its closest ally in its long fight to secure a better deal. Juncker said he had been disappointed by the speech Tsipras had subsequently given to the Athens parliament on Friday. ‚ÄúHe was presenting the offer of the three institutions as a leave-or-take offer. That was not the case ‚Ä¶ He knows perfectly well that is not the case‚Äù. Juncker said Tsipras had also failed to mention to parliament Juncker‚Äôs willingness to negotiate over Greek pensions. He added: ‚ÄúI do not have a personal problem with Alexis Tsipras. He was my friend. He is my friend ‚Ä¶ But frankly, in order to maintain [the friendship], he has to observe some minimum rules.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-07T13:44:51Z,world,World news,"Latest anthrax scare points to dangerous lack of accountability, experts warn","One week after the terrorist attack in New York on 9/11, another attack on the US began. Letters containing spores of anthrax, a weaponised bacterial agent, were posted to the offices of several newspapers and two Democratic senators. Twenty-two people were infected. Five died. Anthrax is a bacterium often found in soil, according to Jerrold Leikin, a doctor who co-edited a book on ‚Äútoxico-terrorism‚Äù. Its spores are one to five microns across ‚Äì small enough to get into human lungs. The initial symptoms of infection look like flu, but quickly progress to sepsis, hemorrhagic meningitis and death. Once it progresses to those last stages, the fatality rate is around 95%. Over the last few weeks, it was revealed, anthrax was sent to 52 laboratories in 18 states plus South Korea, Canada and Australia. Thirty-one people received treatment for possible exposure. In 2014, a similar incident saw 75 people possibly exposed to the pathogen. The difference is this: the first incident was a terrorist attack. The second and third were accidents. Samples of the pathogen that were supposed to be inactivated were sent to laboratories by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2014 and the Department of Defense most recently. The origin point of this year‚Äôs accident was Dugway proving ground in Utah, a military facility which produces anthrax in industrial quantities for the purpose of military research ‚Äì detection, mainly, and as a countermeasure. The post-9/11 era saw a huge expansion in the security state. The bioweapon industry was no different. After the 2001 anthrax attacks ‚Äì known to some as ‚ÄúAmerithrax‚Äù ‚Äì there was a 20- to 40-fold increase in the number of institutions and individuals working with biological weapon agents like anthrax, according to Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist and biosecurity expert at Rutgers university. In response to questions from the Guardian, a spokesperson for the CDC said there were 181 ‚Äúorganizations or entities‚Äù such as Dugway registered as working with live anthrax, and 321 in total working with live pathogens. Within those 321 entities, according to the Government Accountability Office, there are some 1,495 laboratories accredited under the Federal Select Agent Program to work with live pathogens such as anthrax, and a much larger number working with inert versions of the same pathogens. There is no official government body to oversee production and research of bioweapons that does not ‚Äì as the CDC does ‚Äì engage in its own active pathogen research, and no apparent fixed official guidelines regarding their handling.
After the CDC‚Äôs own accident with anthrax in 2014, it said it would hold an official investigation and issue a set of binding guidelines. No such comprehensive set of guidelines appears to have been issued and it is unclear exactly under what authority the CDC could bind, for example, the Department of Defense. A spokesperson for the CDC told the Guardian that it ‚Äúand [the US Department of Agriculture] work jointly on regulating and overseeing the work done on select agents‚Äù. However, a 2013 Government Accountability Office report found ‚Äúa continued lack of national standards for the design, construction, commissioning, and operation of high-containment laboratories‚Äù and said ‚Äúno single federal agency was responsible for assessing overall laboratory needs‚Äù. According to Ebright, basic rules, such as having at least two people in a lab at any one time, or even that accredited laboratories should have CCTV cameras, do not exist in many such facilities. Information regarding the latest breach is relatively scarce. Army chief of staff Raymond Odierno told reporters ‚Äúthe best I can tell there was not human error‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe fact that this has been obviously happening for some time and perhaps at several different places hints at a systemic issue,‚Äù said Stephen Morse, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University‚Äôs Mailman School of Public Health. Morse, who also worked at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) between 1995 and 2000 on biodefence, speculated that the process by which machines irradiate the live pathogens, inactivating them, might be ‚Äúpoorly calibrated‚Äù. ‚ÄúLuckily for us, human beings are relatively resistant to anthrax compared to smallpox,‚Äù said Morse. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs not something we should rely on.‚Äù Indeed, according to Ebright, military contracted laboratories across the US routinely work with other, more dangerous pathogens than anthrax ‚Äì including several virulent strains of avian flu. A mistake with one of those, instead of anthrax, could have devastating results, including ‚Äúa global pandemic‚Äù. Nominally all such labs are working on defences against these pathogens. But it has become, Ebright said, ‚Äúall pork-barrel‚Äù, with at least one lab in every single state. ‚Äú[It‚Äôs] spending that can‚Äôt possibly be defended on any rational basis,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWith each of the incidents in the past there has been a notable absence of responsibility. They know if you mess up, nothing happens; the programmes aren‚Äôt reduced, the personnel suffer no consequences. So it‚Äôs all about the worst you could possibly have: no one watching, no rules, and no accountability.‚Äù But according to Ebright, the real issue isn‚Äôt a question of danger to the public from the accidental sending itself. It‚Äôs the chance that the pathogen ‚Äì which was the same strain used in the 2001 attack ‚Äì could fall into the wrong hands.
‚ÄúEven one spore is a sufficient seed stock from which an amount could grow to mount a biological weapons attack,‚Äù Ebright said. ‚ÄúThe sad circumstance is that this massive effort since 2001 has dramatically increased the chances of a biological weapon attack on the US, precisely by distributing a highly lethal strain of the agent with no structure and no ability to record where they have gone.‚Äù Nor is this the only slip-up that has been made at Dugway. In 2011 the base was placed on lockdown for several hours after a vial containing a deadly ‚Äúnerve agent‚Äù went missing, the BBC reported at the time. ‚ÄúThe major concern is the security breach, that the material will be transferred to domestic terror and international terror and be used as the seed source for a bomb or weapon,‚Äù said Ebright. ‚ÄúIt would be disappointing if the Department of Defense becomes the supplier for al-Qaida that enables a bioweapon attack.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-07T13:15:47Z,world,World news,Mandarin menus and no rooms with a 4: Spain's hotels adapt for Chinese tourists,"With 300,000 Chinese tourists expected to visit Spain this year and a million by the end of the decade, hotels are rushing to adapt in order to receive a ‚ÄúChinese-friendly‚Äù stamp of approval. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs paradoxical that Spain, the biggest tourist destination after France and the United States, is practically unknown in China,‚Äù said Kurt Gr√∂tsch, chief executive of Chinese Friendly International, whose endorsement is recognised in all 28 EU member states. The World Tourism Organisation estimates that 100 million Chinese will leave their country on holiday this year. Among the adjustments hoteliers need to make is to never give a Chinese visitor a room with the number four in it, nor one on the fourth floor. In Mandarin the number four sounds so similar to the word for death that Chinese go to great lengths to avoid saying it. There should be no physical contact when greeting guests, and the hotel‚Äôs visiting card should be presented with both hands. The restaurant menu and other hotel information should be offered in Mandarin, fruit should always be served in portions, never whole. Hot water should be served with meals, especially if the guests have ordered meat, and all rooms should have a kettle, even though guests often use them to cook noodles. Furthermore, waiters should remember to serve the eldest or the most highly educated person first. They should never point with the finger, only with the hand. ‚ÄúWord of mouth counts for a lot in China,‚Äù said Gr√∂tsch. ‚ÄúIf a Chinese enjoys themselves somewhere, more will come. Often you can become Chinese-friendly without any great investment.‚Äù He recommends that waiters learn a few basic phrases in Mandarin, such as asking diners whether they‚Äôve enjoyed their meal. Currently, 14 hotels in Spain have been rated Chinese-friendly. ‚ÄúBeing rated Chinese-friendly by a recognised association is a big help in dealing with Chinese companies and positioning ourselves in an emerging market,‚Äù said Alex Rodr√≠guez, marketing director of the Vincci hotel chain. The company‚Äôs five-star hotel in M√°laga has acquired the rating and the chain may soon seek approval for its three Barcelona hotels.
Gr√∂tsch admitted that the Chinese were not always the most popular guests, especially those travelling abroad for the first time. ‚ÄúThey can be rude, people see them as arrogant, they talk loud and smoke like chimneys in non-smoking areas.‚Äù One Barcelona hotel that has been approved as Chinese-friendly since 2013 no longer wants to be associated with this type of tourism as it drives away other visitors. Germans, in particular, are inclined to cancel their reservation if they know there will be Chinese in the hotel, a hotel spokesman claimed. However, the Chinese government is anxious to create a good impression and has drawn up a blacklist of citizens who behave badly abroad. People found guilty of antisocial behaviour, vandalism, gambling or going to strip clubs will be placed on the list for two years and will face additional, unspecified punishments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-07T11:52:09Z,world,World news,Merkel welcomes Obama with beer and sausage breakfast before G7 summit,"Accompanied by beer, sausages and men in lederhosen, Barack Obama received a warm welcome to the Bavarian Alps from Angela Merkel on Sunday, before two days of intensive G7 summit talks.
Alpine horns and locals in traditional dress greeted the US president as he arrived in Kr√ºn, a village close to the G7 venue of Schloss Elmau, before the two leaders sat down to a breakfast of the local sausage, weisswurst, a glass of weissbier and pretzels. Locals cheered as Obama saluted them with a ‚ÄúGr√ºss Gott‚Äù ‚Äì a traditional greeting ‚Äì against a stunning backdrop of pine forests and snowcapped mountains, telling them: ‚ÄúThat was without question, the best Alpine horn performance I‚Äôve ever heard.‚Äù In what will no doubt be seen as an open invitation to a local lederhosen tailor looking for some publicity, the president said he had forgotten ‚Äúto bring my lederhosen, but I hope to find some while I‚Äôm here‚Äù.
He later walked through the crowds, talking to locals dressed in traditional Dirndls and lederhosen and accepting an invitation to touch a hunter‚Äôs gamsbart ‚Äì the brush-like tuft of chamois hair adorning his felt hat. But the German chancellor was decidedly cooler than usual during her welcome speech. Despite using his first name, and addressing him in the informal du form, she immediately made a veiled reference to the tensions between the US and Germany over the scandal surrounding Germany‚Äôs intelligence agents allegedly helping the US‚Äôs National Security Agency to spy on officials and companies in Europe. ‚ÄúAlthough it‚Äôs true we have differences of opinion from time to time, the United States of America is our friend and essential partner with whom we cooperate closely because it‚Äôs in our mutual interest,‚Äù she said. Welcoming the two days of talks, during which, Obama said, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to discuss our joint future,‚Äù he referred apologetically to the massive security operation involved in staging the G7, which has upset many locals. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs a lot of hard work when I come to town,‚Äù he said. He then asked Merkel if the talks could be held outside ‚Äúover a glass of beer‚Äù rather than up at Schloss Elmau, the luxury hotel where the seven world leaders will be meeting, ‚Äúbut I think we‚Äôll have to negotiate with the security people,‚Äù he said. The two leaders, along with Merkel‚Äôs chemistry professor husband, Joachim Sauer, then sat down with locals for a specially brewed G7 summit banana and clove-flavour weissbier, weisswurst and pretzels, all of them appearing to swig back the beer, despite the early hour. Obama sat between a local dairy farmer and Krun‚Äôs mayor, while Merkel was next to the village bank manager and his wife.
The brewer, butcher and baker responsible for the breakfast told the local paper that secret service agents had carried out several tastings to check the safety of the products. The butcher, Zeno Berg, said that agents had also X-rayed the sausages and meatloaf. Victoria Schubert, the local brewer responsible for crafting the beer, who learned her trade at a London brewery, confirmed the leaders had been drinking the real thing. ‚ÄúThey were certainly not drinking alcohol-free beer,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt was 5% proof, with an original gravity of 11%, and like all German beer it was brewed according to the 500-year-old purity laws.‚Äù She said it came from a family recipe that was more than 100 years old and which ‚Äúhas only been tweaked a bit here and there over the years‚Äù. It has been temporarily renamed Summit Weissbier for the occasion and six 180-litre barrels have been delivered to Schloss Elmau. After breakfast the two leaders held bilateral talks in which both agreed to continue to take a hard stance against Russia, a sentiment that was later reflected by other delegates. Leaders arrived late morning in helicopters, with golf carts bringing them to the red carpet of the castle entrance. An official ‚Äúfamily photo‚Äù took place against the imposing backdrop of snow-covered mountains, several hours ahead of schedule because of a thunder storm forecast for later in the day. As dark clouds indeed began to gather over the castle ‚Äì a former recuperation centre for Wehrmacht soldiers ‚Äì they then gathered for talks in the castle‚Äôs grand hall, a space normally used for yoga conventions. Police arrested about 25 demonstrators earlier in the morning who blocked the road leading to Schloss Elmau with a sit-down protest, forcing the leaders to continue the final part of their journey by helicopter. One demonstrator and a police officer were injured in the scuffles in which protesters set off fog rockets to which the police responded with pepper spray. But police said the demonstrations had been milder than expected. Tweeting in multiple languages, an official Twitter account wrote: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre slightly missing the music and samba mood of yesterday. Where are the drums?‚Äù In the forests surrounding the venue, some of the 17,000 police on duty spent the day playing a game of cat and mouse with protesters, some of whom attempted to penetrate with bolt cutters a 10-mile (16 km) wire fence that had been erected around the venue. Merkel is hosting the leaders of Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the US and the UK for two days of talks, which are expected to focus on issues including climate change, global health and terrorism The talks began discussing the state of the global economy, including the European debt crisis. A second meeting was expected to deal with international trade and standards, including the controversial TTIP deal between the EU and the US. Over a working supper, cooked by a Michelin-starred chef, they were due to discuss pressing foreign policy issues, including what Obama referred to earlier in the day as ‚ÄúRussian aggression in Ukraine‚Äù. On Monday the leaders are expected to discuss the climate, global health, terrorism, the empowerment of women and development. NGOs were trying to put last-minute pressure on the Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, as it emerged that he is allegedly blocking agreements on development goals. Merkel‚Äôs husband, Joachim Sauer, a quantum chemistry professor, led the spouses present ‚Äì Akie Abe, wife of the Japanese premier, Laureen Harper, wife of the Canadian PM, and Malgorzata Tusk, wife of European council president Donald ‚Äì on a tour of the area in a horse-drawn carriage. Ahead of supper they were to be entertained in the castle‚Äôs grand hall by star sopranist Waltraud Meier performing Richard Strauss lieder. Strauss had a house in Garmisch, the town closest to the summit venue, and died there in 1949.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-07T10:21:51Z,world,World news,"G7 summit: Ukraine, Greek bailout and climate top agenda for Bavaria meeting","David Cameron joins the G7 summit of leading industrialised nations in Bavaria expecting to face a crowded agenda dominated by Ukraine, the Greek bailout and climate change. The summit host, Angela Merkel, fought hard to try to seal a deal with the Greek government before the summit, but failed, ensuring Barack Obama will want an update on how close Europe is to ending an impasse that still hangs over the world economy.
The summit is being held in the remote Schloss Elmau in Bavaria, and as many as 20,000 police are on patrol in nearby towns to minimise disruption by G7 protesters. The European Council president, Donald Tusk, and the EU commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, as well as the director of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, will be present to update Obama on the state of the bailout talks now not due to reach a climax until the end of the month.
Merkel and the French president, Fran√ßois Hollande, phoned the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, at the weekend, and it was agreed the three politicians were likely to meet in Brussels on Wednesday evening on the edge of an EU summit with Latin America and the Caribbean. Obama will be pressing the Europeans to show more resolve to maintain sanctions against Russia.
Russia remains excluded from the G7 as punishment for its encouragement last year of the rebellion in eastern Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has said the conflict in Ukraine was the result of ‚Äúunprofessional actions‚Äù of the US, and opinion remains divided on the extent to which sanctions, as opposed to a lower oil price, is hurting the Russian economy. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, recently travelled to Sochi for direct talks with Putin in what was seen as a sign of potential softening, but nothing tangible occurred, and if anything the fragile ceasefire in Ukraine is under greater pressure than ever. Obama rang the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, before the summit and the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, visited Ukraine on the way to the summit in a sign of solidarity. Benjamin Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser to Obama, said: ‚ÄúMost urgently, the focus is on maintaining the unity around the sanctions effort that has had very significant consequences on the Russian economy. ‚ÄúWe need to maintain the pressure, show that there cannot be cracks in the transatlantic unity, and show that the costs are just going to continue to grow for Russia.‚Äù Merkel has ensured that the communique at this summit will include a long-term aim to limit global warming to below two degrees. Merkel wants countries to commit to the Green Climate Fund, which is aiming for $100bn by 2020. Germany recently doubled its contribution to $8bn and Merkel has personally called on all industrial countries to contribute.
The G7 statement is an important staging post before the UN climate change conference in Paris in December. It is a a sign of how far world opinion ‚Äì or at least American opinion ‚Äì has moved: the last time Merkel was G7 host, in 2007, she was battling to persuade George Bush that climate change existed and was clearly a manmade phenomenon. Doubts remain, however, about Obama‚Äôs ability to get any tough climate change agreement through Congress, as he has been examining ways to circumvent the legislature. The summit is also due to discuss the fight against Islamic State, including a meeting on Monday between Obama and the prime minister of Iraq, Haider al-Abadi. On the economy, Obama is expected to reassure allies that Congress will back the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive deal spanning the Pacific Rim. Obama began his visit on Sunday morning with a visit to the picturesque town of Kr√ºn with Merkel, tasting local food, meeting locals and drinking a very early morning beer. Other topics Merkel has tabled for the summit under the motto ‚ÄúThink ahead, act together‚Äù range from improving labour rights for textile workers to fighting antibiotics resistance and cleaning up oceanic pollution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-07T09:30:06Z,world,World news,A grandmother's 36-year hunt for the child stolen by the Argentinian junta,"Practically all of Argentina has cried on this one,‚Äù says Ignacio Montoya Carlotto, patting his right shoulder. We are crisscrossing the old cobblestone streets of San Telmo, the colonial district of the capital, Buenos Aires. The 36-year-old musician, his crinkly curls prematurely greying, his mouth fast to resolve into a smile, is not bragging. It‚Äôs impossible to walk even one city block without someone rushing to hug him and then burst into tears, as he predicted, on his rumpled T-shirt. Maybe it‚Äôs because, thanks to his grandmother, the whole of Argentina had been waiting ‚Äì praying ‚Äì for more than 30 years for the day when he would be ‚Äúfound‚Äù. Most Argentinians can remember exactly what they were doing when that moment finally came in August last year. ‚ÄúWhen I turned 80, I begged God not to let me die before I found my grandson,‚Äù says Estela Carlotto. Estela has led an extraordinary life, rising from tragedy into one of the most loved and respected public figures in Argentina. It took four more years. ‚ÄúWe all cried; everyone has something to say about how they felt to have found this grandson we were all searching for.‚Äù Estela was a 47-year-old schoolteacher, housewife and mother of three in November 1977 when a death squad from Argentina‚Äôs 1976-83 dictatorship picked her daughter Laura off a street in the city of La Plata where she lived, about 32 miles south of Buenos Aires. Laura, a 22-year-old political activist, became one of the thousands of young dissidents who were made to ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù by a bloody, fascist regime. Unknown to Estela, her long-haired, strikingly beautiful daughter was three months pregnant at the time of her abduction. She was taken to a secret ‚Äúdetention centre‚Äù called La Cacha. There, in her presence, they killed her companion and the father of the child she was carrying, 26-year-old Walmir Montoya. Ignacio was born in June 1978 while his mother Laura was still in captivity. One report states she gave birth handcuffed and was allowed only five hours with her baby. Two months later, she was dragged out of the camp and a mock armed confrontation was staged by the military. When her body was turned over to Estela, she had been shot through the stomach and her face was smashed, apparently by a rifle butt. Survivors of the camp told Estela about the birth, and that she had named the newborn Guido, after her father. For 36 years afterwards, Estela devoted herself to finding her grandson. All she had was a name, Guido, and an approximate birth date. An excruciatingly difficult search led her through three decades of legal action against police officers, military officers and doctors involved in the ‚Äúmissing grandchildren‚Äù cases. Leads were hard to come by. Her grandson had been swallowed by the complicity and silence that surrounded so many of the regime‚Äôs horrendous crimes. Estela realised there were many others like herself looking for the babies of their ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù daughters. They formed a group called the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo, named after the city square facing the presidential palace in downtown Buenos Aires where they marched, drawing attention to their plight. By 1989 Estela had become president of the association. The group believes there are some 500 cases of grandchildren born in captivity. In most cases, the babies were turned over to military families to raise as their own. In the warped thinking of the profoundly Catholic yet murderous generals who ruled Argentina then, it would have been unchristian to kill an innocent, unborn child by executing the expectant mother. By the same token, in their macabre minds turning the babies over to ‚Äúgood‚Äù military families to raise as their own represented the ultimate victory over the ‚Äúgodless‚Äù left-wing enemy they wished to crush into nonexistence.
Even now, three decades after the collapse of the dictatorship, some Argentinians defend the military‚Äôs campaign against Cuban-inspired guerrillas in the 1970s, but even the most die-hard reactionaries draw the line at the baby-snatching cases. Each DNA confirmation that a missing grandchild had been found and reunited with their biological family, usually accompanied by legal action against the ‚Äúmother and father‚Äù who had appropriated them, has been greeted with joy across the political spectrum. Over three decades of work, 113 cases had been resolved by the slowly ageing grandmothers, but despite this, Estela Carlotto‚Äôs missing grandson remained unaccounted for, which left a deep, unhealed wound in the nation‚Äôs psyche. Despite being behind the restitution of the grandchildren of so many of her fellow grandmothers, the white-haired, softly spoken woman who had endeared herself as a perennial hopeful for a Nobel Peace Prize for Argentina, and a worldwide symbol of peaceful women‚Äôs activism, had not yet been able to find her own slain daughter‚Äôs son. ‚ÄúI am such a well-known public figure,‚Äù says Carlotto. ‚ÄúEverybody kept asking me: ‚ÄòWhen is it going to be your turn?‚Äô‚Äù At the time Ignacio Montoya Carlotto still believed he was Ignacio Hurban, the only son of Juana and Clemente Hurban, a couple of humble rural workers who lived near the city of Olavarr√≠a on a farm belonging to Francisco Aguilar, a well-to-do, conservative landowner who died last year.
‚ÄúA few years ago I was watching television with my wife and Estela comes on talking about the search for her grandson,‚Äù Ignacio tells me. ‚ÄúAnd I said: ‚ÄòLook at this poor woman. It‚Äôs heart-breaking ‚Äì she‚Äôs spent her whole life searching, and she may never find him.‚Äô‚Äù Ignacio had, he says, a golden childhood. ‚ÄúI had a great life, but there was always this background noise. I didn‚Äôt look like my parents.‚Äù Growing up on the farm, surrounded by animals and cared for by those he still refers to lovingly as ‚ÄúMother and Father‚Äù, he became a voracious reader, excelled in school, travelled to Buenos Aires to study music and finally returned to Olavarr√≠a to become a successful music teacher and professional musician with his own band, the Ignacio Hurban Grupo. ‚ÄúWhen this all started,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI was scared of it devouring my whole life. Things were really great for me, damn it. I was recording records with musicians I respected, I was able to buy myself a brand-new car working as a musician, teaching and playing the piano. I had my wife and we were thinking of starting a family. And before that I had a healthy childhood on the farm, with lots of love.‚Äù It was precisely that bucolic, protective environment in the deep countryside that made it almost impossible for his despairing grandmother to find him. ‚ÄúWhere he was, 200 miles away in the middle of farm country,‚Äù says Estela, ‚ÄúI was never going to find him.‚Äù A year ago, on 2 June 2014, fate intervened. It‚Äôs the date the then Ignacio Hurban has always celebrated his birthday. Olavarr√≠a is a small city of only 111,000. Among them was Celia Lizaso, a woman who knew the true story of his birth. ‚ÄúCelia Lizaso was the daughter of a farmer who was very good friends with Aguilar,‚Äù says Ignacio today. ‚ÄúShe told my wife that I was adopted.‚Äù After a tearful birthday dinner during which his wife revealed to him the secret of his ‚Äúadoption‚Äù, Ignacio went to see Lizaso, who had only told his wife half the story. ‚ÄúShe left out the part that I was the child of a couple killed by the dictatorship.‚Äù
Both Ignacio‚Äôs adoptive parents are still alive and are certain to face a judicial inquiry due to the fact that he was falsely registered as their biological son. ‚ÄúWhen I went to them about it,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúthey explained their reasons for not telling me. They are humble farm people. They barely finished primary school.‚Äù The circumstances of their employment with Aguilar weighed heavily in the equation, believes Ignacio. ‚ÄúThey couldn‚Äôt have children, and Aguilar gave them the opportunity of bringing them a child born from a woman who didn‚Äôt want to have it, which was common in those days. They never suspected anything. They believed their boss ‚Äì he was like God to them: they lived on his land and he was their only source of income.‚Äù Ignacio is convinced of their innocence and good intentions. ‚ÄúI realise the sacrifices they made to raise me ‚Äì I have nothing but gratitude for that. I also understand that they were tricked, they were made to sign things. They were made to believe things that weren‚Äôt true.‚Äù Although the details remain unclear, and there is a court investigation pending, Ignacio has been able to piece together the essentials. Aguilar received him from the military when he was probably only a few days old and handed him over to the Hurbans, to raise as their own, with a solemn warning never to tell anyone the truth. ‚ÄúAguilar probably did it to collaborate with the military,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúGuys from his social background, sucking up to power ‚Äì he‚Äôd do anything to ingratiate himself with some military officer. It‚Äôs kind of sad, actually.‚Äù Ignacio grew up knowing Aguilar and his children well. ‚ÄúThe kids used to come visit the farm. They live across from the music school where I teach.‚Äù But he has never thought of crossing the street to pound their door in anger. ‚ÄúAguilar is dead and I‚Äôm told his widow has Alzheimer‚Äôs. That‚Äôs for the courts to deal with, I trust justice. There‚Äôs only two things that can affect families like that. Economic consequences, which is losing what they have, because those families often are what they own, or losing their prestige, and that they have definitely lost: their last name is now associated with the worst crime in our history.‚Äù
He is nonetheless adamant that Aguilar‚Äôs sons are innocent in the case. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve met them and talked with them about it. The father was responsible, but the sons weren‚Äôt. They are victims of the shit their father did.‚Äù Over the decades of their search, it was inevitable that some of the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo died. The years are ticking by ever faster for those still in the fight ‚Äì Estela is 84. With hundreds of grandchildren still unfound, they have set up a DNA bank with samples from their own DNA to ensure that anyone who suspects they are a ‚Äúmissing grandchild‚Äù can step forward after they are gone. In what was probably one of the last acts of his life as Ignacio Hurban, Estela‚Äôs missing grandson went to the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo, took a DNA test and then went back to his daily life. Estela says: ‚ÄúSomebody told me ‚Äì and he hasn‚Äôt denied it ‚Äì that he said: ‚ÄòWell, if I turn out to be the son of a ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù couple, I want to be the grandson of the top grandmother, Estela.‚Äô‚Äù But when the phone call came, it not only showed that he was Estela‚Äôs grandson, it also revealed he was the son of Walmir Montoya, Laura Carlotto‚Äôs slain secret boyfriend. Suddenly the pieces fell into place. Montoya had been a drummer in a rock band. Nicknamed Pu√±o (Fist) as a baby by his mother, Montoya, as a young man in the 1970s, soon gravitated to the Montoneros guerrilla organisation. He moved to La Plata, where he met Laura. They fell in love and lived in hiding, in an unsuccessful bid to outrun the secret police. In 2006 forensic anthropologists unearthed his bones in a common grave. They found 16 bullet wounds, showing he was probably executed by machine gun fire. In Caleta Olivia, the coastal town in Patagonia where he grew up, a statue of Pu√±o Montoya had been erected in his memory. Although there‚Äôd been rumours, no one knew for certain that he had a child, least of all his surviving 91-year-old mother, Hortensia Montoya, who also received a phone call with the surprise DNA results. ‚ÄúGod has given me a long life so that I could live to meet my grandson,‚Äù Hortensia said to the press. Like Estela, Hortensia is an exceptional woman, considered a pioneering teacher in Caleta Olivia. The two grandmothers talked to each other in a joint radio interview after the DNA results were announced, as a wave of joy swept across the nation. ‚ÄúWe still haven‚Äôt met, but I love you so much for sharing this wonderful grandson with me,‚Äù Estela told Hortensia. Referring to the photos in the press of her son Pu√±o, Estela added: ‚ÄúNow I understand why my daughter fell in love with your son.‚Äù
The phone call to Ignacio Hurban had been made by Estela‚Äôs younger daughter, who heads the DNA bank which holds the samples. ‚ÄúI asked for time,‚Äù Ignacio says now. ‚ÄúBut then I thought: ‚ÄòThey‚Äôve been waiting for this for over 30 years. One more day for them must feel fatal.‚Äô‚Äù What followed was a hurried 400km journey with his wife and a group of their friends to meet the Carlottos in La Plata. ‚ÄúWe left early, avoiding the press. We got lost, we went round in circles, it was a total scream.‚Äù By then Argentina‚Äôs media were staked out en masse in front of Carlotto‚Äôs La Plata home, so they had to rendezvous at the home of one of her daughters. What the then Ignacio Hurban encountered at the Carlotto home provoked something akin to culture shock. An only son, raised among animals in a faraway farm, walked into a home where Estela‚Äôs 13 other grandchildren, his cousins, aunts and uncles were eagerly awaiting him. ‚ÄúIt was meeting a whole family who are looking at you and can‚Äôt believe it: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs impossible ‚Äì he‚Äôs there!‚Äô Seeing the joy in their eyes simply because I was there ‚Äì everybody crying, the hugs, the emotion.‚Äù His grandmother Estela understands: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a noisy bunch. He‚Äôs very quiet ‚Äì I think he had more contact with animals than with children of his own age growing up.‚Äù ‚ÄúI was a mess when I arrived after this long trip,‚Äù says Ignacio. As he got out of the car, he was told his grandmother was inside. Estela recalls: ‚Äú‚ÄòThat‚Äôs my grandson,‚Äô I thought. All the love I‚Äôd kept for him came over me, to tell him how much I loved him, how much I‚Äôd looked for him. He stood his ground, holding back. I, of course, had been travelling around the world looking for a baby, looking for a child, looking for a young man, and I‚Äôd always thought: ‚ÄòWhen I find him, you can all meet him because you‚Äôve all helped me look for him.‚Äô‚Äù She soon saw she had to be more careful. ‚ÄúA grandmother‚Äôs anxiety wants everything to be fast, but there‚Äôs been cases where it‚Äôs taken years for a grandchild to accept their grandmother. So my advice to the grandmothers always is: give them time ‚Äì that‚Äôs how you show your love. You must not get angry, you must not hurry them, you must demand nothing.‚Äù For Ignacio, the sweetest moment came a few days later, when Hortensia Montoya arrived and the two grandmothers embraced.
‚ÄúMeeting my two grandmothers was the most moving thing,‚Äù he says, speaking with passionate anger against the military who murdered his parents, ‚Äúbecause it was like: ‚ÄòBam, there it is, this is it ‚Äì we won, we did it, we‚Äôre here, seeing each other, talking.‚Äô Do you know what it was like hearing those two women talking to each other? The ground shakes when they meet. Two such powerful persons talking about their children, getting to know each other through the love their children had, crying for joy in the midst of this terrible tragedy.‚Äù Ignacio has stood his ground by refusing to give in to one of his grandmother‚Äôs most cherished wishes: to rename himself Guido. ‚ÄúIt hurt me when he said he didn‚Äôt want to change his name,‚Äù says Estela, sadness clouding her voice. ‚Äú‚ÄòIf it‚Äôs a boy, I want him to be called Guido,‚Äô my daughter told one of her fellow prisoners who survived. She must have called him Guido when he was in her tummy; that has to resonate. But he told me he is Ignacio. It‚Äôs to reaffirm himself after that explosion. I understood completely. So I told him: ‚ÄòLook, I am going to call you Guido. I‚Äôve been looking for you for 36 years as Guido.‚Äô And he accepted that. But now, I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì sometimes I avoid calling him Guido if he doesn‚Äôt want it.‚Äù As the night descends over Buenos Aires at the end of my time with him, Ignacio Hurban is now fully transformed into Ignacio Montoya Carlotto the rising musician, talking about his new project, the Ignacio Montoya Carlotto Septeto. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre songs with folkloric roots, closer to folk music than to tango.‚Äù Driving his car through the busy streets of Argentina‚Äôs capital, he seems slightly lost, far away from the quiet night skies and open horizons of his home, asking for directions, on his way to a rehearsal for a television show he will be performing on. He insists that he will not give in to resentment nor will he feign a suffering for what happened to his biological parents that he has not felt himself. ‚ÄúIt was horrible, to be ripped from your mother, but I have no recollection of that. Plus, what good would it do me to cry for what could have been? Or to start living a life of suffering that I have not lived? My parents suffered. When I think about what they went through, it‚Äôs so sad, and that willingness to give up their lives for their beliefs, such a strong will to go through with the pregnancy. It‚Äôs incredible. But I didn‚Äôt live through any of that. My memories are of growing up on the farm with a mother and a father. And they did everything any other parents would have done.‚Äù
It is difficult to say whether denial is at play in Ignacio‚Äôs reasoning, although he himself admits to none. Perhaps he is that rare thing, a person determined to make the best of the world he has been born into, even if he discovers at the age of 36 that he had been ‚Äúborn‚Äù into a false world, the victim of a heinous crime. Meanwhile Estela continues her work. She still travels to the offices of the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires every day. That‚Äôs about a three-hour round trip. She travels continuously, carrying her message around the world. Her grandson was the 114th missing grandchild to be identified. Two more have been identified since then. Hundreds of others remain unfound. She has no intention of stopping: ‚ÄúThe only thought I had was: Laura can rest in peace now. I felt Laura said to me: ‚ÄòMother, mission accomplished.‚Äô But there‚Äôs so much still to do. I‚Äôm going to keep looking for the other missing ones.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-07T06:36:57Z,world,World news,Hillsong church drops controversial US preacher Mark Driscoll from conferences,"The head of Pentecostal mega-church Hillsong has dropped US preacher Mark Driscoll from the lineup of the church‚Äôs 2015 Australian and UK conferences, saying furore around his controversial sermons ‚Äì including some describing women as ‚Äúpenis houses‚Äù ‚Äì would be an ‚Äúunnecessary distraction‚Äù. Brian Houston said on Sunday after ‚Äúpersonal interaction‚Äù with Driscoll he had decided to rescind his invitation to the events, the Australian version of which is expected to draw 30,000 this month. Driscoll resigned from Seattle‚Äôs Mars Hill church in October after its board found him ‚Äúguilty of arrogance, responding to conflict with a quick temper and harsh speech, and leading the staff and elders in a domineering manner‚Äù.
But uproar in recent days has focused on the content of his so-called ‚Äútestosterone gospel‚Äù, including one sermon in which he told churchgoers: ‚ÄúUltimately, God created you and it is His penis. You are simply borrowing it for a while. ‚ÄúKnowing that His penis would need a home, God created a woman to be your wife. And when you marry her and look down you will notice that your wife is shaped differently than you and makes a very nice home,‚Äù he said. In pseudonymous posts on an online forum in 2000 Driscoll also wrote the US had become a ‚Äúpussified nation‚Äù where boys were being raised by ‚Äúbitter penis-envying burned feministed single mothers‚Äù. A petition against his appearance at the church‚Äôs conferences in Australia and the UK had drawn nearly 3,000 signatures, and an online activist group in Australia had suggested Driscoll be barred entry into the country, as was serial domestic abuser and boxer Floyd Mayweather. Houston said Driscoll ‚Äúheld some views and made some statements that cannot be defended‚Äù and that his 30-minute scheduled appearance ‚Äúhad the potential to divert attention from the real purpose‚Äù of the five-day event. ‚ÄúIt is my hope that Mark and I will be able to speak in person in the coming weeks to discuss some of the issues that have been raised, what ‚Äì if anything ‚Äì he has learned, and for me to understand better how he is progressing in both his personal and professional life,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe teachings of Christ are based on love and forgiveness, and I will not write off Mark as a person simply because of the things that people have said about him, a small minority of people signing a petition or statements he has made many years ago for which he has since repeatedly apologised. ‚ÄúHowever, I do not want unnecessary distractions during our conference,‚Äù he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-07T03:20:50Z,world,World news,Hillsong to review decision to invite controversial US pastor as speaker,"The head of Pentecostal mega-church Hillsong will review a decision to invite to the church‚Äôs Australian conference a controversial US preacher who once compared women to ‚Äúpenis-houses‚Äù. Brian Houston told Channel Seven he would be speaking with the former head of Seattle‚Äôs Mars Hill church, Mark Driscoll, later on Sunday to ‚Äúwork out where to go from here‚Äù. ‚ÄúI am going to be talking to him later on today and we‚Äôll talk about the different possibilities,‚Äù Houston said. Nearly 3,000 people have signed an online petition against Hillsong‚Äôs plans to host Driscoll at its Australian conference in Sydney this month, which is expected to attract around 30,000 people.
Driscoll resigned from the Mars Hill church in October after its board found him ‚Äúguilty of arrogance, responding to conflict with a quick temper and harsh speech, and leading the staff and elders in a domineering manner‚Äù. There were also allegations that donations allocated for outreach to India and Ethiopia were spent instead on growing the church‚Äôs online presence. ‚ÄúUltimately, God created you and it is His penis. You are simply borrowing it for a while,‚Äù Driscoll said in one sermon, part of what he called a ‚Äútestosterone gospel‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhile His penis is on loan you must admit that it is sort of just hanging out there very lonely as if it needed a home, sort of like a man wandering the streets looking for a house to live in,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúKnowing that His penis would need a home, God created a woman to be your wife. And when you marry her and look down you will notice that your wife is shaped differently than you and makes a very nice home.‚Äù Activist groups online have suggested Driscoll should be denied entry into the country over his attitudes to women, as in the case of serial domestic abuser and athlete Floyd Mayweather and so-called ‚Äúpick-up artist‚Äù Julien Blanc. Driscoll has apologised for the way he treated members of the church but not repudiated his views on the roles of men and women. In a statement on the Hillsong website on Friday, Houston said he and Driscoll ‚Äústand poles apart on women, their place in society, and their role in the church‚Äù. He said he wanted to hold an ‚Äúopen interview‚Äù with Driscoll and his wife, Grace, because there were ‚Äúlessons to be learned‚Äù from his story. ‚ÄúWe come from different backgrounds, theological positions, and church expressions. I genuinely want to know,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDid he really say those things? Does he believe those things? Does he have any regrets? Has he been misrepresented? What has he learned and what can we all learn? And where to from here? ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking forward to asking the questions and hearing from Mark directly. Will we agree afterwards or agree to disagree? Time will tell. I doubt we will agree on everything, but everyone deserves an opportunity to be heard.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-07T01:47:51Z,world,World news,"China ferry disaster search area is extended 1,000km down Yangtze river","Hundreds of bodies retrieved from the Eastern Star pushed the death toll above 400, China‚Äôs state broadcaster reported on Sunday, as the search for dozens more bodies was expanded to more than 1,000km down the Yangtze river following the country‚Äôs deadliest maritime disaster in nearly seven decades. Authorities have requested that river traffic and others along the river to alert them if they noticed any floating bodies, Hu Kaihong, the vice director-general of the press bureau of the State Council Information Office, told a news conference. Authorities have attributed the overturning of the cruise ship late on Monday to sudden, severe winds, but also have placed the captain and his first engineer in police custody. Passengers‚Äô relatives have raised questions about whether the ship should have continued its voyage after the storm started in a section of Hubei province and despite a weather warning earlier in the evening. The death toll rose to 406 after hundreds of bodies were found on Friday and Saturday, including that of a three-year-old girl in the top deck, officials said. Another 36 people were listed as missing, CCTV reported, citing rescue authorities. Hu said authorities were increasing their efforts to search for the missing and had expanded the target area from the middle reaches of the Yangtze more than 1,000 kilometres (600 miles) downstream to Shanghai. The boat had more than 450 people aboard, many of them elderly tourists, for a cruise from Nanjing to the southwestern city of Chongqing. Fourteen people survived, including three pulled out by divers from air pockets in the overturned hull on Tuesday. Disaster teams put chains around the hull and used cranes to roll the banged-up, white and blue boat upright and then gradually lift it out of the grey currents of the Yangtze on Friday. Forensic teams are using DNA matching to identify the remains, but haven‚Äôt said how long the process would take. On Saturday night, relatives were taken by bus to an area just upriver of the now-righted ship, where they burned incense and tossed flowers into the Yangtze in memory of the dead. The Eastern Star disaster became the country‚Äôs worst since the sinking of the SS Kiangya off Shanghai in 1948, which is believed to have killed anywhere from 2,750 to nearly 4,000 people. China‚Äôs deadliest maritime disaster in recent decades was the Dashun ferry, which caught fire and capsized off Shandong province in November 1999, killing about 280 people. Meanwhile, a TV station, Jiangsu Satellite, canceled the popular dating show If You Are the One and the rest of its entertainment shows on Saturday for three days because it was ‚Äúin deep mourning‚Äù, it said.

2015-06-06T23:04:09Z,world,World news,"Dazzling jewels from an Ethiopian grave reveal 2,000-year-old link to Rome","Spectacular 2,000-year-old treasures from the Roman empire and the Aksumite kingdom, which ruled parts of north-east Africa for several centuries before 940AD, have been discovered by British archaeologists in northern Ethiopia. Louise Schofield, a former British Museum curator, headed a major six-week excavation of the ancient city of Aksum where her team of 11 uncovered graves with ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù artefacts dating from the first and second centuries. They offer evidence that the Romans were trading there hundreds of years earlier than previously thought. Schofield told the Observer: ‚ÄúEvery day we had shed-loads of treasure coming out of all the graves. I was blown away: I‚Äôd been confident we‚Äôd find something, but not on this scale.‚Äù She was particularly excited about the grave of a woman she has named ‚ÄúSleeping Beauty‚Äù. The way the body and its grave goods had been positioned suggest that she had been beautiful and much-loved.
Schofield said: ‚ÄúShe was curled up on her side, with her chin resting on her hand, wearing a beautiful bronze ring. She was buried gazing into an extraordinary Roman bronze mirror. She had next to her a beautiful and incredibly ornate bronze cosmetics spoon with a lump of kohl eyeliner.‚Äù The woman was also wearing a necklace of thousands of tiny beads, and a beaded belt. The quality of the jewellery suggests that she was a person of very high status, able to command the very best luxurious goods. Other artefacts with her include Roman glass vessels ‚Äì two perfectly preserved drinking beakers and a flask to catch the tears of the dead. There was also a clay jug. Schofield hopes that its contents can be analysed. She believes it would have contained food and drink for the afterlife. Although ‚ÄúSleeping Beauty‚Äù was covered only with soil, her grave was cut into a rock overhang, which is why the finds survived intact. The team also found buried warriors, with each skeleton wearing large iron bangles. They may have been killed in nearby battlefields. Other finds include another female skeleton with a valuable necklace of 1,065 coloured glass beads, and, elsewhere, a striking glass perfume flask. In 2012, the Observer reported that Schofield‚Äôs earlier excavations in the region had discovered an ancient goldmine that may solve the mystery of from where the Queen of Sheba of biblical legend derived her fabled treasures. Aksum, the capital of the Aksumite kingdom, was a major trading power from the first to the seventh centuries, linking the Roman Empire and India. Aksumites were a literate people. Yet little is known about this so-called ‚Äúlost‚Äù‚Äô civilisation. ‚ÄúEthiopia is a mysterious place steeped in legend, but nobody knows very much about it,‚Äù said Schofield. ‚ÄúWe know from the later Aksumite period ‚Äì the fourth and fifth centuries, when they adopted Christianity ‚Äì that they were trading very intensely with Rome. But our finds are from much earlier. So it shows that extraordinarily precious things were travelling from the Roman Empire through this region centuries before.‚Äù In return, the Romans sought ivory tusks, frankincense and metals. Schofield‚Äôs excavations also found evidence of iron working. The finds will go to a new German-funded museum, opening in October. Schofield hopes to organise a loan to the British Museum, but first the finds must be conserved: the mirror, for example, is corroded and slightly buckled. Germany is sending nine conservators. Excavations were paid for by the Sainsbury family‚Äôs Headley Trust and the Tigray Trust, a charity that promotes sustainability in the region; and by individual donations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-06T22:19:39Z,world,World news,Half a million refugees gather in Libya to attempt perilous crossing to Europe,"Up to half a million refugees are gathering in Libya to attempt the crossing to Europe on the deadly boats that have killed thousands already. The toll of misery was revealed by senior Royal Navy officers leading Britain‚Äôs Mediterranean rescue mission off the Libyan coast. Britain‚Äôs amphibious assault ship HMS Bulwark has helped save around 4,000 refugees before they drowned having set sail in unseaworthy boats. The ship‚Äôs 350-strong company of sailors and Royal Marines is bracing itself to rescue a further 3,000. Captain Nick Cooke-Priest said: ‚ÄúIndications are that there are 450,000 to 500,000 migrants in Libya who are waiting at the border.‚Äù As he spoke, intelligence reports were warning Bulwark‚Äôs crew, which is among about 11 rescue vessels in the central Mediterranean, of thousands more migrants in the water. Britain is working with the Italian navy on Operation Weald to rescue migrants who have fallen prey to people smuggling gangs in Libya.
The passengers on some of the overcrowded boats are thought to have been told to scupper them as soon as they see a rescue ship, to ensure they will be saved, even though many of them cannot swim. Commodore Martin Connell, the Royal Navy‚Äôs senior officer commanding Operation Weald on board Bulwark said: ‚ÄúThis is just the most grim situation you could possibly find. It is a grim business ‚Ä¶ most of these boats won‚Äôt make it. If I could get my hands on some of these smuggling gangs. They have no regard for human life.‚Äù The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, visited Bulwark, flown in on one of the ship‚Äôs two Mark II Merlin helicopters, which are used to scour the seas for stranded boats. He urged the rest of Europe to help as Italy and Britain are taking on the brunt of the rescue workload. Asked about the half-a-million already preparing to make the hazardous journey by boat from Libya he told reporters: ‚ÄúWell you have seen today 3,000 people trying to cross in a single day, we could see hundreds of thousands trying to cross this summer. We all have an interest in tackling this much further back. The issue here is poverty and conflict in west Africa and poverty and conflict in east Africa.‚Äù He said more work was needed to smash the ruthless people smuggling gangs who organise the trips across treacherous waters. Fallon added: ‚ÄúWe can pool intelligence, get after the gangs themselves, we can try to cut off their financing. People are making money out of misery and we can do more there to track down the money. ‚ÄúThe Royal Navy stepped up to the plate straight away as David Cameron promised at the emergency summit so we are doing our bit with Bulwark and the helicopters, obviously we want other European countries to do more as well.‚Äù So far this year 76,000 migrants have made the 260-mile crossing into Europe from Libya, with 40,000 remaining in Italy.
On Saturday, Bulwark turned dramatically into the wind as once more it launched a Merlin helicopter to investigate reports of thousands of migrants who needed to be rescued. Meanwhile, Cameron is set to clash with Angela Merkel at the G7 summit over her plans for a pan-EU distribution of the migrants coming across the Mediterranean from north Africa, with the British prime minister insistent that such measures will only encourage the traffickers. The German chancellor has said that finding a way forward on the migration crisis will be a priority during the two-day talks starting in Bavaria on Sunday. She has previously said there should be a new EU system that distributes asylum seekers to member states based on their population and economic strength. Merkel is expected to make further such calls in the days to come. Downing Street, however, insists that it will not go along with the plans. Government officials claim they would deal only with the symptoms and not the cause of the humanitarian disaster. One government official said: ‚ÄúThe more the traffickers see that people are being resettled, the greater the incentive there is for them.‚Äù As part of his freshly announced agenda of tackling corruption, officials said Cameron would instead argue that attempts to dismantle the human trafficking networks should remain the focus, although the idea of an EU military force destroying boats in the Mediterranean has been rejected by the Libyan authorities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-06T20:00:44Z,world,World news,Sympathy and solidarity for migrants on Kos beaches as two worlds collide,"Tourists must get up early to catch a glimpse of the morning procession that is now part of the daily summer routine on the Greek island of Kos. At around 7am, the day‚Äôs arrivals are walked from the small industrial port where their boats have been brought in by police launch and around the corner into the picturesque harbour of Kos Town, past the shuttered shops and cafes and on a 20-minute walk to the very outskirts of town. The knot of tired migrants have little more than a bag each. Those with children to carry bring still less, having paid ‚Ç¨1,200 (¬£875) to make the journey from the Turkish mainland; 40 to 45 people in unsafe, 15ft plastic dinghies, floors lined with plywood, damp with seawater. They are piled into the boat by the traffickers and pointed towards the Greek coastline. Along Kos harbourside they pass the dozen or more big holiday boats which will, in a few hours, load up with tourists and begin their day cruises across the Aegean to the Turkish city of Bodrum. Prices start at around ‚Ç¨25, although cocktails and Greek dancing on board cost a little more. It takes 35 minutes to get to Turkey in one of these boats; in the migrants‚Äô dinghies it is three to four sleepless hours in the dark. A retired British couple on an early stroll stop to watch the migrants‚Äô quiet parade. ‚ÄúFirst time I‚Äôve actually seen them, and we‚Äôve been here a week. So sad really. I hope they find new lives,‚Äù says Julia Brookes, a Scotswoman from Leeds. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask him, though,‚Äù she says, indicating her husband, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs from the ‚Äòlet them die at sea‚Äô brigade. Terrible man.‚Äù Another woman, from Germany, in a neon bikini top, gets off her bicycle: ‚ÄúI come here every year, and I‚Äôm sorry to say enough is enough. This is testing the patience of people who are resident here, and the tourists who come to get away from the terrible news of wars and whatnot, not to see it. They shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to land.‚Äù One of the elderly fish sellers on the harbourside scolds her: ‚ÄúLady, you‚Äôd rather have bodies on the beaches? Tsk. We knew war here too once,‚Äù he says, fixing her with a beady eye. This weekend the arrivals are Syrian, but Afghans, Iraqis and Libyans have also made the journey. On Friday around 120, on Saturday 60, are led to what the police call the ‚Äúcamp‚Äù. The Captain Elias Hotel is just a shell, deserted during the economic slump. Before Easter local volunteers came in answer to a call from the mayor of Kos to clean the building and install standpipes for water. Dozens of bare mattresses line the floors and tents have gone up around the empty swimming pool. Here people try to find a space to sleep and wait until their paperwork is completed and they can move on, first to Athens, then to other parts of Europe. Officially, Greece allows only seven days on its soil, but on Kos the administrative infrastructure is overstretched and what had taken two days is taking longer. Residents drive up with regularity, dropping off what they can: bottles of water, bags of oranges, clothing. One woman brought a dozen cuddly toy dogs for children, driving off quickly as one of the fathers became tearful with gratitude. ‚ÄúThe Greeks have had bad times, many have nothing,‚Äù says Batoor Sulimankhel. ‚ÄúThis is hospitality. People with nothing understand more than people who have everything.‚Äù The Afghan has been here for three days and hopes to be moving on soon. Swedish holidaymaker Pernille Gusta, 27, and her five friends have cycled out from town to have a look. ‚ÄúThere are not so many people, but it is a shame to see the conditions,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe asked people what they need, but they were just smiling and embarrassed. There‚Äôs a child with some stomach upset so we‚Äôll find a pharmacy and see what we can do.‚Äù She says there had been a row in her holiday apartment block about the presence there of migrants, who turned out to be a French Muslim family on holiday. ‚ÄúAn English family moved to another place. I can understand that it makes people feel guilty, so it‚Äôs hard to have fun when maybe you have worked hard for this vacation. But they are people too.‚Äù Her friend Sara adds: ‚ÄúIt is prejudice.‚Äù While the biggest entry route into the European Union for migrants remains international airports, the ‚Äúeastern Mediterranean route‚Äù, as Frontex ‚Äì the agency set up to coordinate operational response at Europe‚Äôs borders ‚Äì calls the Turkish-Greek routes, is now a migratory ‚Äúhotspot‚Äù. Some 40,000 people have taken it so far in 2015, compared with a rough average of 50,000 a year crossing from Turkey into Greece since 2008. What‚Äôs new is that traffickers are supplying boats, shortening migrants‚Äô journeys by sea instead of over the land border. The latest figures from Frontex say June has recorded the ‚Äúbiggest wave of migrants we have seen in 2015‚Äù, says its executive director, Fabrice Leggeri. With 2,000 migrants drowning in the Mediterranean this year, there is an exhausted euphoria among the newly-arrived in Kos. Coming off the police launch on Friday was a Syrian teacher, Mohamad al-Shamali. He showed photographs on his phone of the street he had left behind in Aleppo, all rubble and bloodstains and bombed-out cars. He is sad that he might not see his homeland again. ‚ÄúBut life is more important,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe worst is not even death; it‚Äôs the jails. So many people disappear,‚Äù says Shamali. ‚ÄúThere are three kinds of horrible in Syria: the Islamic forces, the Bashir soldiers, and the thieves who take people and want money, then kill them anyway.‚Äù He made it to Kos on his second attempt. He gets his uncle to show the scabs from a beating by Turkish police. ‚ÄúThey hit him hard, they came up on us in their boat and tried to sink it.‚Äù He points to his companions: ‚ÄúThis guy is trying to reach Denmark. His daughter is sick ‚Äì her blood ‚Äì and he has heard there is medicine there.‚Äù The man shows me the medical papers for his five-year-old. Shamali goes on: ‚ÄúThese two guys, they are soldiers and ran away, they crawled for 3km to get out of Syria. This guy is a Christian and ‚Ä¶‚Äù he draws a line across his throat. ‚ÄúThis guy was a law student, they made him army, he ran away to find his wife so they could leave together.‚Äù The young pair, Mouhammed Yusef al-Mnger and Aisha Mouhammed Jeblawi, in matching nylon tracksuits and rucksacks, are unwrapping their phones from makeshift waterproof plastic coverings. Jeblawi, bruised and dehydrated, has to be restrained from excitedly hugging every European she sees. Shamali leans forward and whispers: ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm a communist.‚Äù Biochemist Namir is here without his wife, a civil engineer. ‚ÄúShe is very clever,‚Äù he says. He hopes the engineering skills shortage in Europe might help them to be accepted somewhere, anywhere barrel bombs don‚Äôt fall from helicopters and severed body bits aren‚Äôt carried around his block of flats by feral dogs. Shaama, four, shrieks as a customs officer wearing a balaclava tells her mother to sit down. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the hood,‚Äù her mother Aysha says. ‚ÄúLike Daesh [Isis].‚Äù Another officer tells the Observer: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unbelievable. We had one person in a wheelchair. Would you use that boat? No! They are so scared that even when they get on our boat they keep their lifejackets. Most are well-educated, not like me with my bad English,‚Äù he jokes. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll be logged and then have to wait for their paperwork. With 20 people in the coastguard and 20 police it‚Äôs tough. We try as fast as we can.‚Äù He says the numbers arriving varied. ‚ÄúThe most we have had in one day is 500, but more likely 100, less.‚Äù
Manolis is a port security guard who is angry to find a British journalist here. ‚ÄúWhy do the British papers say the things they have said?‚Äù he says, referring to a Daily Mail article last month which suggested that Kos was overrun with migrants bothering tourists and hanging dirty washing around the harbour. ‚ÄúIt will destroy us if the tourists stop coming. Already we are 27% down for the month. These people don‚Äôt make trouble. They stay a few days and are gone. These people are quiet and friendly and just escaping war.‚Äù Whatever the tabloid found when it was here, the British press‚Äôs name is now mud. In the week after the article, holiday website Trivago reported a 52% drop in searches for Kos. ‚ÄúWe hear there are a lot of cancellations. If it‚Äôs the economy, or the airlines, or the migrants, or the newspaper reports, we don‚Äôt know,‚Äù says Kos taxi driver Angelo. ‚ÄúBut it is worrying. These people are not thieves, they don‚Äôt steal or be dirty. They are escaping with their lives only. Do they really believe that a person who is trying to survive matters nothing compared to a person on a sun bed?‚Äù Some 1.7 million tourists are expected in Greece this year, where tourism represents 16% of the country‚Äôs GDP. In Kos, the reliance is even higher and the smallest drop in numbers will damage its fragile economy. As Greece teeters on the edge of bankruptcy, airports have announced that they have no money to maintain systems used to land aircraft, while night flights have already been stopped on Lesbos, Greece‚Äôs third-largest island, with Kos, Skiathos and Santorini likely to follow suit. So in Kos, mixed in with fear that tourists won‚Äôt come any more, there is some gratitude that the migrants have euros to spend. At the Captain Elias, Namir the biochemist has returned from buying bread pushing two rather tatty bicycles, far from the shiny ones that tourists are riding. They will have to visit the police station daily to chase up their papers and it‚Äôs a long way. But like the room Shamali and his friends rented this weekend, the price was higher than usual tourist rates. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs OK,‚Äù he grins. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a risk, I know, although why anyone would think I would want to steal a bicycle!‚Äù It‚Äôs funny, he says, that he had to sell his beloved car in Syria to raise cash for a leaky dinghy in Turkey and then a bike nobody else wants in Greece. Everyone makes money from the migrants, say his friends, who joke that if he reaches Germany the Germans will sell him a donkey. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs OK,‚Äù says Namir, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather they see I‚Äôm willing to pay than think I‚Äôm an animal to be drowned at sea.‚Äù Guardian members and journalists will be discussing the real human stories behind the current crisis and the EU‚Äôs responsibility to migrants arriving in Europe at Migration in Crisis, a Guardian Live event being held at Kings Place, London N1 9GU, on 11 June.

2015-06-06T19:42:37Z,world,World news,Israeli rights groups join battle to save symbol of Arab resistance to evictions,"In the cool of evening, the Palestinian villagers of Khirbet Susiya go about their business. A beekeeper in a protective suit and veil moves among his hives with a smoke can. Others use the warm wind blowing from the nearby Negev desert to separate rough legumes from chaff. Shepherds move their animals across the low, rolling yellow hills while children run about the playground. It appears a peaceful scene. Except that, for a third time in almost three decades, the few hundred villagers who live in crude temporary houses dotted about this area of the south Hebron hills of the occupied West Bank are under imminent threat of a new forced displacement. Last month an Israeli high court judge ruled against the villagers‚Äô injunction seeking to halt Israel‚Äôs planned destruction of Khirbet Susiya. Now the village has become the centre of a growing international campaign over its future which has drawn in European diplomats and human rights campaigners. Khirbet Susiya is home to between 250 and 350 villagers ‚Äì depending on the season ‚Äì who live in around 100 structures and eke out an existence largely from subsistence agriculture. Built on a scrubby ridge of limestone pavement, the houses of Khirbet Susiya are closely overlooked by a neighbouring Israeli settlement built on land expropriated from the villagers ‚Äì illegal under international law ‚Äì and, unlike the Palestinian village, connected to public services. On the other side of the nearby road is an archaeological site also run by settlers. Khirbet Susiya is sandwiched in-between. It is this proximity ‚Äì critics allege ‚Äì that underlies Israeli plans to move the villagers. The residents say that the destruction of their homes would mean the latest in several forcible expulsions from their land for which they have deeds going back to the Ottoman era. In 1986 they were expelled from their original village ‚Äì the archaeological site run by settlers who also lived nearby. Until then villagers had lived in houses and cave houses there. The army expelled the residents again in 2001 during the second intifada ‚Äì a short time after Palestinians killed an Israeli from the neighbouring Susiya settlement. Then the residents relocated to their current location on their agricultural land. While Israel claims the structures in Khirbet Susiya are illegal because they were put up without building permits, critics say that Israel‚Äôs civil administration has a policy of rarely issuing building permits to non-Jews in Area C ‚Äì the part of the occupied territories under full Israeli administration. Although the Israeli court accepted the villagers‚Äô ownership of the land, it ruled that they did not have permission to build there. Seventy-year-old Mohammad Ahmad al-Nuwaja has lived on the land around Susiya most of his life. ‚ÄúI was born in Tal Arad, but after the Nakba [‚Äòthe catastrophe‚Äô as Palestinians call the mass displacement that occurred when Israel was founded] we moved here. We are the original owners of this land,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúWe have deeds from the Turkish time.
‚ÄúThey claim these houses were built without permits. We have applied so many times and the Israelis rejected permission. They claim we don‚Äôt have the infrastructure to support living here, but they are the ones who won‚Äôt allow the infrastructure. We were offered land in exchange for moving from here near Yatta [the neighbouring town visible from Khirbet Susiya] but they have no right.‚Äù The long saga of Khirbet Susiya is symbolic of a wider problem of demolition and displacement affecting unrecognised villages in both the occupied Palestinian territories and Bedouin communities in Israel itself. According to Rabbis for Human Rights, an Israeli NGO which has been supporting the village in its efforts to get planning permission: ‚ÄúThe village of Palestinian Susiya has existed for centuries, long before the establishment of the [Jewish settlement of Susiya in 1983. There is documentary evidence of a settlement in the area dating back to 1830, and it is also marked on British mandatory maps from 1917.‚Äù There are indications, however, that the Israeli military intends to go ahead with the demolition. Almost immediately following the court ruling an Israeli inspector for the military‚Äôs civil administration, accompanied by soldiers, arrived to survey the houses ‚Äì often a precursor to demolition. The latest threat to Susiya was prompted by a complaint three years ago by Regavim, a rightwing Israeli NGO, which uses the courts to insist on the demolition of Palestinian buildings it argues are illegal. Regavim describes its mission as using the courts ‚Äúto protect national lands and properties and prevent foreign elements from taking over the countries [sic] territorial resources‚Äù and pursued this case despite the fact that Kirbet Susiya is not in Israel but in the occupied Palestinian territories. The villagers‚Äô plight was described in a recent report by the Israeli human rights organisation BT‚Äôselem. ‚ÄúThe state has been abusing the residents of Khirbet Susiya for many years: the army and the civil administration have repeatedly removed the residents from their homes, in which they have lived since before 1967, when Israel occupied the West Bank. ‚ÄúThe [Israeli] civil administration is responsible for all aspects of civilian life in area C and is theoretically supposed to promote the wellbeing of the local population. In practice, the administration uses its planning systems, in which Palestinians are not represented, to prevent them from promoting solutions that would meet their needs, barring them from building legally and from connecting to water and power supplies. ‚ÄúThe authorities also systematically refrain from protecting the residents of Khirbet Susiya from settlers who attack them or vandalise their property, and restrict their free access to the main town in the district, Yatta.‚Äù
For its part, the Israeli civil administration argued in 2013 that the villagers would be better off leaving their land and moving closer to the nearby town. It said: ‚ÄúWe see the current plan [prepared by the village] as yet another attempt to keep a poor, downtrodden population from advancing; from choosing between partial income and other resources; it is an attempt to prevent the Palestinian woman from breaking the cycle of poverty and depriving her of educational and professional opportunities. ‚ÄúSimilarly, by sentencing the Palestinian child to life in a small, stultified village with no means for development, the plan keeps the child from being aware of all the opportunities available to any other person. It is our recommendation that the plan be rejected out of hand.‚Äù The villagers don‚Äôt see it that way. Nasser Nuwaja is a resident who has been leading the campaign to save it. He points out that almost half the representatives on the village council are women and that whether they live on their own land should be their choice. ‚ÄúThe land we were offered is 1.5km from here. But we don‚Äôt own it. It would cause a conflict with another family. ‚ÄúSince the court ruling, people here have gone to bed not knowing whether the bulldozers would come in the morning. It is like trying to balance on a chair with only one leg and not knowing when you will fall off. People here are living on edge.‚Äù And for now international pressure remains their best hope. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been campaigning hard on this issue,‚Äù said one European diplomat. ‚ÄúWe are trying to put pressure on the Israeli government to prevent the demolition.‚Äù Although the villagers will try to go to court again on 3 August many are fearful the village will be destroyed and moved again. ‚ÄúGod forbid they demolish Susiya again,‚Äù says Nasser. ‚ÄúBut if they do, we will rebuild it.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-06T19:30:29Z,world,World news,Around the world in an autogyro: cancer survivor attempts a global first,"When Norman Surplus was diagnosed with advanced bowel cancer at 40, it was ‚Äúa body blow‚Äù. The prognosis gave him only a 40% chance of living for 18 months. He still gets emotional when he describes the ‚Äúmental challenge‚Äù he faced 12 years ago, knowing that the odds were that very soon he would be leaving his young family behind. One day, when recovering from surgery, he saw a reality TV show involving the restoration of an old autogyro that had been sitting for decades at the back of a barn. ‚ÄúI thought to myself: ‚ÄòIf I get out of this mess, that‚Äôs something I‚Äôd like to try.‚Äô‚Äù Suddenly, he had a goal to reach. The goal helped him stay positive through surgeries and particularly aggressive bouts of chemotherapy. When, against the odds, he was finally up and about again, he duly got his license at the only school that then offered training, in the UK. He flew his autogyro home from Northumbria to Northern Ireland, across the Irish Sea, and started thinking about how far he could take it.
After some research, he realised with delight that despite a few recent attempts, no one had yet flown an autogyro around the world. ‚ÄúTo find an aviation record that‚Äôs not been set is very rare,‚Äù he said. He decided to try, and after four years, he‚Äôs still going. In 2010 he set off from Belfast, and over the next year he flew through 18 countries in Europe, the Middle East and east over Asia to reach Japan. Then he fell foul of the worsening geopolitical situation between Russia and the rest of the world. ‚ÄúWe had written permission but we were delayed en route. We had to reapply, but we never got permission again to fly across Russia.‚Äù The aviation authorities were okay with it, but they had to run everything by a number of agencies, including the spooks at Russia‚Äôs FSB. The intelligence agency didn‚Äôt say no; it simply didn‚Äôt reply to the request. Surplus thinks that this let officials in effect stop the flight without having to explain their objections. For three years, the gyro was in mothballs in Japan. Surplus looked into other routes through the Japanese islands and the Aleutians, or the South Pacific, but the craft just didn‚Äôt have quite enough range. Finally he couldn‚Äôt delay any further. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult to keep an aircraft legally registered and active when it‚Äôs stuck in one place,‚Äù he said. He shipped the autogyro to Tacoma, Washington, and it wintered at the Evergreen Air and Space Museum in McMinville, about an hour south-west of Portland. Now he‚Äôll track across the US, and spend the summer island-hopping across the north Atlantic, from northern Canada, to Greenland, then Iceland and the outer Hebrides, and back to Belfast. This in itself will be a record: ‚ÄúNo autogyro has ever flown across the Atlantic.‚Äù That‚Äôs remarkable since this is a 92 year old technology, the ‚Äúforgotten cousin of the helicopter‚Äù. Unlike the more familiar chopper, the autogyro‚Äôs top rotor is not powered. ‚ÄúIt looks like a helicopter, but it flies much more like a fixed wing.‚Äù The rear propeller provides thrust; the top rotor spins ‚Äúlike a windmill‚Äù, driven by the rushing air. In the 1930s, it was hailed as a miracle technology. During the second world war, the aircraft had an unsung, secret role in helping to calibrate radar signals, and helped to win the Battle of Britain. But after the war, the autogyro was entirely displaced by more powerful helicopters. Surplus thinks its time might be coming again. In an energy-conscious age, its efficiency is attractive ‚Äì it only uses a third of the the aviation fuel of a helicopter of similar size. It‚Äôs also cheap, simply maintained, and easy to fly. It can take off after 50 metres and can land in 10. Surplus mentions the autogyro‚Äôs current use on big Australian sheep stations, and he reckons it‚Äôs ideal for everything from traffic reporting to border patrols. Surplus himself can attest to its ability to survive tight spots. When flying across Saudi Arabia, he found himself with huge storms approaching him fore and aft, and an almost empty desert below. Spying a gas station, he landed on a desert highway nearby, and was given shelter by the amused attendants, who only spoke Arabic. In the morning, with the storm passed, he filled up at their bowser with the cheap, high-octane gas that‚Äôs de rigeur in the kingdom, and went on his way to Riyadh. It‚Äôs these moments of goodwill from strangers, Surplus candidly admits, that have kept the whole enterprise going. There‚Äôs no big ground or support crew, and never a guarantee that he won‚Äôt be ensnared by red tape or worse as he flits from country to country. But he‚Äôs determined, raising funds for bowel cancer along the way: ‚ÄúI love an underdog, and the autogyro is the ultimate underdog of aviation.‚Äù With Surplus at the controls of his small yellow gyrocopter, two underdogs are having their day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-06T16:45:55Z,world,World news,"India and Bangladesh seal border deal, four decades later","Bangladesh and India have sealed a deal to swap border territories, more than 40 years after it was negotiated. The prime ministers of both countries watched as bureaucrats signed the pact in Dhaka, Bangladesh‚Äôs capital. The deal, reached in 1974 but only recently ratified by India‚Äôs parliament, will be seen as a major achievement for Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, who won a landslide election last year to take power. ‚Äú[The deal] will make our borders more secure and people‚Äôs lives more stable,‚Äù the 64-year-old leader said. Modi has had difficulty delivering achievements domestically, but has been active on the international scene and compared the agreement with the dismantling of the Berlin Wall. ‚Äú[Foreign policy] is one area where there has been unexpected and major progress,‚Äù said C Raja Mohan, an Indian foreign affairs analyst. ‚ÄúThis will open the door for significant co-operations and economic engagement.‚Äù Just an hour after Modi‚Äôs arrival in Dhaka, top Indian conglomerates signed outline agreements with Bangladesh‚Äôs state-run electricity agency to invest some $5bn in the country‚Äôs rickety power sector. Indian officials said yesterday‚Äôs agreement sent an important signal that the border disputes that plague India‚Äôs relations with other regional powers could be solved, but added that disagreements with Bangladesh were easier to resolve than those with rival Asian giant China, or with Pakistan, with which India has fought four wars. The agreement was also a boost for Sheikh Hasina, the prime minister of Bangladesh. Hasina won a disputed election last year which was boycotted by the opposition and dismissed as lacking credibility by some western governments. She has been criticised since for cracking down on dissent. Scores of people have been killed in firebomb attacks on vehicles since opposition leaders called a transport blockade at the start of the year in an attempt to oust the current government. Relations between India and its smaller neighbour have significantly improved since Hasina promised her administration would not allow India‚Äôs separatist insurgents to use the porous 2,500-mile border to carry out raids. Eighteen soldiers died in an ambush blamed on the separatists last week. The Indian army helped Bangladesh gain independence from Pakistan in a bloody nine-month war in 1971 and relations have usually been warm. There are hopes now that the border agreement will also boost trade. It will allow tens of thousands of people living in 162 enclaves resulting from ownership arrangements made centuries ago by local princes either side of the border enclaves to choose their nationality after decades of stateless limbo. ‚ÄúThis is a way of cleaning up the mess left by partition [of British India in 1947],‚Äù said Mohan. India‚Äôs parliament only gave its approval last month. People living in the enclaves will be allowed to choose to live in India or Bangladesh, with the option of being granted citizenship in the newly designated territories, and the enclaves would effectively cease to exist. Wary of China‚Äôs growing interest in India‚Äôs backyard, Modi has been keen to play a greater leadership role in South Asia since coming to power. He is set to meet Khaleda Zia, the main Bangladesh opposition leader. Indian officials have played down the idea of Modi playing a mediation role in the dispute between Hasina and Zia, although he might press on Zia to ensure an end to anti-government attacks. India held off from criticising Hasina‚Äôs re-election in January 2014.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-06T13:54:02Z,world,World news,How Turkey‚Äôs pro-Kurdish party HDP could derail Erdogan push for power,"In the towns and villages of south-eastern Turkey, Kurdish clan leaders have long experience of dealing with disputes. In mediation practices going back hundreds of years, they have perfected conflict resolution techniques to negotiate rivalries and blood feuds. In recent weeks the traditions have found a novel field of play ‚Äì national politics. The tribal chiefs and clan leaders are trading their loyalties and allegiances for votes, with results that will become apparent on Sunday on Sunday when Turkey goes to the polls in an epic election that will determine the fate of the country‚Äôs president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Something is stirring in Turkey‚Äôs Kurdish region, and some predict a seismic shift in Turkish politics. The focus of this trend is the People‚Äôs Democratic party (HDP), a new group of leftists and liberals that centres its election programme on minority rights and the rights of women. Its co-chair is Selahattin Demirtas, a young politician and surprise star of the election campaign. Recent polls show the HDP hovering just above Turkey‚Äôs 10% election threshold to enter parliament, one of the highest in the world. The stakes could not be higher. If the party manages to get into parliament, it could secure up to 70 seats, possibly putting an end to the 13-year majority government of Erdogan‚Äôs AKP, or Justice and Development party, and dashing the head of state‚Äôs hopes of engineering a more powerful executive presidency. With the help of local ‚Äúpersuasion committees‚Äù many large tribes ‚Äì Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen ‚Äì have pledged their allegiance to the HDP, taking thousands of voters, most of whom previously cast their ballots for the AK party, with them. Take Burhan Saran, for example. A prominent local AKP politician for the duration of the party‚Äôs ascendancy, he resigned 20 days ago and joined the HDP, taking with him around 4,000 votes now denied to Erdogan and gifted to his most feared rival. ‚ÄúWe drove to the HDP‚Äôs headquarters in Batman with a celebratory convoy of 650 cars to announce our decision,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI had high hopes for AKP before. I invested a lot of time and work in them, but they did not deliver on their promises of peace. When it comes down to it, we are all Kurds, and peace is all that matters to us now.‚Äù The last straw, he said, was the government‚Äôs unwillingness to assist the Syrian-Kurdish border town of Kobani during the attack by Islamic State last year. ‚ÄúThe AK party has failed us.‚Äù The shift marks a significant change in local Kurdish politics. Many members of Saran‚Äôs tribe are village guards, a huge force of mainly Kurdish paramilitaries created almost 30 years ago by the Turkish state to patrol Kurdish settlements of the south-east. Village guards, being Kurds, are seen as traitors and opportunists by their compatriots, and many have been accused of grave human rights violations. ‚ÄúI talked to many of the guards,‚Äù Saran said. ‚ÄúWe are ready for reconciliation. Those that hesitate are afraid to lose their livelihoods, but they will come around. With or without the AK, we will end the politics of pitching Kurd against Kurd.‚Äù After he handed in his resignation to the AKP, the calls started piling in. ‚ÄúI turned off my phone and locked up my house for a week,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMany high AKP officials tried to persuade me to come back. A minister called me.‚Äù He added that they promised him ‚Äúanything‚Äù in order to change his mind. ‚ÄúBut my decision was made.‚Äù Batman‚Äôs mayor, Sabri √ñzdemir, himself a member of the HDP-led ‚Äúpersuasion commissions‚Äù that negotiate with local leaders, said that it has been ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to convince many former AKP supporters. ‚ÄúThe AKP actually did most of the work for us,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTheir hostility towards Kobani and Kurdish fighters, the corruption scandals, their disputes among themselves, and their constant stalling of the peace process made people lose faith in the government.‚Äù In Batman, AKP took almost 37% of the vote in the last elections in 2011, securing two of the four available seats. But since then support has been waning. Many blame the lack of progress on the ongoing peace process between the Turkish government and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers‚Äô party (PKK), whose guerrillas have been fighting Ankara for the past 30 years, as well as AK party blunders in Syria. Expectations of, and confidence in, an HDP victory are high in Batman. But many fear that there might be attempts at ballot-rigging. Opposition parties have called on citizens to volunteer as election monitors, and the HDP leadership has announced that they are ‚Äúwell prepared‚Äù to ‚Äúprotect all votes‚Äù. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been able to sleep for a week,‚Äù said Ibrahim Yilmaz, 60. ‚ÄúI am so worried they will steal our votes, that they will try anything to push the HDP below the threshold.‚Äù According to a survey published by Istanbul‚Äôs Ko√ß University in May, trust in fair elections dropped to 48% from 70% in 2007. While the AKP was previously able to take around 50% of all Kurdish votes on promises of peace and economic development, many of their supporters in Batman now voice their disappointment that only very few pledges have been delivered. According to official statistics, the province still suffers the highest unemployment rate in the country, at more than 20%, double the national average. But at a local AKP election office, the mood is defiant. Only a few men sit in chairs, and leaf through stacks of glossy election pamphlets. ‚ÄúThe AKP is the only party in Turkey that cares about us Kurds,‚Äù said Celat Turan, 56, pointing to a brochure that advertises infrastructure built in Batman under the ruling party. ‚ÄúThere is no Kurdish problem here. The roads here are now better than the roads in Istanbul ‚Äì how can anyone still speak of discrimination?‚Äù His friends nod in agreement. ‚ÄúWe are proud of our leader. Whatever president Erdogan wants we want as well.‚Äù Ilhan Alta√ß, a local village headman, would have agreed, but recently decided to pledge all 714 votes of his constituency to the HDP. ‚ÄúI got sick of Erdogan‚Äôs polarising language,‚Äù he said. He is one of 50 village headmen who switched sides in May. His predominantly Kurdish village has been supporting parties loyal to the Turkish state for over 25 years. But no longer. ‚ÄúNever in my life had I expected to find myself voting for this party,‚Äù Alta√ß said. ‚ÄúUp until last month, I would not even come to have a cup of tea with these people, because I had a bad image of the HDP. Everyone should come and see who they really are, and what they do. I found that my prejudices were all wrong.‚Äù The AKP has tried to use these prejudices against their rivals during the election campaign, berating the HDP as a bunch of ‚Äúmarginals, gays and atheists‚Äù. Some say that the aggressive rhetoric has led to more than 70 attacks on HDP campaigners all over Turkey. On Thursday, a mob attacked HDP supporters in the eastern city of Erzurum before an election rally. Around 150 HDP campaign vehicles were burned, 200 people were wounded, three of them critically. In the most serious attack so far, two bombs exploded in the main Kurdish city of Diyarbakir , killing at least two. Hundreds were injured. Amid rising tension, the HDP leadership has managed to keep calm among its supporters. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give in to your anger,‚Äù Demirtas told the crowd after the bomb attacks. ‚ÄúWe will win, we will bring peace to this country.‚Äù In campaign speeches only thinly veiled as impartial ribbon-cutting ceremonies all over the Kurdish south-east, Erdogan has repeatedly brandished a Kurdish translation of the Qur‚Äôan, warning ‚Äúhis Muslim Kurdish brothers‚Äù not to support ‚Äúthese people who have no relationship with Islam‚Äù. Referring to Ali Atalan, the HDP‚Äôs top candidate in Batman and a member of the Yazidi religious minority, conservative rightwing politicians demanded that voters not vote for ‚Äúpagans‚Äù.
But many in Batman, a religiously conservative region, are indignant about the president‚Äôs blatant use of Islam to rally his base. Selim Yilmaz, an Islamic scholar and imam for 27 years, criticised the AKP‚Äôs attempts to discredit the HDP as ‚Äúheathen‚Äù. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs such nonsense. The Qur‚Äôan does not support such a statement. The HDP unites all kinds of people: religious people, atheists, gays, and others. It‚Äôs like a beautiful garden where all kinds of fruit are growing. But he conceded that the AKP‚Äôs propaganda resonates with some. ‚ÄúI get calls from people asking if they will turn into Yazidis if they vote for a Yazidi, or if it is a sin to support a candidate who drinks alcohol,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI tell them they cannot have a healthy democracy if they expect a politician who will represent their interests to be and live exactly like them.‚Äù For Yilmaz, the idea of an executive presidency under Erdogan is abhorrent. ‚ÄúThat man does not recognise anyone‚Äôs interests. All he cares about and fights for is his own power.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much better than an egg or a sandwich or a cup of tea,‚Äù said Arvind Singh at 6.15am as he did his breathing exercises on a bench. Singh, a 42-year-old salesman, and his friends are far from alone. All across India, in the overcrowded cities, on whatever green space is left, similar scenes are being played out. On 21 June ‚Äì the new International Yoga day ‚Äì Narendra Modi, India‚Äôs prime minister, hopes the world will join in. The grass near India Gate will be transformed into the venue for what it is hoped will be the biggest single yoga session ever held, with up to 45,000 people running through a 35-minute routine. The participants will include 64-year-old Modi, most of his government and, they hope, a range of celebrities. Officials have been sent to round up volunteers from scores of countries to reinforce the international credentials of the ancient Indian practice. Getting Indians, and others, stretching has emerged as something of a focus for Modi, who led his Bharatiya Janata Party to a landslide election victory last year. Last month schools were directed to make sure students attended yoga events timed to coincide with the big demonstration in Delhi, even though it is being held on a Sunday. Officials have already signalled the introduction of compulsory yoga for India‚Äôs famously out-of-shape police officers, and said that daily yoga lessons would be offered free to three million civil servants and their families. Air India, the national carrier, has also said it will introduce yoga for trainee pilots. More controversially, senior politicians in India have suggested more widespread practice of yoga could bring down soaring levels of sexual violence in the country. Modi, an ascetic who is a committed vegetarian and an enthusiastic yoga practitioner himself, suggested an international yoga day when speaking to the United Nations on a visit to New York last year. ‚ÄúYoga is an invaluable gift of India‚Äôs ancient tradition. It embodies unity of mind and body, thought and action, restraint and fulfilment, harmony between man and nature, a holistic approach to health and wellbeing. It is not about exercise but discovering the sense of oneness with yourself, the world and nature,‚Äù Modi said at the time, adding that yoga could help in tackling climate change. The discipline is between 3,000 and 6,000 years old and originated somewhere on the Indian subcontinent, possibly among religious ascetics. Its meditative practices as well as physical exercises have long been associated with local religious traditions including Buddhism and Jainism, as well as the Hinduism practised by 80% of Indians. Yet this association with faith has led to some criticism of Modi‚Äôs campaign from religious minorities. ‚ÄúMany Muslim scholars say that yoga is against the fundamental tenets of Islam ‚Äì to pray to the sun, for example,‚Äù said Asaduddin Owaisi, a Muslim member of parliament. ‚ÄúWhy make this a nationalist issue? Just because I do not want to do yoga does not mean I am not a patriot.‚Äù Modi, who started his career as an organiser for a hardline Hindu nationalist organisation, has been previously criticised for promoting a view of Indian culture that has little place for other traditions. One commentator called the event on 21 June ‚Äúa mix of cultural nationalism, commercialisation and subtle coercion‚Äù. Novelist Ajaz Ashraf wrote on India‚Äôs Scroll website: ‚ÄúUnderlying it is the hope of bringing into the BJP tent the modern-day gurus and their teeming followers, who largely constitute the urban middle classes.‚Äù Others, however, point to a recent US court ruling that said yoga was not inevitably linked to faith. A court in California ruled that: ‚ÄúWhile the practice of yoga may be religious in some contexts, yoga classes as taught in the [San Diego] district are, as the trial court determined, ‚Äòdevoid of any religious, mystical, or spiritual trappings‚Äô,‚Äù after two parents claimed yoga in schools promoted Hinduism and inhibited Christianity. Amish Tripathi, the author of best-selling novels set 4,000 years ago in India that retell stories from Hindu mythology, said characters in his books practise yoga. ‚ÄúIn ancient India it was part of daily life, both the physical and the mental aspects. Every culture has gifted something to the world, and this is our gift,‚Äù Tripathi said. Suneel Singh, a guru in south Delhi, agreed that yoga did not belong to any one religion: ‚ÄúIs t‚Äôai chi just Chinese? Is soccer just English? Same is with yoga. It is [a] complete package for everybody‚Äôs body and the cheap way for keeping you hale and hearty.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-06T12:00:07Z,world,World news,Canada confronts its dark history of abuse in residential schools,"Sue Caribou contracts pneumonia once a year, like clockwork. The recurring illness stems from her childhood years at one of Canada‚Äôs horrific residential schools. ‚ÄúI was thrown into a cold shower every night, sometimes after being raped‚Äù, the frail 50-year-old indigenous mother of six said, matter-of-factly. Caribou was snatched from her parents‚Äô house in 1972 by the state-funded, church-run Indian Residential School system that brutally attempted to assimilate native children for over a century. She was only seven years old. ‚ÄúWe had to stand like soldiers while singing the national anthem, otherwise, we would be beaten up‚Äù, she recalled. Caribou said Catholic missionaries physically and sexually abused her until 1979 at the Guy Hill institution, in the east of the province of Manitoba. She said she was called a ‚Äúdog‚Äù, was forced to eat rotten vegetables and was forbidden to speak her native language of Cree. ‚ÄúI vowed to myself that if I ever get out alive of that horrible place, I would speak up and fight for our rights‚Äù, she said.
Her voice and that of 150,000 other residential school pupils was finally heard across the nation this week as Canada faced one of the darkest chapters in its history. The head of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), set up to examine the school system‚Äôs legacy, did not mince his words when he unveiled his landmark report. ‚ÄúCanada clearly participated in a period of cultural genocide‚Äù, declared Justice Murray Sinclair to cries and applause of survivors in Ottawa. Although prime minister Stephen Harper apologised for the school system in 2008 (as did the Roman Catholic Church in 2009), his government has always denied that it was a form of genocide. Many survivors who gathered in Ottawa felt empowered for the first time in their life after hearing findings of the six-year-long commission. ‚ÄúIt feels like our story is validated at last and is out there for the world to see‚Äù, said a tearful 58 year-old Cindy Tom-Lindley, who is executive director of the Indian Residential School Survivor Society in British Columbia. ‚ÄúWe were too scared as children to speak out. So to give our testimonies to the commission was liberating and emotional.‚Äù As many as 6,000 children died in residential institutions, which ran from 1876 to 1996. The accurate figure could be much higher however, since the government stopped recording aboriginal students‚Äô deaths in 1920 in light of the alarming statistics. Caribou believes that dozens of pupils perished at the institution where she was detained. ‚ÄúRemains were found all over the fields. But numbers do not reflect the reality. Many of my friends committed suicide after their release‚Äù, said Caribou, who said she was frustrated that an inquiry did not take place twenty years ago, after the last of the residential schools closed Justice Sinclair, who was the second aboriginal judge to be appointed in Canada in 1988, made clear the connection between residential schools and the social ills plaguing the First Nations today, namely unemployment, domestic violence, the over-representation of aboriginal children in foster care and the high homicide rate of indigenous women. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt learn anything at the Guy Hill school except the ‚ÄúOur Father‚Äù prayer and the national anthem‚Äù, said Caribou. ‚ÄúMy children taught me how to read and write. I‚Äôve been a housekeeper all my life because of my lack of education and poor health‚Äù. The hopeful mood among survivors in the capital was met with silence by the government, despite urgent calls to act on the commission‚Äôs 94 recommendations. Prime Minister Harper did not utter a word while he attended the emotional closing ceremony of the TRC on Thursday, nor did he announce any measures that would further reconciliation for survivors and close the economic gap between First Nations and non-aboriginal Canadians. Since coming into power in 2006, the Conservative government has repeatedly rejected some long-standing demands by First Nations, such as holding a national enquiry on the missing and murdered aboriginal women, a measure also recommended by Justice Sinclair.
‚ÄúIf Stephen Harper‚Äôs apology for residential schools is not followed by actions, it will prove to be meaningless‚Äù, warned Perry Bellegarde, Chief of the Assembly of First Nations. Bellegarde said Harper should move quickly on certain policy proposals, such as promoting the use of native languages and introducing aboriginal rights in the school curriculums across the nation. Bellegarde also stressed that more funding is desperately needed for equal education on reserves, where the government spends 3,000 dollars less per student than the national average. The upcoming federal elections this October might still turn the tide in favour of the First Nations. Leaders of the two opposition parties ‚Äì the New Democratic Party and the Liberal Party ‚Äì have both promised to act on key policies if elected on October 19. There has been growing support in the general population for aboriginal requests, with three quarters of Canadians in favour of a public enquiry on violence against indigenous women who are four times more at risk of being murdered. NDP‚Äôs Thomas Mulcair has pledged that he would set up one within days of being elected. Tom-Lindley hopes that the awareness and political pressure on the Harper government will continue to grow until Election Day. ‚ÄúCanadians are starting to get the message that this is not only an aboriginal issue, it concerns everyone. We have found our voice and we will not keep quiet anymore.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-06T11:00:06Z,world,World news,The price of China's yuan manipulation: American jobs,"China‚Äôs yuan is no longer undervalued ‚Äì or so the International Monetary Fund said last month. The basis for this claim is that China‚Äôs central bank is no longer engaged in large-scale interventions in currency markets and its trade imbalance is within a normal range. After being as high as 10% of GDP in 2007, China‚Äôs trade surplus is now just over 2% of its GDP. With this drop in the trade surplus, the IMF was effectively declaring mission accomplished. If only it was so simple. Before we all break out the champagne, it is worth giving this one a bit more thought. First of all, China deserves credit for an extraordinarily large adjustment in its trade balance with remarkably little disruption to its domestic economy. An eight-point drop in its trade surplus is equivalent to a loss in annual demand of more than $1.4tn in the US economy. It is difficult to envision the United States seeing this sort of hit to demand without massive unemployment and other negative consequences. The fact that China was able to maintain an extraordinarily rapid pace of growth throughout this period is a testament to the effectiveness of its ability to manage its economy. But just because there has been an enormous reduction in the size of the trade surplus does not mean it is at a satisfactory level. The textbook story is that capital is supposed to flow from slow-growing rich countries to fast-growing developing countries like China. The logic is that capital is plentiful in rich countries, but relatively scarce in developing countries; therefore it should get a better return in developing countries. This means that investors in rich countries should want to send their money to China in search of higher returns. Flows of capital from rich countries to China would mean that China is running a trade deficit rather than a trade surplus. So even though a trade surplus of 2% of GDP is much better than one of 10%, China still has some way to go before its trade situation is in line with what the textbooks predict. In this respect, it is worth noting the contrast with the United States. As a result of moderately more rapid growth in the US than the euro zone last year (2.4% in the United States compared to 0.9% in the euro zone) the dollar rose rapidly against the euro ‚Äì and the US trade deficit is rising as a result. If China‚Äôs currency were following normal market patterns, we would expect the country‚Äôs much more rapid pace of growth (projected to be close to 7% in 2015) to lead to a higher-priced currency, which would push its trade surplus toward deficit. The fact that this is not happening is compelling evidence that its currency is still being controlled by the government. An important factor in this equation that is generally left out of discussion is the $4tn in foreign exchange reserves being held by China‚Äôs central bank. This stock is way out of line with what would be expected for an economy of China‚Äôs size. If we use six months of imports as our yardstick (a common rule of thumb) then China has more than $3tn of excess reserves. This stock of foreign reserve holdings almost certainly is keeping down the value of the yuan against the dollar and other freely traded currencies. This is the exact same logic as the Federal Reserve‚Äôs holdings of more than $3tn in government bonds and mortgage backed securities. Almost everyone would accept that holding these assets raises their prices and lowers interest rates compared to the scenario in which private investors have to absorb all of them. The same story applies to the dollars and other reserve currencies held by China‚Äôs central bank. This means the huge stock of foreign exchange reserves is keeping down the value of the yuan, even if the Chinese central bank is not currently acquiring more reserves. This is a big deal for the US, for the simple reason that we have no easy mechanism for replacing the demand lost to the trade deficit. We filled the demand gap in the 1990s with a stock bubble, and in the last decade with a housing bubble. Without getting the trade deficit down, or seeing another round of bubble-generated growth, it is difficult to see how the US economy gets back to full employment. And with the employment to population ratio of prime-age workers (ages 25 to 54) down 3% from its pre-recession level, we still have a long way to go to get to full employment. As long as the labor market remains weak, workers will not have the bargaining power to secure wage gains and stop the upward redistribution of income. This is a reason to care about currency values.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ovel. The men dug. A few of them, on their knees after a day of drinking and murder, vomited. They prised Ntehelang‚Äôs stiff body from the car, pushed him into the ground, piled wood on him, and tried to torch him in the hopes of protecting the corpse from wild animals, which might expose their crime. They then drove back to Pretoria, weaving through the streets during morning rush hour, while white workers headed to their offices. Later, De Kock arranged for Baker to keep issuing Ntehelang‚Äôs salary to cover up the crime. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very horrible to see the way he was buried,‚Äù Ntehelang‚Äôs brother-in-law, Victor Makoke, tells me. ‚ÄúThey put him in a blanket and threw him into the hole. Stones, sand, fire, diesel, the flames and whatever. Those people were not right in their mind. They fear that he might rise up, so they have to make sure they put everything on top of him. To them it seems he was a monster. They were fearing him even when he was dead.‚Äù Ntehelang was 22. *** De Kock, Ras, Flores, Baker and six other men received amnesty for Ntehelang‚Äôs murder, but the body was never recovered. In 2014, Fullard asked De Kock if he could help. He called Ras from her office phone. Ras hadn‚Äôt heard from De Kock since their days before the TRC, when they were co-applicants in a number of cases. He was bitter that De Kock had implicated him in so many crimes, but, having got amnesty, he now considers the whole process ‚Äúbrilliant ‚Äì if I didn‚Äôt go to the TRC, I would be in jail today‚Äù. A week later, Ras met Bisso, Fullard, De Kock and his prison guards in the back of a burger chain in Pretoria. De Kock looked good, Ras thought, younger than his years; you don‚Äôt get sun in prison. The men embraced. Ras was tasked with asking the new farm owner if they could dig on his property. ‚ÄúPeople are different there, they haven‚Äôt got hassles about the past,‚Äù Ras tells me. ‚ÄúI just tell him, ‚ÄòEugene de Kock and I have to go dig up the body,‚Äô and he says, ‚ÄòYou can go.‚Äô‚Äù The unusual group headed upcountry: Prime Evil and his two prison guards; a quartet of ANC guys; Claudia Bisso; her two proteges, one of them Indian-South African and the other Zimbabwean; and Madeleine Fullard. They met for dinner and drinks. They worked together in the searing sun, meticulously extending their search until they found Ntehelang. Later, back in Pretoria, the group celebrated over a barbecue. ‚ÄúOnly here, only in South Africa,‚Äù Bisso reflects. ‚ÄúFifteen years in this country and I still don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù On 17 December 2014, the Missing Persons Task Team formally exhumed Ntehelang before his family members, and his friend Edwin Martins. The local ANC military veterans‚Äô association presided over the service, despite the fact that Ntehelang had been, technically, a traitor at the time of his death. ‚ÄúIt is the belief of most comrades that if a man died in the hands of the enemy, you can‚Äôt say that he was selling out,‚Äù Martins explains. Six weeks later, to the shock of many South Africans, De Kock was released from prison. According to national legislation, offenders sentenced prior to 1 October 2004 who have served a required minimum sentence (13 years and four months) are eligible for parole at the justice minister‚Äôs discretion. Justice minister Michael Masutha had dodged a decision several times, as De Kock‚Äôs lawyer repeatedly applied for parole. Finally, Masutha, who said he had asked President Jacob Zuma‚Äôs advice, announced in a press conference: ‚ÄúIn the interests of nation-building and reconciliation, I‚Äôve decided to place De Kock on parole.‚Äù He credited De Kock‚Äôs work with the Missing Persons Task Team and his consultations with the victims‚Äô families as key to this decision.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But according to Julian Knight, De Kock‚Äôs lawyer, the state was simply litigated out of options; De Kock had more than served the minimum sentence and the minister‚Äôs repeated refusals had begun to seem like discrimination. After all, De Kock was in prison precisely because he had been denied amnesty, on the grounds that certain crimes were not politically motivated; he should be treated like a criminal, not an apartheid monster. ‚ÄúWho was it that said, ‚ÄòIf you‚Äôve got them by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow‚Äô? And we had the minister by the balls,‚Äù Knight says. Opinion on the parole decision was divided. Some felt that De Kock was the only member of the old regime upon whom justice had been served, and that he should be joined behind bars by his old cronies. Others felt he was a scapegoat who should be freed. Few people believed there was adequate political will to go after other perpetrators: former president FW de Klerk heads a charitable foundation and boasts a Nobel peace prize; a doctor who once cooked up chemical weapons for the apartheid government runs a thriving Cape Town cardiology practice. Why was De Kock in prison? De Kock had long held out hope that the new government would release him. Years before, he told a friend: ‚ÄúMy own people put me in jail, and if I‚Äôm ever released, it will be because of my former enemy.‚Äù,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
*** De Kock was released in January this year. Mystery now surrounds his whereabouts. According to Knight, he was extracted from prison a week before his release was announced on 30 January, most likely by the state security agency. For weeks, even Knight couldn‚Äôt access his client, telling journalists that De Kock had ‚Äúgone missing‚Äù. In March, Knight received a message through an intermediary, telling him that De Kock was being held against his will. Days later he sent another message saying he was ‚Äúfine‚Äù. Meanwhile, the government asserted that De Kock was being kept in protective custody due to threats on his life. In April, under a judge‚Äôs order, he was produced before the Pretoria high court, where he told a judge he was ‚Äúsatisfied‚Äù by his parole conditions before being whisked away by unnamed officials. He has not been seen since. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs spook nation,‚Äù Knight tells me. ‚ÄúThe weirdest case I‚Äôve ever worked on.‚Äù Fullard and her team have not seen De Kock since his release, though they figure they will eventually be able to start their collaboration again. She refuses to comment on his parole, though her team submitted two reports detailing the assistance he gave them ‚Äì assistance that helped De Kock ‚Äúslowly but surely recreate his identity‚Äù, according to his biographer, Anemari Jansen. Fullard tries not to focus on whether or not she has helped to rehabilitate a killer. She tries to focus instead on his lesser-known victims. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs one of many,‚Äù she says of De Kock. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just a bullet man, marginal on the landscape of death.‚Äù She wants to maintain her distance, but it has been difficult, coming face-to-face with the larger-than-life figure who killed your comrades and tried to destroy your cause, and finding him to be a living, breathing person whom you can‚Äôt simply dismiss. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs resigned to the fact that he‚Äôll never escape the Prime Evil identity,"‚Äù she reflects. ‚ÄúI did say to him once that he can still make a change. I said: ‚ÄòThe final chapter has not been written.‚Äô‚Äù""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-06T08:00:02Z,world,World news,World War Two veterans: 'The people who say they weren‚Äôt frightened are liars‚Äô,"Donn French, 87 I was 15, but I said I was 18 because I wanted to join the service. I walked out the door and there was an old marine sergeant. He said, ‚ÄúYou look a bit crestfallen, lad,‚Äù and I said, ‚ÄúThe lieutenant-commander told me to come back later when I‚Äôm older.‚Äù He looked at his watch and said, ‚ÄúWell, if you go and walk around the block, he‚Äôll be gone to lunch. I shall be in charge, it‚Äôll be later and you‚Äôll be older.‚Äù And that‚Äôs what I did ‚Äì but I went through the wrong door and joined the merchant navy instead of the Royal Navy. We weren‚Äôt armed. In 1944, I transferred to the Royal Navy, and I stayed until 1956.
I was in the engine room. It was hot and noisy ‚Äì that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm deaf in both ears. We made our own drinking water out of sea water, in an evaporator. It tasted fine but it took all the enamel off your teeth, because it was just pure water ‚Äì it‚Äôs what they put in car batteries now. In my last couple of years in the navy, I met my wife. She worked in an office, but she wouldn‚Äôt tell me what sort. I came home from work one evening in 1976 and on the mantelpiece was a brown envelope. She said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where I used to work.‚Äù It was Bletchley Park. She was a codebreaker. She didn‚Äôt tell me for 21 years, until she was released from the Official Secrets Act. For two or three years after I first got demobbed, I don‚Äôt think I would have minded whether I lived or died. But through my wife I settled down, and I‚Äôve got three daughters, which gave me something to live for. The people who say they weren‚Äôt frightened are liars. But the thing I get upset about now is the friends I lost. They are the people who deserve medals. I wanted to do what I thought was my bit, and whether it‚Äôs been a good thing or a bad thing, I still don‚Äôt know. Joan De-Vall, 89
I was a height-finder and predictor operator on an anti-aircraft battery. As the enemy planes flew in, I would check the height they were flying. It was up to us to get the guns into the right position to fire. On our gun site, each woman had to go for monthly FFI inspections, which means ‚Äúfree from infection‚Äù. The medical officer would say, ‚ÄúHave you been a good girl?‚Äù and you‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù and they‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôll soon find out.‚Äù As for the men, they put bromide in their tea to keep them good. At breakfast there would be two queues, the men down one side, the ladies down the other, and you always knew when one of the fellows was going home on leave because he‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúGive us a cup of your tea.‚Äù Because we didn‚Äôt have bromide in ours. After the war, I went into ladies‚Äô fashion. On the gun site, we were issued with three pairs of pants, three pairs of khaki directory knickers, a uniform and boots. The knickers were abominable because the elastic came down to our knees, so we used to cut the legs, making them into semi-French knickers, and just keep one pair for inspection. After we were demobbed and got married, we‚Äôd had so little for so long that we‚Äôd go home feeling like we‚Äôd won the pools just because we‚Äôd bought an ironing board or saucers. By the time they declared victory, I was in Greenford, west London. I was in the Nissen hut, and a young woman came in and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all over!‚Äù We went to the West End and had a bit of fun ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think many people remember an awful lot about the rest of the day. People were dancing in the streets and having a drink; everybody was absolutely delighted. The man who would later become my husband was on a minesweeper. We‚Äôd known one another since we were 16, and we met up again after the war. I lost him in 2002. We had 54 wonderful years together. Patrick Ready, 90
I fought in the Marines. On D-day there were five of us together, and we got mortar attacked. Two of us were lucky, the other three got killed. I got a big gash on my head and leg. We went to Hong Kong to take the surrender of the Japanese. When we opened a camp to release some Australian prisoners, they went mad. They were grabbing our rifles and going round trying to shoot the Japanese. They were like matchsticks. On VE Day, I was in India, outside Pune. We were training for another raid, but they gave us a day off to have a drink. We were issued with one pint of Whitbread‚Äôs beer each. My wife wouldn‚Äôt marry me while I was in the service. I came out and went to work with my brother as a long-distance lorry driver. She said, ‚ÄúI waited 10 years for you, and now you‚Äôve got a job that means I don‚Äôt see you.‚Äù My brother-in-law worked for the Bank of America. We were having a drink and he said, ‚ÄúThe bank are looking for a private security man, would you be interested?‚Äù And my wife said, ‚ÄúYes, he would!‚Äù I got the job and stayed there for 30 years. My wife lost her first child in 1956, and they told us she wouldn‚Äôt be able to have any more children; so we adopted a boy, Peter, in 1965. In the family, we had about nine servicemen ‚Äì guardsmen, navy. When we get together and chat, we only talk about the good times. Eric Drube, 91
I was a minesweeper. It‚Äôs dangerous. On D-day we ran into a great big minefield, mines like big dishes. One plate mine alone could sink a ship. Prisoners of war were put in factories to make them. There were so many mines in the water, it‚Äôs a wonder we never got blown to bits. Every morning you woke up to find lives lost somewhere in the water. I wasn‚Äôt frightened, but it affected some people. We were only 19. When we were anchored in the Channel, we used to see the rockets going up in the middle of the night over London and Portsmouth. When the war finished, the minesweepers still had to carry on. Some were given leave to go to London to celebrate, but I was on duty on the boat, so I didn‚Äôt get the chance. We were sent to the Irish Sea: the minefields there were colossal. I was due to be demobbed in 1945, but I was still minesweeping in Ireland in 1946. They‚Äôre still bringing up mines today ‚Äì there are fishermen out there wondering what‚Äôs pulling on their nets ‚Äì great big thousand-pounders! And they could still blow up. Dorothy Runnicles, 90
I came out of the war appalled by the slaughter. I lost friends, and I lost my first boyfriend when I was 19. I was in the Royal Naval Air Service, a petty officer Wren. We serviced the planes, and I was a mechanic. At the age of 19, I was ticking the box saying, ‚ÄúThis plane is fit to fly.‚Äù It was a huge responsibility. On VE Day I was 20, and I was up in the north of Scotland on a Royal Naval Air Station called HMS Fearn, run almost entirely by women. We had to take the place of men who went off to war. We had a chief officer woman, all the mechanics were women ‚Äì you wouldn‚Äôt believe all that was happening in 1945, would you? Of course, at the end of the war most women went back to the kitchen. I was 21, and lucky enough to be offered a place at Bedford College for ladies in Regent‚Äôs Park in London. We were the first batch of women who‚Äôd been through university and come out as qualified social workers. I became an academic, and now I‚Äôm a community worker and researcher. I still think about the war regularly because it was so awful, a ridiculous slaughter of people. I joined the Peace Pledge Union, and did cooperative studies with my students. We should have had much more peace studies. By now we should have learned how to avoid war. Edward Bullock, 89
After eight months of bombing London, the sewers were all smashed, rats were running around; you‚Äôd look up and half your house would be gone. I remember the Queen Mother came down and said to us, ‚ÄúI know how you feel, they bombed my house as well.‚Äù She brought us to a little hut and poured us cups of tea. I come from a military family: my eldest brother did six years in the navy and was killed at Normandy. My other brother was on Arctic convoys and he‚Äôs dead, too. I was one of the lucky ones. I was in the air force. People don‚Äôt realise how ill-equipped we were; the German equipment was a thousand times superior to ours. We rounded up 1,000 prisoners in Hamburg and I said to one of them, ‚ÄúWhen you had us surrounded at Dunkirk, you could have wiped us off the face of the earth.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúTo be honest, we couldn‚Äôt stomach killing you, so we shot over your heads.‚Äù Whether that was true or not, I will never know. For me, it‚Äôs important that future generations know what we suffered during that time. I recently went into a school to talk to children, and when I spoke to the older kids, aged about 14 to 15, I told them there was something they could do for me. ‚ÄúI want you to forget about your mobile phones and your laptops and your iPads, just for a short period of time, and join the cadets,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDo not be in the position we were in: unprepared.‚Äù Clifford Guard, 91
I had a good Catholic education in Swansea, but when I was nearly 16, I ran away and joined the British merchant navy. The war was just starting. I was a cabin boy, deck boy, and engine room boy. Then I went to New York, and I met a physician who asked me what I wanted to do with my life. I said I‚Äôd like to become an American sailor, and he said, ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre not a citizen ‚Äì but I can get you in the army.‚Äù And he did. We were getting ready for D-day down in Weymouth. I had two close buddies, one from Pennsylvania, who passed away six months ago, another from Michigan. They protected me whenever we were in action. I‚Äôm here today because of those two guys. I remember fighting on Omaha beach just after D-day. It was absolutely terrible. I got hit in my left knee by a piece of shrapnel. It was just very slight, just a splinter from a mortar, but it floored me. After the war, I stayed in the army of occupation for about six months and then I went back to the US and ended up as a clinical psychologist. It bothered me ‚Äì what I saw, what I did, that I‚Äôd had a .50 calibre machine gun. I wanted to learn more about myself, and I didn‚Äôt turn out such a bad one after all. Tom Schaffer, 89
I was in the 6th Airborne division. I was in the battle of the Ardennes. I never got injured, luckily. It was snowy and very cold. We suffered 61 casualties and withdrew into Holland. We met Russian soldiers in the Baltic and there was plenty of vodka. Every night we would round up all the women, put them in a barn and guard them overnight, so they wouldn‚Äôt get raped by the Russians. On VE Day, we were given the day off, and some of the boys went swimming in the Baltic. One of them didn‚Äôt come back ‚Äì he drowned. Afterwards, I went back to England for one month‚Äôs leave and then straight out to the far east for training ‚Äì where they dropped the two atom bombs. We started infiltrating Java, and headed to Semarang, where people were dying in the streets. So we organised water and food, and when we left they didn‚Äôt want us to go. Before the war, I was a butcher‚Äôs boy. After it all ended, I went back to the shop. I was happy to be back, it was a family business in Winchmore Hill, in north London. I also did 11 years as a National Standard Bearer. I got married ‚Äì my first wife and I divorced, but we‚Äôre still friends. My second wife died of a bee sting in the neck when we were visiting Arnhem in Holland. We‚Äôd been married three and a half weeks. I still think and talk about the war a lot. Other veterans and I meet and have a beer once a month. But I only talk about it when somebody brings it up. Geoffrey Pattinson, 91
In Normandy, we got separated from the main part of the battalion. We managed to catch up with them three days after D-day, and we realised there were only about 200 men left. I got shot in the back of the legs and evacuated to a hospital in England. The day they declared victory, I was back in a place called Wismar, on the Baltic in Germany, guarding the frontiers. We weren‚Äôt celebrating. Inwardly, I was very, very pleased the war was over, but a bit sad about what it cost us to get that freedom. It wasn‚Äôt until 1994 that I went back to Normandy, to pay my respects to those who didn‚Äôt make it. I didn‚Äôt talk about the war at all for 50 years. Nobody ever asked me. It‚Äôs only now that it‚Äôs become talked-about because of the length of time it‚Äôs been ‚Äì the 50th, 60th, the 70th anniversary. The longer it goes on, the fewer veterans there are. I feel very lucky to be here today, to be able to talk about it to people who want to know. I‚Äôll be back for the 80th.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disaster teams have found hundreds more bodies on Friday night and Saturday morning after pulling the overturned river cruise boat upright with cranes and gradually raising it up from the gray currents of the river. Only 14 survivors, one of them the captain, have been found after the ship carrying 456 overturned in what officials called a freak tornado on Monday night. The death toll from the disaster stood at 103 on Friday as authorities commemorated successfully lifting the wreckage from the water. The boat operator apologised for the disaster and said it would cooperate with investigations. Rescuers are searching the cabin of the ship, which was righted on Friday, looking for more bodies, the official People‚Äôs Daily, wrote on its microblog. Jiang Zhao, general manager of the company which operated the Eastern Star, bowed in apology for the disaster during an interview with state media reported late on Friday, saying it would ‚Äúfully‚Äù cooperate with the investigation. Beijing has pledged there would be ‚Äúno cover-up‚Äù in the probe. Police have detained the captain and chief engineer for questioning. An initial investigation found the ship was not overloaded and had enough life vests on board. More than 1,000 family members have come to Jianli in the central province of Hubei, where the ship went down, with many expressing frustration at a lack of information from the government. They accused the government of ‚Äúinhumane‚Äù treatment of bereaved families and many complained they had been spied on and had their movements curtailed by officials who appear nervous at the possibility of unrest.

2015-06-06T01:26:16Z,world,World news,Victorian Sex party leader may table bill to stop anti-abortion protests at clinics,"Following meetings with senior Victorian politicians and police, Australian Sex Party leader, Fiona Patten, will consider introducing a private member‚Äôs bill to the state parliament to stop anti-abortion protesters from gathering outside women‚Äôs health clinics. On Tuesday, Patten met with staff at the Melbourne East police command, who for more than two decades have been called to the East Melbourne fertility clinic in response to calls from protesters, clinic staff and patients. In the past month, she has also met the premier, Daniel Andrews, and opposition leader, Matthew Guy, to discuss the protests. The protesters, from the group Helpers of God‚Äôs Precious Infants, jostle and harass women and staff attending the clinic, preventing them from exiting their cars, and distribute anti-abortion literature, clinic staff have said. Patten told Guardian Australia on Friday that police said they were fed up with the continual disputes. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôd be very supportive of some form of legislative instrument that gave them power to prevent people from standing metres away from the front of the clinic,‚Äù Patten said. ‚ÄúI think Tasmania got it right in legislating to implement exclusion zones around abortion clinics there, and I‚Äôm investigating what I can do, possibly through a private member‚Äôs bill, to introduce similar legislation here.‚Äù In a document obtained from Melbourne city council last week through freedom of information laws, Patten found that the city council lord mayor, Robert Doyle, approached the former Coalition government in 2011 to request an exclusion zone around the east Melbourne clinic. Council‚Äôs approach of using local laws to help women ‚Äúenter and exit without harassment‚Äù had failed, Doyle wrote, adding that an exclusion zone would stop protest activities occurring ‚Äúwithin a small bubble around the clinic‚Äù without altogether stripping them of their freedom to protest. In his response to Doyle in 2012, the former Victorian attorney general Robert Clark wrote he was ‚Äúnot convinced an exclusion zone would be an appropriate solution‚Äù. ‚ÄúExisting law provides a range of remedies for responding to allegations that persons are acting improperly in a protest or harassing other people,‚Äù Clark wrote. ‚ÄúThese remedies include injunctions, criminal charges and on-the-spot notices for breaches of by-laws relating to obstruction or public nuisance.‚Äù Melbourne city council refused to comment on this story. But in a case relating to the clinic before Victoria‚Äôs supreme court this week, a council lawyer said that council staff had no such power to issue injunctions or other penalties to the protesters, unless the protesters were blocking the entry door to the clinic. The only option council had, the court heard, was to investigate complaints against the protesters and then make a recommendation. The council was brought before the court by the clinic, who argued the council had failed to protect women from activities dangerous to their health under the Public Health and Wellbeing Act. Judgment will be handed down at a date yet to be announced. Victoria‚Äôs attorney general, Martin Pakula, would not answer questions about whether the Labor government would support exclusion zones at abortion and fertility clinics. A spokeswoman for Pakula cited the case before the supreme court as the reason, despite that case being between the city council and the clinic, and not involving the government. ‚ÄúWe await the judgment of the case with interest,‚Äù the spokeswoman said. In his response to Guardian Australia the shadow attorney general, John Pesutto, said when in government the Coalition had enacted move-on laws that gave police stronger powers to deal with protesters in all situations, including at abortion clinics. This legislation was repealed by the Labor government after it was elected in November last year, he said. ‚ÄúThe Coalition would welcome the re-introduction of move-on laws of the sort the government repealed,‚Äù he said. However, those move-on laws were never used by police to remove protesters outside the clinic. Melbourne east senior sergeant, Dale Huntington, said police had been responding to the protesters for more than two decades and that moving them on was an ineffective long-term solution. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt stop them from coming back the next day and starting again,‚Äù he said. Police supported the right of people to protest and freedom of expression, Huntington said, adding that women should also be free to get medical treatment without facing harassment. ‚ÄúI know Tasmania has no-go zones in relation to clinics there and it seems that would afford people the right to protest while also allowing people to attend a legal health service,‚Äù he said. Police received complaints from women who had been harassed by the protesters, he said, but few wanted to take the matter before a court. ‚ÄúI understand why,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have most often young ladies who truly don‚Äôt want to be identified, sometimes getting very personal procedures, and going to court and being identified is not appealing.‚Äù Police also received complaints from protesters, he said, who reported women had pushed them or ripped placards out of their hands. He welcomed the issue being put back on the agenda through the case unfolding in the supreme court, and through discussions about the pros and cons of exclusion zones. ‚ÄúIf we continue with the business-as-usual approach, we‚Äôll be in this same situation for another 10 years,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd really, that‚Äôs not good.‚Äù The leader of Helpers of God‚Äôs Precious Childrens‚Äô Melbourne arm, Tanya O‚ÄôBrien, said the group were not protesters, but ‚Äúpetitioners‚Äù. It would not be possible to petition the women from across the road from the clinic, she said. ‚ÄúOur activity is to offer assistance to women and we can‚Äôt do that from across the street,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe seek to establish a personal relationship with the woman and to find out what is causing her to resort to abortion.‚Äù There were no medical or life circumstances where the group would support an abortion, she said. If an exclusion zone were implemented, the group would ‚Äúcross that bridge‚Äù at that time, she said. O‚ÄôBrien rejected reports from clinic staff that women had been traumatised by their activity. In 2001 a clinic security guard was murdered by an anti-abortion protester at the clinic. A 2011 study of 158 women attending the clinic, led by the University of Melbourne, found women on average, ‚Äúwomen indicated considerable distress in participants when exposed to the picketers‚Äù.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Victor Ponta, who has been prime minister since 2012, has refused to resign, saying only parliament could dismiss him, but the president, Klaus Iohannis, called for him to step down yesterday. Iohannis, who beat Ponta in presidential elections in November, said it was ‚Äúan impossible situation for Romania‚Äù. Parliament is due to vote next week on whether or not to lift Ponta‚Äôs immunity from prosecution. If it votes to shield him, political observers predict it will trigger a constitutional crisis, pitting prime minister and parliament against the president and the judiciary. Ponta was called in to the National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA) in Bucharest yesterday, to be presented with an extensive charge sheet. He is accused of filing forged invoices for a total of $45,000 for work he did not do in 2007 and 2008, when he was a lawyer. The DNA statement also said that an investigation would continue into alleged conflict of interest during Ponta‚Äôs term as prime minister, for making his closest business associate a minister. The DNA said there was ‚Äúreasonable suspicion‚Äù of wrongdoing and said it would ask parliament to approve a criminal investigation into Ponti on those charges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-06T00:09:47Z,world,World news,"Love, poetry and war: the Afghan women risking all for verse","The founder of Afghanistan‚Äôs largest women‚Äôs literary society, whose female members regularly put their lives at risk to write poetry documenting sex, rage, war and heartbreak, will be among those speaking at the International Poetry Festival at London‚Äôs Southbank Centre this summer. Kabul-based Mirman Baheer is a pioneering female literary group which enables women to share landays, short two-line poems, traditionally only performed orally, which have long been used by Afghan women as a secretive form of rebellion. Its members span professional women working in government to young girls in isolated rural villages forced to contribute in secret. The society was first brought to the attention of the international community by journalist and poet Eliza Griswold in 2012 ‚Äì this will be the first time she and Mirman Baheer founder Sahira Sharif have spoken together about the group in the UK. They will appear as part of a festival lineup focusing on themes of war, conflict and oppression from poets and performers from across the world. Bringing the work of Mirman Baheer on to the global stage, would be ‚Äútransformative‚Äù, Griswold said, both for the group and for people‚Äôs perceptions of Afghan women. ‚ÄúThese poems are about war, they are about love, they are about drones, they are about American soldiers, they are about sex, they are about the size of a husband‚Äôs manhood ‚Äì they don‚Äôt hold back,‚Äù said Griswold. ‚ÄúThey show a side of the life of Afghan women that is otherwise left hidden and no-one would ever dare to try and reveal. You could call these a protest but they are more than that because they show these women using their feminine power to shame men.‚Äù While oppressive restrictions on women prevent most from being able to openly express opinions on sex and lust, on men, on their family and oppression and suffering, the landays have become powerful outlets for their emotions and anger. Those who are able, gather every week in Kabul to share the couplets, which are only 9 words and 22 syllables, while others in outlying regions call into the society in secret and repeat their landays over the phone. Thanks to the strict conservatism fostered by the Taliban, where singing is still associated with loose morals and poetry is seen as shameful, this puts the women at the risk of punishment or even death if they are discovered. With the support of Sharif and the Mirman Baheer network, Griswold began a project to collect contemporary landays from Afghan women across the country ‚Äì both to preserve them and bring their stories to the world ‚Äì which have been recently published as a volume titled I am the Beggar of the World. As part of the International Poetry Festival, there will be an evening of landays, celebrating how the poems have become a new platform for resistance. Griswold said: ‚ÄúOne of the great gifts about this poetry that it allows us to look out at the world through Afghan eyes, as much as that‚Äôs possible. So we‚Äôre not looking at them, we‚Äôre looking at the world they choose to describe and how they see it.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe landays so exploded any stereotype which I had of Afghan women as mute ghosts. Having worked there for more than a decade, my assumption has always been that I understood the nature of their subjugation better than they did themselves. But that is dangerous assumption and nothing shows that to be more inaccurate than these poems.‚Äù While the popularity of Mirman Baheer is growing, however, Griswold said Afghanistan‚Äôs bleak and uncertain future made her concerned for the women involved. ‚ÄúMy sense is that Mirman Baheer is growing even stronger,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut with the withdrawal of international troops and the possible resurgence of the Taliban, the fear is that as a women‚Äôs organisation they will be one of the first to suffer.‚Äù The International Poetry festival, founded by Ted Hughes in 1967, will this year host 30 poets from more than 10 countries including Iraq, Palestine, Iran and Pakistan. The line-up will also feature a group of Pashto-speaking poets from Pakistan forced to flee after Taliban militants forced them to compose poems glorifying jihad. After settling in a refugee camp, they have begun to reclaim the traditional themes of their craft, and the festival will host three of the poets, Saleem Khan, Zahid Ullah Khan and Dilawar Khan, in the UK for the first time. Southbank Centre‚Äôs Artistic Director Jude Kelly said this year‚Äôs line-up conformed perfectly to Hughes‚Äôs founding philosophy for the festival, that poetry ‚Äúis a universal language of understanding in which we can all hope to meet‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe are particularly privileged to welcome two groups of poets from Afghanistan and Pakistan who share their incredible stories of adversity and highlight the enduring ability of poetry to envisage change and transcend barriers,‚Äù Kelly added. Poetry International will run at Southbank Centre from Thursday 23 to Sunday 26 July. Eliza Griswold and Sahira Sharif will be speaking at Why Afghan Women Risk Their Lives to Write Poetry on 25 July Landays I Call. You‚Äôre stone One day you‚Äôll look and find I‚Äôm gone May God destroy the Taliban and end their wars. They‚Äôve made Afghan women into widows and whores. You sold me to an old man, father May god destroy your home; I was your daughter May your airplane crash and may the pilot die that you are pouring bombs on my beloved Afghanistan. Making love to an old man Is like fucking a shrivelled cornstalk black with mould When sisters sit together, they always praise their brothers. When brothers sit together, they sell their sisters to others. Your eyes aren‚Äôt eyes. They‚Äôre bees. I can find no cure for their sting. My pains grow as my life dwindles, I will die with a heart full of hope. I‚Äôll kiss you in the pomegranate garden. Hush!

2015-06-05T20:03:07Z,world,World news,Mexico's election faces disruption as radical teachers burn ballot papers,"Radical teachers and relatives of Mexico‚Äôs disappeared have vowed to disrupt voting in the country‚Äôs coming national election on Sunday, towards the end of an electoral campaign that has been marked by the murders of candidates amid serious questions about fairness and legitimacy. ‚ÄúWe are ready to install and operate all the polling stations,‚Äù Lorenzo C√≥rdova , the head of the national electoral authorities, told international observers. They are in Mexico to monitor the election that will elect all new members of the lower house of congress, as well as nine new governors and hundreds of new mayors. ‚ÄúBut if the conditions put the physical integrity of our staff, or the voters, in danger we will not do it. We are not responsible for security.‚Äù
C√≥rdova was talking about a group of radical teachers whose efforts to roll back education reform now include a movement that aims to block the working of polling stations in five southern states. The protests are at times violent and have been particularly intense in Oaxaca where the teachers have ejected electoral officials from their offices across the state, burned ballot papers, clashed with the security forces and severely affected the distribution of petrol. In the state of Guerrero, protesters have included relatives of people who have been killed or disappeared in the drug war violence that has ragedin Mexico for the past eight years. There is particularly tension around the town of Tixtla, a centre of protest since 43 students from the Ayotzinapa teachers college in the town disappeared after being attacked by cartel gunmen and municipal police, last September. Local media has reported 21 murders around the country directly associated with the elections. These include three candidates and one would-be candidate, whose beheaded body was dumped beside a message that read ‚Äúthis is going to happen to all the fucking politicians who don‚Äôt get in line‚Äù. Security expert Alejandro Hope said the murders of candidates were the logical consequence of a climate in whichdisparate drug cartels are sowing terror and political vendettas can be hidden behind a tendency to blame all assassinations on organised crime. He also stressed the failure of the authorities to provide protection for candidates.
‚ÄúGiven the prevailing conditions,‚Äù Hope wrote in El Daily Post, ‚Äúthe surprise is not that some candidates get killed, but that the number of corpses is not much higher.‚Äù The credibility of the elections has also been damaged by questions surrounding the ability of the electoral authorities to guarantee fairness. ‚ÄúI cannot think of an election where the reputation of the electoral authorities has been so low,‚Äù said political analyst Federico Estev√©z. ‚ÄúThat does not bode well.‚Äù Much of the criticism has centred on the failure to rein in the Green Party‚Äôs systematic flouting of campaigning rules, such as the amount of political advertising permitted. The Green party, widely alleged to be among the most corrupt in Mexico, is an ally of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) of President, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto.
The fact that no major party is free of allegations of serious corruption has helped give maverick independent candidate Jaime Rodriguez ‚Äì nicknamed El Bronco ‚Äì a shot at winning the governorship of the rich northern state of Nuevo Leon, according to most polls. Elsewhere, however, corruption allegations have prompted a movement to spoil ballot papers. ‚ÄúSpoiling my ballot paper is the only way I can see of stripping the system of legitimacy, shaking it up and reforming it so that it favours citizens,‚Äù national political commentator Denise Dresser said in a YouTube video. For all the signs of crisis, the elections appear set to produce a balance of power that differs little from the one in place since the last time the country voted, in 2012. Polls suggest that the PRI will remain dominant, and with the help of the Greens, could even obtain a majority in congress.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-05T19:03:09Z,world,World news,Tsipras warns G7 leaders time running out to rescue Greece from bankruptcy,"The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has warned that time is running out to rescue the country from the brink of bankruptcy an and exit from the eurozone, ensuring that Greece‚Äôs plight will be a pressing concern for G7 leaders as they gather in Bavaria. With the end of June now regarded as the last possible moment for striking a deal to release the ‚Ç¨7.2bn (¬£5.2bn) in bailout funds that Greece needs to stay afloat, Tsipras struck a defiant tone in a statement before the country‚Äôs parliament, accusing Greece‚Äôs creditors of making ‚Äúabsurd‚Äù demands on his recession-hit country and insisting, ‚Äúthey won‚Äôt humiliate us‚Äù. Tsipras also appealed to the Greek opposition parties ‚Äì and his own Syriza MPs ‚Äì to give their backing to his negotiating stance and reject the latest proposals from the country‚Äôs paymasters. ‚ÄúTime is not only running out for us, it is running out for everyone,‚Äù he warned, adding, ‚ÄúGreek people should be proud because the government is not going to give into absurd proposals.‚Äù He also insisted that a debt restructuring ‚Äì writing off some of the ‚Ç¨320bn that Greece owes ‚Äì must remain on the table. US officials, including the Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, have repeatedly warned their European counterparts not to be complacent about the economic risks of a so-called Grexit, and President Obama is likely to reiterate that argument this weekend. The US president is likely to be particularly concerned that Greece could turn to Russia for aid. Tsipras underlined that risk on Friday by letting it be known he was holding a phone conversation with Russian president Vladimir Putin. In the Greek parliament, Antonis Samaras, leader of the opposition New Democracy party, accused Tsipras of mishandling the negotiations and tipping Greece back into recession. ‚ÄúYou have totally destroyed the country and isolated us,‚Äù he said. Analysts said Tsipras‚Äôs firm public rejection of the creditors‚Äô latest proposal made it hard to envisage a deal emerging. Nick Spiro, of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, said it was, ‚Äúdifficult to see a basis for further negotiation‚Äù, given that Greece and its paymasters were already ‚Äúat daggers drawn‚Äù. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is thought to favour a compromise in the talks between Greece‚Äôs radical leftist government and its lenders, but the International Monetary Fund has argued for a tougher stance. Tsipras went to the Greek parliament to explain his stance last night, after Athens took the risky decision to delay a ‚Ç¨300m payment to the IMF. In a highly charged parliamentary session, Tsipras condemned the proposals tabled at a late-night meeting in Brussels on Wednesday. A leaked draft of those proposals called on Athens to make pensions cuts, raise VAT and cancel the planned repeal of controversial labour market reforms imposed as part of its original bailout deal. All of these demands are unacceptable to Tsipras and to many in his party. He had hoped to return to Brussels to continue negotiations on Friday but a furious response from his Syriza colleagues forced him to remain in Greece and make the case for continuing to engage in the negotiations. Greek share prices were sold off sharply as investors absorbed the news that Athens had refused to make the IMF payment, a decision that emerged after markets closed on Thursday night. The Athens general composite index fell by almost 5%, with banks hit particularly hard. Athens exploited a little-known loophole in IMF rules and announced that it would bundle up four debt repayments into one lump sum at the end of the month. The ratings agency Fitch confirmed on Friday that Greece‚Äôs decision to postpone the payment would not jeopardise its credit rating, which has already been cut to CCC over the course of the crisis. Fitch warned: ‚ÄúThe risk that Greece misses its larger IMF payment at the end of June cannot be discounted,‚Äù adding that Athens‚Äô decision ‚Äúillustrates the pressure that a lack of market or official funding and tight liquidity conditions for Greek banks are putting on Greece‚Äôs sovereign liquidity‚Äù. A group of high-profile economists, including the Nobel prizewinner Joseph Stiglitz and John Maynard Keynes‚Äô biographer Robert Skidelsky, also wrote a letter to the Financial Times calling for Greece to be granted debt forgiveness, starting with an immediate moratorium on repayments in return for economic reforms. ‚ÄúWe think that the whole of Europe will benefit from Greece being given the chance of a fresh start,‚Äù they said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-05T16:03:59Z,world,World news,NSA surveillance: how librarians have been on the front line to protect privacy,"In the hours before US senators voted to take on the might of the National Security Agency this week, their inboxes were deluged with more than 2,200 supportive emails from a most unlikely group of revolutionaries: America‚Äôs librarians. Their contribution to the passage of the USA Freedom Act may not have been as dramatic as the revelations of Edward Snowden, but this mild-mannered wing of the privacy lobby has been stridently campaigning against government surveillance since long before the NSA whistleblower shot to fame. The first politician to discover the danger of underestimating what happens when you have thousands of librarians on your case was attorney general John Ashcroft who, in 2003, accused the American Library Association of ‚Äúbaseless hysteria‚Äù and ridiculed their protests against the Patriot Act. US libraries were once protected from blanket requests for records of what their patrons were reading or viewing online, but the legislation rushed through after after 9/11 threatened to wreck this tradition of confidentiality in ways that presaged later discoveries of bulk telephone and internet record collection. In 2005, four librarians from Connecticut also successfully fought a FBI request to use national security letters to seize reading records and hard-drives, forcing the government to drop the case and back off. ‚ÄúWhen people were asked ‚Äòwho do you trust, some librarian, or the attorney general?‚Äô, they said ‚ÄòI trust my librarian‚Äô,‚Äù recalls Emily Sheketoff, head of the ALA‚Äôs Washington office. ‚ÄúYou can throw the attorney general up against us and we beat him because we are the ones spending every morning doing story time with your toddlers and we are the ones ‚Äì when you have been given a devastating health report ‚Äì who help you find information on what this means,‚Äù she adds. ‚ÄúThere is this close, close relationship with people and their library.‚Äù Such boosterism might be dismissed as civic nostalgia in the age of Google, but the evolution of libraries from print depositories to digital gateways has put the ALA in the rare position of being one of the few large lobby groups in Washington representing consumers of information rather than producers. ‚ÄúLibrarians were the original search engine,‚Äù claims ALA government relations head Adam Eisgrau. ‚ÄúAs advocates [for consumers in digital copyright disputes] we were not just on the barricades, we helped erect the barricades.‚Äù There is no doubt that the risks to personal liberty from having one‚Äôs library card or community internet terminal confiscated are small scale compared with the collection of hundreds of millions of phone records or domestic internet surveillance exposed by Snowden. Yet it is the library‚Äôs traditional, and dare one say humdrum, place in American life that perhaps gave the ALA such outsize lobbying clout when it came to making broader arguments about the importance of privacy. ‚ÄúBecause we have this history and it‚Äôs our core value, there was no question we were going to be at the forefront,‚Äù argues Sheketoff.
‚ÄúWe are able to have the influence we have not because we contribute one dime to anybody‚Äôs campaign but because we have the grassroots: we have librarians and library supporters in every congressional district who call and contact their member of Congress.‚Äù And when librarians fought to protect, for example, the identity of a reader who had scrawled notes in the margin of a biography of Osama bin Laden they weren‚Äôt just making arguments about consumer confidentiality. ‚ÄúThe reason we feel this is so important is we feel there is a direct tie to democracy: unless people feel free to investigate and read, and now, look at websites, so they can see for themselves what is going on, they cannot truly be a good citizen and they cannot oversee the government,‚Äù adds Sheketoff. Or as Eisgrau puts it: ‚ÄúFreedom of thought is an absolute prerequisite to the freedom of speech, and freedom of inquiry is an absolute prerequisite to freedom of thought.‚Äù From other trade groups, such claims might sound pompous, but the thousands of ALA members who have lobbied Congress or picketed speeches by security hawks like Ashcroft are neither easily roused nor easily dismissed. ‚ÄúI say this with the greatest affection about our grassroots, but they are a little unusual in that there are some organisations where people read an alert and lunge for their phones or their keyboards,‚Äù adds Eisgrau. ‚ÄúLibrarians are not lungers. And this is a strength; they want to know what it is they are advocating about.‚Äù It is, acknowledges the ALA, the paradox that explains this stereotypically meek profession‚Äôs surprisingly kick-ass reputation on civil liberties. ‚ÄúWe are fearsome defenders of our patrons,‚Äù says Sheketoff. ‚ÄúBut we are fearful of government overstep.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They talk of the roads that have been resurfaced, the bridge that has been reinforced ‚Äì reportedly so that it can bear the weight of Obama‚Äôs armoured car, ‚Äúthe Beast‚Äù ‚Äì as well as the helipad that has been built to take six helicopters at one time, the laying down of new cables for water, electricity and broadband because summit regulation states there should be two of each in the event of an emergency. ‚ÄúIt is sheer craziness,‚Äù says Tessy L√∂dermann, who runs a local animal sanctuary. She said the entire community was astounded a few months ago to hear Angela Merkel announce that the summit of world leaders would meet in their narrow valley. Garmisch-Partenkirchen has been spruced up for the event, with everything from renovated railway platforms and roads to new fire engines for the five communities closest to the Schloss.
For days now the manhole covers have been sealed. Locals are controlled by police wherever they go and have been told to remove any flower boxes or woodpiles that are out on the street. There‚Äôs a virtual ban on hiking in the local forests, and hang-gliding. Indeed, flying of any kind ‚Äì of private planes, kites, helium balloons or drones ‚Äì is strictly forbidden. Police thinly disguised as hikers have been patrolling the forests for months, habitually stopping mountain bikers and ramblers and asking for their ID, while the local ice-skating rink has been commandeered as the press centre for the 5,000 accredited reporters. Garmisch-Partenkirchners are decidedly annoyed. ‚ÄúLocals have joked that this was Merkel‚Äôs revenge for the fact that our farmers voted against hosting the 2018 Winter Olympics here, saying they would block their land,‚Äù L√∂dermann says. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs rubbish, but it‚Äôs what people are saying.‚Äù The biggest gripe among the 26,000 locals has been the proposal to site a protest camp on a meadow provided by a local tavern owner. Towards the end of the 16th century, Garmisch-Partenkirchen either garrotted or burned at the stake more than 10% of its own population, mainly as a punishment for crop failure or disease. So it was perhaps little of a surprise when at one recent town hall meeting, farmers threatened to odeln ‚Äì or spread liquid manure ‚Äì on the fields if the camp was allowed, openly expressing their fear that protesters might set fire to their haystacks. Last week, authorities banned the camp, citing the difficulties they would have rescuing demonstrators in case of flooding. Protest groups and opposition politicians accused the authorities of crying wolf, seeing it as a desperate ruse by scared local leaders to keep the demonstrators out. A Munich court lifted the ban with just days to go, amid fears the ruling might exacerbate protesters‚Äô already pent-up anger, and by Friday morning, about 600 demonstrators had already pitched their tents. In return for permission to camp there, protesters have to agree to abide by a set of rules, including to not drink spirits and to recycle their rubbish. Weapons or anything that might be used as a weapon will not be allowed on site. Benjamin Ru√ü, of the protest alliance group Stop G7 Elmau, described the scene as calm and the mood good. ‚ÄúThe infrastructure is in place, the Alpine panorama is amazing,‚Äù he said. And despite resistance shown by some residents, others ‚Äúhave been providing us with donations of food and money‚Äù, he said. Thousands of anti-poverty campaigners from around the world are expected to gather in Munich on Saturday for a jamboree of music and entertainment organised by ONE and Global Citizen. Under the banner United Against Poverty, they will hope to impress upon G7 leaders the importance of putting poverty at the centre of their discussions. Among several protests planned in Garmisch-Partenkirchen is a march up to Schloss Elmau, though seven-metre-high chicken coop wire has been wrapped around the forests surrounding the castle. The 17,000 police guarding the area, some on horseback, are likely to stop protesters from getting close. While most protest groups have ruled out violence, police have warned that some groups at the centre of rioting that took place at the March opening of the new European Central Bank headquarters in Frankfurt, will be present, so anything is possible.
Metal shipping-style containers that have been hired from France, the Czech Republic and Austria, have been turned into makeshift prisons that can hold up to 200 protesters, according to the police. A guided tour around one last week revealed carpeted floors, a playroom for children, as well as the plan to provide a welcome gift of a free chocolate bar to anyone who ends up in a cell. Hundreds of prosecutors and lawyers will also be on hand. Locals say although attempts have been made by police and politicians to put them at their ease, they are still ready to take control if they feel in any way threatened, and have made sure the protesters know that they have supplies of manure at the ready.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-05T15:06:37Z,world,World news,'Mossad talked of killing Khomeini': an interview with a former agent,"Thirty-three years after he left the Mossad, Israel‚Äôs external intelligence arm, one memory sometimes wakes Yossi Alpher at four in the morning. What if Mossad had agreed to a request in early 1979 to kill Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, then still in exile near Paris? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible to answer,‚Äù Alpher said in an interview. ‚ÄúBut there is a case to be made for the centrality of very charismatic leaders, and so for the consequences of their disappearance.‚Äù Alpher relates the bare bones of incident in his recent book Periphery: Israel‚Äôs Search for Middle East Allies. He was summoned by Mossad head Yitzhak Hofi and told that Mossad‚Äôs Tehran representative, Eliezar Shafrir, had received a plea to assassinate Khomeini from Shapour Bakhtiar, appointed caretaker prime minister by the Shah to head off growing protests. Another official present gave a negative reply: if Khomeini returned to Iran, he‚Äôd be dealt with by the army and the Shah‚Äôs security police, Savak. Alpher took a deep breath and suggested: ‚ÄúWe simply don‚Äôt know enough about what Khomeini stands for, and what his chance are, to justify the risk.‚Äù Underestimating Khomeini was a failure not just of Mossad, but of the United States, Britain, and Savak itself. Knowing what he knows now, what advice would Alpher have offered? ‚ÄúIf the conversation had been a few months later, I would have said it‚Äôs worth the risk,‚Äù Alpher said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying the head of Mossad would have decided differently had I offered a different opinion, but it‚Äôs an incident that stays with me.‚Äù
In power, the revolutionaries quickly revealed their intentions. ‚ÄúWe saw how they dealt with the rest of the opposition, all the executions, and we got an appreciation of their determination,‚Äù said Alpher. ‚ÄúThey made no bones of their plans to export revolution...Bakhtiar had apparently understood all this, but we didn‚Äôt know Bakhtiar and we certainly didn‚Äôt know the clergy. We just didn‚Äôt get it.‚Äù Alpher‚Äôs riveting book - based on experience and a raft of interviews - surveys a ‚ÄúPeriphery Doctrine‚Äù developed in 1957-8 in the office of prime minister, David Ben Gurion, through which Israel found regional allies against the hostile ‚ÄúArab core‚Äù of states led by Egypt under Gamal Abdul Nasser. ‚ÄúThe Mossad is under the prime minister, there is no anomaly whatsoever in the fact that Ben Gurion the prime minister assigned this task to the Mossad,‚Äù Alpher explained. ‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt skirting the foreign ministry. These were secret relations and that‚Äôs the job of the Mossad, which reports to the prime minister.‚Äù Mossad operatives like Alpher courted both countries and ethnic or religious minorities within them. These variously included Ethiopia, Sudan, Morocco and Greece as well as Lebanese Maronites, Iraq‚Äôs Kurds, and the south Sudanese. Mossad operatives were in northern Iraq training Kurdish fighters for the battles with Saddam Hussein‚Äôs Iraq, until the Shah pulled the plug, ending support for the Kurdish rebellion with his 1975 Algiers agreement with Saddam. The ‚Äúflagship‚Äù of Israel‚Äôs search for Middle Eastern allies was Trident, an intelligence alliance with Turkey and Iran from the late 1950s. With Iran this lasted until the 1979 Revolution, and with Turkey until prime minister Recep Erdogan took a distance from Israel around 2009. ‚ÄúThe head of our trade mission in Tehran was a highly experienced ambassador,‚Äù notes Alpher. ‚ÄúHe had access to the shah, but he didn‚Äôt have [formal] rank, he was never invited to diplomatic cocktails, because the Iranians wanted a degree of deniability [about their relationship with Israel] vis-a-vis the Arabs.‚Äù
Overall, the periphery doctrine waned in the 1980s with progress in peace talks with ‚Äòcore‚Äô Arab states and apparently the Palestinians, before re-emerging after 2010 in a different guise as Israel confronted not hostile Arab states but various strains of militant Islamism. ‚ÄúToday if you want to define a hostile ring, it‚Äôs more amorphous: first and foremost non-state actors, Hezbollah, Hamas; and now potentially Daesh [Islamic State] and Jabhat al-Nusra [the Syrian militant group allied to al-Qaeda],‚Äù Alpher said. ‚ÄúThere is a fluid, revolutionary situation all around us that requires us to be on our toes, to look at the area as a mosaic and be ready to jump from one square to another to exploit out interests. Further afield we find Iran and Turkey ‚Äì Iran definitely as a supporter of Hezbollah, while Turkey is more difficult to define as part of a hostile ring ... [as despite diplomatic strains its] trade [with Israel] is booming. ‚Äù So who does Israel regard as the bigger threat? The axis of Iran, Hezbollah and the Syrian regime of president Bashar al-Assad? Or the militant Sunni Muslim groups, including the Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra? ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre both as bad,‚Äù said Alpher. ‚ÄúIn fact if you have to attach urgency to the task of dealing with one or the other, the more urgent task would be Hezbollah and Iran - Assad has almost become a passive player here. They continue to proclaim that we‚Äôre their immediate enemy, whereas Daesh doesn‚Äôt talk about us. Undoubtedly as Islamic fanatics they want to get rid of us but they have a long hit-list ahead of us.‚Äù Facing the hostile ring, Israel has built links with Azerbaijan, Rumania, Greece and Cyprus, and has expanded trade with Russia, China and India. This reflects Israel‚Äôs strength compared to the 1950s when the periphery doctrine evolved, said Alpher: ‚ÄúWe have more options, we no longer have our backs to the wall.‚Äù There is also the matter of Israel‚Äôs relationship with the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, which are as ‚Äòsecret‚Äô as the Shah‚Äôs oil exports to Israel. ‚ÄúBibi [Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister] got up in the UN a year and half ago and proclaimed it [Isreal‚Äôs links with the Gulf Arab states],‚Äù said Alpher. ‚ÄúHe said it very openly. How much substance there is to this relationship is another question, but at least there‚Äôs something to it. And yet it‚Äôs ambivalent because they [the Gulf Arab states] have a hand in cresting these organisations [Isis and Jabhat al-Nusra], and they still do if you take a look at what‚Äôs going on in Idlib [the province in north-west Syria mainly held by Jabhat al-Nusra] and so forth.‚Äù There is also trade between Turkey and the Gulf Arab states going through Israel because it can no longer go safely through Iraq and Syria. ‚ÄúTurkish lorries drive from Haifa [the Israel port] to the Beit She‚Äôan valley into Jordan, to bring Turkish exports to the Arabian peninsular. The Turkish licence plates are on their trucks, they arrive by ferry and they keep going. It‚Äôs been happening for several years and there is a huge commercial interest in some sort of status quo.‚Äù Alpher is downbeat about Iran. His book has a chapter on what he calls ‚Äúperiphery nostalgia‚Äù, the belief in Israel that better relations could return either by the authorities in Tehran changing or being removed. This has faded since the 1980s when Israel sent arms during the war with Iraq, although Alpher detects an ‚Äúequivalent‚Äù today within the Obama administration. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre saying do this nuclear deal with [president Hassan] Rouhani and [foreign minister Mohammad Javad] Zarif and it will empower them to moderate Iranian political life to the benefit of everyone, Iranians and non-Iranians,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI hope they succeed. I don‚Äôt object to having ten years without having to worry about an Iranian nuclear weapon, but what bothers me is that they tend to translate this into a tolerance on the ground for Iran‚Äôs drive for regional hegemony, in Iraq, in Syria and perhaps in Yemen.‚Äù Perhaps it could all have been different. Shafrir, Mossad‚Äôs former man in Tehran, and Alpher live today near each other in Tel Aviv. ‚ÄúWe meet at the swimming pool,‚Äù said Alpher. ‚ÄúAnd, yes, we chat.‚Äù This article was amended on 6 June 2015 to reflect that Shafrir was not the official who replied to Bakhtiar‚Äôs request.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-05T14:36:59Z,world,World news,"The Red Cross, Haiti and the 'black hole' of accountability for international aid","International aid groups largely operate in a ‚Äúblack hole‚Äù of accountability, charity watchdogs have said, as fresh allegations emerged this week of the Red Cross‚Äôs misrepresentations of its accomplishments after Haiti‚Äôs devastating earthquake in 2010. Officials at nonprofit watchdogs were not surprised by a ProPublica and NPR investigation which found the Red Cross had misrepresented its efforts in Haiti and delivered only a portion of the $488m it raised to Haitians, in spite of a pledge to give ‚Äú91 cents‚Äù of every dollar. The Red Cross disputes the report, saying the accusations are overblown and unfair characterizations of a program beset by the challenges that all aid groups face in Haiti. But the organization has faced accusations of mismanagement before, including withholding funds after 9/11, delays of emergency supplies after hurricane Katrina and disarrayed and selective relief after hurricane Sandy. Indeed, members of Congress are currently waiting for the results of an audit into the American Red Cross‚Äôs disaster relief efforts. Experts said there are virtually no ways to monitor how nonprofits operate, nor for governments or disaster victims to hold them accountable for deliberate or accidental mismanagement. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of waste and abuse that‚Äôs allowed to go on just because there is no accountability,‚Äù said Daniel Borochoff, president of the nonprofit CharityWatch. They exist in ‚Äúa black hole‚Äù of accountability, he said, especially in the realm of international grants. Tobias Pfutze, a professor of development economics at Florida International University, said that nonprofits have much weaker disclosure rules compared with for-profit or government organizations, and that a huge gap divides donors from their programs. ‚ÄúWhen any kind of government program screws up in the US, you‚Äôll very quickly hear about it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut when it comes to foreign aid, the people there have virtually no way to tell the taxpayer or donor whether the money reaches them or whether they‚Äôre satisfied with services. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very difficult to hold these organizations to account in a political sense or with their purse strings.‚Äù In 2013 Congress opened an investigation into the Red Cross, prompted by the problems of earlier disaster relief programs. Jennifer Ashley, a spokesperson for the Government Accountability Office, said that the agency‚Äôs audit will look at ‚Äúthe nature and extent of the Red Cross‚Äô disaster-related services‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat external oversight‚Äù of those services exists. She said that the agency expects to complete the report this summer. A spokesperson for Iowa senator Chuck Grassley, who has for more than a decade called for clearer accounting of Red Cross finances and programs, said the senator is ‚Äúconcerned about the latest report‚Äù. ‚ÄòTextbook examples‚Äô and hidden results The issues described in the Red Cross report, such as a lack of Haitian staff, an inability to navigate Haitian law, and a lack of expertise were ‚Äúalmost textbook examples‚Äù of problems that entangle foreign aid work, Pfutze said. ‚ÄúThey just had accumulated so much money earmarked for Haiti that they essentially started doing development work that they were not prepared for,‚Äù Pfutze said. ‚ÄúYou would think that good charities would want accountability,‚Äù Borochoff said, ‚Äúbecause other groups are doing bad things and it would make them look better, but they often don‚Äôt want to tell you what specifically they‚Äôre distributing.‚Äù Watchdogs and investigators take particular issue with how aid organizations often report their spending in broad, vague categories such as ‚Äúhousing and shelter‚Äù and ‚Äúmedical supplies‚Äù. Those categories can variously lump together everything from temporary camps and housing repairs to tissues and snacks. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not looking for an itemized receipt,‚Äù said Sanda Miniutti, a vice-president of another industry watchdog, Charity Navigator. ‚ÄúBut there should be a greater level of detail than they have given. ‚ÄúIt really goes beyond the Red Cross,‚Äù Borochoff said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt really know overall who‚Äôs doing what, and how resources are best being used, and whether serious needs are being taken care of .‚Äù ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll itemize how much was spent on office supplies and then it‚Äôll be $15m in unidentified stuff sent to Africa or the Pacific islands. Can‚Äôt you get more specific? Can‚Äôt you describe it?‚Äù The ‚Äòhumanitarian industry‚Äô The Red Cross retains good but qualified ratings from CharityWatch and Charity Navigator: the former ranks the group so high because of its huge and successful blood program; the latter has placed it on a watchlist and links to media reports of mismanagement. Other aid organizations have also landed on the watchlist, including the Clinton Foundation, another major player in Haiti. The foundation has recently come under fire for a perceived lack of transparency and nature of its donations. Most often, charities prove less criminal than careless, though many have been found to be both. In the US, regulation and law enforcement usually stays at the state level, though a handful land in the crosshairs of federal law enforcement every year. In May the Federal Trade Commission and all 50 states charged four cancer charities with committing fraud worth more than $187m. But abroad, the people on the receiving end of foreign aid have little to no recourse when interventions go horribly wrong, as they did during the Haiti cholera outbreak, which was suspected to have been caused by UN teams. The Red Cross is more accountable than most of its peers: although an independent, tax-exempt nonprofit, it also has a congressional charter and a status of ‚Äúfederal instrumentality‚Äù. Its reports annually to congressional committees, and a spokesperson for the Red Cross said that it also ‚Äúregularly respond[s]‚Äù to questions from members of Congress. And although fiscal restraint is not a hallmark of the US Defense Department, it has some oversight over the Red Cross; the US army performs an audit of its financial filings every year. Jonathan M Katz, a freelance journalist and author of a book about the 2010 earthquake, The Big Truck That Went By, said that the ‚Äúhumanitarian industry‚Äù should be treated like any other for-profit business. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a mistake to look at these charities as purveyors of goodness,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou have to look at them as what they are, which is a business. People have very nice careers and retire with pensions from these groups. ‚ÄúAnd when you give $25 to the American Red cross, you‚Äôre not necessarily buying a saved life. You might be buying a good feeling, or $25 to keep the Red Cross in business, or some of that may go to help relief. But we should evaluate the industry on how it does its work.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-05T14:27:52Z,world,World news,Tokyo cracks down on red-light district hawkers in pre-Olympics cleanup,"It is still early on a humid weekday evening but already this cabaret club in Tokyo‚Äôs Kabukicho district is in full swing. At 20-minute intervals a different hostess arrives, takes her place next to her customer and goes to work: pouring drinks, lighting cigarettes and engaging in small talk. The lights dim and the chatter is interrupted by a troupe of female dancers whose routine only occasionally borders on the risqu√©. This is one of Kabukicho‚Äôs more respectable hostess clubs, where men and women come to do nothing more than unwind over deftly mixed whisky and water. But just a few metres away outside on Kabukicho‚Äôs neon-lit streets, touts prey on inebriated salarymen and tourists wandering the streets of Japan‚Äôs biggest red-light district. As Tokyo prepares to host the Olympics in five years‚Äô time, police and businesses are finally getting serious about cleaning up the capital‚Äôs notorious adult playground amid a surge in scamming and aggressive hawking. In the first four months of this year, police received almost at least 1,000 complaints about bottakuri, or bill-padding, in Kabukicho hostess bars and sex clubs, the public broadcaster NHK said ‚Äì 10 times the number reported in the same period last year. The embarrassment that once prevented victims from coming forward is giving way to anger about their treatment by unscrupulous club operators. Typically, the scam artists approach customers with promises of an hour of unlimited drinks and the company of scantily clad hostesses for a few thousand yen. When the customer attempts to leave, he is charged many times more and intimidated by male staff until he pays up. When challenged, the clubs deny having any business ties with the hawkers who bring customers to their doors. In recent months there has also been a rise in the number of people who claim they were robbed or tricked into paying huge bills after having their drinks spiked, prompting the US embassy to warn its nationals to take precautions. Mototsugu Katagiri, chairman of the Kabukicho merchants‚Äô association, conceded that the area‚Äôs sleazy image was hard to shake. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to erase the atmosphere of the Kabukicho I knew when I was younger, but just force out the bad places,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe want this to be a place where Japanese people and foreign tourists alike can come, have a drink and enjoy themselves in safety. It will take time, but we‚Äôve made a start.‚Äù Tourist numbers to Japan are rising due to a weaker yen and fading concern about the Fukushima nuclear meltdown. On a recent evening, groups of Chinese visitors ambled along Kabukicho‚Äôs narrow backstreets as a public address system issued multilingual warnings about hawkers and overcharging. With another surge in foreign visitors expected as the city prepares to host the Olympics, businesses say they are determined to drive out aggressive touts and scammers. Last year they enlisted hotel concierges in their campaign. Now about 60 members of the Kabukicho concierge association dispense advice on reasonably priced bars and restaurants, and will even point guests in the direction of adult entertainment clubs that have been vetted for safety, including a handful of local ‚Äúsoaplands‚Äù that accept non-Japanese clientele. ‚ÄúIf one of our customers is ripped off, it reflects badly on the hotel,‚Äù said Toshimi Hirano, chief concierge manager at the 970-room Hotel Gracery Shinjuku. ‚ÄúOur business depends on repeat guests, so we want them to have a trouble-free stay and go home with only good memories.‚Äù The 600 sq metre neighbourhood, a short walk from Shinjuku railway station ‚Äì the world‚Äôs busiest ‚Äì started life as a travellers‚Äô rest stop in the 1700s and was destroyed by a US bombing raid towards the end of the second world war. In the postwar period it reinvented itself as an entertainment district centred on the Koma theatre, which was torn down seven years ago. Today it encompasses the myriad tiny bars of Golden Gai as well as the world‚Äôs biggest concentration of gay bars ‚Äì both colourful reminders of Tokyo‚Äôs eclectic drinking scene. But it is the hawkers who operate along the streets that stand in the shadow of a giant replica of Godzilla, a local ‚Äúresident‚Äù, that have prompted the latest crackdown. Of the estimated 4,500 bars, restaurants and clubs in the district, about 100 are considered unsafe, according to Katagiri. And amid a crackdown on traditional sources of income for Japan‚Äôs yakuza mobsters, bottakuri has become a new and lucrative earner for organised crime syndicates. ‚ÄúFirst there were just a few hawkers, but when they proved how profitable it could be, lots of others followed. Now it‚Äôs spiralling out of control,‚Äù said Kouichi Teratani, an authority on the area, who is leading efforts to improve its image. In one recent high-profile case, the manager of a Kabukicho hostess club was arrested for allegedly threatening two male customers by refusing to allow them to leave the premises until they paid 240,000 yen (¬£1,250). Some clubs try to resist legal action by printing menus showing their exorbitant prices and placing them where they can‚Äôt easily be seen in what are usually dimly lit premises, according to Teratani, whose group has produced tens of thousands of booklets in Japanese and English promoting safe establishments. The pre-Olympics cleanup coincides with the area‚Äôs gradual gentrification, linked to the opening this spring of a 12-screen cinema complex and a 30-storey hotel that dominates the skyline. So far this year, 1,500 hotel rooms have opened in Kabukicho, and a similar number will be added by the end of the year, many of them aimed at visitors from Asia on package tours. ‚ÄúThe aim is to strike a balance between the gritty, slightly risqu√© Kabukicho and a new, safe version that appeals to foreign tourists,‚Äù Teratani said. Brett Bull, whose Tokyo Reporter website covers all aspects of Japan‚Äôs sleazy underbelly, said: ‚ÄúAs with Tokyo in general, the possibility of being assaulted or physically harmed is fairly small. But if you are a tourist or unaware of the ripoff problem, you could be susceptible.‚Äù He and other Kabukicho aficionados say that if in doubt, enter bars and clubs that are visible from the street. ‚ÄúI always like to pick a street-level place that I have some familiarity with,‚Äù Bull said. ‚ÄúWatching all the touts, hosts and other Kabukicho denizens stroll past is a great way to spend a couple of hours.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-05T13:57:16Z,world,World news,Bank urges action to close boardroom gender gap in Africa,"Women make up just 14% of the boards of major African companies and urgent action is needed to close the gender gap, according to the African Development Bank (AfDB). ‚ÄúTo break the ‚Äòglass ceiling‚Äô in Africa, we urgently need to bring women on corporate boards, which we can do by fast-tracking them through middle and senior management in the private sector,‚Äù said Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi, the bank‚Äôs special envoy on gender. ‚ÄúWe need to think and act differently and invest markedly in women‚Äôs leadership.‚Äù The first study of female board membership in Africa was launched by the AfDB during this week‚Äôs World Economic Forum on Africa in Cape Town, South Africa. It measured 2013 data for 307 companies in 12 African countries and found that just one in seven board members is female. The African countries with the highest percentage of women on boards are Kenya (19.8%), South Africa (17.4%), Botswana (16.9%), Zambia (16.9%) and Ghana (17.7%). The companies with the highest percentage of women on boards are East Africa Breweries of Kenya (45.5%), followed by two South African firms, Impala Platinum Holdings (38.5%) and Woolworths Holdings (30.8%). To increase female representation, the AfDB recommends that publicly listed companies should be forced to say how many women are in senior positions and quotas should be introduced. It adds that women should be speedily promoted though middle and senior management, and calls for greater investment in women‚Äôs leadership. The report, entitled Where are the Women? Inclusive Boardrooms in Africa‚Äôs Top-Listed Companies, revealed the best-performing sectors for gender parity are the financial services, basic materials and construction, and automotive industries. With women making up 14.4% of the boards of blue-chip companies, Africa is still ahead of other emerging regions, including Asia-Pacific (9.8%), Latin America (5.6%) and the Middle East (1%). It trails behind Europe (18%) and the US (16.9%). But there is ‚Äúa distance to go to make sure [Africa‚Äôs] strong economic growth includes its most talented women at the top,‚Äù the report says. The AfDB said it has a five-year gender strategy focusing on economic empowerment, knowledge management and capacity building, and legal status and property rights. It recently unveiled its first gender equality index for Africa with praise for Rwanda, which has 64% female representation in public service, including parliament ‚Äì the highest proportion in the world. At an event entitled Africa Rising, Women Leading hosted by Merrill Lynch in South Africa earlier this year, Ory Okolloh, a Kenyan internet entrepreneur and commentator, told delegates: ‚ÄúOpen up your mind to what you can do ... Being very secure with the fact I have a lot to give in a spectrum of things. ‚ÄúMen do that without any issue at all. Men wake up and their starting position is, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm awesome‚Äô. I think starting from a position of confidence is one of the most important things I‚Äôve learned. We talk ourselves out of a lot of things whereas male colleagues talk themselves into things.‚Äù Bola Adesola, the managing director of Standard Chartered Bank in Nigeria, said data shows that organisations led by women were more profitable and options such as maternity leave improved productivity. ‚ÄúMany more of us should be sending the elevator back down,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúSomeone sent the elevator down for me.‚Äù In the UK, women now hold 23.5% of FTSE-100 directorships, almost double the number in 2011 when the government-backed target was set, but just 18% of FTSE-250 firms. Only 8.6% of all executive roles on FTSE-100 companies are held by women.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-05T13:53:52Z,world,World news,"G7 Bavaria summit: 26 hours of climate, trade and Ebola talks ‚Äì and an oompah band","When Angela Merkel gathers six other world leaders in a Bavarian castle for G7 talks, they will face a heavy agenda, with 26 hours to cover everything from climate change and foreign trade to plastic waste and female empowerment. During the weekend there will be some opera to lighten the load, performed by a star singer flown in for the occasion, as well as spectacular Alpine scenery to help inspire Merkel and her guests as they try to come up with solutions for some of the world‚Äôs most pressing problems in their 1,000-metre-high mountain retreat. More than 17,000 police dotted throughout the surrounding thick forests and below in the valley have the job of protecting the leaders of Germany, France, Britain, Japan, Canada, Italy and the United States from terrorists ‚Äì and from the tens of thousands of protesters who are expected to descend on the nearby town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The German chancellor has staunchly rejected claims that, at an estimated ‚Ç¨200m (¬£150m) mostly of taxpayers‚Äô money, Sunday‚Äôs summit is too expensive as well as lacking in rationale ‚Äì since countries such as China and India are not involved ‚Äì and too elitist, the latter view only enhanced by the choice of the heavily guarded Schloss Elmau castle, 60 miles south of Munich, as the venue.
The costs do not include those that the individual leaders will clock up themselves, which in the case of Barack Obama, who is bringing an entourage of 2,000, will be considerable. The protesters in the valley complain that it is an exclusive political club of leading industrial countries, taking place at the expense of those countries who are not invited as well as ordinary citizens. But Merkel defended the encounter. ‚ÄúFor us what‚Äôs important are the consequences of globalisation both at home and in foreign lands, because it‚Äôs a process we‚Äôd like to happen in a just fashion,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe G7 seizes on central challenges that have a global relevance and are important for many people.‚Äù The seriousness with which she is taking the meeting is reflected in the visits she has made before the event, to Ottawa, Washington, London, Paris, Rome and Tokyo, to make clear to her counterparts early on what her expectations are. Responsible for preparing the meeting are high-level diplomats known as sherpas (so-called because they guide the leaders to their destinations), scurrying around in last-minute talks trying to hammer out deals on every item, in agreements that will then form communiques. Merkel is only too aware that the results of the gathering have the potential to considerably enhance or sully her legacy. The items on the agenda have been thrashed out behind the scenes over the past 18 months or more in intensive discussions, many of which Merkel attended. Certain topics like climate change, energy and the global economy are considered obvious ones for the G7 to tackle. Others, like the crises in Ukraine, Greece, Syria, sanctions against Russia and even the dramatic events unfolding at Fifa, are so pressing they are unavoidable. A third category consists of topics that work their way on to the agenda because they are considered particularly important to the current holder of the G7 presidency, in this case Germany and Merkel. In 2015 these include the empowerment of women, health issues such as Ebola, marine pollution, energy efficiency and retail and supply chain standards. ‚ÄúWe all recall with horror the events in Bangladesh,‚Äù Merkel said this week, in reference to the 2013 collapse of the Rana Plaza factory near Dhaka in what was the deadliest disaster in the history of the garment industry, claiming more than 1,000 lives. Another item on the agenda that Merkel has indicated is close to her heart ‚Äì not just as a politician but also as a former research scientist ‚Äì is the growth of antimicrobial resistance and how it is hampering the efficacy of antibiotics. Merkel has said in off-the-record briefings with journalists that the issue is crying out for a political solution on a global level, and is therefore perfect for the G7.
Closely linked to that is the issue of how to tackle the next health epidemic, drawing on the lessons learned from Ebola and Sars and focusing on the growing threat of Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers). The world‚Äôs leading experts on these topics, handpicked by Bill Gates at the request of Merkel, were invited for talks with her in Berlin in the weeks leading up to the summit. Based on their recommendations, Germany will propose that other G7 leaders sign up to plans to radically reform the World Health Organisationto make it better able to respond to health crises, including the establishment of an emergency medical reserve corps that could rapidly respond to future epidemics. ‚ÄúThis is a crucial conference for the future of global health,‚Äù said Jeremy Farrar, professor of tropical medicine at Oxford University and the director of the Wellcome Trust, who was involved in the pre-summit talks with Merkel. ‚ÄúThis is the first time this issue has been at this level of prominence, and it‚Äôs largely thanks to Angela Merkel who has really pushed for it and has put her reputation on the line by doing so.‚Äù But where Merkel‚Äôs reputation will arguably be most at stake and where the summit‚Äôs biggest sticking point is likely to lie is on climate change and the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, an area where, despite past pledges, very little progress has been made since 2008. Ideally this G7 will pave the way for a global climate agreement to be reached at the UN climate conference scheduled for December in Paris. But with the US unclear on its stance and Canada and Japan blocking the long-term goal to decarbonise global energy systems, probably no issue is as controversial as this one. Germany, with its a reputation as a worldwide pioneer in tackling the energiewende, or switch to renewables, and having in Merkel a leader who has not only served as environment minister but, due to her background as a physicist, is known to thoroughly understand the issues, could give new dynamism to the debate. However, Greenpeace said Germany could find itself in the embarrassing position of not fulfilling its own target of reducing greenhouse gas by 40% by 2020. Its huge dependence on coal, and the strong opposition to change from both the coal industry and trade unions, makes the prospect of a phase-out difficult, though environmentalists are holding out hope that Merkel might yet intervene before the summit.
‚ÄúMerkel has chosen to put this topic high on the agenda of an international meeting, but without making a clear commitment to this domestically she risks losing her reputation as a climate chancellor,‚Äù Martin Kaiser, head of international climate politics at Greenpeace, told the Guardian. Meanwhile, as the tough negotiating proceeds within the castle walls, the spouses will be provided with their own programme of entertainment. As is traditional, Merkel‚Äôs chemistry professor husband, Joachim Sauer, will take on the role of host to the wives of Shinz≈ç Abe of Japan, Stephen Harper of Canada and the European Council president Donald Tusk. He is to lead a sightseeing tour of the region, including the nearby Linderhof palace of the 18th-century ‚ÄúMad King‚Äù Ludwig II of Bavaria, and to a lecture on nanotechnology by the Munich professor Wolfgang Heckl. The spouses will also be invited to a musical evening in Schloss Elmau on Sunday when, at the request of Merkel and Sauer, both opera fanatics, the star soprano Waltraud Meier will perform lieder by Richards Strauss and Wagner. Overshadowing the event is the absence of Russia. Putin was refused an invitation over the annexation of the Crimea, prompting the meeting‚Äôs name change from G8 to G7. The scandal surrounding Germany‚Äôs intelligence service, the BND, amid claims it spied on EU officials and companies on behalf of the US National Security Agency, has also threatened to sour relations between Merkel and Obama. Possibly to ease the tension, both leaders are due to meet for bilateral talks over beer and pretzels on Sunday morning, before the summit. Merkel has said the NSA row will not be on the agenda. The nearby village of Kr√ºn will host the leaders, prefacing their discussions with a performance by a brass oompah band and dancers in lederhosen and dirndls, in what the mayor has promised will be a ‚Äúbeer garden atmosphere‚Äù. After that it will be off up to Elmau, where a landing pad for six helicopters has been built at the back of the hotel, which has variously served as a spa resort for Wehrmacht soldiers and a post-war recuperation site for Holocaust survivors. There, among the 300 staff on duty, will be Michelin-starred chefs on alert round the clock to feed leaders as they negotiate well into the night. ‚ÄúConsidering we only have 24 hours and also need to sleep a little bit in between, it is, I believe, an ambitious agenda,‚Äù Merkel told a gathering of foreign journalists this week. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking forward to some intensive and very friendly discussions.‚Äù
Up for discussion: topics at the G7 The G7 club grew out of a meeting between French president Val√©ry Giscard d‚ÄôEstaing and German chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who first met for a quiet fireside chat outside Paris. Now in its 41st year, the event has evolved beyond recognition. Topics for discussion at this year‚Äôs summit, which will cost an estimated ‚Ç¨150m to ‚Ç¨200m, include the global economy ‚Äì and such matters as TTIP, the free trade agreement between the United States and Europe, the CETA agreement with Canada, and agreements between the United States and Pacific partners, including Japan) ‚Äì development issues; climate change (with particular focus on the UN climate conference in Paris in December that aims to see an agreement on ensuring global warming does not exceed two degrees); global health, including the fight against antibiotic resistance, neglected tropical diseases in the light of the recent Ebola epidemic and reform of the WHO; female empowerment in the developing world, particularly professional training; and retail and supply chain standards. Part of the 26-hour-long gathering will include time spent in ‚Äúoutreach meetings‚Äù with guests mainly from Africa, including the presidents of Nigeria, Liberia, Senegal, Ethiopia, Tunisia and Iraq. The main topics of conversation will be the fight against terrorism and, thereafter, health and development goals beyond 2015. Also invited to these discussions are the UN secretary general, the chief of the World Bank, and representatives from the World Trade Organisation, WorldWork, the IMF and the OECD.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-05T13:35:06Z,world,World news,Pakistan says only two convicted for attempted murder of Malala Yousafzai,"Pakistani officials confirmed on Friday that only two men have been convicted for the attempted killing of the education activist Malala Yousafzai, not 10 as lawyers from her home region of Swat had initially claimed. Although 10 men stood trial, only two were jailed for their role in shooting the Nobel laureate as she sat in a school bus in October 2012. In April this year, members of the legal community in Mingora, the capital of Swat, claimed all 10 had been sentenced to 25-year jail terms ‚Äì a claim that garnered positive global headlines for a country that has long struggled against Islamist militancy. At the time, one army official in Swat, who spoke anonymously to the Guardian, contradicted the claims by several lawyers, insisting only two men had been convicted. Officials say the lawyers who spread the claim had not been inside the secretive, military-run court at the time of the hearing and had simply assumed all of the suspects had been jailed. Neither the army nor the government made any attempt to correct the public record at the time. The army has played a major role in the security of Swat ever since a military operation was launched in 2009 to roll back a Taliban takeover of the valley. On Friday, an army officer said the military believed there had been enough evidence to convict all of the men, but eight of them were acquitted because of what he called the longstanding weaknesses of Pakistan‚Äôs judicial system. He said witnesses were intimidated into not giving evidence and the court dropped many of the charges against them, including the plot to kill Yousafzai. The officer strongly denied claims made by the Daily Mirror that any of the men had been released. He said they were still being held and would be brought back to court at a later date after a fresh case had been built against them. The 10 men arrested in September last year, in an operation involving multiple security agencies, were accused of being part of a group tasked by Pakistani Taliban leader Mullah Fazlullah with killing a series of high-profile people, including Yousafzai. Court papers further contradict information given in April about the men who were convicted, neither of whom were thought at the time to be the actual culprits of the attempted murder. But the judgment said the two convicted men had approached the minivan in which Yousafzai was sitting with her classmates, before one opened fire on her. The teenager survived the gunshot to her head after undergoing an emergency operation in Pakistan and later being moved to the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham. In October last year, she became the youngest winner of a Nobel peace prize for her work campaigning for the right of children to education.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-05T13:31:27Z,world,World news,Ultra-Orthodox Jewish schools drop ban on mothers driving,"Two ultra-Orthodox Jewish schools have backed down on a proposed ban on mothers driving children to school after the Equality and Human Rights Commission warned them that it was unlawful and discriminatory. In a letter sent after consultation with the Department for Education, Onora O‚ÄôNeill, chair of the commission, described the actions of the Belz sect, which runs the two schools in Stamford Hill, north London, as illegal. On Wednesday, the commission wrote to the sect saying its ‚Äúactions are unlawful under the Equality Act 2010‚Äù. The group runs Talmud Torah Machzikei Hadass, a boys‚Äô primary school, and Beis Malka, a primary school for girls.
The schools had said that, from August, any child driven to school by their mother would be turned away at the gates. The letter said the ban was based on the recommendations of Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach, the Belzer spiritual leader in Israel. But now Ahron Klein, chief executive of the schools, said the ban was made without the approval of the governors and that mothers would be able to drive to the schools.
‚ÄúThe headteacher sent out the letter on behalf of the spiritual heads of the community, who had not taken into account the implications of such a policy,‚Äù he said in a statement. He added: ‚ÄúThe school believes that women have a choice about whether they want to drive or not, and our policy is to accept all children who are members of our community, which we have been doing for the last 40 years.‚Äù Klein pointed out that the letter to parents setting out the ban explained ‚Äúour values may be compromised in [women] driving a vehicle‚Äù. But he added that it also said the schools respected individual choices. And he revealed the backdown over the proposed ban, saying: ‚ÄúHowever, the message that children will be excluded has not come from the school‚Äôs board of governors, who did not approve the letter in advance.‚Äù A spokesperson for the Equality and Human Rights Commission said: ‚ÄúWe have written to the school‚Äôs proprietors to seek assurances that they are complying with the law. While we broadly welcome this statement, we hope to receive a formal response to our letter soon providing full clarification and confirmation that they will meet their legal obligations.‚Äù
Gloria De Piero, the shadow minister for women and equalities, wrote to the commission last week asking for ‚Äúurgent clarification of the law‚Äù over whether religious freedoms trumped other rights. ‚ÄúOur laws protect individuals in the enjoyment of their basic rights and freedoms from discrimination because of their sex and I have serious concerns about the implications of the ban as reported,‚Äù she wrote. Lady O‚ÄôNeill‚Äôs reply said: ‚ÄúIn our view, the actions of the proprietor of the two schools in question are likely to constitute direct discrimination [contrary to section 13] by association with the sex of another person [in this instance their mothers, when driving them to school].‚Äù Nicky Morgan, the education secretary, has also condemned the ban as ‚Äúcompletely unacceptable in modern Britain‚Äù. Parents in the area have defended the ban, which was first reported by the Jewish Chronicle last week, as part of living within the Belz community. Women rejected the characterisation that they were oppressed and the schools wrote to Morgan, saying the notice had been misrepresented.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-05T13:19:59Z,world,World news,Lawyers blame groupthink in Sweden's worst‚Äã‚Äã miscarriage of justice,"‚ÄúGroupthink‚Äù and a cascade of errors that condemned a drugged mental health patient to be declared a depraved mass murderer were laid bare on Friday as Sweden‚Äôs top legal minds offered their verdict on a case considered the country‚Äôs worst miscarriage of justice. Sture Bergwall, who then called himself Thomas Quick, confessed to 30 killings in the 1970s and 80s and to dismembering and eating some of his victims. In trials beginning two decades ago he was convicted and locked up in an institution for the criminally insane. But, in a story redolent of the darkest Nordic crime fiction, doubts continued to swirl around the case until an investigative journalist, the late Hannes R√•stam, demonstrated that the confessions had no basis in fact. Craving attention, Bergwall had relied on press reports of the murders to concoct fantasies about his guilt, which were eagerly accepted by investigators in thrall to a theory that offenders repressed their memories of horrific crimes. In return they fed Bergwall‚Äôs addiction to tranquillisers. Bergwall was acquitted of the last of the murders in 2013, and an official commission was appointed to draw lessons from the case, seen in Sweden as the scandal of the century. ‚ÄúIn hindsight, it is easy to see mistakes in the Bergwall affair,‚Äù the commission in Stockholm said on Friday.
‚ÄúWhen the same people participated in all or most of it, a groupthink developed ‚Ä¶ Strong trust between people is often described as one of Sweden‚Äôs great assets [but] it can not replace a critical approach to serious allegations, even when they are self-accusations,‚Äù it said in a newspaper article accompanying its report. However, the commission said it had found no evidence of systemic failures in the justice system. Bergwall‚Äôs violent behaviour had been attributed to alleged sexual abuse in early childhood, although there was no evidence of this, and mistakes in his testimony were blamed on ‚Äúdeliberate deviations‚Äù as he fought to repress the gruesome memories of the murders, the commission said. ‚ÄúThe investigators‚Äô faith in this explanatory model meant that scant or incorrect responses did not necessarily have any significance other than that he had difficulty talking about them,‚Äù the report (pdf) said. ‚ÄúThe psychotherapists do not appear to have sufficiently considered the risk of false memories being created, or of Sture Bergwall being encouraged to make up stories.‚Äù
Meanwhile, his lawyers had ‚Äúdeclined to critically examine‚Äù the prosecution case, said Daniel Tarschys, a professor at Stockholm University, who led the review. ‚ÄúThe fact that Sture Bergwall‚Äôs lawyers did not specifically draw attention to the shortcomings in the prosecutor‚Äôs presentation or other flaws in the investigative process may be explained by a lawyer‚Äôs duty of loyalty to the client,‚Äù the report said. Claes Borgstr√∂m, one of Bergwall‚Äôs lawyers during his murder convictions and a prominent figure among Stockholm‚Äôs legal elite, said he was disappointed by the report. ‚ÄúI am a professional and was careful not to be blinded,‚Äù he told Swedish media. Bitter insults have been traded between the small group of investigators who upheld Bergwall‚Äôs convictions and their detractors. The supreme court judge G√∂ran Lambertz, who as chancellor of justice in 2006 reviewed Bergwall‚Äôs convictions and found them sound, faced a storm of ridicule when he published a book in April that declared he was right and that Bergwall was guilty. Lambertz faces widespread calls from within the legal profession to resign for undermining trust in the Swedish legal system. He has yet to comment on the report but has said he will do so on Sunday. Jenny K√ºttim, a journalist who worked with R√•stam to expose the miscarriage of justice, said she thought the report would begin to put an end to the scandal. However, nobody had yet been held accountable, she said, and the ‚Äúsect mentality‚Äù that had kept Bergwall incarcerated for so long was also a feature of other cases in recent Swedish legal history in which theories of ‚Äúrepressed memories‚Äù were involved. ‚ÄúThis case shows what happens when we start believing rather than looking at the facts,‚Äù K√ºttim said. Sweden‚Äôs interior minister, Anders Ygeman, said the report was a starting point to make the necessary changes ‚Äúto ensure that this never happens again‚Äù.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-05T12:04:20Z,world,World news,China cruise disaster: death toll passes 100 as relatives complain of harassment,"The death toll from the Yangtze river cruise disaster has risen to 103 as authorities commemorate successfully lifting the wreckage from the water but the sister of one victim has condemned the government for its ‚Äúinhumane‚Äù treatment of bereaved families. Xia Yunchen, 70, whose sister and brother-in-law were among the 456 people on the Eastern Star when it sank on Monday, barged into a press conference being given by Chinese authorities to vent her anger at how families were being harassed by officials.
Hundreds of relatives from across China have descended on Jianli, the town nearest the disaster site, seeking information about their loved ones. But many complain they have been spied on and have had their movements curtailed by officials who appear nervous at the possibility of unrest. ‚ÄúIs it necessary to treat the common people, one by one, as if you are facing some kind of formidable foe?‚Äù Xia, from the city of Qingdao, shouted at the press conference on Friday, according to Reuters. ‚ÄúYou view the common people as if we are all your enemy. We are taxpayers. We support the government,‚Äù she said before being led away. ‚ÄúYou had better change your notion of this relationship. You are here to serve us. You need to be humane.‚Äù For days frustration and anger have been building among relatives, many of whom have serious misgivings over the official explanation for the tragedy. Officials blamed a freak tornado for causing the Eastern Star to suddenly capsize and sink at around 9.30pm on Monday. But many families question why the ship did not wait out the storm, as other boats in the area did. Doubts over the sunken ship‚Äôs safety record have also been raised after reports that it had been cited for violations two years ago. There were further questions on Friday after it emerged that a Chinese journalist had been summoned by police after he photographed a rubbish bin filled with shredded documents at the headquarters of the company that owns the Eastern Star.
Zhang Xiaohui, a veteran Chongqing-based journalist for the Economic Observer, said he went to the firm‚Äôs Chongqing offices on Wednesday as part of his investigation into the disaster. ‚ÄúWe saw a dustbin by the toilet and it was a very big blue dustbin. The dustbin was full of shredded papers,‚Äù Zhang told the Guardian. ‚ÄúI asked a guy from the company‚Äôs management why were they destroying documents. The guy didn‚Äôt answer and left immediately.‚Äù Zhang said he had posted a photograph of the shredded documents on Weibo, China‚Äôs equivalent of Twitter. The next day he was summoned by police who ordered him to delete the posts. ‚ÄúThey accused me of posting untrue things online,‚Äù Zhang said. There is no indication that the destroyed papers were related to the Eastern Star but Zhang‚Äôs revelation ‚Äì and the police reaction ‚Äì raised further eyebrows among bereaved families and Chinese bloggers.
President Xi Jinping announced a ‚Äúserious investigation‚Äù into the tragedy‚Äôs causes on Thursday as Beijing sought to show it was addressing relatives‚Äô concerns. As criticism of the Communist party‚Äôs handling of the disaster mounts, the Global Times, a pro-Beijing tabloid, accused foreign journalists of exaggerating the anger of bereaved families. ‚ÄúSome foreign media eagerly exploit the misery of the families and rub salt in their wounds,‚Äù it said in an editorial. ‚ÄúTheir effort to stage confrontation is unscrupulous. The victims and their families should be respected.‚Äù A total of 103 bodies had been recovered from the Eastern Star‚Äôs wreckage by Friday evening after four iron ropes were used to hoist it from the water, Xu Chengguan, a transport ministry spokesperson, told reporters. The decision to hoist the upturned vessel from the water was made after rescuers decided the chances of finding further survivors were ‚Äúvery, very remote‚Äù, Xu said.

2015-06-05T11:26:13Z,world,World news,Death toll rises in Accra floods and petrol station fire,"The death toll from a petrol station explosion and heavy flooding in Ghana‚Äôs capital, Accra, has risen to more than 150, rescue workers have said. President John Dramani Mahama described the loss of life as ‚Äúcatastrophic and almost unprecedented‚Äù and announced that three days of national mourning would be held next week. A fire broke out late on Wednesday at a filling station where people had sought shelter from heavy rains that caused widespread flooding. The victims were burned beyond recognition where they stood under the station‚Äôs awning, or trapped and incinerated in the wreckage of cars and minivans on the station‚Äôs forecourt. Neighbouring buildings were also set ablaze. Francis Obeng, disaster management coordinator of the Red Cross in Ghana, told Agence France-Presse on Friday: ‚ÄúAs of yesterday we have recovered more than 150 corpses. Sixty people have been taken to the hospital.‚Äù He said rescuers, including dozens of volunteers, were assessing the situation and providing relief supplies to people affected. ‚ÄúWe are providing blankets, mats and drugs to residents in the seven communities affected by the fire and flooding. UNDP (United Nations Development Programme) officials are also joining us in our efforts to bring succour to those affected.‚Äù Visiting the scene, Mahama said he was heartbroken by the loss of life and blamed the floods partly on people building homes and businesses on the city‚Äôs waterways, blocking drainage systems. ‚ÄúWe must sit down and strategise to make sure this doesn‚Äôt happen again,‚Äù he said, pledging ¬£9m to help flood victims. The opposition leader, Nana Akufo Addo, also went to the site and called it a ‚Äúdark day in the history of the city‚Äù. Witnesses said the main victims of the blast were low-wage workers struggling home through a seasonal storm that had forced the closure of roads and stoppage of minibus taxis. One woman said she sought refuge at the station from floods that prevented her returning home from work, but soon became alarmed by an overpowering smell of gasoline and moved to stand next to an adjacent bank building. A power cut plunged the area into darkness and when a generator was switched on at the petrol station to provide light, people cheered at first, Comfort Arhin, a domestic worker, told Reuters. ‚ÄúWe heard a pop. Then the fire was walking where the petrol was. Everybody was running. You had to fight for yourself. My bag fell inside the water ‚Ä¶ All the people in the filling station died.‚Äù Other people died in flooding that left thousands homeless, officials said. The tragedies have highlighted flaws in Accra‚Äôs infrastructure, which has failed to keep pace with population growth after years of rapid economic expansion. Police spokesman Arthur Cephas said the situation in Accra was returning to normal. ‚ÄúPolice are protecting lives and properties as well as ensuring that evidence that would assist in the investigation is not tampered with,‚Äù he told AFP. ‚ÄúWe have commenced investigations into this monumental national tragedy ‚Ä¶ more bodies have been recovered from across Accra following the flooding.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-05T11:20:11Z,world,World news,"Former al-Qaida spy for MI6 urges effort to ""confuse"" Islamic State","Aimen Dean is an unusual example of a poacher turned gamekeeper. The talkative Bahraini is sought after for his understanding of the Islamic State, now expanding across Syria and Iraq in a campaign the US has warned could take decades to defeat. Dean‚Äôs insights are based on his own experience as an al-Qaida terrorist ‚Äì but one who underwent a crisis of conscience and changed tack to spy for British intelligence. With his neat haircut, dark suit and gold-rimmed glasses, Dean ‚Äì not his real name - looked at ease amongst the academics and security policy wonks debating strategies for countering violent extremism at a conference in Qatar this week. But his years in the jihadi world ‚Äì and his extraordinary journey out of it ‚Äì inform his view of how to combat Isis, which is attracting thousands of young Muslims from across the world to its ‚ÄúCaliphate‚Äù in the heart of the Middle East. ‚ÄúThe first thing is to realise the magnitude of the problem,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt is deep and difficult. The idea that there a magic solution to convince these people just to turn around and come back and be good citizens is almost impossible. It is ludicrous.‚Äù Sowing doubt is the key. ‚ÄúAl Qaida and Isis say on Twitter and YouTube that the shortest path to heaven is jihad and martyrdom. New recruits to Isis went to nightclubs, took drugs, were members of gangs and had sexual relations out of wedlock. They want absolution, forgiveness. The thirst for redemption is there. And Isis is catering to that need. ‚ÄúThe motivation is religious even if the recruits are ignorant. They think they will end up in heaven if they blow themselves up for Isis. Isis is offering simple answers to all questions - so you need to encourage complexity: 100% certainty means a committed militant; 95% certainty means a confused militant; a confused militant is a disarmed militant. That is what is needed. To confuse them, not to convince them.‚Äù Countering the Isis narrative that there is a ‚Äúwar on Islam‚Äù waged by a ‚Äúconspiracy of Crusaders and Zionists‚Äù - rather than a west in pursuit of its economic interests and global stability - is another important strand of an effective counter-extremism strategy, Dean argues. But Isis, he cautions, is a more coherent cause than al-Qaida ever was. Establishing a jihadi society in the areas it controls in Syria and Iraq has been effective. New recruits ‚Äúwill not have to spend their lives on the run like al-Qaida. They will stand their ground because it is the Islamic State- and they will fight to the death to defend it.‚Äù Dean, 37, grew up in Saudi Arabia, fought the Serbs in Bosnia and ended up in Afghanistan swearing loyalty to Osama Bin Laden and meeting Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, the architect of the 9/11 attacks. But his own doubts surfaced when 240 African civilians were killed in the suicide bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. He questioned a 13th century fatwa that justified the death of innocents in a jihad ‚Äì directly challenging al-Qaida doctrine on human shields. He saw a ‚Äúslippery slope‚Äù and decided to get off it. That led, via Qatari intelligence, to eight years working undercover with MI5 and MI6. He passed on information that foiled attacks and led to the arrest and deaths of former al-Qaida comrades. His cover was inadvertently blown in 2006 by a book that drew on CIA sources and he went public for the first time three months ago in a BBC interview. He has been pardoned in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and now runs a consultancy in Dubai. The al-Qaida commander who issued a fatwa against him for treachery was killed in a US drone strike in Afghanistan. Dean remains a devout Muslim and sees Isis as representing in part an Arab Sunni fightback against perceived reverses at the hands of Iran and Shia groups it supports or exploits ‚Äì in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and most recently in Yemen, where Houthi rebels are now facing the Saudi-led air strikes of Operation Decisive Storm. ‚ÄúThe Saudis have stolen some of Isis‚Äôs thunder by countering Iran‚Äôs weight,‚Äù he says. In his assessment this has significantly cut jihadi recruiting in the kingdom - and encouraged Isis to mount sectarian bombings of Shia mosques. Other terrorism experts argue that while Dean‚Äôs insights are valuable, his experience is outdated and he focuses too narrowly on the role of religion in jihadi recruitment while paying insufficient attention to social background and individual psychology. But he warns in turn of the ‚Äúeasy dismissal‚Äù of the effects of Islamic theology as a motivating factor. Anti-radicalisation campaigns‚Äì ‚Äúled by Downing Street imams or Elysee preachers‚Äù- can never succeed because their official nature means they will be discredited, he insists. It may be a legacy of his MI6 years that he believes clandestine propaganda and psychological warfare methods work better. ‚ÄúThe last thing I want to do is to do what many security professionals do, which is to complicate the simple and simplify the complex,‚Äù Dean says. ‚ÄúIf I have learnt anything it is not to take anything at face value. Do not accept Isis as the truth and the only truth. The books are out there. Do not rent out your brain to Isis so they can think on your behalf.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-05T11:00:13Z,world,World news,Sharif Mobley's family pleads with US officials: 'Just save his life',"Her voice quaking with tears, Caamilya Beyah begged Barack Obama and John Kerry to save her brother from the Houthi rebels who may have already killed him. ‚ÄúI would just ask them to save my brother‚Äôs life. For the sake of his children and, really, for the sake of my mother. Just save his life,‚Äù Beyah, a mother of four from New Jersey, said on Thursday, 21 days after she last heard from her brother, Sharif Mobley, a US citizen trapped in a prison on a military base in Yemen. Mobley‚Äôs last message to his sister, during a smuggled cellphone call on 14 May, was that his captors, the rebels that overthrew the US-backed government in Sana‚Äôa, intend to kill him.
Beyah and Mobley‚Äôs lawyers, with the human rights group Reprieve, have reason to believe Obama and Kerry can save Mobley. Last week US diplomats, operating on a back channel to the Houthi movement, secured the release of an American journalist in Houthi custody, Casey Coombs. But when Beyah, on behalf of her mother Cynthia Mobley, wrote to the State Department on 28 May ‚Äì the subject line of her email: ‚ÄúDesperately Seeking Assistance‚Äù ‚Äì she received the same curt reply that US diplomats have given since Mobley first disappeared last year within the Yemeni penal system Washington‚Äôs allies used to control. ‚ÄúAs we no longer have a US Embassy in Sana‚Äôa, you may want to reach out to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to see if they have any information or to see if they could request a visit,‚Äù read the response, which did not include the sender‚Äôs name. After word leaked of Coombs‚Äôs release, Beyah on Tuesday said to tell the anonymous diplomats who pled impotence: ‚ÄúI know this is untrue.‚Äù For weeks, Beyah had quietly played a behind-the-scenes role in connecting Mobley to his family and his attorneys, who had not heard from him in a year. Mobley, 32, had unexpectedly begun placing calls to his wife and his sister, thanks to guards who smuggled him a cellphone. The guards were not merely acting out of sympathy: they wanted money. Beyah started wiring money, normally in $300 installments, to keep the line of communication alive. What emerged was difficult for the family to bear. Mobley‚Äôs mother, who has cancer, had started making peace with the prospect of never seeing her son again. She began to tell her daughter that she would be reunited with Sharif in heaven. Hope returned when Mobley began making the calls. ‚ÄúIt was almost like a miracle. It was a relief just to hear his voice,‚Äù said Beyah, 36, who has not spoken publicly before. ‚ÄúAny time he would talk to my mother, he was always trying to sound upbeat, because he‚Äôs always more concerned about us worrying about him than his own wellbeing,‚Äù she said. In private, with Beyah, he had a different message. ‚ÄúHe would say, ‚ÄòCaamilya, don‚Äôt tell mommy, but they‚Äôre not really feeding me here‚Äô or ‚ÄòThey‚Äôre not giving me anything to drink and they‚Äôve been beating me.‚Äô One time he said: ‚ÄòI haven‚Äôt seen the sunlight since December, and they‚Äôre holding me in a basement.‚Äô He said to me he thought like he had been buried alive.‚Äù It was the spring. Mobley has told his family that he is held at a military base on Hadda Street in Sana‚Äôa. He could hear anti-aircraft fire from the roof of the building in which he was being held, an attempt at holding off the Saudi warplanes that have bombed Sana‚Äôa for months in order to return their allies to power. An air strike last week hit the Hadda Street base, and Mobley has not been heard from since. The Saudi war is supported by Washington ‚Äì which has played a nebulous role in Mobley‚Äôs disappearance from the start. Mobley had traveled with his family to Yemen to study Islam and Arabic. In January 2010, a team of masked men captured Mobley at gunpoint and shot him in the leg. In hospital he was visited by interrogators identifying themselves as agents of the FBI and US defense department. They wanted to know about Anwar al-Awlaki, the US citizen and al-Qaida preacher whom the US would kill the next year in a drone strike. Terrorism accusations were later dropped against Mobley. But Yemen charged him with the murder of a guard after saying the wounded, restrained Mobley attempted an escape. Four years later, while still in pre-trial detention, Mobley disappeared from the Sana‚Äôa jail in which he was held, something Reprieve attorneys suspect occurred before details of his capture ‚Äì and the US role in it ‚Äì could emerge in court. Reprieve‚Äôs Cori Crider wrote to a State Department official, William Lesh, on Wednesday to protest the ‚Äúcontinuing total failure of your department to engage in any way with the case of our client, Sharif Mobley‚Äù. Crider wrote: ‚ÄúThat Mr Coombs‚Äô release could be achieved successfully in little more than two weeks since he was detained demonstrates quite clearly the true extent of the State Department‚Äôs current capabilities in Yemen, and the efficacy of the lines of dialogue with the Houthi group. We are left, again, with the clear ‚Äì if deeply disappointing ‚Äì evidence that your department‚Äôs refusal to help our client remains a deliberate policy.‚Äù A State Department official, who was not cleared to speak by name on the subject, reiterated a statement typically issued when the Guardian has asked about Mobley: ‚ÄúThe safety and welfare of US citizens overseas is among our top priorities. Consular officers strive to assist US citizens detained abroad whenever possible. All consular services in Sana‚Äôa have been suspended until further notice. Due to privacy considerations, we are unable to provide further information.‚Äù The State Department has yet to fulfill a Freedom of Information Act request from the Guardian for documentation of US-Yemeni communications about Mobley. Caamilya Beyah, waiting to hear any word of her brother‚Äôs fate, said her last memory of Mobley was seeing him in her New Jersey living room, watching the children‚Äôs show Hip Hop Harry with their daughters. ‚ÄúSharif was dancing in front of the television and being so silly, which is just classic Sharif,‚Äù Beyah said, crying. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I remember most of him: he could always make anybody laugh. He has always been so light-hearted and silly ‚Äì just like, I don‚Äôt know, the perfect little brother.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-05T10:52:16Z,world,World news,Human rights court allows France to take tetraplegic man off life support,"French doctors have been told by the European court of human rights that they can switch off the life-support system of a man who has been in a coma for seven years. The ruling by the grand chamber of the Strasbourg court will form a precedent across the continent for other cases in which families and medical staff are in dispute over how long patients in a vegetative state should be treated. Vincent Lambert, 39, suffered serious head injuries in September 2008. He was left a tetraplegic and in a condition of complete dependence. He receives artificial nutrition and hydration administered through a gastric tube. His relatives and doctors were divided over how he should be treated. His wife, Rachel, agreed with doctors that they should put an end to the intravenous food and water that was keeping him alive. The court heard that Lambert had confided in his wife and one of his brothers a desire not to be kept alive in a highly dependent state, but had left no formal statement. He did not share the views of his deeply religious Catholic parents who support the idea that doctors should respect the ‚Äúsanctity of life‚Äù, the court heard. French law does not authorise either euthanasia or assisted suicide but permits doctors to discontinue treatment only if continuing it would demonstrate ‚Äúunreasonable obstinacy‚Äù.
Lambert‚Äôs parents argued that withdrawing nutrition and hydration would be in breach article 2 of the European convention on human rights, which guarantees the right to life. Depriving him of nutrition and hydration would also constitute ill-treatment amounting to torture within the meaning of article 3 of the convention, they maintained. By acknowledging that the decision was primarily for the domestic authorities, the Strasbourg court reinforced the principle that member states have a wide ‚Äúmargin of appreciation‚Äù as to how to decide such complex issues according to their own national laws and traditions. The ECHR judgment said that in ‚Äú39 of the 47 Council of Europe member states, no consensus exists in practice in favour of authorising the withdrawal of treatment designed only to prolong life artificially‚Äù. In the majority of countries, treatment may be withdrawn subject to certain conditions; in other states legislation prohibits withdrawal or is silent on the subject. The Strasbourg court concluded that France‚Äôs domestic courts had ‚Äúcomplied with their positive obligations flowing from article 2 of the convention‚Äù in allowing doctors to turn off his life-support systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-05T09:18:56Z,world,World news,Vietnam upgrade air defences South China Sea dispute,"Vietnam is seeking to upgrade its air defences by acquiring western fighter jets and drones, a move which would further militarise a dispute with Beijing over territorial claims in the South China Sea. Hanoi is speaking to European and US contractors to buy jets, patrol planes and unarmed drones, Reuters reported on Friday. Several countries claim islands and surrounding waters in the South China Sea, including Malaysia, Brunei, Vietnam, Taiwan and the Philippines. China claims most of the area. The naval corridor is an important shipping route and the region is thought to have oil and gas reserves. Industry sources told Reuters that Vietnam was in discussions with Swedish defence contractor Saab, the European multinational Eurofighter, the defence wing of Airbus and US firms Lockheed Martin and Boeing. The companies and the Vietnamese foreign ministry did not confirm reports. Carl Thayer, an analyst on the South China Sea at the Australian Defence Force Academy, said Vietnam already has Russian Sukhoi Su-27 and Su-30 fighter jets but its air force is in need of an upgrade.
‚ÄúVietnam badly needs modern maritime reconnaissance aircraft to patrol its vast maritime domain,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúReports that Vietnam has canvassed widely with European and American defence contractors fits its profile of extensive market research and bargaining for the best package deal.‚Äù Vietnam spent $3.4bn (¬£2.2bn) on defence in 2013, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, and has close to half a million ground forces. Ian Storey, from Singapore‚Äôs Institute of South East Asian Studies, said Vietnam wants to reduce its military dependence on Moscow before the Chinese government puts pressure on Russia to reduce weapons sales. ‚ÄúAlthough Hanoi knows that its military will always be outnumbered and outgunned by China‚Äôs, a strong navy and air force provides it with a limited deterrence and, if push comes to shove, the ability to give China a bloody nose in battle,‚Äù Storey said. China has reportedly started building up its military presence on islands artificially created by land reclamation. On Monday, the secretary of the Australian defence department, Dennis Richardson, said Beijing‚Äôs rapid claim on contested islands ‚Äúdwarfs what the other claimant states have done‚Äù. The South China Sea disputes have already led to altercations. In May, Chinese and Vietnamese ships collided as Beijing tried to set up an oil rig. Vietnam released footage of a Chinese ship ramming and sinking a Vietnamese fishing boat. Countries in the region have also tried to boost their claims to islands by constructing houses, schools and medical centres on them. The Ho Chi Minh City government‚Äôs website in Vietnam said that 180 citizens will be able to join a six-day tourism, fishing and seafood cruise to the contested Spratly archipelago this month. It called the promotion ‚Äúthe big trip of your life, reviving national pride and citizens‚Äô awareness of the sacred maritime sovereignty of the country‚Äù.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-05T08:56:40Z,world,World news,Saudi-led naval blockade leaves 20m Yemenis facing humanitarian disaster,"Twenty million Yemenis, nearly 80% of the population, are in urgent need of food, water and medical aid, in a humanitarian disaster that aid agencies say has been dramatically worsened by a naval blockade imposed by an Arab coalition with US and British backing. Washington and London have quietly tried to persuade the Saudis, who are leading the coalition, to moderate its tactics, and in particular to ease the naval embargo, but to little effect. A small number of aid ships is being allowed to unload but the bulk of commercial shipping, on which the desperately poor country depends, are being blocked. Despite western and UN entreaties, Riyadh has also failed to disburse any of the $274m it promised in funding for humanitarian relief. According to UN estimates due to be released next week 78% of the population is in need of emergency aid, an increase of 4 million over the past three months.
The desperate shortage of food, water and medical supplies raises urgent questions over US and UK support for the Arab coalition‚Äôs intervention in the Yemeni civil war since March. Washington provides logistical and intelligence supportthrough a joint planning cell established with the Saudi military, who are leading the campaign. London has offered to help the Saudi military effort in ‚Äúevery practical way short of engaging in combat‚Äù. On western urging, Riyadh had promised to move towards ‚Äúintelligence-led interdiction‚Äù, stopping and searching individual ships on which there was good reason to believe arms were being smuggled, and away from a blanket policy of blocking the majority of vessels approaching Yemeni ports. But aid agencies and shipping sources say there is little sign of any such change. UN sources say that only 15% of the pre-crisis volume of imports is getting through, and that the country depends on imports for nine-tenths of its food.
‚ÄúThere are less and less of the basic necessities. People are queueing all day long,‚Äù said Nuha Abdul Jabber, Oxfam‚Äôs humanitarian programme manager in the Yemeni capital, Sana‚Äôa. ‚ÄúThe blockade means it‚Äôs impossible to bring anything into the country. There are lots of ships, with basic things like flour, that are not allowed to approach. The situation is deteriorating, hospitals are now shutting down, without diesel. People are dying of simple diseases. It is becoming almost impossible to survive.‚Äù In April, Saudi Arabia pledged it would completely fund a $274m UN emergency humanitarian fund for Yemen, but so far none of the money has been transferred to the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Riyadh is nonetheless insisting upon the right to decide which aid workers can enter Yemen. At Al Hudaydah on Yemen‚Äôs west coast, the only major port still functioning, a trickle of humanitarian food supplies is arriving on a handful of aid ships allowed through the naval blockade each week, but many more ships are being turned away or made to wait many days to be searched for weapons.
A State Department official said Washington was pressing for basic goods to be allowed through the blockade. ‚ÄúWe continue to urge all sides, including the Saudis, to exercise restraint and avoid unnecessary violence,‚Äù the official said in an emailed statement. ‚ÄúWe also urge all parties to allow the entry and delivery of urgently needed food, medicine, fuel and other necessary assistance through UN and international humanitarian organisation channels to address the urgent needs of civilians impacted by the crisis.‚Äù Britain‚Äôs Royal Navy has liaison officers working with their Saudi counterparts, and they have been trying to urge a more targeted, intelligence-driven, approach to stopping a much smaller number of ships, so far with limited effect. In London, where a pro-Saudi line has been driven principally by Downing Street, there is growing unease over the impact of the blockade. A Foreign Office spokesman said the UK ‚Äúurges the coalition to quickly move to targeted naval interdictions of incoming commercial ships‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe UK remains in close contact with the government of Yemen and other international partners regarding the situation in Yemen, including the maritime blockade. The foreign secretary discussed Yemen with the Saudi foreign minister while in Paris this week,‚Äù the spokesman said. ‚ÄúWe are not participating directly in military operations, but are providing support to the Saudi Arabian armed forces through pre-existing arrangements. A small number of UK personnel are coordinating planning support with Saudi and coalition partners. All UK military personnel have extensive training on International Humanitarian Law.‚Äù The Saudi government did not respond to requests for comment.
The blockade ‚Äì which is also being enforced in the air and on land ‚Äì has choked a fragile economy already staggering under the impact of a six-month civil conflict pitting Yemeni forces loyal to the President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, now exiled in Riyadh, against Houthi rebels allied to his predecessor and rival, Ali Abdullah Saleh. A coalition led by Saudi Arabia and including Egypt, Jordan, Sudan and Bahrain intervened in March in support of Hadi, viewing the Houthis as an Iranian proxy force. Iran denies accusations of supplying arms to the insurgents, but British officials believe there are Iranian Revolutionary Guard advisers with the Houthi rebel leadership. Over 2,000 Yemeni civilians are known to have been killed in the fighting so far, and, according to new UN figures, a million have been forced from their homes. The humanitarian crisis meanwhile, affects the overwhelming majority of the population. Tankers carrying petrol, diesel and fuel oil are also being stopped routinely by the naval blockade, crippling the country‚Äôs electricity supply and forcing the mass closure of hospitals and schools. Most urgently, it has stopped water pumps working. Oxfam reckons the fighting and embargo have led to 3 million Yemenis being cut off from a clean water supply since March, bringing to 16 million the total without access to drinking water or sanitation ‚Äì nearly two-thirds of the population ‚Äì with dire implications for the spread of disease.
Cooking gas is almost impossible to find. Queues to refill gas cylinders in Sana‚Äôa now last for than a week, with people camping out by their cylinders or chaining them down to keep their place in the queue. There are also long lines of abandoned cars waiting for elusive supplies of petrol. The UN estimate that nearly 20 million Yemenis are in need of humanitarian assistance ‚Äì 78% of the entire population ‚Äì represents an increase of 4 million since the escalation of the conflict with the Saudi intervention in March. Twelve million Yemenis are ‚Äúfood insecure‚Äù, having to struggle to find their next meal, up 1.4 million since March. Five million are described as ‚Äúseverely food insecure‚Äù, meaning they often go for days without a meal. In the cities worst hit by street fighting, such as Aden, civilians are either cowering at home to avoid sniper fire and bombardment or have joined the more than half million Yemenis forced out of their houses and now looking for food and shelter. But the blockade has spread the impact of the humanitarian crisis around the country. According to Save the Children, hospitals in at least 18 of the country‚Äôs 22 governorates have been closed or severely affected by the fighting or the lack of fuel. In particular, 153 health centres that supplied nutrition to over 450,000 at-risk children have shut down, as well as 158 outpatient clinics, responsible for providing basic healthcare to nearly half a million children under five. At the same time, due to lack of clean water and sanitation, cholera and other diseases are on the rise. A dengue fever outbreak has been reported in Aden. ‚ÄúChildren are dying preventable deaths in Yemen because the rate of infectious diseases is rising ,‚Äù said Priya Jacob, Save the Children‚Äôs director of programmes in Yemen. ‚ÄúThe humanitarian crisis in Yemen is a protracted and rapidly deteriorating situation that leaves four out of five Yemeni people in need of aid. The ongoing naval and air blockade means very little aid is getting through, exacerbating the needs of the Yemeni people.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe lack of fuel is a real issue ‚Äì both for our teams and for local people, making it difficult to transport patients and medical supplies,‚Äù said Ahmad Bilal, medical coordinator for M√©decins sans Fronti√®res based in Yemen‚Äôs third city, Taiz. ‚ÄúFor ordinary people it means that it is hard to move around the city and it‚Äôs an ongoing struggle to access clean water and food. Many people living in frontline areas are unable to travel to clinics or hospitals for medical care both because of the fighting and the lack of fuel. Even those who are able to make it to health facilities find that they are not functioning. At least 12 hospitals in Taiz had to close their doors and stop receiving patients, for these reasons.‚Äù
A shipping source in Al Hudaydah said the flow of ships into Yemen was down 75% compared with before the March intervention. ‚ÄúSome ships have been docked in the past week or so, but many others have been stopped and it‚Äôs hard to see any pattern. Sometimes the coalition conducts a search and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. Sometimes it depends which navy is involved. In the past few days the Saudis have been more flexible, but the Egyptians have been rigid, not letting anything through,‚Äù the shipping source said. The uncertainty has made some ship owners nervous about having their vessels impounded. Over the past few days, two tankers carrying 70,000 tonnes of diesel, steered away from the Yemen coast and have begun offloading the fuel into small ships offshore. But as of this week, less than a tenth of the country‚Äôs monthly fuel requirement of 5m tonnes is getting through the blockade. ‚ÄúWe have heard a lot about international commitments to help Yemen with big sums but we haven‚Äôt seen anything here,‚Äù Oxfam‚Äôs Nuha Abdul Jabber added. ‚ÄúThis is the moment for the world to understand the severity of the situation.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-05T05:19:01Z,world,World news,South Korea declares 'war' on Mers virus as death toll rises,"Authorities in South Korea have declared ‚Äúwar‚Äù on what they say is the worst outbreak of a deadly respiratory Mers virus outside the Middle East. The country said it was stepping up its response on Friday after fourth victim died and the number of people infected with the disease rose to 41. More than 1,600 people have been placed now under quarantine, media reports said, while the outbreak of the disease, for which there is no vaccine, has led to the temporary closure of more than 1,000 schools and colleges. Thousands of people have called a government hotline seeking advice. It is the worst Mers outbreak outside Saudi Arabia, where the respiratory virus is thought to have originated three years ago.
In echoes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome [Sars] outbreak more than a decade ago, anxious residents were stocking up on surgical masks and airports were stepping up screening efforts after the outbreak in South Korea was traced to a 68-year-old man who had been traveling in the Middle East. The fourth Mers patient to die was a 76-year-old man who had tested positive for the virus in late May. The victim, who was not named, had come into close contact with the first confirmed Mers patient, Yonhap news agency said. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said South Korea could expect more cases, but cautioned against unnecessary panic. Most of the cases are linked to a single hospital south of Seoul, and there is no evidence of ‚Äúsustained transmission in the community,‚Äù the UN health body said.
Kang Cheol-in, an infectious diseases expert at Samsung Medical Centre in Seoul, said it was highly unlikely anyone would become infected just by visiting crowded areas, such as parks or schools, since Mers is not an airborne disease. The closure of so many schools ‚Äúreally doesn‚Äôt make sense,‚Äù Kang said. The public is skeptical of official reassurances, however, just over a year after 300 people, mainly schoolchildren, died in the Sewol ferry sinking, a disaster many blame on official incompetence. The health ministry belatedly released the name of the hospital where the first person to be diagnosed with Mers was treated amid complaints about a lack of transparency. Kang said the initial government response was inadequate, ‚Äúbut the people are also looking at things in an unreasonable manner‚Äù. The mayor of Seoul, Park Won-soon, criticised the government for not reporting the Mers diagnosis of a doctor at a large hospital in Seoul who is believed to have been at a public meeting attended by about 1,500 people while infectious. Officials said they were contacting people who attended the 30 May meeting to ask them to undergo voluntary quarantine. ‚ÄúFrom now on, Seoul city is embarking on a war against Mers. We will take swift and stern measures to protect the lives and safety of our citizens,‚Äù Park told reporters Friday.
The health minister, Moon Hyong-po, apologised for causing anxiety among the public, but accused Park of spreading ‚Äúmistrust and misunderstanding‚Äù. Mers has a mortality rate of 38 percent and was first observed in Saudi Arabia in 2012. It has infected 1,161 people in more than 20 countries, with most of the cases in Saudi Arabia. The global death toll stands at 436. Symptoms include fever, coughing and shortness of breath, with an average incubation period of five to six days. It can be contracted only through close contact with sufferers, but camels are also thought capable of spreading the virus. South Korea has quarantined 17 camels at the country‚Äôs zoos.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-05T04:53:07Z,world,World news,Gillian Triggs accused of 'slur' by linking Bali Nine deaths to asylum seeker policy,"The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, has accused Gillian Triggs of an ‚Äúoutrageous slur‚Äù by linking the death of two Bali Nine drug smugglers to Australia‚Äôs asylum seeker policy. Dutton has called for the Australian Human Rights Commission president to retract her words. The Australian newspaper reports Triggs made the comments during a Committee for Economic Development of Australia forum in Adelaide on Thursday. ‚ÄúBoats have got to stop,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut have we thought about what the consequences are of pushing people back to our neighbour Indonesia? Is it any wonder that Indonesia will not engage with us on other issues that we care about, like the death penalty?‚Äù Triggs‚Äôs office said she was not referring to specific cases, but rather reflecting on the death penalty in the region more broadly. Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were executed by firing squad in Indonesia in April after an unsuccessful attempt to smuggle heroin from Bali to Australia in 2005. Dutton is furious that Triggs linked their deaths to the Coalition‚Äôs boat turnback measure, a cornerstone of its hardline Operation Sovereign Borders policy. ‚ÄúProfessor Triggs holds a very high office in this country and the Australian public believe, I think, that people in these positions should act in a responsible way,‚Äù he told reporters in Brisbane on Friday. ‚ÄúI welcome the fact that Professor Triggs this morning has done a partial backflip, but she needs to confront the cameras to retract this outrageous slur.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think Professor Triggs trying to make some nexus between these two issues, it is a complete outrage and she should retract her statements today,‚Äù Dutton said, adding the claims were ‚Äúcompletely without foundation‚Äù. ‚ÄúI ask Professor Triggs to take into consideration the feelings of the family of two men involved.‚Äù Indonesia has previously been critical of Australia‚Äôs turnback policy, saying a regional approach is needed to tackle the problem of people smuggling. Triggs has previously drawn criticism from the government for a scathing report into children in immigration detention, with pressure from some Coalition MPs for the commissioner to resign. Late on Friday afternoon, Dutton upped the ante, releasing a joint statement with attorney general George Brandis putting further pressure on Triggs, saying her comments were ‚Äúpoorly informed and foolish‚Äù. ‚ÄúProfessor Triggs chose to make her remarks with no specific knowledge of the many steps the Australian government took to save the lives of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, and with no professional experience in diplomacy and no specialist knowledge of the Australia-Indonesia relationship,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúAs a lawyer, she knows better than to assert conclusions in the absence of evidence. Her comments were not in defence of human rights, but a gratuitous intervention in a difficult political issue.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-05T04:02:50Z,world,World news,Timor-Leste presses ahead with challenge to Timor Sea oil and gas treaty,"Timor-Leste is set to resume a formal challenge against an oil and gas treaty that became mired in controversy following claims Australia bugged the cabinet room in Dili to gain the upper hand in negotiations. But the government of Timor-Leste has decided to withdraw an International Court of Justice case against Australia relating to evidence seized by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio) in raids in December 2013. Those raids, authorised by the Australian attorney general, George Brandis, targeted the offices of Timor-Leste‚Äôs Canberra-based legal adviser, Bernard Collaery, ‚Äúon the grounds that the documents contained intelligence related to security matters‚Äù. But after ICJ hearings in The Hague last year, and a preliminary ruling that Australia keep the documents protected under seal, both countries entered talks to resolve the dispute. Australia had previously defended its right to seize the documents but recently agreed to hand them back to Timor-Leste. While the return of the documents has prompted the discontinuation of the ICJ case, it has not deterred the Timor-Leste government from pressing ahead with arbitration against Australia, challenging the validity of the ‚Äò2006 Treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea‚Äô. Timor-Leste has previously said it had irrefutable proof that Australia bugged the cabinet room to obtain an unfair advantage in the lead-up to the treaty being signed. John Howard‚Äôs Coalition government was in power in Australia at the time. Tony Abbott‚Äôs Coalition government said on Friday that Australia remained committed to the treaty and would ‚Äústrongly defend the arbitration‚Äù. Timor-Leste‚Äôs minister of state, Agio Pereira, said the the country had agreed in September 2014 to adjourn both the ICJ case and arbitration for six months to allow for substantive dialogue, but this had not produced a road map for structured talks on maritime boundaries. ‚ÄúTimor-Leste‚Äôs preference is always to avoid legal confrontation and focus all of our energy and resources on national development. However, it is also the mandate of the government to defend the national interest,‚Äù he said in a statement issued this week. ‚ÄúTimor-Leste is focusing on moving forward in its relationship with its neighbour to substantive dialogue to finalise a permanent maritime boundary based on the principles of international law.‚Äù Brandis and Australia‚Äôs foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, issued a joint statement on Friday saying that the countries‚Äô differences were ‚Äúbest resolved through consultation‚Äù. They were ‚Äútherefore disappointed that Timor-Leste has decided to resume the arbitration against Australia challenging the validity‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe Australian government reached agreement ‚Ä¶ with Timor-Leste in 2006 and we remain committed to the treaty,‚Äù Brandis and Bishop said. ‚ÄúBoth governments agreed to defer further maritime boundary negotiations during the life of the treaty. Australia remains committed to that agreement and is disappointed that Timor-Leste is attempting to re-open it.‚Äù Brandis and Bishop said the existing treaty framework had ‚Äúprovided an effective means to share resources claimed by both countries and to develop them jointly‚Äù and also provided ‚Äúthe certainty required by international companies in order to make substantial investments in the resource sector‚Äù. ‚ÄúUnder the Timor Sea treaty framework, Timor-Leste receives 90% of revenue from the ‚ÄòJoint Petroleum Development Area‚Äô and will receive 50% of the upstream revenue from the Greater Sunrise fields ‚Äì despite nearly 80% of the Greater Sunrise fields lying in an area of exclusive Australian seabed jurisdiction.‚Äù In the same statement, Brandis and Bishop said they welcomed formal notification that Timor-Leste would discontinue the ICJ case relating to documents. ‚ÄúAustralia returned the documents in question in the dispute in good faith, without acknowledgment that Australia had violated Timor-Leste‚Äôs sovereign rights,‚Äù the ministers said. The return of the documents followed a preliminary order by ICJ in March 2014 that Australia ‚Äúshall keep under seal the seized documents and electronic data and any copies thereof until further decision of the court‚Äù and ‚Äúnot interfere in any way in communications between Timor-Leste and its legal advisers in connection with the pending arbitration‚Äù. Timor-Leste said the documents were returned on 12 May under the supervision of the country‚Äôs ambassador to Australia, Abel Guterres. It pointed out Australia had defended its right to seize and hold the documents for 16 months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-05T01:49:55Z,world,World news,"Data used by Indonesia to justify drug laws is 'questionable', say experts","The credibility of government data cited by the Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, to support the country‚Äôs punitive drugs policies has been criticised by a group of leading health experts and academics in one of the world‚Äôs most eminent medical journals. In an open letter published in The Lancet on Friday, the group of Indonesian experts write that the Indonesian government‚Äôs policies of involuntary rehabilitation and the death penalty for drug users must be stopped ‚Äúurgently‚Äù. The Indonesian government frequently cites statistics from its national narcotics board, which estimates illicit drug use prevalence to to be at 2.6% ‚Äì equivalent to 4.5m people ‚Äì and suggested as many as 50 drug-related deaths were occurring every day. The authors wrote they had ‚Äúserious concerns‚Äù about the validity of those estimates because the details and methods of the studies behind the data were not publicly accessible, and from the information that was available, the study methods were questionable. ‚ÄúThe Indonesian government, led by president Joko Widodo, has heralded its commitment to evidence-based policy making,‚Äù the letter states. ‚ÄúHowever, as researchers, scientists and practitioners, we have grave concerns that the government is missing an opportunity to implement an effective response to illicit drugs informed by evidence.‚Äù The 10 signatories to the letter, from institutes including the Indonesian Drug Users Network, the University of Indonesia‚Äôs law faculty, and Jakarta‚Äôs Atma Jaya HIV-Aids Research Centre, said the government must expand evidence-based interventions, such as opioid substitution therapy, needle-and-syringe programs and rehabilitation programs based on science. Indonesia‚Äôs punitive drugs strategy has drawn global attention this year after 15 drug criminals were sentenced to death and executed by firing squad, six in January and nine in April. Widodo has frequently said there was ‚Äúno excuse‚Äù for drug traffickers and that tough approaches were needed to combat what he described as the country‚Äôs ‚Äúdrugs emergency‚Äù. But a signatory to the Lancet letter, an HIV researcher called Professor Irwanto, said a tough, war-on-drugs approach had proven to be a global failure. ‚ÄúObtaining valid estimates of drug use is not an easy, straightforward process, yet we need to make sure that national policies are based on evidence that is thoroughly peer-reviewed and transparent,‚Äù Irwanto said. ‚ÄúEach human life matters. Productive human lives may be compromised by misguided policies.‚Äù Dr Ignatius Praptoraharjo, a researcher at the faculty of medicine at Gadjah Mada University, said there was an ‚Äúethical obligation‚Äù to implement evidence-based drug policies. ‚ÄúBut despite the proven success of these interventions, political commitment and funds are lacking, and current punitive strategies in Indonesia do not provide enough space for meaningful health programs,‚Äù Praptoraharjo said. ‚ÄúOur limited funds are instead being used to bolster fear-based approaches, which effectively drive people in need further away from health programs.‚Äù The authors called on the government to be more transparent in its drugs policy data, and to turn away from ‚Äúcounterproductive‚Äù measures in favour of a drugs policy based on current scientific evidence. Professor of Asian law and director of the University of Melbourne‚Äôs centre for Indonesian Law, Tim Lindsey, said he did not doubt the Lancet letter would reach Widodo, or that it would embarrass him. ‚ÄúSimilar criticism to Indonesia‚Äôs drug policy and questions of the data and statistics used by the president have been in the media there for some months,‚Äù Lindsey said. ‚ÄúBut now that this letter has come out it gives an expert, authoritative weight to those criticisms that will further embarrass the president. There are rumours that he was annoyed and angry about the fact these drugs statistics may be unreliable after the Indonesia media first began reporting it.‚Äù However, Lindsey said it would not mean Widodo would back away from his populist, hard-line approach. His political positions was vulnerable and weak, Lindsey said, because he was yet to gain a reliable majority within the legislature. Although Widodo‚Äôs drugs approach had been criticised by the media, public opinion was still largely in favour of the death penalty for serious offences, such as terrorism and drug crimes, Lindsey said. ‚ÄúIf he‚Äôs executing people without even bothering to read their applications for clemency, and if the data on which he bases those drugs executions for being justified is shonky, it puts him a position of having executed people based on flawed data,‚Äù Lindsey said. ‚ÄúBut it will be very hard for him to back down given he has used executing people as a way of showing people he is a strong president.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-04T23:01:07Z,world,World news,Group headed by Kofi Annan urges west to help Africa fund solar panels,"A high-level international body headed by the former UN secretary general Kofi Annan has urged the west to help Africa finance a new $20bn (¬£13bn) fund to provide low-cost solar panels for the two thirds of the continent‚Äôs population that lacks access to energy. The annual Africa Progress report says there is an opportunity for Africa to bypass fossil fuels and move straight to low-carbon sources of power if aid is combined with higher taxes, an elimination of subsidies and a crackdown on illicit transfers to tax havens. Noting that electricity consumption in Spain exceeds that of sub-Saharan Africa, the report says 600,000 deaths a year ‚Äì almost half of them children ‚Äì are being caused by household air pollution caused by the burning of charcoal and firewood for cooking. Bob Geldof, one of the 10 members of the Africa progress panel, said in an interview with the Guardian: ‚ÄúThe lack of energy is crippling. Without power there is no development, economic or intellectual.‚Äù The rock musician added: ‚ÄúEnergy is the single most important key to eliminating poverty. It takes in everything. Without power, you don‚Äôt have the agriculture that‚Äôs required. You don‚Äôt have the economic development that‚Äôs required. You don‚Äôt have the education or the health that you need.‚Äù The report says Kenya has piloted a scheme that provides solar power to villages not connected to the grid. A solar panel costs $200, with customers paying for it in small instalments through their mobile phones. Geldof said: ‚ÄúHome solar kits cost $200. The price is crashing through the floor. The average poor family on less than $2.50 a day could pay 25 cents a day through their mobile phone.‚Äù Annan‚Äôs report calls for a global connectivity fund that would provide the $20bn a year annually that would ensure universal access to electricity by 2030. Half the money would come from Africa itself, with the other $10bn coming from aid and low-cost finance.
Kevin Watkins, the director of the UK Overseas Development Institute and lead author of the report, said Africa accounts for only 1% of global carbon emissions but is rich in reserves of fossil fuels. Africa had to be helped to deliver low carbon energy or it would inevitably turn to coal, oil and gas instead. The report says that access to electricity in Africa is limited and expensive. About 621 million people have no access to electricity and four out of five rely on solid biomass for cooking. ‚ÄúAfrica‚Äôs poorest households are the unwitting victims of one of the world‚Äôs starkest market failures. We estimate that the 138 million households comprising people living on less than $2.50 a day are spending $10bn annually on energy-related products, such as charcoal, candles, kerosene and firewood. ‚ÄúTranslated into equivalent cost terms, these households spend $10 per kilowatt hour on lighting, which is about 20 times the amount spent by high income households with a connection to the grid for their lighting. The average cost for electricity per kWh in the US is $0.12 and in the UK is $0.15.‚Äù According to the report, current investment in Africa‚Äôs energy sector stands at just $8bn, or 0.4% of gross domestic product. The panel estimates that the financing gap for meeting demand and achieving universal access is around $55bn, including the $20bn connectivity fund. The report adds that almost half of the gap could be covered by increasing sub-Saharan Africa‚Äôs tax-to-GDP ratio by 1% of GDP. ‚ÄúAdditional revenues could be mobilised by halting the wasteful subsidies now transferred to loss-making utilities, stemming the finance lost as a result of illicit financial transfers, and cautious recourse to bond markets.‚Äù Noting that Africa will pay the highest price for failure to avert a ‚Äúglobal climate catastrophe‚Äù while making the smallest contribution to climate change, the report says: ‚ÄúFor too long, Africa‚Äôs leaders have been content to oversee highly centralised energy systems designed to benefit the rich and bypass the poor. Power utilities have been centres of political patronage and corruption. ‚ÄúThe time has come to revamp Africa‚Äôs creaking energy infrastructure, while riding the wave of low carbon innovation that is transforming energy systems around the world. ‚ÄúMillions of Africa‚Äôs poorest people are paying among the world‚Äôs highest prices for energy because of the cost barriers separating them from affordable, efficient and accessible renewable technologies.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-04T18:56:53Z,world,World news,Greece's IMF repayment delay smacks of both desperation and defiance,"You could almost hear the gritted teeth through which the International Monetary Fund issued its terse statement acknowledging that Athens planned to miss Friday‚Äôs deadline for making a ‚Ç¨300m (¬£219m) debt repayment. The Washington-based lender, which was always wary about being dragged into Europe‚Äôs debt crisis, didn‚Äôt condemn Greece‚Äôs actions, let alone suggest that deferring the payment was tantamount to default.
It simply restated that in a little-known loophole adopted in the late 1970s, ‚Äúcountry members can ask to bundle together multiple principal payments falling due in a calendar month‚Äù. But it was clear that the IMF had received little warning of Greece‚Äôs plans. Yanis Varofakis, the country‚Äôs pugnacious finance minister, has long argued that the end of June, when the four-month extension to the country‚Äôs bailout programme the Syriza government won in February expires, is the real deadline for reaching an agreement. But the lastminute decision to delay the payment, just hours after IMF managing director, Christine Lagarde, said she fully expected it to arrive, smacked of both desperation and defiance. Greece‚Äôs stance is likely to infuriate the IMF, which doesn‚Äôt want to shoulder the blame for pushing Greece into default, but reportedly believes current plans for tackling its debt burden remain unrealistic. Even with the rest of the month now apparently available to secure a deal, the distance between Greece and its creditors remains considerable, as leaked negotiating texts from both sides suggested on Thursday. Meanwhile, both the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, who faces an uphill struggle selling any deal to his party, and Varoufakis, who has been sidelined from the talks but remains finance minister, have continued to make pungent public statements about the sacrifices of the Greek people. A deal still remains just about possible; but as the IMF ponders the ramifications of letting Friday pass without receiving its cheque, and Tsipras prepares to do battle with his own party over the creditors‚Äô latest set of demands, it feels like an increasingly slim hope.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-04T15:33:26Z,world,World news,El Salvadorans hope to revise town's beloved 'first migrant' story,"In February 1967, a humble young cotton farmer left his home in south-eastern El Salvador and made his way to Washington DC, where he eventually found work as a dishwasher. Sigfredo Ch√°vez‚Äôs odyssey was the first ripple of migration from the sleepy town of Intipuc√° to the US capital, a northwards tide that remains in full spate nearly 50 years later. Thousands of local people have followed Sigfredo‚Äôs footsteps ‚Äì around 5,000 Intipuque√±os now live in or near Washington ‚Äì and the town‚Äôs economy now largely depends on an estimated $2.5m a year in remittances from the US. Meanwhile, Ch√°vez has become a local hero whose bootstrap life story showed it was possible to start over, earn a good living in the US and send enough money home to build a town up from almost nothing. In 2006, Ch√°vez‚Äôs nephew Oscar Romero ‚Äì who works in Intipuc√°‚Äôs town hall ‚Äì erected a statue memorializing him, as the town‚Äôs ‚Äúfirst migrant‚Äù. But not everyone in Intipuc√° agrees with this version of events: some say that the audacious plan to travel to the US was dreamed up not by Ch√°vez, but by his then wife, Elba Salinas, who also travelled with him.
Hugo Salinas, a former mayor ‚Äì and Elba‚Äôs nephew ‚Äì argues that she has been erased from the town‚Äôs history and is campaigning to set the record straight. ‚ÄúHe left with Elba!‚Äù Salinas said. ‚ÄúAfter the monument to the first migrant went up in the plaza, I wanted to correct history; she was never mentioned. And she is as much the first migrant as Sigfredo was.‚Äù Elba Salinas was a single mother in her early 20s when she met and fell in love with Ch√°vez. According to her nephew, when Elba‚Äôs father refused to allow her to travel abroad, she ignored him and ran away to the US with Ch√°vez. Ch√°vez supporters are unmoved. ‚ÄúMaybe Elba was the first woman to leave Intipuc√°,‚Äù sniffed Romero. ‚ÄúBut she was not the first migrant.‚Äù
Jaqueline Portillo, the director of town cultural centre, said that the truth is unlikely ever to be known. Certainly, elements of the story seem to have been embellished in the re-telling: Ch√°vez actually came from a wealthy farming family, so his self-made image may be a fabrication. Furthermore, several other families have also made competing claims that their relatives were actually the town‚Äôs original migrant. ‚ÄúThe Ch√°vez family kept better documentation of his trip than the family of the other migrants. So there‚Äôs simply more weight to the story of him being the first migrant,‚Äù she said. Portillo and Hugo Salinas are now planning a celebration for the 50th anniversary of the first migration from the town ‚Äì whoever made the journey. ‚ÄúI want to create a positive image of my town, because no one was collecting these personal stories,‚Äù Salinas said. Much has changed since Sigfredo and Elba headed north. Intipuc√° has lost much of its young to migration: census data shows that Intipuc√°‚Äôs population has hovered at around 7,000 for the past 20 years; those who remain are mostly small children, returned migrants who have retired, and deportees from the US. Many two or three-storey homes built with remittance money sit empty except for a week in March, when richer locals return to celebrate the town‚Äôs patron saint.
Some of today‚Äôs emigrants enter the US legally on a family reunification visa. The less fortunate pay smugglers for the journey north. As elsewhere in El Salvador, most are fleeing grinding poverty or street violence which has now pushed the country‚Äôs death rate to the same levels as they were during the civil war 20 years ago. Recent crackdowns by US and Mexican migration authorities means that today‚Äôs undocumented migrants are forced to take ever-more perilous ‚Äì and more expensive ‚Äì routes. And if they do arrive in the US, they are unlikely to be hailed as heroes. On a recent morning, Oscar Romero stood beneath the clay statue of his uncle, shown with a backpack slung over his shoulder. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the first monument to emigrants in the world! Nowhere else did people have the idea to praise their first migrant‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd by the way,‚Äù he added ‚ÄúMy uncle was not an undocumented immigrant like those ones today. You can see he was facing the direction of the airport.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-04T15:12:28Z,world,World news,Egypt court hears closing arguments for three al-Jazeera journalists being retried,"Defence lawyers for three journalists on trial in Egypt over charges of broadcasting ‚Äúfalse news‚Äù and aiding the Muslim Brotherhood made closing arguments on Thursday. The nearly 18-month legal ordeal undergone by the three has been widely denounced as an attack on press freedom. Journalists Mohamed Fahmy, Baher Mohamed, and Peter Greste were arrested from a Cairo hotel room in December 2013. The three, who had been working for al-Jazeera English, were convicted and spent more than 400 days in prison following an initial trial. After an appeals court ordered a retrial last December, Greste was deported home to Australia, while Baher Mohamed and Mohamed Fahmy were released on bail in February. Greste remains on trial in abstentia. In a courtroom inside Cairo‚Äôs Tora Prison on Thursday, defence lawyer Khaled Abu Bakr refuted each of the charges against Fahmy, asserting there was no evidence of any connection between him and with the Muslim Brotherhood, which was banned and declared a terrorist organisation after the military removed president Mohamed Morsi from power in 2013. ‚ÄúHe mentioned to the judge the ABCs of journalism,‚Äù Fahmy said outside the courtroom following the session. ‚ÄúOur job is to speak to the terrorists, to the criminals, to the killers, whoever it is. Our job is just as messengers, nothing more, nothing less.‚Äù Fahmy said he believes the judge, Hassan Farid, is focussing on technical aspects of the case, in particular whether the journalists had been working with government accreditation, and whether the network was licensed to broadcast in Egypt. Fahmy blames al-Jazeera for endangering him and his colleagues and is now suing the Qatar-based network for damages. ‚ÄúI made it very clear, in very aggressive and detailed rhetoric, that we inquired, and I as bureau chief inquired, and so did my team, about the legalities of our situation, and we got confirmation from the network that we were legal,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf there is a conviction related to that specific accusation, the network needs to be accountable 100% for this issue.‚Äù The prosecutors presented their closing arguments on Monday, reiterating a narrative of the journalists operating as a ‚Äúcell‚Äù from a room in the Marriott hotel in Cairo. They alleged the journalists altered footage of protests in order to destabilise Egypt. The prosecution rests on a trove of videos, apparently seized from the journalists, presented as evidence in the trial. In an earlier session of the retrial, a court-appointed committee of experts said they found no evidence of fabrication, and could not establish that the footage had been broadcast. At the conclusion of Thursday‚Äôs session, Judge Hassan Farid adjourned the proceedings until 11 June, when other defence lawyers will present their closing arguments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-04T14:55:39Z,world,World news,Ibiza conservationists claim victory as Scottish firm abandons oil search,"It was a battle that pitted one of the world‚Äôs most notorious party islands against a push for offshore oil prospecting. Celebrities, including Kate Moss and Fatboy Slim, had lined up behind a local campaign to keep a Scottish oil explorer away from the coast of Ibiza. This week, after four years of sustained campaigning against a move that critics said would hurt tourism and wreak havoc on the area‚Äôs rich biodiversity, Cairn Energy announced it was abandoning its plans. The move was greeted with joy by Vicent Serra, president of the island‚Äôs local government. ‚ÄúBetween all of us, we did it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a triumph for Ibiza and all the effort we made to reject a project that threatened our way of life, our surroundings and our wellbeing.‚Äù In 2011 Cairn was given the green light to prospect for oil 30 miles off the coast of Ibiza. Promising jobs and prosperity for the local community and backed by a central government keen to reduce Spain‚Äôs dependency on energy imports, the company was waiting for the results of an environmental impact assessment before beginning seismic surveys.
The plans were met with staunch opposition from locals and conservationists, who worried that the search for oil would damage not only the local environment but also the tourist-dependent economy. The campaign against Cairn spread when celebrities joined in ‚Äì from Paris Hilton, who pleaded on Instagram ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let them ruin one of the most beautiful islands in the world‚Äù, to DJ Carl Cox, who led the ‚ÄúIbiza says no‚Äù campaign. Carlos Bravo, of the campaign group Alianza Mar Blava, which spent two years fighting the plans, said: ‚ÄúFor us, it‚Äôs really good news. It‚Äôs been a really intense campaign and a lot of work.‚Äù Bravo noted that the environmental impact assessment had not been made public, and claimed it would have been negative, setting an invaluable precedent for the area. ‚ÄúWe would have preferred that the assessment had come out, because it would act as a de facto prohibition on prospecting in the area,‚Äù he said. Serena Cook, of the Ibiza Preservation Fund, said this week‚Äôs victory was the first step in an ongoing push to keep the western Mediterranean free of oil prospecting. ‚ÄúThere are certainly a few more steps to go,‚Äù she said, citing plans by Spectrum, a seismic data specialist, to prospect an even wider area than that planned by Cairn. ‚ÄúBut the fact that we have had this win is extremely positive.‚Äù Cairn said it was abandoning its plans in Ibiza to focus on its offshore operations in Senegal. The widespread opposition to the plans had had little impact on the project, said a spokesperson, who added thar it would be incorrect to assume that the environmental impact assessments would have been negative. Cairn continues to move forward with plans to prospect in northern Spain‚Äôs Bay of Biscay and the Gulf of Lion, off the coast of Catalonia. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very committed to continuing to work with the ministry in terms of unlocking the potential that we think exists in Spain,‚Äù the spokesperson said. In recent years Canarians have clashed with the central government as it pushes to uncover new energy sources for a country that imports 80% of its energy. In January, the Spanish energy giant Repsol announced after two months of exploration off the islands that it had found only small deposits and would abandon its search in the area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-04T14:38:51Z,world,World news,Chinese workers face grim task recovering bodies from Eastern Star,"The boat powered south under a leaden sky towards the scene of China‚Äôs worst shipping catastrophe in 70 years. Ahead lay the wreck of the Eastern Star, the cruise ship that capsized and sank on Monday night, plunging its 456 occupants ‚Äì many of them elderly tourists ‚Äì into the Yangtze‚Äôs gloomy swell. On Thursday afternoon the vessel‚Äôs upended body poked from the water like a submarine resurfacing from the depths of what the Chinese call their Chang Jiang or Long River. Orange-clad rescue workers straddled the hull while navy divers searched the underwater graveyard below. Sparks flew as welders attached bollard-sized hooks to the vessel‚Äôs bottom with which, officials hoped, to lift it from the water. ‚ÄúLife is the most precious thing. Our rescuers are doing the utmost to save more people,‚Äù Li Keqiang, the prime minister, was quoted as saying by state media as hope of finding more survivors all but ran out.
The rescue mission ‚Äì now in its third day and looking increasingly like a recovery operation ‚Äì made grim viewing. Yet the more shocking scene lay 200 metres upstream, where two dozen workers sat under a blue tarpaulin, in three neat rows. The group wore identical uniforms ‚Äì black Wellingtons, white face-masks, elbow-length yellow rubber gloves ‚Äì and each member had the same bleak task: to bring ashore the bodies of the hundreds of people now believed to have died.
So far only 14 survivors have been found, and since Tuesday lunchtime only bodies have been pulled from the sunken ship. ‚ÄúIt is getting more and more difficult,‚Äù Dong Yan, a deputy navy commander, admitted in an interview with state media. At least 46 bodies were pulled from the shell of the Eastern Star on Thursday, the day the Guardian visited the disaster site on a vessel chartered by Chinese officials. The dead were carried down a muddy riverside path to a large white tent and then dispatched in a fleet of minivans to a nearby crematorium. There, undertakers and pathologists were waiting behind a wall of camouflage-wearing soldiers. As relatives waited to hear if their loved-ones were among the 77 now confirmed dead, questions grew over why the ship‚Äôs captain had chosen to sail into a severe rainstorm that officials have indicated was to blame for the disaster.
‚ÄúAll the other ships ‚Äì even the cargo ships ‚Äì knew to wait for the storm to pass,‚Äù said Liu Gang, a 38-year-old from Jiangsu province whose mother was on the boat. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt this one stop?‚Äù There were questions too about the company that operated the boat ‚Äì Chongqing Eastern Shipping Corp ‚Äì after it emerged that the sunken ship had been cited for safety violations two years earlier by maritime officials. Xi Jinping, the president, convened a special meeting of the elite Politburo standing committee and ordered a ‚Äúserious investigation‚Äù into the tragedy‚Äôs causes. ‚ÄúWe will never shield mistakes and we‚Äôll absolutely not cover up anything,‚Äù Xu Chengguang, a ministry of transport spokesperson, told a press conference. China‚Äôs Communist party leaders have poured huge manpower and resources into the region following Monday‚Äôs tragedy. Hundreds of troops and security officials can be seen on the streets of Jianli, the town closest to the disaster. Excavators and bulldozers line the country roads leading to rescue camps on the banks of the Yangtze. People‚Äôs Liberation Army engineers have laid 8,000 cubic metres of road to help rescuers reach the area, state-run CCTV reported on Thursday, and 10,000 cubic metres of sludge have been cleared. Propaganda chiefs in Beijing have spun that response as an unmistakable sign of the party‚Äôs commitment to its people. ‚ÄúXi Jinping gave instructions instantly while Premier Li Keqiang arrived at the scene to direct the rescue efforts in short order,‚Äù said an editorial in the state-run Global Times, praising the ‚Äúspeedy rescue efforts‚Äù.
Yet in Jianli there is also deep anger at the government, with some relatives accusing local officials of either offering them insufficient information about the rescue effort or hounding them to stay silent in their hour of need. ‚ÄúWe are followed everywhere we go, even if we just want to pop out to buy things from the shop,‚Äù one family member told the Guardian. In the early hours of Thursday around 50 family members staged a midnight march to the banks of the Yangtze in protest. ‚ÄúThe boat is still upside down. The politicians are just making speeches,‚Äù one elderly woman, whose 78-year-old husband was on the boat, told CNN. There were more angry scenes as relatives flocked to a funeral parlour in Jianli hoping to identify their dead relatives but were told they could not come in. One woman broke down in tears after she was blocked from entering the heavily guarded compound to search for her 63-year-old mother, who had been holidaying with a group of pensioner friends. ‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt tell us anything. We don‚Äôt know anything,‚Äù the woman said, after arriving at a reception centre for the bereaved in a tent outside the crematorium. When officials insisted she would not be allowed to see the bodies that had already arrived the woman erupted in a fit of rage. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt we have human rights? Why won‚Äôt you let us see the bodies?‚Äù she screamed. ‚ÄúYou have found the bodies so why won‚Äôt you let us see them? Don‚Äôt we have any human rights in China? It‚Äôs my own mother. Why can‚Äôt I see her?‚Äù As a convoy of vans set off to gather more bodies from the riverside mortuary, the woman‚Äôs husband lost his temper. ‚ÄúSomeone from our family has died, don‚Äôt you know?‚Äù he told the officials. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just cremate the body and give us a box of ashes.‚Äù Additional reporting by Luna Lin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-04T14:13:24Z,world,World news,Google apologises for Narendra Modi 'top 10 criminals' search results,"Google has apologised after photographs of the Indian prime minister started appearing in image search results for ‚Äútop 10 criminals‚Äù. Narendra Modi, who took office last year, appears alongside notorious gangsters, murderers, dictators and Justin Bieber in the search results. Google said it was sorry ‚Äúfor any confusion or misunderstanding‚Äù and blamed the results on a unspecified British news site that had published an image of Modi with erroneous metadata, the often invisible information used by websites to describe photographs and other content. ‚ÄúThese results trouble us and are not reflective of the opinions of Google,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúSometimes, the way images are described on the internet can yield surprising results to specific queries. We apologise for any confusion or misunderstanding this has caused. We‚Äôre continually working to improve our algorithms to prevent unexpected results like this.‚Äù
Other results for the search query ‚Äútop 10 criminals‚Äù include George W Bush, Muammar Gaddafi and Osama bin Laden. Several well-known Indians come up in the search results, including Delhi‚Äôs chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal; Dawood Ibrahim, a fugitive underworld leader, and Sanjay Dutt, a Bollywood actor serving a jail term in connection with deadly blasts in Mumbai in 1993. Below the search box, the results page states: ‚ÄúThese results don‚Äôt reflect Google‚Äôs opinion or our beliefs; our algorithms automatically matched the query to web pages with these images.‚Äù Google said multiple news articles with images of Modi reported his comments about politicians with criminal backgrounds. It said the articles did not link Modi to criminal activity but the words appeared in close proximity to his name. Last month Google apologised after searches that included racist terms in connection with Barack Obama found the White House on Google Maps. In 2010 the company‚Äôs search auto-complete system suggested racist queries when typing the word ‚Äúwhy‚Äù. A study by a Harvard professor found that Google‚Äôs advertising system was 25% more likely to bring up ads for criminal record checks when searching for names associated with African-Americans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-04T13:07:18Z,world,World news,"Turkish president's feud with press is rooted in a deeper, personal unease","President Recep Tayyip Erdogan‚Äôs long-running feud with Turkey‚Äôs feisty opposition media has descended into open warfare ahead of Sunday‚Äôs general election, amid claims that his ruling neo-Islamist Justice and Development party (AKP) is plotting to fix the results and shrill threats to lock up journalists and editors en masse. But Erdogan‚Äôs livid fury with the press may be rooted in a deeper, personal unease. Turkey‚Äôs apparently untouchable Teflon president, who has dominated political life since 2002 and now plans to rewrite the constitution, sideline parliament and grab sweeping dictatorial powers, increasingly fears he may have fatally misread the electorate‚Äôs mood. The AKP is still expected to emerge as the largest single party. But opinion polls are showing unexpectedly strong support for opposition parties, notably the pro-Kurdish, secular and progressive People‚Äôs Democratic party (HDP). If the HDP gains 10% or more of the vote, thereby thwarting the AKP aim of a ‚Äúsuper-majority‚Äù, Erdogan‚Äôs constitutional coup may be rendered infeasible.
Accustomed to winning easily, Erdogan has been thrown off-balance by opponents empowered by concerns over a slowing economy, unemployment, high-level corruption, the unresolved Kurdish question, and officialdom‚Äôs zero tolerance for dissent, as seen in the brutal suppression of the 2013 Gezi park street protests. The president has been ridiculed over his lavish $615m, 1,150-room presidential palace in Ankara, in particular its allegedly gold-plated toilets. ‚ÄúAs he falls from grace, the sense of total exhaustion and loss of prestige is driving him [Erdogan] to excessive aggression,‚Äù said Bulent Kenes, editor-in-chief of Today‚Äôs Zaman newspaper. ‚ÄúHe bypasses the administration of the prime minister, Ahmet Davutoƒülu, to issue his own instructions for operations. He orders the detention or arrest of dozens of people. He lambasts and threatens those who dare criticise him. ‚ÄúThreats and insults are tossed around, but Erdogan ‚Äì who gives the impression of being a paper bully ‚Äì fails to scare anyone. Honourable people from all ideologies and beliefs ‚Ä¶ can defy Erdogan and his crime syndicate with the courage of knowing they are right,‚Äù Kenes wrote. ‚ÄúIf Erdogan cannot rig the elections, it seems the AKP will not be able to form a one-party government. This would mean the end of Erdogan‚Äôs sultanistic aspirations,‚Äù said Ihsan Yilmaz in a column headlined ‚ÄúErdogan‚Äôs Jihad‚Äù. The ruling party was trying to ready the public for electoral fraud by publishing misleading opinion poll figures, he claimed. In another widely reported development, a self-styled Twitter whistleblower known as Fuat Avni published the names of 324 polling station clerks who he claimed would help the AKP fiddle Sunday‚Äôs count. Avni‚Äôs claim that Erdogan is planning a mass post-election round-up of about 200 reporters and editors from leading news media is viewed as credible, given previous purges, arrests and show trials that have left Turkey in 149th place in the World Press Freedom Index. Erdogan is not himself standing for election and, as president, is supposed to rise above the fray. Instead he has been campaigning relentlessly for the AKP. His statements have become increasingly wild and divisive as he struggles to rescue his dream of an executive presidency. Erdogan has accused the HDP of being terrorists and atheists, while failing to condemn over 70 violent attacks on HDP candidates and offices that claimed another life on Wednesday. In a speech in Bingol, he said all journalists, Armenians and gay people were ‚Äúrepresentatives of sedition‚Äù. Stung by taunts by Kemal Kilicdaroglu over his expensive taste in loos, he suggested the veteran Republican People‚Äôs party (CHP) leader would be best employed as a toilet cleaner. In other worrying outbursts, Erdogan has vowed to jail for life the editor-in-chief of Cumhuriyet newspaper, Can D√ºndar, for publishing video of Turkish intelligence agents apparently delivering weapons to Islamist fighters in northern Syria. This reporting amounted to espionage, he said. ‚ÄúThe person [D√ºndar] who committed this crime will pay a heavy price. We will not let him go,‚Äù he said. The threats against Cumhuriyet and other media have provoked international protests, including from Human Rights Watch and European parliamentarians. Erdogan appears to be past caring. He lashed out at the BBC, CNN, and the New York Times this week, claiming they were the trashy tools of an international, implicitly anti-Islamic conspiracy. ‚ÄúDo you know what their aim is? To weaken Turkey, to divide it, to disintegrate it and then to swallow it.‚Äù The weekend election now looks like a turning point. Columnist Yavuz Baydar summed it up: ‚ÄúIn a nutshell, it has turned out to be a simple choice between giving approval or not for all Erdogan now stands for: introducing to Turkey an arbitrary rule, disrespect for human dignity, rejection of supremacy of the rule of law, eradication of rights and freedoms, unaccountability and impunity, and construction of a new system in which there will be no separation of powers.‚Äù If he gets his way on Sunday, Erdogan will be unstoppable. If he is thwarted, his vengeful wrath may be dangerously unconfined.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The callup ‚Äì to run for five years from September ‚Äì will enlist young men from 19 to 27 to serve nine months each. When it was announced, the Lithuanian president said the measure was necessary because of Russia‚Äôs ‚Äúgrowing aggression‚Äù in Ukraine. Reka≈°i≈´tƒó and Ti≈°keviƒç-Hasanova took portraits of the men and noted their thoughts about conscription and masculinity in general. In the touching and haunting pictures, the men can be seen staring into or away from the camera, with tears streaming down their faces. ‚ÄúSince the conscript army was reinstated in Lithuania, more than 37,000 people have found their names on the [Ministry of National Defence‚Äôs] list of compulsory army service,‚Äù Reka≈°i≈´tƒó told the Guardian. ‚ÄúThe men in the photographs are crying because in social media and mass media in Lithuania, the common opinion of people is that you have to ‚Äòman up‚Äô, not to be a ‚Äòcry baby‚Äô, not act as ‚Äòa coward‚Äô and go to the army. That those nine months won‚Äôt change anything in your life. ‚ÄúTo have a different opinion about conscription and masculinity is absolutely unpopular. We wanted to say that there is nothing wrong with tears and expressing emotions.‚Äù Reka≈°i≈´tƒó said her main priority was to ignite a discussion about what masculinity is in Lithuania. Questions around sexism and gender stereotypes pervade the project. ‚ÄúThe Lithuanian head of parliament, Loreta Grau≈æinienƒó, said that ‚Äòwomen have to tend to the family and make babies, while men go to [the] army‚Äô. ‚ÄúMasculinity is still understood very shallowly, in strict gendered norms; you are not a man if you don‚Äôt want to go to the army. But forcing stereotypical expectations of manliness can be dangerous. The percentage of men who commit suicide in Lithuania is very high.‚Äù Participants for the project were found through social media. ‚ÄúBeata is a very popular actress and TV host in Lithuania with a big number of followers. So we used her Facebook account to recruit the men. All of them were informed of the kind of project that this would be. All of them said yes, except one,‚Äù Reka≈°i≈´tƒó said.
She added that the artists understood that the geopolitical climate in Lithuania ‚Äúis tough at the moment‚Äù with Russia viewed as a threat to the country‚Äôs security. ‚ÄúHaving a tragic history related to the former Soviet Union, massive deportations of Lithuanian people to Siberia and other atrocities which were committed by the former Soviet Union are deep in our memory. So, I think that strengthening the military is an important priority in Lithuania today,‚Äù Reka≈°i≈´tƒó said. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt agree with with the randomness of the conscript army. I think it is un-democratic to force people to serve in the army. So that is what inspired me and Beata to make this project. We wanted to make the other side heard too.‚Äù The artists have been much criticised for doubting the state and questioning tradition. Military service remains an extremely sensitive issue in Lithuania. ‚ÄúThe first day the project came out, we were called the traitors of the country and the enemies of the state. People think it puts Lithuanian men to shame and it can be used as Russian propaganda,‚Äù Reka≈°i≈´tƒó said. ‚ÄúWe wanted to give a platform to present a different view of the conscript army. But our view is on the margins.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-04T12:06:43Z,world,World news,Escalation of fighting in east Ukraine leaves ceasefire teetering on the brink,"After several months of shaky ceasefire, east Ukraine has seen the first bout of serious fighting since February, with clashes this week leaving up to 21 dead and prompting fears of a resumption of full-blown conflict in the region. Speaking in his annual address to parliament in Kiev on Thursday, Ukraine‚Äôs president, Petro Poroshenko, said there was now a ‚Äúcolossal threat of the resumption of large-scale hostilities by Russian and terrorist forces‚Äù. He claimed there were 9,000 Russian troops currently in the rebel-controlled areas of east Ukraine. Underlining the seriousness of the situation the UN security council will hold an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss the escalation of fighting. The Ukrainians said five of their soldiers had died in fighting around the town of Marinka on Wednesday, while the self-proclaimed Donetsk people‚Äôs republic said 16 fighters and five civilians had been killed. Both sides reported dozens of wounded in the battles. As usual, both sides blamed the other for initiating the fighting. A report on Russian television recounted how Ukrainian forces were using artillery against separatist positions, forbidden by the Minsk accords, the ceasefire terms agreed in Belarus in February. The Ukrainians said they only moved the weapons back to the frontline after they were attacked with tanks by the rebels. A special report from observers on the ground with the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) strongly suggested the separatist fighters had gone on the offensive first. Marinka was originally a settlement of around 9,000 people before the war broke out a year ago. In recent months it has become the frontline along the main road out of Donetsk to the west, with a number of rebel and Ukrainian checkpoints in close proximity. The other major hotspot currently is the town of Shirokyne, the last Ukraine-held settlement before the rebels would be in sight of Mariupol, a major city, and a potential target if Russia wanted to drive a land bridge through to newly annexed Crimea. A ceasefire between government and separatists was agreed in Febuary after negotiations between the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany in Minsk.
Russia is under western sanctions for its role in Ukraine, but has consistently denied being a party to the conflict. ‚ÄúAll agreements should be fully implemented so that no one is able to derail fragile progress by resuming military activity,‚Äù the Russian foreign ministry wrote on its Twitter feed, quoting minister Sergei Lavrov. ‚ÄúWe must know who is shelling communities, thereby violating not only the Minsk agreements, but also international humanitarian law.‚Äù Lavrov blamed Kiev for this week‚Äôs upsurge in fighting. ‚ÄúThe February Minsk agreements are constantly under threat because of the actions of the Kiev authorities, trying to walk away from their obligations to foster direct dialogue with Donbass,‚Äù he said. Two men believed to be soldiers with Russia‚Äôs GRU military intelligence are in custody in Kiev having been apprehended near Luhansk last month. The men have said they were serving soldiers in a number of interviews, but Russia has again insisted they were not. For a year Russia has denied all involvement in the conflict despite an overwhelming amount of evidence to the contrary. Last week the OSCE observers said they had witnessed a group of armed men wearing uniforms with Russian military markings in the conflict zone, as well as vehicles with Russian military plates. On Wednesday, the Interfax news agency quoted Valentina Matvienko, speaker of the upper house of Russia‚Äôs parliament, saying it was possible an extraordinary session of the house could be called in the coming days. This is the mechanism by which Russia can officially authorise the use of its troops on foreign territory. Later, however, the report was said to be a fake by a spokesperson for the parliamentary body. Additionally, Igor Strelkov, a retired Russian officer who led rebel armed forces until August last year, claimed that the Kremlin‚Äôs powerful point man on east Ukraine, Vladislav Surkov, had made a secret trip to Donetsk in the past week to meet with rebel leaders. Although the Minsk document contains a comprehensive peace plan involving holding elections under Ukrainian law in east Ukraine and returning to Kiev control of the border with Russia, most observers believe the full provisions are unlikely to be carried out. ‚ÄúMinsk is impossible to fulfil in practice and in theory, and that was obvious from the very first days,‚Äù a European diplomat based in Kiev told the Guardian recently. ‚ÄúIt was a stopgap measure to stop the bloodshed. We have to have a plan B. But as far as I can see there is no plan B.‚Äù Last month the US secretary of state, John Kerry, visited Sochi and held talks with Russia‚Äôs president, Vladimir Putin. A week later, US assistant secretary of state Victoria Nuland travelled to Moscow to follow up with meetings on Ukraine, as well as on Russian policy on Syria and Iran. Both Kerry and Putin affirmed their commitments to solving the Ukraine crisis through the Minsk agreement. Western leaders have repeatedly called on Russia to stop interfering in east Ukraine, and have offered military training to Ukrainian forces, but are unwilling to go further and provide weapons, fearful of igniting an even bigger conflict. Analysts say the resumption of a full-blown war still remains unlikely, with Russia unwilling to move to a full-scale open invasion, and Kiev militarily incapable of winning the territory back without enormous losses. However, the fluid situation on the ground means there is always the risk that minor skirmishes escalate into renewed conflict. Over 8,000 people have died since hostilities started a year ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-04T09:35:24Z,world,World news,Bog off! President Erdo√Ñ≈∏an responds to golden toilet accusations,"Name: Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. Age: 61. Appearance: For legal reasons, it‚Äôs best to describe his appearance as ‚ÄúSomeone who definitely doesn‚Äôt own any golden toilets‚Äù. That‚Äôs it? This is the worst game of Guess Who ever. This is about Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, president of Turkey. Right. And he‚Äôs famous for not owning any golden toilets? Yes. Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan definitely does not own any golden toilets. I really can‚Äôt make that clear enough. That‚Äôs funny, because he looks like the type of man who would probably own at least one golden toilet. Don‚Äôt say that! You never accuse Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan of owning a golden toilet. Never! Why not? Because he‚Äôll sue you. At a rally on Saturday, opposition leader Kemal Kili√ßdaroƒülu implied that Erdoƒüan went to the toilet on a gold-plated seat, and now Erdoƒüan is demanding the equivalent of ¬£24,000 in compensation from him.
So that he can buy himself a golden toilet? Is that how much they cost? No! Stop saying that! Any more of this and we‚Äôll be in deep trouble. Why? We can stump up ¬£24,000, can‚Äôt we? We could do a Kickstarter. It‚Äôs worse than that. We‚Äôre also a newspaper. And if there‚Äôs one thing that Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan hates more than people who accuse him of owning a golden toilet, it‚Äôs newspapers. How so? A Turkish newspaper recently published a video apparently showing Turkey‚Äôs state intelligence helping to arm Syrian rebels, an act it had previously denied. And now Erdoƒüan wants the editor jailed for life for ‚Äúcrimes against the government‚Äù. Yeesh. Is there anything about him that we can say? Well, he‚Äôs on record as saying that women and men should not be treated equally because ‚Äúit goes against the laws of nature‚Äù and that Israel is worse than Hitler, so there‚Äôs that. I‚Äôm starting to think that Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan might not be such a great guy. Don‚Äôt say that. He‚Äôs ace! He once threatened to destroy Twitter in a show of nationalistic might, for instance. Well, fair‚Äôs fair, I guess. Give him all the golden toilets he needs. Stop it! Do say: ‚ÄúRecep Tayyip Erdoƒüan does not own any golden toilets.‚Äù Don‚Äôt say: ‚ÄúBut he wipes his bum on a mink rug. Can we say that? No?‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-04T09:17:03Z,world,World news,MPs David Davis and Tom Watson in court challenge over surveillance act,"Two MPs ‚Äì the Conservative David Davis and Labour‚Äôs Tom Watson ‚Äì have joined forces for a combined challenge against emergency surveillance legislation introduced by the coalition last year. Their high court claim aims to overturn powers created by the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 (Dripa) which was rushed through parliament last July. Dinah Rose QC, appearing for both MPs at London‚Äôs high court, said: ‚ÄúThe claimants I represent are both distinguished members of parliament who are not very often to be seen sitting next to each other on the same front bench.‚Äù Both MPs, she said, had a particular need to protect the confidentiality of their contacts with constituents and other members of the public ‚Äì including whistleblowers ‚Äì who might approach them with sensitive information. Both appreciated the importance of communications data in relation to the fight against crime and terrorism. However, Rose continued: ‚ÄúTheir concern is that this legislation doesn‚Äôt contain the necessary minimum safeguards to protect against the risk of arbitrary, disproportionate or abusive retention and use of personal data, and for that reason it breaches the fundamental right to privacy.‚Äù Dripa contains the same flaws as those identified in an EU directive on data retention that was overturned by the European court of justice (ECJ) last year in the case of Digital Rights Ireland, she told Lord Justice Bean and Mr Justice Collins. During Rose‚Äôs submission, Collins said that there were plenty of examples of speedy legislation that had ‚Äúfrequently led to disastrous results‚Äù. In the legal challenge, which is backed by the human rights organisation Liberty, the MPs argue that the legislation is incompatible with Article 8 of the European convention on human rights, the right to respect for private and family life, and Articles 7 and 8 of the EU charter of fundamental rights, respect for private and family life and protection of personal data. The MPs complain that use of communications data is not limited to cases involving serious crime, that individual notices of data retention are kept secret and that no provision is made for those under obligation of professional secrecy, in particular lawyers and journalists. Nor, they argue, are there adequate safeguards against communications data leaving the European Union. The prime minister, David Cameron, and the then deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, said last year that the acceleration of Dripa through parliament was necessary because of an emergency created by a ruling in April last year by the ECJ, which they said would have the effect of denying police and security services access to vital data about phone and email communications. They insisted the act would simply maintain existing powers, which required communications companies to retain data for 12 months for possible investigation, but did not allow police or security agencies to access the content of calls or emails without a warrant. According to the Interception of Communications Commissioner‚Äôs Office, the court was told, there were 517,236 notices and authorisations for communications data issued by public authorities last year plus a further 55,346 urgent oral authorisations. Each authorisation may cover numerous individuals. Emma Norton, legal officer for Liberty, said in a statement: ‚ÄúThe executive dominance of parliament in rushing through this legislation ‚Äì using a wholly fabricated ‚Äòemergency‚Äô ‚Äì made a mockery of parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of law, and showed a staggering disregard for the entire population‚Äôs right to privacy. ‚ÄúIt is thanks to the Human Rights Act that we are able to challenge the government‚Äôs actions ‚Äì the same government which now seeks to axe that very piece of legislation and, by doing so, curb the British people‚Äôs ability to do so in future.‚Äù Liberty said it did not dispute the role of communications data in solving and preventing crime, ‚Äúbut does not believe that justifies the costly and lengthy mass retention of records of those who are not involved in such investigations‚Äù. It is calling for prior judicial authorisation and a requirement that data is only retained as part of investigations into serious crime and to prevent death and injury. The Law Society, Privacy International and the Open Rights Group have all intervened in the case. In a prepared statement, Watson said: ‚ÄúThe government‚Äôs decision to use emergency powers to enable it to spy on citizens shows the rights of the individual need to be strengthened to ensure the state can‚Äôt act with impunity. ‚ÄúEven MPs are powerless to prevent such powers being enacted. The Human Rights Act allows us to challenge those powers in the courts but the Tory government is intent on tearing up the act and doing away with the limited legal protection it affords. It is vital that we fight for it to be retained.‚Äù Outside the court, Davis said the government had declared a ‚Äúbogus emergency really to push [Dripa] through the house in one day‚Äù, providing official access to data ‚Äúfor not very serious crimes or not even crimes at all‚Äù. He added: ‚ÄúThose are very serious constitution issues. They go right to the heart of the privacy of every Briton and they‚Äôre not the sort of thing that‚Äôs traditional in this country.‚Äù There was no choice, he said, but to challenge the law in court. The hearing will continue on Friday. Judgment is expected to be reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-04T08:33:59Z,world,World news,Orange says it plans to terminate contract with brand partner in Israel,"The French telecoms giant Orange has indicated that it intends to terminate its relationship with the Israeli company that licenses its brand in the country ‚Äì and would end the relationship ‚Äútomorrow‚Äù if it could. The comments ‚Äì made by the company‚Äôs CEO, Stephane Richard ‚Äì have emerged amid a sharp push back by the Israeli government against growing calls for an international boycott of Israel over its continuing occupation of Palestinian territories. They were angrily condemned by the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, who called on the French government to ‚Äúdistance itself publicly from the miserable statement and the miserable action of a company that is partially owned by the government of France.‚Äù Although Orange only licenses its name to the Israeli company Partner, the threat ‚Äì if carried through ‚Äì will be seen as a major success for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement which has been campaigning on the issue in both France and Egypt. Orange, in which the French government has a quarter stake, has been under pressure in France as well as in Egypt to terminate its relationship with Partner over its supply of services to Israeli settlements regarded as illegal under international law. Last month Orange was accused of flouting the French foreign ministry‚Äôs own guidelines on investing in Israel by the Catholic Committee against Hunger and for Development. In a report published in May the group claimed that Partner had built more than 100 telecommunication antennas on confiscated Palestinian land, as well as operating four shops in Israeli settlements. Speaking at a news conference in Cairo to lay out plans for the years ahead in Egypt, Richard said that his company intended to withdraw the Orange brand from Israel as soon as possible, but that the move would take time. ‚ÄúI am ready to abandon this tomorrow morning but the point is that I want to secure the legal risk for the company. I want to terminate this, once again, but I don‚Äôt want to expose Orange to a level of risk and of penalties that could be really sizeable for the company,‚Äù he said. Richard said his company‚Äôs stance on the matter was the result of its sensitivity to Arab countries. ‚ÄúI know that it is a sensitive issue here in Egypt, but not only in Egypt ... We want to be one of the trustful partners of all Arab countries.‚Äù He added that the brand fees from the contract with Partner were low compared to the size of Orange, saying that ‚Äúthe interest for us is certainly not a financial interest‚Äù. ‚ÄúIf you take those amounts on one side and on the other side the time that we spend to explain this, to try to find a solution and the consequences that we have to manage here but also in France, believe me it‚Äôs a very bad deal,‚Äù he added. At the news conference, Richard explained that the use of the Orange brand name in Israel dated back to the 1990s, under a contract inherited by the group when France Telecom acquired Orange. Recent negotiations have put Orange in a position where it can terminate the contract in the future, but at the moment the legal framework was not favourable, he said. Partner is Israel‚Äôs second biggest mobile company. Partner said in response that it regrets Richard‚Äôs comments. ‚ÄúWe wish to highlight that Partner Communications is an Israeli company owned by Saban Capital Group, which is owned by Haim Saban, and not by France Telecom (Orange). The company is holding the Orange brand name since 1998, and the only connection between us and France Telecom is the brand name.‚Äù Israel‚Äôs deputy foreign minister, Tzipi Hotovely, wrote to Richard asking for clarification. ‚ÄúI must admit to have been taken aback by these reports which do not become a responsible global company such as Orange,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúI am confident that these reports do not reflect the intent of your company. I therefore urge you to clarify the matter as soon as possible.‚Äù Yair Lapid, head of the opposition Yesh Atid party, also attacked Richard for the comments, and called on state-run France Telecom, which owns a majority stake in Orange, to distance itself from the comments. ‚ÄúThis is hypocrisy of the highest order,‚Äù he said in a statement. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember him having a problem making money here and profiting from Israeli citizens. The state of Israel is an island of sanity in this difficult neighbourhood and we certainly won‚Äôt accept lessons in morality from someone so self-righteous and detached.‚Äù The row over Richard‚Äôs comments came as the US ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro, pointedly remarked that the threats to boycott Israel were being driven, in part, by a lack of peace negotiations. ‚ÄúThe problem is that now there are no negotiations,‚Äù Shapiro told Israel Radio. ‚ÄúIn the past when there were negotiations, that was the most effective tool to tell other countries, perhaps private companies as well, not to impose sanctions because that would upset efforts to reach a solution.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-04T08:12:36Z,world,World news,Dozens killed in Ghana petrol station explosion,"At least 73 people were killed when a petrol station exploded in the Ghanaian capital Accra while it was being used as temporary shelter from torrential rain. Many of the victims were commuters trying to escape the downpour when flood water swept stored oil towards a fire, according to a fire official. Billy Anaglate, a spokesman for the Ghana fire service, said the emergency services had recovered dozens of bodies from the scene at a Goil filling station on the busy Kwame Nkrumah Circle north of the city centre. Referring to the death toll, Anaglate said: ‚ÄúWe are still trying to salvage the site of the accident before we can come out with an accurate figure.‚Äù He said flooding ‚Äúcaused the diesel and petrol to flow away from the gas station, and fire from a nearby house led to the explosion‚Äù. Later, the Ghanaian president, John Mahama, visited the scene, offering condolences and help to the families of the victims. He described the explosion as ‚Äúcatastrophic and unprecedented‚Äù.
Graphic footage broadcast on national television showed corpses being piled into the back of a pickup truck and other charred bodies trapped amid the debris. Neighbouring buildings that had caught fire burned into the night as flood waters around the site hampered recovery efforts.
‚ÄúMany people took shelter under a shed at the station during a severe rain across the country and got trapped when the explosion happened,‚Äù Michael Plange, who lives nearby, told Associated Press. Images from the scene showed the remains of at least six vehicles under a charred petrol station canopy.
Accra‚Äôs city authorities had already been under pressure to declare a state of emergency after hours of heavy rain caused severe flooding in and around the capital. Britain‚Äôs high commissioner to Ghana, Jon Benjamin, expressed his condolences to the families of the victims, on Twitter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-04T08:00:06Z,world,World news,"Female genital mutilation practised in Iran, study reveals","The first authoritative study into female genital mutilation in Iran has found the practice is being carried out in at least four major provinces while officials are silent on the matter. According to research by social anthropologist Kameel Ahmady released on Thursday, FGM is more prevalent in the southern province of Hormozgan and its nearby islands (Qeshm and Hormuz) than in any other parts of the country. It is also being practised to a lesser degree in Kurdistan, Kermanshah and West Azerbaijan provinces, which are situated in western Iran close to the Iraq border. Ahmady‚Äôs research shows that FGM is mainly an issue concerning the Shafi‚Äôi sect of Sunni Muslim Iranians, a minority in the Shia-dominated country. Only a small fraction of the Shia population living in proximity of Sunni communities practise FGM. ‚ÄúFGM is practised in Iran in some cases to tame girls‚Äô sex drive before marriage; it is made to preserve their chastity,‚Äù said Ahmady. ‚ÄúThe attitude of officials and authorities is that FGM doesn‚Äôt exist in Iran. The Iranian public is also largely ignorant about the subject.‚Äù Ahmady first decided to focus on FGM in Iran when he was working with relief NGOs in Africa in early 2000s. Over the course of 10 years he has spoken to around 3,000 Iranian women who have experienced FGM in Iran, as well as 1,000 men. His research was published to coincide with the International Day of Innocent Children Victims of Aggression, observed every year on 4 June. ‚ÄúI returned to Iran in 2005 to study FGM in my home country and instantly I was shocked to discover that it even happened to the closest members of my own family and relatives,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn fact, many in Iran don‚Äôt have a clue that [FGM] is being practised in some parts of the country.‚Äù FGM, which has affected millions of girls and women alive worldwide, predates Islam and Christianity and has been practised in many different cultures and societies, from Coptic and Catholic Christians in Eritrea and in Ethiopia, to Beta Israel society, Australian aboriginal tribes and some parts of the Middle East and Asia. It is usually performed on girls between the ages of four and 12 and can include partial or in extreme cases total removal of external parts of female genitalia. In Iran, the practice, referred to as Khatne or Sonat, is usually carried out outside hospital without anaesthesia or prior consent by amateur midwives. The tools used include sharp razors. Mehrangiz Kar, a leading Iranian human rights lawyer, said it was tragic that such mutilation was carried out by women. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of those instances where the violence against women is carried out by women in unhygienic circumstances,‚Äù she told the Guardian. ‚ÄúIn areas where FGM exists, unfortunately it‚Äôs usually the mothers who insist that their daughters should be cut.‚Äù In at least one extreme case which had involved stitching up after cutting, Kar said an Iranian mother refused to allow her daughter to have her stitches removed before marriage. ‚ÄúThe daughter told me that she was afraid of marriage; she feared she would have pain during sexual intercourse.‚Äù Although Ahmady‚Äôs research is unprecedented in its depth, other people have also studied FGM in Iran, including Fatemeh Karimi and Rayehe Mozafarian, who have both published books on the subject. Mozafarian said that the Iranian authorities had let activists research FGM in Iran and had allowed those books to be published. ‚ÄúWhen people in Iran learned for the first time seven or eight years ago that women are being cut there, it was a cultural shock,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúPeople didn‚Äôt believe that it was being practised.‚Äù Mozafarian said she had reached out to the country‚Äôs vice president for women‚Äôs affairs, Shahindokht Molaverdi, who is considering her proposal for a nationwide campaign to end FGM. Iran‚Äôs penal code criminalises mutilation but does not specifically mention FGM. Mozafarian warned that in some parts of Khuzestan province, home to many Arab Iranians, an extreme form of FGM known as infibulation, which involves the removal of the clitoris as well as the narrowing of the vaginal opening by creating a covering seal, is being practised. Influenced by events in the neighbouring Kurdistan region of Iraq, which prohibited FGM in 2007, female circumcision is in decline in Iran‚Äôs Kurdistan but still goes on. Hormozgan is less affected by that change. Not all Sunni Iranians practise FGM, such as those belonging to the Hanafi sect or those living in other provinces. In West Azerbaijan, FGM exists among Sunni Shafi‚Äôi Kurds of Sorani dialect but not among Sunni Shafie Kurds of Kermanji dialect, Ahmady‚Äôs report shows. In Iran‚Äôs Kurdistan, where prevalence of FGM is patchy, it is mainly seen in rural areas, some villages and communities but not usually in urban areas. Even in provinces where FGM exists, many communities do not practise it. ‚ÄúThe majority of women I spoke to who were circumcised defended FGM, saying that it is a tradition that had existed for hundreds of years,‚Äù said Ahmady. ‚ÄúSome Sunni mums even boasted that their daughters were more virtuous than the majority Shia girls because they were cut.‚Äù Shia clerics also avoid interfering in what they see as a Sunni issue. The government, wary of inciting anti-Shia sentiment among the country‚Äôs Sunni minority, is also largely quiet. In Hormozgan, minimal traces of FGM is seen in Shia communities in some village, the report shows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-04T06:00:04Z,world,World news,Down with women-only literary prizes,"The unveiling of the Baileys prize for female fiction is a reminder that the drink has proved a risky tipple for men. Over Christmas a burglar in Warrington was caught after forensics found his fingerprints on a bottle. In Cameroon last year, a man was jailed on a charge of homosexuality with only his choice of digestif as evidence. Neither does the brand encourage equal-opportunity consumption. Its ads are strictly targeted at one gender, from the Here‚Äôs to Us promo, in which a girl gang goes round the country, with Baileys their refreshment of choice, to the Mother‚Äôs Day push, (slogan: celebrate all that you share). Some posters for that campaign include suggestions showing how to make shots extra special with various toppings, such as caramel and whipped cream and, for the health-conscious, three cubes of apple on a little stick. The Baileys prize, which took place on Wednesday evening , and was formerly the Orange prize is, of course, not open to men. It operates on the logic that positive discrimination is still required in a field in which half the bestselling authors are women, as are six of the 10 most recent Booker prizewinners. To me, the idea of a gender-specific prize for fiction is as offensive as a gender-specific drink. Real women should boycott such things. Similarly, real men can reasonably, moderately, drink Baileys. They need not worry that others might judge them. My ex-boyfriend‚Äôs lovely dad used to pour it on his puddings as a sauce. My current boyfriend bought me a bottle as a birthday present last month. He felt no shame in the purchase,. On Saturday, I went on a trip on the Sir Walter Scott steamship round Loch Katrine in the Scottish Trossachs: a fine boat with a small bar offering such delights as the Rob Roy (Baileys and hot chocolate). As we set off, the steward issued a caution over the intercom: due to their strength, the number of Rob Roys served to each customer would be capped: no more than at 12 per person. Now that‚Äôs what I call a macho challenge. Guilt trip In his new movie, Valley of Love, G√©rard Depardieu plays the former partner of Isabelle Huppert, with whom he reunites in Death Valley at the request of their dead son. ‚ÄúI got fat,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúWhatever makes you happy,‚Äù she shrugs. ‚ÄúHow could I possibly be happy like this?‚Äù he replies. Such a conflicted sense of obesity (blithely guzzling yet guilty and sad) contrasts curiously with Melissa McCarthy‚Äôs undercutting of fat gags in the new comedy Spy. In contrast to Bridesmaids and The Heat, the joke is on those who pigeonhole her on account of her size. It‚Äôs clearly a healthier approach ‚Äì and Spy is terrific fun. Yet something about Depardieu‚Äôs sweaty regret feels more genuine. Sam‚Äôs sim To watch Lisa Dwan perform three late Beckett monologues in a pit at the Barbican is to experience serious sensory deprivation. As well as the stripped-back dialogue and staging, the house lights were off throughout, and the audience ‚Äì instructed at the start to turn off their mobiles ‚Äì were so quiet a rumbling tum was the closest thing to a chorus line. It was an astonishing performance, spoiled only by someone accidentally enabling their phone‚Äôs voice activation at the end. So, as the final protracted fade-out into total silence and darkness began, the closing lines rang out: ‚ÄúSay a command‚Äù, repeated three times; then ‚ÄúCommand not recognised‚Äù, twice. I say spoiled; in fact, it sounded quite Beckettian. And, as someone with faint claustrophobia who clutches their mobile at all times, even when it‚Äôs off, such interruption did come as weird relief.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-04T04:00:01Z,world,World news,How to succeed in Iran: lessons from Russia and China,"As the Hassan Rouhani government woos western capitals in anticipation of a nuclear deal and the end of sanctions, foreign investors eying opportunities in Iran would do well to remember the lessons from the economies of the crumbled Soviet Union circa 1991 or gaizhi-era China over a decade later: strengthen your legal team, treat trust like a commodity, and beware of cephalopods. Since the administration of economically pragmatic President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iranian governments have attempted to sell large portions of the mostly state-owned economy to ‚Äúthe real private sector.‚Äù But after trying out a range of ideological strategies and transferring large volumes of capital, over 80% of it ended up in the tentacles of organizations linked to the regime: banks, military enterprises, religious foundations, pension funds and populism-driven welfare projects, according to Princeton University scholar Kevan Harris. Far from entering a green field of opportunities, as some members of the Rouhani administration would have them believe, foreign investors will have to reckon with around 120 pseudo-private entities that by the estimates of former deputy industry minister Mohsen Safai Farahani account for half the country‚Äôs gross domestic product.
‚ÄúThe quasi-governmental players are powerful and like octopuses over the Iranian economy,‚Äù says Marvin Zonas from the University of Chicago‚Äôs Booth School of Business. ‚ÄúNonetheless, major foreign firms will work out relations with many of them which are eager for greater efficiencies‚Ä¶ But the underlying culture is not likely to change anytime soon. Nor is the country‚Äôs closed political structure.‚Äù
Still, Iran is home to dozens of foreign firms that have tackled the intricacies of the local business environment. Following the suit of manufacturers and engineering firms from Turkey and China, whose governments never fully implemented the sanctions regime, South Korea‚Äôs Samsung and a several European automakers restarted their activities in Iran, taking advantage of sector-specific exemptions announced by the United States after the start of the nuclear negotiations in 2013. Most international banks are unlikely to touch Iran-based transactions as long as the sanctions on the country‚Äôs financial system remain in place, so companies like Chinese computer manufacturer Lenovo or French carmaker Renault rely on oil-for-product swaps and other types of barter. While these measures help meet the immediate needs of a consumer market starved for foreign products, the involved firms are often slated by the Iranian press for cutting disadvantageous deals that hinder the country‚Äôs long-term economic prospects.
Returning emigrants, who have been trickling back into Iran after the last presidential election, have also made exploratory investments, but many report struggling against a culture of corruption and distrust. In an interview for an article on business culture in the Islamic republic, a veteran corporate lawyer in Iran told Tehran Bureau that breach-of-contract cases have mushroomed in recent years, raising the legal costs of business transactions. Irregularities on the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE), populated mainly by large industrial holdings co-owned by pseudo-private entities, are also common. Last month, 43 individuals bought up 18 million shares of Mobin Petrochemical Company on a single day of trading, causing share prices to rise by over 30%. A parliamentary committee later cancelled the transaction, which TSE managers said was caused by ‚Äúdefects in stock trading software.‚Äù
Andreas Schweitzer, CEO of the Swiss-Iranian consultancy Arjan Capital, says he employs a disproportionately large legal team to address the ‚Äúspecial circumstances‚Äù of the Iranian business environment. ‚ÄúYou have to look at Iran as a Chinese or Russian economy that is highly state-owned,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúYou have to make a decision if you accept this. If you do, you have to adjust yourself. We don‚Äôt believe that one should go to Iran with just a little bit of business, because the cost is too high.‚Äù When the government controls most of the economy, ‚ÄúYou cannot prevent that big buyouts are made to government entities. One can‚Äôt blame the system as such - one can only privatise again,‚Äù Schweitzer says. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the government is getting the best value for its assets. If this is the goal, and if one wants to attract money from western investment banks, the process should be competitive.‚Äù Schweitzer‚Äôs business activities in Iran began eight years ago, with a wind farm construction project in the country‚Äôs northwest. The renewable energy sector was exempt from sanctions and wind was a topic of national interest, allowing Schweizer and his partners to access subsidized loans. Together with an Iranian co-investor based in Tabriz, they approached now-Energy Minister Hamid Chitchian, a former Revolutionary Guards intelligence unit head, and completed the four 200-page licenses required and environmental studies. The company was compelled to pause the project amid the inflation and political uncertainty of the late Ahmadinejad era, but to Schweitzer, that all comes with the territory. ‚ÄúYou have to adjust a bit to the geopolitical weather,‚Äù he says. To succeed in Iran, Schweitzer recommends raising capital locally and taking advantage of existing infrastructure and expertise. Ideally, the only imports should be upper management and know-how, he says. Now, Arjan Capital consults foreign firms interested in a range of sectors: construction, hospitality, energy and branded retail. ‚ÄúLike the Chinese, the Iranians love western brands, so we bring a few very serious companies...with a long-term vision,‚Äù Schweitzer adds. ‚ÄúNo one comes to build just one hotel. They are coming to stay because the cost of getting established is significant.‚Äù As in other transitioning economies, staffing poses a particular challenge for foreign firms. After years of isolation from international trends, Iranian workers lack the skills to fill middle and upper management positions. ‚ÄúIf you needed in Russia 20 years ago 16 interviews to fill one job, you‚Äôre looking at double that in Iran,‚Äù Schweitzer says. Domestic politics are also likely to affect the role of western businessmen, who will likely have to collaborate with pseudo-private companies and various factions of Iran‚Äôs rulings elite to get their projects off the ground. ‚ÄúI doubt things are going to open up for American companies any time soon,‚Äù said an Iranian expat doing business there. ‚ÄúEuropeans will partner up with companies linked to the Revolutionary Guards, the bonyads and social welfare organisations to snatch up a lot of the good deals, and the regime will silence hardline opponents of the nuclear deal by handing them the crumbs.‚Äù Schweitzer adds that Iran remains a managed economy, and investors should not overestimate the country‚Äôs readiness to handle a foreign influx in people and products. ‚ÄúEven if there‚Äôs a lot of enthusiasm and pressure built up, it‚Äôs a wiser move to make this process organized over a few years,‚Äù says Schweizer. ‚ÄúOtherwise, it will be a tsunami that could do more damage than good.‚Äù This article was amended to reflect that Arjan Capital completed four 200-page licenses for its windmill construction project in northwestern Iran. The original article stated that 200 licenses were originally required.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-04T00:41:04Z,world,World news,Texas executes Lester Bower after 31 years on death row,"Lester Bower became the oldest prisoner executed by Texas in the modern era on Wednesday after the US supreme court rejected the 67-year-old‚Äôs last-day appeal. Bower spent 31 years on death row after being convicted of killing four men at an aircraft hangar near Dallas in 1983. He has always maintained his innocence and had appeals pending for the vast majority of his three decades behind bars. After six previous stays of execution, he finally ran out of options and was put to death with a lethal dose of the sedative pentobarbital at the state penitentiary in Huntsville, near Houston. ‚ÄúMuch has been written about this case, not all of it has been the truth,‚Äù Bower said in his final statement, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. ‚ÄúBut the time is over and now it is time to move on. I want to thank my attorneys for all that they have done. They have afforded me the last quarter of a century. ‚ÄúI would like to thank my wife, my daughters, family and friends for unwavering support, and all of the letters and well wishes over the years. Now it is time to pass on. I have fought the good fight, I held the faith. I am not going to say goodbye, I will simply say until we meet again. I love you very, very much. Thank you warden.‚Äù
Bower is the eighth Texas prisoner executed this year using compounded pentobarbital from an unknown source. Legal challenges and problems finding suitable drugs have restricted the death penalty‚Äôs application to all but five states in 2015. Only Texas and Missouri have carried out executions since Warren Hill died in Georgia on 27 January. Texas, though, has another four executions scheduled between 18 June and 6 October. Since 1976, when capital punishment was reinstated in the US, nine prisoners have been on death row in Texas longer than Bower but only David Powell, executed in 2010 after 32 years, has been killed by the state after serving more time there. Bower argued that he was innocent, that the duration of his stay amounted to cruel and unusual punishment that violated the US constitution and that jurors were improperly prevented from taking his previously unblemished character into account during the his sentencing. At the time of the crime, he was a married and college-educated chemicals salesman with two children and no criminal record. Prosecutors said he killed Bob Tate, Jerry Brown, Philip Good and Ronald Mayes while stealing an ultralight aircraft he had agreed to buy for about $4,500 (¬£3,000). They were shot in the head at close range. Bower said he tried to keep his planned purchase of the aircraft a secret from his wife because she would have disapproved. He initially lied to investigators about his connection to it and the men. But there was no hard evidence linking him to the crime scene, the weapon was not recovered and witnesses came forward in later years who said that he had nothing to do with the murders. Witness statements and documents cited in Bower‚Äôs appeals suggested the killings stemmed from a drug deal that went wrong, which was one of the investigation‚Äôs early theories until they settled on Bower. But prosecutors insisted in court filings that they had the right man. In an interview with the Guardian last week, Bower said that the nature of the legal system meant it was very difficult for death row prisoners to earn a new trial or lesser punishment without strong evidence of innocence or serious prosecutorial misconduct, even if appeals and investigations raise questions about the fairness of the original trial. In 2012, a state judge wrote that evidence that might have persuaded the original jury of Bower‚Äôs innocence was not good enough to earn him a fresh trial. In denying an appeal, James Fallon said that though Bower‚Äôs latest evidence ‚Äúcould conceivably have produced a different result at trial, it does not prove by clear and convincing evidence that [Bower] is actually innocent‚Äù. Bower said prosecution claims at the original trial that his attorneys had since debunked have lingered all the same, casting an unfair shadow over his attempts to clear his name. ‚ÄúOnce it gets in the record you can‚Äôt get it out. Like a bad case of termites, you just can‚Äôt get rid of it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything that I can tell people other than that it‚Äôs been shown there are innocent people who are coming off death row all the time.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-03T22:52:31Z,world,World news,Islamophobia in the skies: United Airlines bans accused worker,"Viral allegations of discrimination on a United Airlines flight last week have led the company to take action against the accused flight attendant. The airline company on Wednesday released a statement saying that after an investigation, the employee of Shuttle America ‚Äì a company United uses to feed their services ‚Äì will no longer be allowed to work on its flights.
Over the weekend, Northwestern chaplain Tahera Ahmad‚Äôs allegations of Islamaphobia at 30,000 feet led to threats of a boycott against United Airlines. United had released a statement the day after the incident that, Ahmad said, reduced her allegations to being just about a ‚Äúmisunderstanding over a diet soda‚Äù, which caused more uproar.
Ahmad told the Guardian she found the company‚Äôs earlier characterizations to be trivializing and said she wished it had acknowledged the alleged discrimination explicitly. ‚Äú[This is] not about me or a soda can, it‚Äôs about systemic injustice,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúUnited does not tolerate behavior that is discriminatory ‚Äì or that appears to be discriminatory ‚Äì against our customers or employees,‚Äù United‚Äôs second statement says. Shuttle America, owned by Republic Airways Holding, confirmed to the Guardian the flight attendant had been pulled from future United Express flying and would be retrained. The airline states that all employees undergo annual and recurrent customer services training ‚Äì including cultural awareness lessons ‚Äì and it will ‚Äúcontinue to work with all of [its] partners to deliver service that reflects United‚Äôs commitment to cultural awareness‚Äù.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-03T21:36:08Z,world,World news,Forced evictions in Rio favela for 2016 Olympics trigger violent clashes,"Rio de Janeiro‚Äôs preparations for next year‚Äôs Olympic Games were marred on Wednesday by a bloody confrontation between police and residents who resisted attempts to forcibly remove them from their homes near the stadium construction site. At least six people were wounded in the face-off at Vila Aut√≥dromo, a favela community on the edge of the Olympic Park. About 90% of the 600 residents have already moved after being offered financial compensation, but the remaining holdouts are adamant that they do not want to give up their homes of many years for a mega-event that last little longer than a fortnight. Wednesday‚Äôs clashes were the first attempt to forcibly relocate them, following a decree in March by Mayor Eduardo Paes that called for their urgent removal so the Olympic host city can complete its preparations on time. Two homes were targeted for demolition, according to the mayor‚Äôs office, which claimed residents pelted police, municipal guardsman and city officials with ‚Äústones, rocks and bricks‚Äù as soon as the work was authorized. It said four guards were injured. Residents give a different story. They say about 50 or 60 of them tried to form a human chain around the homes that were due for demolition and that the police used violence, as well as pepper spray, to try to break them up. Only then, they say, did they throw rocks. In response, the police used rubber bullets and percussion grenades. Residents posted images on their Facebook page of the injuries sustained on their side. It showed blood streaming from the head wounds of a middle-aged woman and man. One of the injured, Penha Silva, was hit near the eye with a riot-police baton, according to her daughter Natalia. ‚ÄúI was right next to her and saw it happen. She is at the hospital right now doing some tests, an x-ray, but thank god she is out of danger.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey came with bulldozers and fired rubber bullets at the residents as well as percussion grenades,‚Äù said the head of the Vila Aut√≥dromo association, Altair Guimar√£es. ‚ÄúI was hit with a baton by the municipal guard.‚Äù Ocimar da Silva Miranda, whose home was targeted, said he was hit in the arm by a rubber bullet. ‚ÄúWe have the right to live here, but they want to take it by force. It‚Äôs not right,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe mayor is using our lives, our homes, as a way to pay back the loans from the big construction companies that financed his campaign. But it‚Äôs our lives, our homes.‚Äù The holdouts have protested before against what they believe are unjustified and unnecessary demolition plans. They believe they are being evicted so developers can make higher profits once the Olympic Games are finished. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs strange that we are being forced out of our homes in the name of public works, yet this is a private investment,‚Äù said Jane Nascimento de Oliveira, who says she has been offered 400,000 reals (about $128,000) to move. The city hall says all residents have been offered compensation and alternative housing at a newly built condominium, Parque Carioca, about a kilometre away. Mayor Paes originally said he would not order forced relocations. Additional reporting by Shanna Hanbury",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-03T19:11:49Z,world,World news,"American Red Cross squandered aid after Haiti earthquake, report alleges","Despite collecting nearly half a billion dollars for Haiti earthquake relief, the American Red Cross has built only six permanent homes and seemingly squandered millions in the country, according to a new report. A joint investigation by ProPublica and NPR uncovered rampant mismanagement, high overhead costs and deeply rooted acrimony from Haitians toward the aid organization. Among the investigation‚Äôs findings was that although the Red Cross apportioned about $170m to the category of ‚Äúshelter‚Äù relief, and although it at first planned to build some 700 houses, it only constructed six permanent homes. The report charges the Red Cross with consistent misrepresentation of its projects, especially in housing. The authors cite promotional materials that say the Red Cross provided more than 130,000 people with homes, and then note that that total includes people in ‚Äútransitional shelters‚Äù, recipients of short-term rent assistance, and people who had been ‚Äútrained in proper construction techniques‚Äù.
The Red Cross disputes the report and asserts it has ‚Äúhelped build and operate eight hospitals and clinics‚Äù and ‚Äúmove more than 100,000 people out of make-shift tents into safe and improved housing‚Äù. In a statement, the organization said it is ‚Äúdisappointed‚Äù by the ‚Äúlack of balance, context and accuracy‚Äù on the part of ProPublica and NPR. A major problem for the organization was leadership and staffing, according to the report. Integral positions, including experts for health and shelter, were left vacant for months and sometimes years. The positions that were staffed were predominantly held by expats or by people flown in from the United States, many of whom could not speak French or Creole. In one 2011 document, Red Cross official Judith St Ford notes that there are ‚Äúserious program delays caused by internal issues that go unaddressed‚Äù, including for cholera relief. ‚ÄúThere is a clear lack of foresight and planning,‚Äù she wrote, and ‚Äúthe lack of leadership ability has contributed to poor morale in the field.‚Äù She also urged her superiors to hire more Haitians: ‚Äúthe implication that talented, smart, competent Haitians cannot be found in Haiti has to be dispelled.‚Äù In its statement the Red Cross says 90% of its current staff are Haitians; the organization did not break down the hierarchy or positions of its staff.
‚ÄúIf they were an organization that had a real history in Haiti I think this would‚Äôve gone a lot better,‚Äù said Justin Elliott, one of the journalists who co-wrote the report. ‚ÄúThe entire Haiti reconstruction effort has been really problematic, but the outside groups that have done better have roots there, have Haitian people working at high levels, have people who speak the language.‚Äù In one 2013 email published by ProPublica, CEO Gail McGovern admitted a project had failed and that she did not know what to do with a $20m remainder. ‚ÄúNow that the Northern project is going bust and we are still holding $20 million of contingency, any ideas on how to spend the rest of this?‚Äù she asked, before mentioning a mysterious ‚Äúwonderful helicopter idea‚Äù. Without Haitians in leadership positions, the Red Cross was particularly ill-prepared to deal with Haiti‚Äôs land tenure rules, a system so tangled and unforgiving that it has intimidated USAid and Vatican relief efforts.
‚ÄúLand tenure is probably the biggest stumbling block,‚Äù said Jonathan M Katz, a freelance journalist and author of a book about the earthquake, The Big Truck That Went By. The system has stymied aid organizations for years, and Katz said that for years aid organizations have ‚Äúthrown up their collective hands and said ‚Äòwe don‚Äôt really want to deal with this.‚Äô‚Äù The Red Cross entangled itself in a web of other organizations, often paying them to do relief work, themselves struggling in Haiti. This outsourcing is commonplace in the international aid industry, Katz said, and leads to inevitable but not necessarily unreasonable overhead costs. But eager to better solicit donations, organizations often try to downplay these costs.
The report notes that overhead charges by the Red Cross and its contractors undermine McGovern‚Äôs claim that ‚Äúminus the nine cents overhead, 91 cents on the dollar will be going to Haiti.‚Äù In one case, Elliott and his co-author, NPR‚ÄôS Laura Sullivan, found that the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) exacted $1.56m in overhead from the American Red Cross‚Äôs payment of $6m, all to help give Haitians rental subsidies so they could leave tent camps. The IFRC said the costs were related to ‚Äúadministration, finance, human resources‚Äù. In another case, the Red Cross commissioned Swiss and Spanish Red Cross societies to upgrade shelters, but still took 24% of the money for the project in additional overhead costs, according to the report. Where exactly the $488m of the American Red Cross‚Äôs Haiti budget has gone is unclear, Elliott said, since ‚Äúthe whole international aid sector is pretty opaque in general. And the spending of the American Red Cross is incredible opaque. You can tell hardly anything from their disclosures.‚Äù He said that the issue of money was particularly sensitive to Haitians who had coordinated with the Red Cross. ‚ÄúThey were furious basically over broken promises,‚Äù Elliott said. ‚ÄúAbout three years ago, the Red Cross told people they were going to build hundreds of new homes in this very hard-hit area, and this thing was just stalled. Over the next two years they had meetings with the community, handed out juice boxes and so on, and nothing happened for a long time.‚Äù
The Red Cross is now helping build a road and install solar lights in the area. Katz said that the problems of the American Red Cross are ‚Äútypical of the aid industry in general. The Red Cross is sort of the biggest kid on the block. Because they make way more money than anybody else, what they do is magnified.‚Äù The interconnected NGOs and aid organizations of the world, ranging from the many satellites of the Red Cross to Doctors Without Borders to the Clinton Foundation, Katz said, should deserve more skepticism from the public. Reports have traced the 2011 cholera epidemic to United Nations relief efforts, he noted, adding that many organizations operate more like businesses than anything else. ‚ÄúEven when an aid group is pulling off a project well,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúif it isn‚Äôt going to be there forever, if it isn‚Äôt going to be accountable for successes and failures, if it isn‚Äôt leaving something behind that‚Äôs permanent, then it‚Äôs still capable of doing damage.‚Äù Last year the Red Cross similarly took issue with another ProPublica report that said the organization had disastrously mismanaged aid relief after hurricane Sandy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-03T18:32:32Z,world,World news,Brazil makes space for indigenous people with new reserve in S√É¬£o Paulo,"
Indigenous activists in Brazil are celebrating a ruling by the country‚Äôs government to declare a new indigenous reserve on the fringes of Latin America‚Äôs largest city. For the past 10 years, members of a Guarani community just inside S√£o Paulo‚Äôs northern city limits have been attempting to get their village and 72-hectare [178-acre] swath of forest recognised as traditional tribal lands. In an announcement published on Monday in the Di√°rio Oficial da Uni√£o, Brazil‚Äôs journal of record, the justice Minister Jos√© Cardozo declared the settlement traditional Guarani territory, as part of a wider 532-hectare area around the Pico de Jaragu√° mountaintop. The announcement marks the second stage in a three-step process, following the recognition of the land as Guarani in 2013 by Funai, Brazil‚Äôs federal agency for Indian affairs. The third step is the signing of a presidential decree declaring the land demarcated Indian territory. The decree, once signed, would make the Guaranis legal owners of the land. ‚ÄúThe apprehension we‚Äôve been living with has suddenly lifted,‚Äù said the community‚Äôs 74-year-old leader, or cacique, Ari Karai. The group, which occupied the land in 2014 following a previous occupation in 2005, was served an eviction order in April, at the petition of a former politicianwho claimed that his family owned the land.
Karai said that help from supporters in S√£o Paulo and beyond helped swing the minister‚Äôs decision. ‚ÄúWe had support from so many people, including from abroad,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt was very important for us ‚Äì I think it made a big difference.‚Äù Three families from cramped, impoverished settlements at the foot of Jaragu√° peak have already taken up residence in the new village, named Tekoa Itakup√©, which is flanked on one side by forest and on the other by the community‚Äôs crops. More families are expected to move up to the forest, but Karai said the group were determined to limit it to 20-30 families, to avoid more overcrowding. ‚ÄúThe last thing we want is to end up living on top of one another again,‚Äù he says. Following the victory in Jaragu√°, the Guarani‚Äôs struggle now shifts 60km to the southernmost edge of S√£o Paulo, where four villages await demarcation as indigenous territory. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hoping that will be easier now,‚Äù said Karai, ‚Äúbut we know we need to keep up the pressure, and to keep gathering as much support as we can.‚Äù Compounding the encouraging news, in Brazil‚Äôs senate as of last week a decisive 60% of senators signed a manifesto opposing the constitutional amendment PEC 215. The proposed amendment, driven by Brazil‚Äôs powerful ruralist congressional caucus, seeks to shift the power to demarcate land ‚Äì or not ‚Äì to Congress. The PEC is fiercely opposed by the indigenous community and its growing ranks of supporters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-03T18:28:05Z,world,World news,Qatar's World Cup officials put on brave face for post-Blatter era,"It was business as usual for Qatar‚Äôs preparatory work on the 2022 World Cup on Wednesday, even as the shockwaves of Sepp Blatter‚Äôs resignation led to more speculation that the Fifa chief‚Äôs sudden departure could see the emirate stripped of the coveted global sports event.
But there was something in the air ‚Äì and not just the 46C mid-afternoon heat that is a scorching reminder of long-standing controversy about the location and its drawbacks. In downtown Doha, in the steel and glass HQ of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, frantic officials were fielding calls on how the Gulf state might respond to a new threat to its moment of glory seven years hence. If anyone in Al Bidda Towers was bothered by the warning from the English Football Association chairman Greg Dyke that Qatar should not be ‚Äúfeeling comfortable‚Äù in the post-Blatter era, they were putting a brave face on it ‚Äì but with a hint of anger. The bland, terse statement that emerged at the end of the day conceded not the slightest hint of crisis. ‚ÄúThe recent events at Fifa will not impact on our preparations for the 2022 Fifa World Cup,‚Äù the committee insisted. ‚ÄúWith five stadiums currently under construction, we are ahead of schedule to deliver on our promises.‚Äù Earlier, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa bin Ahmed Al Thani, president of the Qatari FA, noted pointedly that the emirate had been ‚Äúcleared of any wrongdoing‚Äù by Michael Garcia, the US investigator hired by Fifa ‚Äì and welcomed a Swiss investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. But Al Thani, a member of the ruling family, added a sharp jibe that reflected nationalist sentiment in one of the smallest and wealthiest countries on earth. ‚ÄúMr Dyke‚Äôs instinct to focus immediately on stripping Qatar of the World Cup speaks volumes on his views concerning what will be the first Fifa World Cup to take place in the Middle East,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe would urge Mr Dyke to let the legal process take its course and concentrate on delivering his promise to build an England team capable of winning the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.‚Äù Elsewhere, the mood was a mixture of the defensive and the defiant. Four male friends in traditional white robes sipping fruit juice in the lobby of one of the capital‚Äôs many luxury hotels were looking forward to the competition. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know about Blatter but will put on a good show and we will have excellent stadiums,‚Äù said Issa. ‚ÄúEverything is being prepared ‚Äì the infrastructure, communications. The government has devoted a lot of effort to it.‚Äù Mohammed, his friend, chipped in: ‚ÄúThey say there has been corruption in Fifa but Qatar won fairly. It is an honour for us to host the World Cup ‚Äì as Arabs and Muslims. We have stability here. We have the infrastructure. So what‚Äôs all the fuss about it? We don‚Äôt have strikes here like in Britain. Does someone have a monopoly?‚Äù Officials made a distinction between the competition itself and Blatter‚Äôs fate. But foreign observers saw a clear and possibly ominous link. ‚ÄúIt does complicate things for Qatar,‚Äù one diplomat mused. ‚ÄúEver since they won the bid, Blatter was a staunch supporter and him getting re-elected gave them a degree of confidence that the Fifa investigation wouldn‚Äôt be re-opened. Now he‚Äôs gone they will be worried that a new president won‚Äôt hold back on that. He gave them a feeling of protection.‚Äù The possibility of months of delay and uncertainty before a successor is chosen is another cause for concern. Doha looks likely to welcome the candidacy of Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahad Al Sabah of Kuwait, a fellow member of the Gulf Cooperation Council ‚Äì the regional grouping. It might also be happy with Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, a poor Arab country which might expect Qatari financial largesse for broader political and economic reasons. The Qatari stock market gave its own blunt judgement, falling on the news of Blatter‚Äôs departure just as it rose when he was re-elected a few days ago. The World Cup remains a matter of huge national pride and sensitivity. Al-Watan, the main Arabic daily, splashed on Wednesday with an angry rebuttal of a Washington Post story about the death rate amongst migrant labourers, the subject of intense global scrutiny since a Guardian investigation in 2013. It was not the only one: a separate statement was issued flatly denying a Buzzfeed story suggesting that Qatari officials now faced arrest if they set foot in the US. Qataris are proud to have won the bid but question the motives of their critics, noting that for every time Russia is mentioned Qatar is mentioned many more times. ‚ÄúI believe it is because of prejudice and racism that we have this bashing campaign against Qatar,‚Äù the foreign minister, Khaled al-Attiyah, told Reuters, in Wednesday‚Äôs strongest official response to the Fifa drama. Doha‚Äôs stunning skyline makes plain why the stakes are so high. Cranes and building sites are strewn across a city that is building at least eight new stadiums, new roads and flyovers as well as $35bn metro and rail system. In all, Qatar plans to spend $200bn on infrastructure in the period up to 2030. In the lobby of Al Bidda Towers, an air-conditioned refuge from the furnace-like heat outside, is a reminder of why it matters so much. In a glass case that might house a precious ancient relic is a lavishly-bound book open at an interview with Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the previous emir, who stepped down in favour of his son Tamim two years ago. ‚ÄúHosting the 2022 Fifa World Cup will obviously further enhance our country‚Äôs standing and reputation globally, raising the awareness of Qatar and providing a positive focus for the region as a whole.‚Äù The supreme committee made a strikingly similar point: ‚ÄúQatar has faced criticism from the moment we won the right to bring this tournament to the Middle East for the first time,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúWe remain committed to using the World Cup as a platform to break down prejudice and misconceptions, while leaving a lasting legacy for our country and the rest of the region.‚Äù Ian Black, the Guardian‚Äôs Middle East editor, was visiting Doha to attend the US-Islamic World Forum as a guest of the Brookings Centre for Middle East policy and the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-03T17:03:25Z,world,World news,Chechen leader's show of strength muddies loyalty to Putin,"Chechnya‚Äôs macho leader Ramzan Kadyrov is the most loyal of Vladimir Putin‚Äôs regional heads, at least in theory. The central street of the captial, Grozny, is called Putin Avenue, and the lampposts lining it are adorned with the Russian tricolour. Putin‚Äôs portrait looks down from dozens of buildings across the city, and Kadyrov‚Äôs Instagram account, his main method of communication with the outside world, is full of protestations that he is a ‚Äúfoot soldier‚Äù, supremely loyal to Russia‚Äôs great leader. But recent events, especially the murder of Boris Nemtsov in Moscow, have led to renewed debate over whether the Kremlin‚Äôs political control over the region, won back after two gruesome wars in the post-Soviet years, may be loosening. While pledging a feudal-like loyalty to Moscow, Kadyrov has been provided billions of roubles to rebuild Grozny, which has been transformed from a ruined shell reminiscent of Stalingrad to a modern city studded with shiny Dubai-style skyscrapers. Wealthy locals dine in the 32nd-floor restaurant at Grozny City, a five-star hotel, the football team plays at a newly renovated stadium. But Kadyrov has also built up his own private armies. In an extraordinary address to thousands of his troops, gathered in fatigues and armed in Grozny‚Äôs main stadium in December, a black-shirted Kadyrov said his men were ready to fight for the motherland at any time. ‚ÄúAmerica and Europe have declared an economic war on Russia,‚Äù he declared to the assembled ranks of fighters. ‚ÄúBut the Russian people have rallied around their leader Vladimir Putin ‚Ä¶ Long live our great motherland Russia! Long live our national leader Vladimir Putin! Allah-u Akbar!‚Äù The pictures were not widely broadcast on Russian television, and the sight of a regional leader commanding such a fierce army gave many pause for thought. ‚ÄúOne theory is that this was a genuine show of loyalty to Putin, while another theory is that it was actually a warning, showing everyone that Chechen forces have this extraordinary potential. Of course, it‚Äôs quite likely that both of these theories are true,‚Äù said Grigory Shvedov, editor in chief of Caucasian Knot, one of the only independent news sites specialising in Russia‚Äôs North Caucasus region. Kadyrov‚Äôs forces have long had a dubious reputation. For many years, rights activists and analysts have worried that the rebuilding of Chechnya has come at a huge price, both in terms of money and in terms of turning a blind eye to human rights abuses committed by Kadyrov‚Äôs battalions and special units. On Wednesday, one of the last human rights groups in the republic said a large mob of people had gathered outside its office, smashing windows and destroying its car, apparently accusing it of fighting an ‚Äúinformation war‚Äù against Chechnya for documenting rights abuses. The group already had its offices in Grozny burned down in December. This kind of attack on rights groups or freedom of speech has long been considered the price Moscow has to pay for keeping Chechnya under its formal control. But the assassination of Nemtsov, in the shadow of the Kremlin, has led many to wonder whether Chechnya has slipped too far out of Moscow‚Äôs orbit. Investigators arrested several Chechens in connection with Nemtsov‚Äôs murder, including a deputy commander of one of Kadyrov‚Äôs special battalions. Russian agencies reported that one of the main suspects, Ruslan Geremeyev, who is close to Kadyrov, was being guarded in a Chechen village and was later helped to flee the country. Kadyrov wrote on his Instagram account that Zaur Dadayev, one of the arrested men, is ‚Äúa true patriot of Russia‚Äù. In recent days, there have been reports that investigators have a video of Dadayev saying goodbye to Geremeyev at the airport in Moscow in the days after the killing. The trail appeared to lead directly to the Chechen leader. Joining the dots between the investigators‚Äô leaks in the press and Kadyrov‚Äôs Instagram belligerence, many analysts have speculated there is a battle going on between different parts of Putin‚Äôs security services: those who want to take Kadyrov down, and those who believe he must be protected at all costs to stop Chechnya sliding into chaos. A former Kremlin insider told the Guardian earlier this year that ‚Äúnobody in Moscow has ever liked Kadyrov‚Äù because no state bodies work normally in Chechnya: not the police, prosecutors office or courts. A source in Grozny confirmed that almost everyone in a position of power in the republic is locally appointed, with just a few people in the FSB security service coming from Moscow. Ten days after Nemtsov‚Äôs murder, as the Russian media was full of speculation linking those close to Kadyrov to the hit, the Kremlin announced Kadyrov would receive the Order of Honour, a top state award. It was read by many as a sign that the Chechen leader is untouchable. Lawyers for Nemtsov‚Äôs family want Kadyrov himself questioned over the killing, but that appears unlikely. Some play down the idea of a feud between the FSB and Kadyrov, and point out instead the usefulness of the Chechen leader. Andrei Soldatov, a specialist on the Russian security services, said he believes talk of a full-blown feud is exaggerated. The FSB needs Kadyrov, he believes: ‚ÄúLinks with western security services are important for the FSB leadership and the main thing Russia has to share is information on people going to Syria to fight. The main source of this information is Kadyrov.‚Äù Others say that while Kadyrov may have become more unruly, the Kremlin‚Äôs new antagonism with the west makes him more important than ever. ‚ÄúWith the events in Ukraine and the changing political climate, I think there has been a much greater need for Ramzan over the last year,‚Äù said Shvedov. ‚ÄúKadyrov is a unique politician on the Russian scene. What other local leader could rail at the west in the same way he does, or personally insult Obama? They would be too worried about their houses in California and so on, but Kadyrov can and does speak his mind freely.‚Äù But the tension has at times spilled out into the public domain, an extremely rare occurrence in Putin‚Äôs ‚Äúpower vertical‚Äù. Kadyrov reacted furiously to a ‚Äúspecial operation‚Äù carried out in Grozny by special police troops from nearby Stavropol region, which led to the wanted man being shot dead. Kadyrov ordered Chechen law enforcement that they should ‚Äúshoot to kill‚Äù any police officers from other regions who came to Chechnya without informing local authorities first. The Interior Ministry in Moscow reacted with a statement that the outburst was unacceptable, and Kadyrov‚Äôs words quickly disappeared from local television broadcasts. Later, the Chechen leader said he had been misinterpreted. Last month, exiled oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky‚Äôs Open Russia foundation released a film about Kadyrov‚Äôs Chechnya. ‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs policies in Chechnya will lead to the creation of two dangerous enemies ‚Äì Ramzan Kadyrov‚Äôs clan and the people of Chechnya. Sooner or later, one or the other of them will start a war with us,‚Äù wrote Khodorkovsky in an accompanying article. Kadyrov‚Äôs response, as usual, came on Instagram. With the somewhat sinister title ‚ÄúIf you haven‚Äôt understood by now, you soon will.‚Äù The supposed ‚Äútrailer‚Äù for the ‚Äúfilm‚Äù featured Kadyrov running across a plain, weapon in hand. He wrote it was directed by a Hollywood star and featured ‚Äúinternational A-list stars‚Äù. Given there is almost certainly no Hollywood film, it felt like a threat. ‚ÄúKadyrov has done everything to rebuild the republic, everything is thanks to him,‚Äù said a former member of one of Kadyrov‚Äôs militias in an interview in Grozny over the weekend. ‚ÄúBut if you‚Äôve read anything of Caucasus history, you‚Äôll know this is unlikely to be the end. We can never trust Russia, and there is sure to be more trouble in the future.‚Äù Another contentious incident was the marriage of a 17-year-old schoolgirl to a middle-aged police chief who already had a wife. Kadyrov intervened after human rights activists criticised the marriage, and the chief of his administration personally brought the bride to the registry office. In the days after the marriage, Kadyrov gathered a group of locals who had ‚Äúspread rumours‚Äù about the marriage. It was not made clear how they were identified. He blamed gossiping women for spreading rumours about the marriage using WhatsApp and called on men to ensure their female family members did not spend time using the app. ‚ÄúLock them in, do not let them go out, then they will not post anything,‚Äù he said, according to translation from Chechen language by Russian media. ‚ÄúFamily honour is the most important thing. Do not write such things. Men, take your women out of WhatsApp.‚Äù Some say allowing Kadyrov so much breathing space risks provoking the very war Russia is so keen to prevent. ‚ÄúIt turns out the price for Russia of ‚Äòpeace‚Äô in the Caucasus is the de facto semi-independence of Chechnya, which our regime has to accept because it can‚Äôt keep ‚Äòconstitutional order‚Äô in the Caucasus without Kadyrov and his personal army,‚Äù wrote Gennady Gudkov, an opposition politician former KGB officer who sat on the Duma‚Äôs security committee until recently, in a column. ‚ÄúOf course we can just pretend that Chechnya is a part of Russia just like Yaroslavl, Sakhalin or Petersburg. That‚Äôs what we did at the end of the 1980s when the USSR‚Äôs laws stopped working in this proud Caucasus republic. And we know what happened then. Are we risking a repeat?‚Äù Some Chechens express love for Kadyrov and say a place such as Chechnya can only be governed with strong rule. Even for many Chechens who are uneasy about Kadyrov‚Äôs role, the memories of a decade living amid war and chaos are still fresh, and most people say they are willing to put up with a lot to avoid war. Many locals say Russian criticism of Chechnya‚Äôs existence outside Russia‚Äôs legal system is unfair. Polygamy is fairly widespread in Chechnya, explained partly by local traditions and partly by a shortage of menfolk after all the tragedies the Chechens have experienced in recent decades. ‚ÄúThe Qur‚Äôan gives men the right to have up to four wives,‚Äù said Murad, the eldest of 25 children that his now-deceased father had with three separate wives. ‚ÄúWhat man wouldn‚Äôt want several wives? It‚Äôs never been a problem here. In Russia they do the same thing, it‚Äôs just there they call it having a mistress. Here it‚Äôs official and honest.‚Äù At a wake on Saturday in Grozny, held for a well-known Soviet-era wrestling trainer who had just passed away, the smell of sweat wafted through the air as the men performed the zikr, a sufi-inspired local tradition of prayer and swirling dance, while the headscarved women prepared hunks of meat and a giant vat of soup. The scene felt far removed from Moscow. But there was bemusement among the guests over the idea that by operating according to sharia law rather than the Russian constitution, Chechnya was somehow more lawless than the rest of Russia. ‚ÄúThere they ignore the law and here we ignore the law. It‚Äôs just that there it‚Äôs based on wealth and corruption, and here it comes from Allah,‚Äù said one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-03T16:04:12Z,world,World news,Surveillance reform explainer: can the FBI still listen to my phone calls?,"Something surprising happened in Washington DC on Tuesday: Congress passed surveillance reform. Last weekend, three parts of the Patriot Act ‚Äì a bill disapproved of in its current form by many Americans across party lines ‚Äì expired, ending authority for several forms of surveillance of US citizens introduced by the Bush administration, backed by Barack Obama, and altered in secret by the National Security Agency (something Edward Snowden later exposed). The Senate on Tuesday passed the USA Freedom Act, which restores expired powers of the FBI, notably the ‚Äúbusiness records‚Äù, ‚Äúlone wolf‚Äù and ‚Äúroving wiretap‚Äù provisions, but puts an end to the NSA‚Äôs indiscriminate collection of American phone records. The fight was hard-won: Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell advanced three different amendments that would have defanged the reforms in various ways. All three failed.
So that‚Äôs it ‚Äì the FBI can‚Äôt listen to my phone calls anymore, right? Wrong. The FBI will do whatever it wants with your phone calls, provided it has a warrant. Section 215 of the Patriot Act, used by the FBI ‚Äúto obtain large collections of metadata‚Äù, had indeed expired, but the USA Freedom Act restored it. (The Freedom Act, as mentioned, will stop the NSA from collecting Americans‚Äô phone records in bulk. More on that in a second.) The main statute the FBI uses to listen in directly on phone calls is called Calea ‚Äì the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act. Calea was designed to make it easier for the FBI to listen in on calls as telecoms technology shifted from copper wires to digital. Essentially, giving the FBI a backdoor key to your network is a condition of running a phone or internet company. Where phone records are concerned, the FBI has a history of circumventing the requirement for a warrant, notoriously in the years after 9/11 with ‚Äúexigent letters‚Äù seeking billing records, which claimed ‚Äì often falsely ‚Äì that the situation was an emergency and a grand jury was about to be convened. And there are National Security Letters, which allow the FBI to collect ‚Äúbusiness records‚Äù (and that includes credit card statements and phone information) without having to get permission from a judge. National Security Letters are sticking around, though they can‚Äôt be used to collect phone records in bulk anymore. But the Freedom Act specifically states that you won‚Äôt be able to tell anybody you received a National Security Letter. If this provision sounds to you like it does not belong in something called the Freedom Act, you have a point.
Speak English. What are ‚Äòlone-wolf‚Äô capabilities? Sorry. First up, we‚Äôre talking about the 2004 ‚Äúlone wolf‚Äù amendment to the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa). See, Fisa created a secret court that issues warrants for surveillance to the FBI (and helped the NSA retroactively shoehorn metadata collection into the Patriot Act in 2006). This allows for the possibility that there‚Äôs one guy out there who might blow something up. Rather than an agent of a foreign power, or a person with connections to terrorism, the definition of lone wolf is nebulous ‚Äì to say the least. The amendment changes the definition of ‚Äúagent of a foreign power‚Äù to include people who might be planning to engage in ‚Äúinternational terrorism‚Äù in the judgment of the court. ‚ÄúIf an order is sought under this definition of an ‚Äòagent of a foreign power‚Äô,‚Äù the amendment says, ‚Äúthe applicant is not required to demonstrate a connection between the target of the electronic surveillance or the physical search and a foreign nation, foreign group, or international terrorist group.‚Äù The FBI says it has never even used this provision. And ‚Äòroving wiretaps‚Äô? ‚ÄúRoving wiretaps‚Äù are supposed to allow the government to track suspects who change phones, but their definition is very broad too ‚Äì so broad a court can issue them without having to know the identity of the target. The FBI has used this provision, notably to spy on children for five days. Go back. Secret court? Yes. Fisa created a secret court that issues orders related to the surveillance of ‚Äúforeign intelligence information‚Äù between people who are ‚Äúagents of foreign powers‚Äù, including US citizens. Which Americans? Definitely everybody on Verizon, who had their data swept up by the NSA, as first revealed by Snowden, for example. Also US customers of other phone companies. Will the USA Freedom Act get rid of that secret court? Nope. So what does the Freedom Act even do then? At this point in the debate, its biggest change is to make a big trade: it junks the NSA‚Äôs bulk collection of US phone data in exchange for restoring the now-expired, aforementioned FBI powers in the Patriot Act. (The reason you might be confused about that is weeks‚Äô worth of imprecise reporting, as the media has ‚Äì understandably ‚Äì had trouble making heads or tails of this). Various writers and talking heads have used ‚ÄúSection 215‚Äù or the ‚ÄúBusiness Records Provision‚Äù to mean ‚ÄúNSA bulk collection‚Äù because the NSA secretly jammed its domestic bulk collection into Section 215 back in 2006. But they‚Äôre totally not the same thing. To ensure that the NSA or the FBI doesn‚Äôt try to reconstitute bulk collection, or some domestic surveillance operation similarly massive, the act also creates a kind of ‚Äúearly warning‚Äù system at the secret Fisa court. ‚ÄúSignificant‚Äù Fisa court opinions, ones that would substantially reinterpret the laws (again, in secret), would have to be publicly disclosed within 45 days. Also, since the Fisa court right now only hears from the government ‚Äì another way the Fisa court is unlike every court you‚Äôve ever heard of in this country ‚Äì it would also create a kind of privacy advocate, called an ‚Äúamicus‚Äù, for those kinds of novel cases so that it‚Äôs not overseeing itself. Those are the transparency provisions McConnell and Senate intelligence committee chief Richard Burr wanted to scuttle. Wait, so how can I be sure nobody‚Äôs listening who isn‚Äôt supposed to be listening? The short answer is that you can‚Äôt, but the long answer is more interesting. Fear of government surveillance and malicious hackers have meant a boom in apps and proxies that purport to offer secure alternatives to plain old telephone service connections, mostly using VPNs ‚Äì virtual private networks. Sure, your data goes through open phone lines, cell towers and fiber cables, but it can be encrypted in a number of ways, some more effective than others. Some of these privacy tools keep a log of your username, IP address and when you use the network (which can then be turned over to law enforcement if subpoenaed); others use ‚Äúdark tunnels‚Äù and do not keep logs ‚Äì there are proxies that even accept bitcoin so that financial records are harder to trace. So this isn‚Äôt big news? No, it‚Äôs HUGE news. The steps forward represented by the USA Freedom Act may seem small to people outraged by government overreach, but it‚Äôs frankly astonishing that they‚Äôre going forward at all. For the past 15 years Congress‚Äôs favorite thing to do has been to expand NSA powers. Now it‚Äôs restricting them for the first time since 1978. The issue of broad government surveillance has become such a powerful motivator to action that the passage of the Freedom Act is likely to have all kinds of ramifications, from the NSA having to justify its actions more frequently to a more knowledgeable public, to Rand Paul being taken more seriously as a presidential candidate. It‚Äôs also an issue others seeking the US‚Äôs highest office will have to develop a public-friendly stance on, and quickly.

2015-06-03T15:59:59Z,world,World news,"Nigeria's army behind countless acts of torture and 8,000 deaths, Amnesty says","Senior military officers in Nigeria should be investigated for war crimes including the murder, starvation, suffocation and torturing to death of 8,000 people, Amnesty International has said. An investigation carried out over several years, perhaps the most damning account yet of the military response to Boko Haram, casts a shadow over the first foreign trip of the new Nigerian president, Muhammadu Buhari, during which he is set to discuss a fresh regional strategy against the Islamist group. Amnesty set out on Wednesday the case against five senior Nigerian officers in a 133-page report based on hundreds of interviews, including with military sources, and leaked defence ministry documents.
During security operations against Boko Haram in the north-east, it says the armed forces ‚Äúcommitted countless acts of torture; hundreds, if not thousands, of Nigerians have become victims of enforced disappearance; and at least 7,000 people have died in military detention as a result of starvation, extreme overcrowding and denial of medical assistance‚Äù. The report, Stars on Their Shoulders. Blood on Their Hands: War Crimes Committed by the Nigerian Military, also alleges that more than 1,200 people have been extrajudicially executed by soldiers or allied vigilante groups since February 2012. It claims the worst case took place on 14 March 2014 when the military killed more than 640 detainees who had fled Giwa barracks after Boko Haram attacked. Many of these killings appear to be reprisals following attacks. A senior military official told Amnesty that soldiers ‚Äúgo to the nearest place and kill all the youths ‚Ä¶ people killed may be innocent and not armed‚Äù. The report alleges that military forces arbitrarily arrested at least 20,000 people, mostly young men and boys, some just nine years old. It says detainees are held incommunicado in extremely overcrowded, unventilated cells without sanitary facilities and with little food or water. Amnesty claims that a high-ranking military officer gave it a list of 683 detainees who died in custody between October 2012 and February 2013. The organisation also obtained evidence that in 2013, more than 4,700 bodies were brought to a mortuary from a detention facility in Giwa barracks. A former detainee who spent four months in detention described how, on arrival, the soldiers said: ‚ÄúWelcome to your die house. Welcome to your place of death.‚Äù Only 11 of 122 men he was arrested with survived, he said. Amnesty researchers also witnessed emaciated corpses in mortuaries, and one former Giwa detainee told the organisation that around 300 people in his cell died after being denied water for two days: ‚ÄúSometimes we drank people‚Äôs urine, but even the urine you at times could not get.‚Äù The conditions for prisoners in Giwa barracks and detention centres in Damaturu were allegedly so overcrowded that hundreds of detainees were packed into small cells where they had to take turns sleeping or even sitting on the floor. ‚ÄúHundreds have been killed in detention either [by soldiers] shooting them or by suffocation,‚Äù a military officer told Amnesty, describing the situation in Sector Alpha detention centre, known as ‚ÄúGuantanamo‚Äù. Amnesty claims that on a single day, 47 detainees died there as a result of suffocation. To combat the spread of disease and stifle the stench, cells were regularly fumigated with chemicals. Fumigation may have led to the deaths of many detainees in their poorly ventilated cells. One military official based at Giwa barracks told Amnesty: ‚ÄúMany Boko Haram suspects died as a result of fumigation. They fumigated with the chemicals you use for killing mosquitoes. It is something very powerful. It is very dangerous.‚Äù Former detainees and senior military sources described how detainees were regularly tortured to death, hung on poles over fires, tossed into deep pits or interrogated using electric batons.
Boko Haram has been fighting to impose sharia law across Nigeria‚Äôs north for the last six years, massacring civilians and kidnapping thousands of women and children, most notoriously a group of more than 200 schoolgirls in Chibok. But Amnesty alleges that the military‚Äôs response has resulted in further atrocities against civilians. The international criminal court (ICC) in the Hague has previously said there was insufficient evidence tying Nigeria‚Äôs military to systematic and orchestrated atrocities targeting civilians. But the report says: ‚ÄúAmnesty International believes that the evidence contained in this report and submitted separately to the ICC office of the prosecutor is sufficient to reopen this issue.‚Äù Amnesty also called on Buhari, who was sworn in as president last week, to act against those responsible and end the culture of impunity in the armed forces. Commanders based in the north-east ‚Äúshould be investigated for potential responsibility for war crimes of murder, enforced disappearances and torture‚Äù, it said. It named five officers it believes should be investigated: Major General John A H Ewansiha, Major General Obida T Ethnan, Major General Ahmadu Mohammed, Brigadier General Austin O Edokpayi and Brigadier General Rufus O Bamigboye. The Nigerian government said it took the allegations seriously but the officers were innocent until proven otherwise. ‚ÄúThe government of Nigeria has zero tolerance of the mistreatment of citizens, especially when human rights are involved,‚Äù spokesman Mike Omeri said. ‚ÄúWhen such allegations are made, the government will not hesitate to investigate. The armed forces are professional in training and conduct. Unless they are investigated we cannot accuse them of this. They are not known to be engaged in this.‚Äù Asked about the alleged abuses at the Giwa barracks, Omeri replied: ‚ÄúGiwa is like any other military barracks. I am not aware of any such things.‚Äù The government of former president Goodluck Jonathan was repeatedly pressured to try all Boko Haram suspects in court. After taking the oath of office, Buhari promised he would review the military‚Äôs rules of engagement in a bid to end concerns of rights violations by soldiers. He also promised to improve ‚Äúoperational and legal mechanisms so that disciplinary steps are taken against proven human right violations by the armed forces‚Äù. He vowed that he would tackle ‚Äúhead on‚Äù the six-year insurgency and said the military command centre will be relocated from the capital, Abuja, to the north-eastern city of Maiduguri. On Tuesday, Buhari met his security chiefs for the first time and on Wednesday began a visit to neighbouring Niger and Chad, where he is expected to discuss changes to the regional offensive against Boko Haram. Japheth Omojuwa, a political commentator and blogger, said: ‚ÄúWe will see a change in strategy and that is a no-brainer really. The strategy of the immediate past administration ‚Äì if ever there was a strategy ‚Äì failed woefully. I see Buhari working with Nigeria‚Äôs neighbours Niger, Chad and Cameroon more closely in a less combative or competitive way as it was with Jonathan. That shows already with his first travel outside the country being Niger and Boko Haram clearly the main subject of discussion.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúHe will also enjoy a lot of intelligence support from the United States and technical and moral support from the likes of the United Kingdom and France. I see him fully focused on insecurity while his vice-president, Yemi Osibajo, concentrates on the economy. That would help. The movement of the military‚Äôs base from Abuja to Maiduguri shows pro-activeness, his willingness to take the war to the terrorists.‚Äù Antony Goldman, a west Africa risk analyst at London-based PM Consulting, said: ‚ÄúThere have been significant gains over the last four months but there remains a lot of structural work to be done to create a fully professional military. There are some long-term issues that, even with the will, are not going to be fixed with the change of leadership, but the change might be part of that process.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-03T15:44:06Z,world,World news,Abu Khdeir murder trial: defendant tells court he did not plan to kill teenager,"One of two Israeli teenagers accused with a 30-year old man of the kidnap and murder of Palestinian boy last summer has described the killing in detail for the first time in evidence at his trial in Jerusalem. Mohammed Abu Khdeir, 16, was snatched from outside a mosque in east Jerusalem and driven to a forest where he was knocked insensible with a crowbar and burned alive. His murder triggered an international outcry and violent clashes in the city. The killing was condemned at the time by the US secretary of state, John Kerry, the EU and by the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, as well as by the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. Speaking in his defence at his trial at a Jerusalem district court, the teenager, who cannot be named because he is a minor, blamed Yosef Ben-David, his 30-year-old co-accused, as motivating the hate crime, adding that he had never planned to kill Abu Khdeir. In an angry outburst in the court, and in comments outside later, Abu Khdeir father accused the teenager of lying. Ben-David, a resident of the West Bank settlement of Adam, admitted last year he had been responsible for setting Abu Khdeir alight. He has, however, refused to testify, invoking his right to remain silent, while his lawyer has insisted his client is ‚Äúinsane‚Äù and therefore unfit for trial. The teenager, who has claimed he was emotionally dependent on the older man, said in his defence that he had felt pressured to join in the kidnapping. ‚ÄúWhen [Ben-David] picked me up at my home he told me we had to do something ... to avenge God‚Äôs honour. It was hard for me to say no to him,‚Äù the teenager said. ‚ÄúI was conflicted. I was afraid to do something but on the other hand I also couldn‚Äôt say no to him. I find it difficult believe that I was involved in such a horrific incident. It‚Äôs not true that I planned to kill him. I never dreamed that it would end in the way it did.‚Äù
The teenager said Ben-David had been angry after attending the funeral of three Israeli youths ‚Äì Eyal Yifrach, Naftali Frenkel and Gilad Shaer ‚Äì the day before, who had been kidnapped and killed while hitchhiking in the West Bank in a case that dominated the Israeli headlines. ‚ÄúBen-David was at the boys‚Äô funerals,‚Äù the teenager said on Wednesday during the court hearing, which was interupted several times by Abu Khdeir‚Äôs father, Hussein, as details were disclosed. ‚ÄúHe was much more enthusiastic and heated up. We met at the central bus station, bought some cigarettes and drank energy drinks to spur us on.‚Äù During the evening, the teenager said, Ben-David ‚Äústarted talking about wanting to pick someone up in his car and beat him. He gave us pills to calm us down. The other youth and I said it was dangerous. We drove around for hours. He stopped next to five small children and every time we were looking for a way to get out of it. I was distressed over the children.‚Äù After kidnapping Abu Khdeir, the teenager said: ‚ÄúI was sure [Ben-David] would let us off on the side of the road. I didn‚Äôt think he would take him into the woods and beat him there. I thought he would drop it. ‚ÄúThere was shouting in the car and there was tension. We reached the Jerusalem forest, and the whole trip we held him from behind. Ben-David asked where the crowbar was, and said that they (the Arabs) have seven souls, then he gave him two blows to the head with the crowbar. ‚ÄúI said to Ben-David: ‚ÄòEnough!‚Äô I got into the car and suddenly I saw a huge bonfire and understood the meaning. I didn‚Äôt see with my own eyes that it was Yosef who lit it, but from what was said, he lit it.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-03T14:17:00Z,world,World news,Families' anger grows after China cruise ship sinking,"Forty-eight hours after a Chinese cruise ship carrying 456 people capsized and sank on the Yangtze river, anger and frustration is growing among relatives of those feared to have died. Dozens of family members arrived in Jianli on Wednesday, the town nearest to the disaster scene, seeking news of their loved ones. By Wednesday night, just 40 of those travelling on the Eastern Star cruise ship had been accounted for ‚Äì 14 survivors and 26 dead. Liu Gang, whose 68-year-old mother is missing, told the Guardian he had arrived in Jianli with a group of about 20 other families in the early hours of Wednesday. The group had hoped to visit the disaster site and accompany the rescue efforts. However, authorities prevented the families from reaching the site and had provided scant information about their operations, he complained. ‚ÄúWe are here but we still have to get all our information from the internet. We can‚Äôt go to the [disaster] site and have no way of finding out what has happened,‚Äù said Liu, whose mother, Shen Zhijuan, is still missing. ‚ÄúWe are prepared for the worst but [the government] should let us know what is really happening,‚Äù said a second relative ‚Äì a 35-year-old from Shanghai who asked to be named only as Mr Gu and whose mother and father-in-law were on the ship. ‚ÄúWhy they won‚Äôt talk to us?‚Äù
‚ÄúRescue crews in orange overalls began cutting a 55cm by 60cm hole in the ship‚Äôs hull on Wednesday night in the hope of finding further survivors inside, Xinhua, China‚Äôs official news agency reported.‚Äù Earlier, navy divers had used their hands to feel their way through sections of the submerged vessel, Zhang Jianxin, a transport ministry official, told state-run CCTV. Li Keqiang, the Chinese prime minister, urged rescue workers tocontinue their efforts despite the difficult conditions. ‚ÄúThe whole nation is putting their hope on you,‚Äù he said, according to state media. But while the Communist party has been keen to emphasise its swift response to the tragedy, both Liu and Gu said the government‚Äôs lack of transparency was fuelling suspicion among relatives. ‚ÄúTo be honest, we don‚Äôt trust all the official information that is being published,‚Äù said Gu. ‚ÄúThe families can remain calm for a day or two, but what if one day we are unable to take it any more?‚Äù ‚ÄúI wonder why they won‚Äôt let us go to the site,‚Äù said Liu. ‚ÄúWe told them that if they were worried they could organise for us to go there, but they didn‚Äôt respond to our request. We came here on our own because we are anxious and sad. We want to see our families, and we are not here to cause trouble.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf they insist on not letting us in, we might think there could be flaws in their rescue efforts,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúOtherwise, why are they so scared of us, the families, being there?‚Äù Liu said he had not given up hope of finding his mother alive. ‚ÄúIf she comes back safely, I will never let her go on tourism trips again,‚Äù he said.
However, at Jianli‚Äôs main funeral parlour authorities were preparing for the worst. Shen Yuanhai, the owner of a coffin factory in the neighbouring province of Henan, said he delivered four lorries to the funeral home on Wednesday, each stacked high with refrigerated caskets. After being unloaded by a forklift truck, the coffins, which have transparent, flower-covered lids, were packed side-to-side into four halls where wakes will be held over the coming days. Zou Jinlin, a 40-year-old local who was among crowds gathered at the Rongcheng Crematorium, said she would comfort relatives by telling them: ‚ÄúIt was a natural disaster. It wasn‚Äôt human error.‚Äù Her words echoed reports in China‚Äôs government-controlled media that have repeatedly pointed to a tornado or cyclone as the most likely cause of Monday‚Äôs disaster. ‚ÄúUnder the special circumstance of cyclone, the pressure on the one side of the boat went beyond the standard it was designed for, resulting in the overturning of the boat,‚Äù Zhong Shoudao, the president of China‚Äôs Chongqing Boat Design Institute, told a press conference, according to the Associated Press. However, some relatives remain unconvinced by the official narrative. Liu Gang said he could not grasp how ‚Äúsuch a big ship could turn upside down‚Äù in the river and why the 251ft-long Eastern Star appeared to have been the only ship affected by the storm. ‚ÄúThere were many other ships ‚Äì big and small ‚Äì and they were all fine. If it really was the bad weather, other ships would have been affected too,‚Äù he said. Questions over whether human error could have played a role grew on Wednesday after the Wall Street Journal reported that the Eastern Star had been cited for ‚Äúsafety infractions‚Äù two years ago. Safety inspectors in Chongqing had given the Eastern Star the green light as recently as last month, the People‚Äôs Daily, Beijing‚Äôs official mouthpiece newspaper, said. Chinese authorities appear nervous about the potential for unrest as hundreds of grieving relatives flock to the riverside town. As well as the massive rescue operation, large numbers of security forces have descended on Jianli, setting up roadblocks at major intersections. Foreign and Chinese journalists have been prevented from independently travelling to the disaster site. Attempts to interview relatives who had gathered outside Jianli‚Äôs main hospital were thwarted by government volunteers in red armbands. One family was ushered into a black sedan, apparently against their will, and driven away from reporters. ‚ÄúToo many journalists! You have to get into the car!‚Äù a government volunteer told them. ‚ÄúWe feel powerless as a member of the public, especially when government officials block the roads and do not allow us go to the site,‚Äù complained Liu. For relatives thre two key questions remained: what had happened to their loved-ones and why. ‚ÄúYou tell me, how could such a horrible disaster happen?‚Äù Liu said.

2015-06-03T11:05:10Z,world,World news,Israel brands Palestinian-led boycott movement a 'strategic threat',"Israel and key international supporters have sharply ratcheted up their campaign against the Palestinian-led Boycott Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, with senior Israeli officials declaring it a strategic threat. Using language the Israeli government usually reserves for the likes of Hamas or Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme, senior figures ‚Äì including the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and a key backer in the US, casino magnate Sheldon Adelson ‚Äì have turned on the movement, which is prominent on university campuses and among international trade unions. The moves came as the UK‚Äôs National Union of Students (NUS) voted on Tuesday to formally ally itself with the aims of BDS. Following the vote, Hebrew media reported that Israeli MPs were due to hold a special session in the Knesset to discuss the issue.
The non-violent grassroots movement, founded with the support of dozens of Palestinian organisations, is modelled on South African anti-apartheid campaigns and calls for an end to the occupation, equality for Palestinian citizens of Israel, and a resolution for Palestinian refugees of 1948. Israeli critics point to the call for a right to return and the opposition of some leaders of the movement to a two-state solution ‚Äì which they describe as a mistake ‚Äì as evidence that BDS is antisemitic. After years in which Israeli officials and commentators have loftily dismissed the impact of BDS ‚Äì which seeks to persuade businesses, artists, governments and academic institutions to boycott Israel over its long occupation of the Palestinian territories ‚Äì Israel‚Äôs new rightwing government has in recent days singled out the movement for criticism. The issue appears to have been given added impetus since Palestinian efforts to have Israel suspended from the scandal-ridden world football organisation Fifa failed on Friday. Comments by senior Israeli politicians over the last week have been amplified in the Hebrew media by sympathetic commentary by columnists. Among those who have allied themselves with the latest efforts are the mass circulation Israeli paper Yedioth Ahoronoth ‚Äì which earlier this week allied itself on its front page with ‚ÄúFighting the boycott‚Äù ‚Äì and its rightwing columnist Ben-Dror Yemeni, who has echoed the comments of officials. ‚ÄúThe success of BDS,‚Äù Yemini wrote earlier this week, ‚Äúis particularly impressive because it is a movement that uses the language of rights, but deals in practice with denying Israel‚Äôs right to exist. The result is a major deception.‚Äù The latest rhetoric has coincided with growing evidence of pro-Israeli activism over BDS, not least in the US. Last week, a new website emerged whose aim was to identify US college students active in the BDS movement with the explicit aim of identifying then to future possible employers. It was not clear who was behind the site. This weekend, Adelson will reportedly convene a meeting of super wealthy pro-Israel donors for a summit in Las Vegas on countering the influence of BDS and similar movements on US campuses. On Sunday, Netanyahu explicitly attempted to link boycott movements to historic ‚Äúanti-semitism‚Äù, echoing remarks that Netanyahu made in his keynote address to the US pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC last year, when he described BDS as being on the ‚Äúwrong side of the moral divide‚Äù while predicting that the ‚Äúmovement will fail‚Äù.
The latest rhetoric was immediately condemned by Barghouti, who dismissed the recent moves as a ‚Äúpanic-driven, racist and patently propagandistic Israeli attack on the movement‚Äù. He told the Guardian: ‚ÄúPlacing a non-violent human rights movement that seeks freedom, justice and equality on par with the so-called Iranian ‚Äònuclear capacity‚Äô as a ‚Äòfirst-rate strategic threat‚Äô ‚Äì as Israeli president Reuven Rivlin announced a few days ago or as the new minister of strategic affairs and public security in the far-right Israeli government Gilad Erdan tweeted on his first day on the job ‚Äì reflects Israel‚Äôs failure in hindering the fast growth of BDS. ‚ÄúIt also betrays Israel‚Äôs inherent inability to face such popular, anti-racist, human rights-based and nonviolent challenges to its regime of oppression.‚Äù Israeli officials told the Guardian that the focus on BDS was not an acknowledgement of its success but rather the reaffirmation of a principal of ‚Äúmoral outrage‚Äù both over the recent move by the NUS and by efforts to have Israel suspended from Fifa. That, however, has led to accusations from critics that Israel is deliberately conflating the BDS movement with separate Palestinian efforts to hold Israel accountable for the occupation. Facing growing warnings of international isolation in the absence of a peace process with the Palestinians and amid continued settlement building in the occupied territories, the latest moves appear designed to conflate BDS with separate initiatives by Palestinian diplomats to internationalise support for the end to occupation and for the creation of a Palestinian state in global forums. One Palestinian official familiar with efforts on the international stage said he believed the latest effort was aimed not only at BDS but at the wider Palestinian effort to promote its case in the international criminal Court, the UN and Fifa. ‚ÄúThey are trying to combine all the efforts to hold Israel accountable into creating a monster that is not there yet,‚Äù the official said. ‚ÄúIf ask the Palestinian leadership, some love BDS as a movement, others hate it. I think what Netanyahu is trying to do is create an idea that even if you believe Palestinian moves in international forums are legitimate, they are undermined because BDS ‚Äì in the Israelis argument - seeks to ‚Äôdestroy state of Israel‚Äô.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-03T09:26:26Z,world,World news,Hundreds of coffins prepared as China realises scale of cruise ship tragedy,"Undertakers at a small-town funeral parlour in central China are bracing themselves for the arrival of hundreds of corpses after the country‚Äôs worst shipping disaster since the 1940s. More than 400 people are feared to have died when the Eastern Star cruise ship capsized on the Yangtze river during a rainstorm on Monday night. Officials raised the official death toll to 18 on Wednesday but said rescue teams were still hunting for survivors in and around the vessel‚Äôs upturned hull.
With almost no underwater visibility, navy divers used their hands to feel their way through sections of the submerged vessel, Zhang Jianxin, a transport ministry official, told Chinese television. ‚ÄúThe whole nation is putting their hope on you,‚Äù Li Keqiang, the prime minister, told a group of divers, according to the China Daily newspaper. ‚ÄúYou are brave enough to challenge the extremes.‚Äù Of 456 people travelling on the Eastern Star, 14 people have been found alive, including the captain, a 65-year-old woman and a tour guide who survived 10 hours in the river despite being unable to swim.
However, 40 hours after the ship sank while travelling from Nanjing to Chongqing, hopes that others might be rescued were fading fast. ‚ÄúThe chances are small,‚Äù said Shi Chengming, who was leading a team of civilian rescue workers from a Buddhist charity in Chongqing to the disaster site.
Instead, staff at the Rongcheng crematorium in Jianli ‚Äì the town nearest to the wreckage ‚Äì were preparing to receive the dead. Shen Yuanhai, the owner of a coffin factory in Henan province, said he had driven through the night in a convoy of four lorries, each stacked high with refrigerated caskets. ‚ÄúWe have brought 200,‚Äù said Shen, whose factory is more than 400 miles from Jianli in the city of Zhengzhou. After being unloaded by a forklift truck, the caskets, which have transparent, flower-covered lids, were packed side-to-side into four halls where wakes will be held over the coming days.
Xie Xuening, a coffin factory employee, said the scale of the loss had shocked him. ‚ÄúI feel upset,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt is a disaster.‚Äù By Wednesday morning, the bodies of seven victims had arrived at the Rongcheng crematorium. Their identities were not immediately clear. A black-and-white noticeboard had been placed outside one of the halls for staff to record the names and ages of victims, alongside their photograph. The majority of the Eastern Star‚Äôs passengers were tourists aged between 50 and 80, state media has reported, although a three-year-old boy was also on board. A funeral parlour employee, who declined to give his name, said staff were expecting the worst. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve contacted all of the crematoriums around here so that if we don‚Äôt have room we can send the bodies there,‚Äù he said.
A doctor at the Jianli People‚Äôs hospital said his team was treating five survivors, two of whom were in intensive care. Asked if medics were expecting more survivors, the doctor, who asked not to be named, said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still waiting for information.‚Äù As the families of Eastern Star passengers began arriving in Jianli, dozens of local women gathered at the Rongcheng Crematorium to watch the grim preparations. ‚ÄúI would tell the families not to be sad,‚Äù said Zou Jinlin, 40. ‚ÄúIt was a natural disaster. It wasn‚Äôt human error.‚Äù Additional reporting by Luna Lin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-03T08:41:02Z,world,World news,Egyptian football's 'magician' denies funding Muslim Brotherhood,"They call him the magician, or the ‚Äúsmiling assassin‚Äù, for his lightning attacks and last-minute goals. But now Mohamed Aboutrika, one of Egypt‚Äôs greatest footballers of all time, is battling an adversary far more formidable than even the best international defence as he faces down a government freeze on his assets over allegations that a company he co-founded aided the Muslim Brotherhood. The furore surrounding the footballer underscores the enduring importance of the game in Egypt‚Äôs politics and how the political situation remains unsettled nearly two years after the military ousted the elected president, Mohamed Morsi, a Brotherhood member. The case is also a rare example of a public dispute that cuts across political lines in Egypt, where the rift between the state and its Islamist opponents runs deep. A state campaign against Islamists and political dissidents has left more than 1,000 dead and as many as 40,000 arrested. Abdel-Rahman el-Barr, the Muslim Brotherhood‚Äôs top religious cleric, and Mahmoud Ghozlan, the group‚Äôs former spokesman and a member of its top decision-making body, became part of their number on Monday. ‚ÄúWe come by wealth so that it can be in our hands, not in our hearts, and so our hearts cannot be confiscated, no matter what they confiscate. I will remain in this country and continue to work for its betterment,‚Äù Aboutrika said on his official Twitter and Facebook accounts. Since announcing his retirement in 2013, Aboutrika remains a hero to millions in Egypt after leading the Cairo club Al Ahly to a series of national and regional titles. He is now relying in part on his superpower status to combat the accusations that he aided the Brotherhood, which has been banned and branded a terrorist organisation. Last week, he filed an appeal against the decision by a state committee tasked with seizing assets linked to the Brotherhood. A parade of other prominent football players have lined up behind him, and the news of the seizure of his assets triggered a flood of sympathetic posts on social media. ‚ÄúThere are very few instances in Egypt today where both sides of the divide agree on anything, or would line up on the same side. Aboutrika is one of those rare instances where that is happening,‚Äù says James Dorsey, a scholar studying Middle East football, and senior fellow at the S Rajaratnam school of international studies at Singapore‚Äôs Nanyang Technological University.
The committee that seized Aboutrika‚Äôs assets alleges that a travel company he co-founded in 2013, Ashab Tours, financed the Brotherhood, a charge he denies. Over the years he built a complex public profile. In the aftermath of Egypt‚Äôs 2011 revolution that ousted president Hosni Mubarak, Aboutrika sided with the most insurrectionary force in Egyptian football: militant fans known as ultras, who fought police in the immense street battles of the revolt. In 2012, after more than 70 people were killed in a deadly stadium melee in Port Said, he backed the ultras by heeding a demand not to play in the opening match of the following season. The ultras have not escaped the government crackdown. On Saturday, an Egyptian court declared them a banned terrorist organisation. The ruling came the same day as another court sentenced Morsi to death for fleeing prison after being detained during the 2011 uprising. Aboutrika has also expressed support for the Palestinian cause. After scoring against Sudan during the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations, he pulled up his red national team jersey to reveal a white T-shirt reading ‚ÄúSympathise with Gaza.‚Äù In perhaps his most controversial move, he backed Morsi in the 2012 presidential election. Aboutrika is widely known as an avowedly religious person but denies any explicit ties with the Brotherhood. ‚ÄúFootball isn‚Äôt simply a game. He knows that football is life as far as people are concerned. Football is politics. This football is part of the life of the people,‚Äù says Alaa Ezzat, a journalist and friend of Aboutrika, who conducted a recent interview with the footballer for the state-owned al-Ahram newspaper. ‚ÄúAboutrika‚Äôs name is known in Egypt‚Äôs streets, for a very positive role in religion, in relations with the Arab nation, with Palestine.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-03T08:20:18Z,world,World news,Japanese spa fudo no yu closed after string of orgies revealed,"One of Japan‚Äôs most famous hot springs ‚Äì usually a place for a contemplative soak in mineral-rich waters ‚Äì has been closed indefinitely following complaints that groups of bathers were regularly using it for orgies, footage of which has been posted online. The hot spring, or onsen, tourism association in Shiobara, Tochigi prefecture, near Tokyo, said it had closed Fudo no Yu, an outdoor bath that was popular for its mixed bathing and panoramic views. What the outdoor onsen lacks in size ‚Äì the circular bath is just three metres (nine feet) in diameter ‚Äì it makes up for in atmosphere. Only about 10 people can bathe comfortably at any one time, but it draws large numbers of visitors hoping to relax in its mountain forest setting. However, the bath‚Äôs secluded location encouraged exhibitionists, who took advantage of the absence of a caretaker and its policy of collecting a modest 200 yen admission fee through an honesty box, according to Japanese media reports. Local residents and other bathers had been complaining about witnessing lewd acts for about a year, but the last straw appeared to have been a succession of weekend orgies involving as many as 15 middle-aged men and several younger women, according to the Tokyo Reporter website. The bath, part of the popular Shiobara onsen resort, is also thought to have been targeted by voyeurs armed with cameras, the site said, citing a report in the Mainichi Shimbun. Shigeki Tashiro, the head of the local council, said action had to be taken to safeguard Fudo no Yu‚Äôs reputation as one of Japan‚Äôs finest onsen. ‚ÄúWith the resort being promoted by the prefecture as a tourist attraction, it was a tough decision,‚Äù Tashiro was quoted as saying. ‚ÄúHowever, if left as it is, the image of the area as a tourist destination could be downgraded.‚Äù Onsen are an important part of the tourism economy in Japan, whose vast reservoirs of geothermal activity support more than 3,000 hot springs. Fudo no Yu‚Äôs popularity as a location for al fresco sex has embarrassed local tourist authorities, which had featured it on their website and promotional posters. ‚ÄúWe are sorry, but it was breach of manners that was impossible to overlook,‚Äù an unnamed member of the local residents‚Äô association told the Asahi Shimbun. ‚ÄúWe had no choice but to close the bath.‚Äù The offending onsen, which has now been drained of its water, has existed since the Meiji era (1868-1912), media reports said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-03T05:44:45Z,world,World news,Japanese robot cat Doraemon helps ease diplomatic tensions with China,"Just a few months ago, Chinese media denounced him as a counter-revolutionary. Now, though, Doraemon ‚Äì Japan‚Äôs beloved robot cat ‚Äì is easing diplomatic tensions between Tokyo and Beijing, and breaking box-office records in the process. The 3D animated film Stand By Me Doraemon brought in 30m yuan ($4.8m) in receipts on its opening day last Thursday, and repeated the feat the following day. As parents and children packed out Chinese cinemas, receipts surged to 85m yuan and 88m yuan on Saturday and Sunday, surpassing the previous single-day record for animated movies, held by the US film Kung Fu Panda 2. According to estimates, revenue from the Doraemon movie accounted for more than half of China‚Äôs total box-office revenues on Sunday, easily beating the US superhero blockbuster Avengers: Age of Ultron. Doraemon, a chubby, perennially cheerful cat from the 22nd century, has charmed generations of Japanese fans with his teleportation powers, addiction to sweet bean pancakes and array of ingenious gadgets he uses to help his hapless schoolboy friend, Nobita. The popularity of Stand By Me Doraemon reflects an easing in tensions between Japan and China over ownership of the Senkaku islands and interpretations of wartime history. China‚Äôs leader, Xi Jinping, and his Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe, have met twice in the past six months, raising hopes of friendlier ties between the world‚Äôs second and third-biggest economies. In recent remarks to a Japanese delegation of tourism and local government officials, Xi said he understood the importance of people-to-people exchanges, adding China was ‚Äúready to [negotiate] with the Japanese side to advance neighbourly friendship and cooperation‚Äù. The Doraemon film, which will be shown at 5,500 screens across China over the coming month, is the first Japanese movie to go on general release in China since 2012, when Japan‚Äôs government bought the Senkaku islands from their private Japanese owners, effectively nationalising them. The move sparked protests in several Chinese cities and sent bilateral ties to their lowest point in decades. Doraemon‚Äôs attempts to win over China haven‚Äôt always been so well received, however. Last October, a Chinese newspaper accused the blue cat of political subversion claiming his presence at an exhibition in the city of Chengdu was part of a plot to portray Japan in a kinder light as the countries traded verbal blows over the Senkakus and wartime history. ‚ÄúDoraemon is a part of Japan‚Äôs efforts of exporting its national values and achieving its cultural strategy; this is an undisputed fact,‚Äù the Chengdu Daily said in an editorial. ‚ÄúTaking this to heart, we should be less blind and keep a cool head while kissing the cheeks of the chubby blue guy.‚Äù In South Korea, where a ban on Japanese popular culture has been lifted in increments since the late 1990s, disputes over territory and the legacy of the second world war show little sign of easing. A recent survey showed that mutual suspicion among the public remains high: 52% of Japanese polled said they had a negative view of South Koreans, while in South Korea, 73% said they felt similarly towards the Japanese. Doraemon‚Äôs global popularity is such that in 2008 he was made an ambassador to promote Japanese popular culture overseas. Having built a huge following in Japan since his comic book debut in 1969, he has become instantly recognisable throughout East Asia and, more recently, in the US. The manga, created by Fujiko F Fujio, has sold well over 100m copies, making it one of the best-selling comics in the world, while the TV series has won over audiences in more than 30 countries. Last summer, Doraemon made its US debut on the Disney XD satellite channel. In 2002, Time magazine named Doraemon one of its 22 Asian heroes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 to the forest to teach them the ways of a hunter: how to make bows from vines, hunt wild turkeys and squirrels, and trap small animals. In his scrappy English, Benga often regaled the boys with stories of his adventures hunting elephants ‚Äì ‚ÄúBig, big‚Äù, he would say, with outstretched arms ‚Äì and recounted how he celebrated a kill with a triumphant hunting song. In Benga they found an open and patient teacher, and a companion who uninhibitedly relived memories of a lost and longed-for life. Benga, in turn, had found a surrogate home and family, and would learn their customs and the contours of their binding blackness. In their sermons and spirituals, he surely recognised a familiar sorrow. Still, they did not know the piercing rupture of captivity ‚Äì the eternity of alienation that many of their forebears had known, which Benga himself now knew. While they were burdened and disdained in America, it was the land they had tilled and spilled blood on, the land where they created life and buried their dead. For all the rejection, they were home. Benga had only memories, and no one but he could know what form they took. Was his sleep troubled by nightmares of being stalked by mobs, or being caged? Was he haunted by visions of murdered loved ones, or of starving, tortured, and chained Congolese? Some nights, beneath a star-speckled sky, the boys recalled, they would watch Benga build a fire, and dance and sing around it. They were enraptured as he circled the flames, hopping and singing as if they were not there. They were no older than 10, too young to grasp the poignancy of the ancient ritual. But as he, and they, grew older, something changed. By 1916, Benga had lost interest in their excursions to hunt and fish, and no longer seemed so eager a friend to the neighbourhood children. Many had noticed his darkening disposition, his all-consuming longing to go home. For hours he would sit alone in silence under a tree. Some of his young companions would recall, decades later, a song he used to sing, which he had learned at the Theological Seminary: ‚ÄúI believe I‚Äôll go home / Lordy, won‚Äôt you help me.‚Äù In the late afternoon of 19 March 1916, the boys watched as Benga gathered wood to build a fire in the field. As the fire rose to a brilliant flame, Benga danced around it while chanting and moaning. The boys had seen his ritual before, but this time they detected a profound sorrow: he seemed eerily distant, as vacant as a ghost. That night, as they slept, Ota Benga stole into a battered grey shed across the road from his home. Before daybreak, he picked up a gun that he had hidden there, and fired a single bullet through his own heart. In the harrowing stillness, he was free. ‚Ä¢ Adapted from Spectacle: The Astonishing Life of Ota Benga, published this week (US) and 2nd July (UK) by HarperCollins.

2015-06-03T02:22:39Z,world,World news,Bison tosses Australian tourist into air at Yellowstone national park,"An Australian tourist, 62, survived being tossed in the air three times by a bison while he was visiting Yellowstone national park, US park authorities have said. It is the second time in three weeks a bison has seriously injured a tourist in Yellowstone. Park officials said the man‚Äôs injuries were not life-threatening despite being thrown about repeatedly by the animal. The man, whom authorities did not name, was flown by helicopter for medical treatment. Yellowstone officials said several people crowded the bison as it lay near a path not far from the famous Old Faithful geyser on Tuesday morning. The bison charged as the man took photos from a few feet away. Bison can weigh as much as a full-size sedan and run three times faster than a person. A bison in the Old Faithful area gored a 16-year-old girl from Taiwan as she posed for a picture near the animal on 16 May. The park service said in a statement: ‚ÄúThe girl turned her back to the bison to have her picture taken when the bison lifted its head, took a couple of steps and gored her.‚Äù The exchange student, who was staying with a US family, was airlifted to hospital for treatment. Yellowstone is home to wild animals including bears, elk, deer, moose, coyotes and wolves, a park official said. ‚ÄúVisitors are reminded that Yellowstone wildlife is wild ‚Ä¶ and should not be approached, no matter how tame or calm they appear.‚Äù Bison in particular were fast, ‚Äúunpredictable and dangerous‚Äù, the official said. Many believe grizzly bears and wolves are Yellowstone‚Äôs most dangerous animals but bison and elk attacked a couple of people in the park every year and were responsible for more injuries, said Yellowstone spokeswoman Amy Bartlett. In the case of the Australian man, he wasn‚Äôt the only person to blame, Bartlett said.

2015-06-02T23:41:15Z,world,World news,Tiffany & Co backs investigative reporter in Angola blood diamonds case,"Tiffany & Co has called on Angola to drop the prosecution of an investigative reporter known for his groundbreaking investigation into blood diamonds. The diamond retailer is one of a host of famous names, including 12 Years A Slave director Steve McQueen, who have signed an open letter to Angolan president Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos over the treatment of Rafael Marques de Morais.
Marques, who uncovered stories of widespread torture and murder in the country‚Äôs diamond industry, was last week given a six-month suspended sentence over claims made in his 2011 book, Blood Diamonds: Corruption and Torture in Angola. The book accused seven army generals of complicity in more than 100 killings and widespread torture by a private security company, owned by the generals, in the country‚Äôs diamond fields. ‚ÄúMarques‚Äô vital investigations into human rights abuses should not be impeded by the threat of jail, which is set to loom over him for two years under the court‚Äôs terms,‚Äù the letter reads. ‚Äú[His] reporting is fundamental not only to Angola, but to the world at large. We call on you to ensure standards of international law are applied during the appeal process.‚Äù Marques had faced 24 defamation charges that could have resulted in a nine-year prison sentence and a fine of ¬£800,000. Human rights groups were cautiously optimistic after seven generals appeared to drop charges last week after an out-of-court settlement, as international political and media interest grew.
But, in an unexpected twist, judge Adriano Cerveira on Thursday handed down a suspended six month sentence for ‚Äúslander‚Äù and ordered Marques to ‚Äúwithdraw the book from the market, including on the internet, and not to republish or translate it‚Äù. It is unclear how that would be enforced in international markets. Following the sentence, Marques said that he believes the generals had deliberately misled him, and had wished to avoid the public embarrassment of being cross-examined in court, while still intending to pursue him. The six-month suspended sentence is a way to ensure he does not continue his investigations into torture and corruption in the southern African nation, he added. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a victory for treachery and ill-faith and it just proves the generals were aware of the abuses in the region,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf they were unaware, they would not have resorted to such laws to clear their names in such a crude and manipulative manner.‚Äù
Other signatories to Tuesday‚Äôs letter include Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales; actors Janet Suzman and Juliet Stevenson; playwright Howard Brenton; former Times editor Sir Harold Evans and the paper‚Äôs current editor, John Witherow. Several other diamond merchants have also signed, including ethical jewellers Brilliant Earth and Leber. The letter will be delivered to the embassy of Angola in London by the free expression group Index on Censorship. ‚ÄúRafael‚Äôs trial was a sham. He was told charges would be dropped, only for him to be hit with new charges out of the blue, and he was not allowed to present his evidence or call witnesses,‚Äù said Jodie Ginsberg, chief executive of Index, which gave Marques a Freedom of Expression award earlier this year. ‚ÄúRafael is a courageous journalist, working with little support to expose corruption in Angola. This absurd trial and verdict is meant to stop him from speaking out. We want to make sure that does not happen.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-02T23:37:23Z,world,World news,Alexis Tsipras to face take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum from lenders over debt offer,"The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, will be presented with what is expected to be a take-it-or-leave-it plan on Wednesday after five months of drama-filled negotiations to keep his debt-stricken country afloat. The radical left leader is to be given the ultimatum after lenders at the EU, European Central Bank (ECB) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed on the contours of a cash-for-reform deal late on Tuesday. The agreement, reached after emergency talks in Berlin on Monday, would unlock ‚Ç¨7.2bn (¬£5.2bn) in rescue loans for the cash-strapped country but demand tough economic changes in return. ‚ÄúIt covers all key policy areas and reflects the discussions of recent weeks,‚Äù a senior EU official said on Tuesday. ‚ÄúIt will be discussed with Tsipras tomorrow.‚Äù Greece‚Äôs anti-austerity leader was scheduled to fly to Brussels at the request of the EU commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, a Greek government official said. ‚ÄúThe prime minister will be in Brussels tomorrow with the Greek proposal in his luggage,‚Äù said the official on Tuesday night, suggesting the bargaining was far from over for Tsipras‚Äôs government. Both the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Fran√ßois Hollande, were also expected to put the blueprint to Tsipras in a bid to win his acceptance by Friday when Greece must pay the first in a series of loan instalments to the IMF. The accord ends months of stalemate in the wake of the election of Tsipras‚Äô anti-austerity Syriza party in January. But whether Athens will accept the offer remains in doubt. Taking a defiant stance earlier on Tuesday, Tsipras said: ‚ÄúWe have submitted a realistic plan for Greece to exit the crisis. A realistic plan, whose acceptance by the institutions, our lenders and our partners in Europe will mark the end of the scenario of divisions in Europe.‚Äù He said it was up to the bloc‚Äôs political leadership to decide whether it wanted ‚Äúto adjust to realism‚Äù. Sources suggested the 47-page proposal had been submitted by Athens before Merkel convened Monday‚Äôs mini-summit of protagonists in Europe‚Äôs debt drama. Hollande, Juncker, and the heads of the ECB and IMF, Mario Draghi and Christine Lagarde, would all have seen it, they said.
Faced with empty coffers and debt repayments worth ‚Ç¨1.6bn to the IMF this month alone, crunch time has come for Greece. Failure to honour loan instalments would automatically lead to default and a euro exit. The Washington-based IMF is expecting a first repayment of ‚Ç¨300m to be made this Friday. Last week, the national economy minister, George Stathakis, said Athens would utilise internal resources to ensure the bill was paid. But, ratcheting up the pressure on Tuesday, a Greek government official implied that the country might think twice if an agreement with creditors had still not been concluded. ‚ÄúIf we judge that a deal has been sealed, then we will make the 5 June payment normally,‚Äù he said, explaining that the money would still be transferred even if a preliminary agreement had not been approved by eurozone finance ministers. The countdown to possible economic Armageddon was infused with yet more tension as eurozone officials disagreed over the degree to which progress had been made. A French presidency official, speaking after Monday night‚Äôs talks, hinted that creditors were still at odds over the terms of a deal. Others, including the Dutch finance minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem ‚Äì who chairs the Eurogroup of euro area finance ministers ‚Äì continued to blame the lack of headway on Athens. ‚ÄúThere is some progress, but it‚Äôs really not enough,‚Äù he told Dutch television. The primary budget surplus that Greece must sign up to is believed to remain at the heart of the discord between the two, along with pension changes and labour deregulation. Greece‚Äôs outspoken finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has argued that a primary surplus above 1% will simply exacerbate Athens‚Äô debt deflationary spiral after six years of austerity-fuelled recession. The nation‚Äôs debt-to-GDP ratio stands at 180% ‚Äì the highest in the EU.
Mounting dissent from within Tsipras‚Äô Syriza party ‚Äì catapulted into office in January on the back of promises to scrap foreign-imposed budget cuts ‚Äì has deepened the uncertainty and added to speculation over whether a deal is possible. The young premier has come under growing pressure from hardliners rattled that the government has already made too many concessions to creditors. Amid talk of fresh elections ‚Äì on a day punctuated by fiery rhetoric ‚Äì the country‚Äôs usually mild-mannered deputy leader, Yannis Dragasakis, insisted that any deal would have to include a roadmap to debt sustainability. After being impoverished by belt-tightening, he said, Greeks could not bear any more austerity. ‚ÄúAs a government we do not accept ultimatums, nor do we surrender to blackmail,‚Äù tweeted the former communist, who is now in charge of the coalition‚Äôs economic policy. The debt crisis, which has seen the Greek economy contract by a depression-era 26%, has also triggered record levels of joblessness and poverty, prompting senior Syriza figures to say that any compromise will have to be honourable. ‚ÄúIf a deal is achieved that is not deemed honourable and promoting of compromise, the people will have to be asked before we sign it,‚Äù the labour minister, Panos Skourletis, told SKAI TV. ‚ÄúWhen you are elected you are not given carte blanche.‚Äù Several politicians suggested that polls could be held on 28 June. A second scenario ‚Äì one that could be prompted by lenders deciding on a short-term deal that would tide Greece over a summer of heavy debt repayments ‚Äì might also involve a referendum.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-02T22:54:12Z,world,World news,Greece to face ultimatum from eurozone and IMF,"Eurozone and International Monetary Fund officials appeared to have put the finishing touches on an ultimatum to Greece after Monday night‚Äôs emergency mini-summit between Athens‚Äôs creditors.
With Greece running out of money and due to repay ‚Ç¨300m (¬£219m) to the IMF on Friday ‚Äì and owing a further ‚Ç¨1.3bn this month ‚Äì Angela Merkel fears the crisis could hijack her hosting of a G7 summit in Bavaria this weekend. The hastily and secretly arranged mini-summit of the key leaders in the German chancellor‚Äôs Berlin offices late on Monday signalled that after five months of stalled negotiations between technocrats and civil servants, the Greek crisis is now to be tackled by national and international leaders. In Brussels and eurozone capitals, there is a strong sense of foreboding that the extreme brinkmanship on both sides is careering out of control and will end badly. The radical Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, and his governing far-left Syriza party ‚Äúis underestimating unity in the rest of the EU‚Äù, said a senior EU official involved in five years of negotiations with the Greeks. ‚ÄúThat will probably cause default or breakdown. No one is trying to prevent it any more.‚Äù A finance minister from a key eurozone country, who is party to the negotiations, said eurozone policymakers were considering how to help Greece after it had defaulted on its huge debts and been expelled from the single currency. ‚ÄúThe possibility of an accident is real,‚Äù said the minister, speaking on condition of anonymity. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs going to be an accident, we will need a big humanitarian programme for Greece.‚Äù
Merkel, long criticised as a ditherer on the euro crisis who habitually leaves everything to the last minute, appears to be in a hurry to strike a deal. It is not clear whether she is prepared to make concessions to keep Greece in the euro. On Tuesday, Brussels insisted it remained up to Tsipras to table an acceptable raft of austerity policies to access the ‚Ç¨7.2bn available in bailout funds. ‚ÄúIt is for the Greeks to present a comprehensive package which the [EU] institutions will then discuss,‚Äù said a second EU official, while adding ‚Äúthere are many different proposals being discussed‚Äù. But Merkel‚Äôs sudden initiative is also good news for Tsipras, who has long sought to shift the negotiations from the technical to the political level. In a tirade against the eurozone in Le Monde newspaper on Sunday, he demanded that Merkel and her peers take charge of the negotiations. ‚ÄúThe decision is now not in the hands of the institutions, which in any case are not elected and are not accountable to the people, but rather in the hands of Europe‚Äôs leaders,‚Äù he said.
However, the eurozone finance minister told the Guardian: ‚ÄúTsipras thinks everything has to be a political decision.‚Äù The minister argued that the centrist governments of the eurozone were unwilling to do any favours for a hard-left administration in Greece and that risk-averse eurozone leaders, personified by Merkel, were running scared of public opinion. ‚ÄúNo one is going to push for a real agreement because the one who takes the lead takes too much risk. Because it can finalise in an accident. Who will lead? [European commission president] Jean-Claude Juncker? No. The ECB? No. Merkel? No. Everyone knows being close to Syriza is detrimental.‚Äù That view was echoed by the senior official who said: ‚ÄúNot a single EU government has an interest in helping Syriza find a solution they can sell as an end to austerity.‚Äù While there are divisions between the IMF and the Europeans over what to do next, officials and diplomats say Tsipras and Syriza have failed to split the eurozone, which is more united behind the harder line espoused by the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch√§uble, than before. ‚ÄúBelgian, Finnish, Dutch opinion is hardening. The Germans are actually the softies compared to the Slovakians and Estonians,‚Äù the official said. A senior diplomat in Brussels said Spain and its finance minister, Luis de Guindos, who hopes to take over the presidency of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers in July, take the hardest line of all because they are worried that a success for Tsipras and Syriza will boost the leftwing Podemos movement in elections later this year in Spain. Then there are the Americans who are alarmed at the prospect of Greece falling out of the eurozone for geopolitical reasons. A Greek departure will present an opportunity for Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin that he is unlikely to waste, that Athens could be bought off by the Russians and become Moscow‚Äôs Trojan horse inside the Nato military alliance. Merkel‚Äôs ally, Gunther Krichbaum, who chairs the German parliament‚Äôs Europe committee, brushed off such fears on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThere are other Nato members who are not in the EU,‚Äù he told German radio. Merkel is expected to come under strong US pressure to act more decisively at the weekend when she hosts the G7 summit. The eurozone finance minister, who has taken part in most of the crisis meetings for years, was pessimistic about the outcome. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not used to dealing with a government like Syriza. It‚Äôs totally new for us. Usually we deal with mainstream parties,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf there is a default, we will have to react right away. The ECB will have legal difficulties maintaining emergency liquidity assistance to Greece. If we go to capital controls, it‚Äôs the first step in a very difficult process. The Greeks will need a new sort of currency. There is no precedent, no procedure. It will be a mess.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-02T17:53:08Z,world,World news,Independent El Bronco aims to buck Mexico's politics-as-usual trend,"Jaime Rodr√≠guez likes it when people call him El Bronco. The nickname, he claims, reflects an untamed nature that explains how he became the first independent candidate with a realistic shot at winning a major election in Mexico. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be pushed around, and people respond to that,‚Äù said El Bronco of his attempt to become governor of the northern state of Nuevo Le√≥n in elections this Sunday that will also completely renovate the lower house of Congress, elect eight other new governors and nearly 900 new mayors. ‚ÄúWe need to push the mafias out of power,‚Äù he said. El Bronco‚Äôs swashbuckling candidacy directly challenges the stranglehold maintained by Mexico‚Äôs two main political parties, and could pave the way for a serious independent contender in Mexico‚Äôs next presidential elections in 2018. A win by El Bronco, as predicted by some polls, would hint at the biggest potential shake up of the Mexican political system since the National Action Party (the Pan), ended 71 years of continuous rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (Pri) in 2000. ‚Äú[El Bronco‚Äôs campaign] is very important because it loosens the political imagination to go beyond politics as usual,‚Äù said political analyst Federico Est√©vez. ‚ÄúThe message that independent candidates can win is very worrying for the political parties.‚Äù
Est√©vez stressed that El Bronco‚Äôs popularity bears little resemblance to the success of insurgent parties in Europe, such as Spain‚Äôs Podemos or Syriza in Greece ‚Äì after all, the candidate was a member of the Pri for 33 years. He resigned in September, just after a constitutional reform giving independents in Mexico the possibility of standing. But his message that ‚Äúit‚Äôs all about corruption‚Äù nevertheless resonates in a country weary of scandal: fresh allegations of wrongdoing emerge every week, from allegations of kickbacks given for government contracts to deals with organised crime. And whatever his party political roots, his campaign ‚Äì relying on the internet to channel frustration over politics-as-usual ‚Äì remains an extraordinary feat. While his opponents can draw on huge amounts of public financing for blanket advertising campaigns, El Bronco has been sidelined by mainstream media. Local TV and radio stations have either ignored him completely or portrayed him as a dangerous populist. During the campaign one of his two ex-wives accused Rodr√≠guez of assaulting her during their marriage, an allegation he both denied and charged was part of a smear campaign against him orchestrated by the Pri. Silvia Gonz√°lez, his former wife, has publicly backed the candidate of the Pri. At two recent rallies in poor neighbourhoods of the state capital Monterrey, supporters cheered loudly when Rodr√≠guez pledged never to pay TV stations for favourable coverage ‚Äì a tactic which many high-profile candidates are alleged to have used in the past. Several in the crowd said their trust in El Bronco stemmed from his willingness to take on the cartels while he was mayor of the city of Garc√≠a, on the edge of the Monterrey metropolitan area, between 2009 and 2012 ‚Äì a period when Nuevo Le√≥n became a battlefield for the rival factions of the Gulf cartel and the Zetas.
Rodr√≠guez was himself targeted by the narcos twice; in one attack, the story goes that he ordered his driver to turn back and use his armoured car to provide cover for his bodyguards, rather than speed away to safety. ‚ÄúHe went back to protect the people working for him,‚Äù said 63-year-old former builder Jos√© Estrada with admiration. ‚ÄúIt makes me think he is sincere when he says he will go after the corruption in the political parties.‚Äù Up on stage, El Bronco milked the emotional power of his life story ‚Äì one which reflects the extraordinary levels of drug-fuelled violence that have become part of everyday life in much of the country. He pledged to dedicate his life to changing the country, he told the crowd, while cradling the corpse of his 22-year-old son, killed in a car accident while trying to escape a kidnapping attempt. ‚ÄúI know that I can deliver what I promise,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt bring you food handouts like the candidates of the political parties. I have brought you my heart and my strong character.‚Äù
What marks El Bronco‚Äôs campaign as unique is not his rhetoric, however, but his development of a digital version of the post-rally walkabouts in which he firmly shakes supporters‚Äôs hands and listens to their concerns. Chatting in the van that drives him between campaign events, El Bronco said he begins each morning with two hours dedicated to answering the WhatsApp messages on his mobile, a number he gives out everywhere he goes. But it is Facebook, he added, that sets the rhythm of his campaigning day around the state that shares a nine-mile border with Texas, and is home to some of Mexico‚Äôs biggest companies. Whipping out an iPad with a cracked screen, he scrolled down the comments below a Facebook invitation to the rally he was about to attend. ‚ÄúThe comments tell you what people feel, which is more important than what they think,‚Äù he said. A few moments later he found one about drainage in the area of the rally, which he duly included into his stump speech to general approval. ‚ÄúHe blew open the normal model of political communication on social media,‚Äù said Juan Manuel Ramos of Quinto Poder, a platform set up in 2012 to monitor the political use of the web. While most Mexican politicians‚Äô use of social media consists of anodyne tweets and Facebook posts which read like something from a motivational handbook, Rodr√≠guez uses colloquial language to respond to his constituents, said Ramos. This, Ramos added, has given El Bronco a ‚Äúnear-religious‚Äù political fanbase with a mission to get him elected. With El Bronco becoming a genuine contender, the business elite has also begun to jump on the bandwagon, along with the young and progressive who might otherwise be put off by his macho image. El Bronco‚Äôs rise in Nuevo Le√≥n inevitably brings comparisons with Vicente Fox, another northern politician who changed the country‚Äôs political history by wresting the presidency from the Pri in 2000. Fox launched his presidential bid after winning the governorship of his state of Guanajuato in 1995. Like Bronco, Fox wore a cowboy hat and peppered his speeches with swearwords. He was also an innovative campaigner, producing unusually bold and direct TV spots. And like Bronco, Fox‚Äôs mould-breaking popularity eventually drew in parts of the business elite and the leftwing intelligentsia. But as the years ticked by critics charged that the advent of political pluralism did little to limit the abuse and corruption of those in power. One-party hegemony had fallen, the argument went, only to be replaced with a kind of political cartel.
The Pri returned to federal government in 2012, when Enrique Pe√±a Nieto was elected president ‚Äì a victory which for many cemented a sense of disillusionment with Mexico‚Äôs first attempt at democratisation. One recent poll found that just 9% of Mexican voters trusted the country‚Äôs national parties. ‚ÄúOur system at the federal level and at the local level, really needs to be shaken up,‚Äù said Mauricio Sada, a businessman and former head of the Pan in the Nuevo Le√≥n congress who now supports El Bronco. ‚ÄúHe has a natural persona that fits the circumstances. There are a lot of elements that are lacking, or at least not proven, in terms of his actual capacity, but you just have to trust him.‚Äù With the tension mounting ahead of Sunday‚Äôs election, El Bronco said he deals with the stress with the help of yoga-style breathing exercises every morning, adding yet another contradictory element into his singular mix of old and new. But, the candidate mused, what really keeps him focused and calm is a sense of himself as usefully unhinged. ‚ÄúNever doubt that it is those who are a little crazy who manage to change the world,‚Äù the candidate said, after waving to another motorist giving him the thumbs up. ‚ÄúThose who reason everything, those who plan everything, and those who stay in their comfort zone ‚Äì they never change anything.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-02T16:42:43Z,world,World news,Secret report urges treaty securing US web firms' cooperation in data sharing,"A top secret report to the British prime minister has recommended that a new international treaty be negotiated to force the cooperation of the big US internet companies in sharing customers‚Äô personal data, the Guardian has learned. Privacy campaigners said the decision to classify the report, written by the former diplomat Sir Nigel Sheinwald, as top secret was designed to bury it and its key recommendation for an international treaty could provide a legal, front-door alternative to the government‚Äôs renewed ‚Äúsnooper‚Äôs charter‚Äù surveillance proposals. It is believed the former British ambassador to Washington concluded that such a treaty could overcome US laws that prevent web giants based there, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Microsoft and Yahoo, from sharing their customers‚Äô private data with British police and security services. It would also mean not having to revive the powers, which require British phone companies to share data from the US giants passing over their networks, from the 2012 communications data bill that would enforce their compliance. Jim Killock of the Open Rights Group said: ‚ÄúThe Sheinwald report should be published. Any attempt to hide it can only be interpreted as an attempt to close down debate about whether the snooper‚Äôs charter is really needed. ‚ÄúA new international treaty is the right approach to cross-border requests for data by law enforcement agencies. This approach undermines Theresa May‚Äôs claim that there is a need for a new snooper‚Äôs charter when there is a simple, transparent and workable solution.‚Äù But the Cabinet Office defended its decision to keep the report secret. It said Shinewald ‚Äúreports on progress to the prime minister but ‚Ä¶ is not undertaking a public review‚Äù. The Guardian understands the report has been classified as top secret by the Cabinet Office because it goes into the detail of each company‚Äôs operations. Shinewald was appointed by Cameron in September 2014 as his special envoy on intelligence and law enforcement data sharing. Campaigners said the Sheinwald report could be published by redacting or stripping out the confidential detail of each company‚Äôs operations and having the report declassified. May, the home secretary, is due to publish within the next few months an ‚Äúinvestigatory powers bill‚Äù that is expected to extend the powers of the security services to access personal communications data, which tracks everyone‚Äôs email, web and social media use, and enhance their powers for the warranted intercept of their content. The bill has been described as a ‚Äúturbo-charged snooper‚Äôs charter‚Äù and is expected to revive the original 2012 communications data bill that was blocked by the Liberal Democrats in the coalition government. That bill had included highly controversial powers requiring British phone and web companies to collect the personal third-party data passing over their networks from US web companies that refused to cooperate on a voluntary basis with British requests. The concerns of the US major web companies over this point was a key factor behind Nick Clegg‚Äôs decision to veto the bill. There is currently a system of general mutual legal assistance treaties, known as Mlats, but they are regarded as cumbersome and slow. The Home Office has said they are completely unsuitable to facilitate the real-time exchange of data for day to day crime and counterterrorism investigations. The Home Office confirmed that in extreme cases it was considering inserting ‚Äúblack box‚Äù probes into the transatlantic networks to collect the data it says it needs. Cameron acknowledged the problem facing internet firms when he appointed Sheinwald as a special envoy. The prime minister said a number of overseas companies had said their ability to work with the British government was severely constrained by international conflicts of jurisdiction, ‚Äúfor example, where they think they have a British law saying they should share data, and an American law saying they shouldn‚Äôt‚Äù. This week‚Äôs vote in the US Congress allowing some domestic data surveillance powers to lapse underlined the growing difference in US and British policies. Eric King, deputy director of Privacy International, accused the government of avoiding an honest debate about surveillance: ‚ÄúThe role of US companies is critical to surveillance reform, but now the report commissioned to assess the situation, and report back to parliament and public, is being classified top secret. Why?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúPerhaps the report hints that last summer‚Äôs Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act [Dripa] didn‚Äôt solve the problem it claimed to, or acknowledges that greater international reform is a better option than rushing through broad powers at home to try and strong-arm companies abroad. Unless it‚Äôs published, we‚Äôll never know. ‚ÄúThis is not how complex reforms should be conducted. Must the same mistakes continue to be made, time and time again? Or will this government allow public and parliament the space for an honest debate about surveillance that it so sorely needs?‚Äù In response, a Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‚ÄúSir Nigel Sheinwald has been leading the discussions on intelligence and law enforcement data-sharing with overseas governments, communications service providers, and other key international partners on ways to improve access to data when it is stored in other jurisdictions. ‚ÄúThis includes consideration of new international frameworks to facilitate data sharing. He reports on progress to the prime minister but unlike David Anderson QC, is not undertaking a public review.‚Äù The Sheinwald report was commissioned by Cameron when the emergency Dripa legislation was introduced last year. At the same time he asked Sir David Anderson, the official reviewer of counterterrorism laws, to undertake a review of the current surveillance and intercept laws. The emergency data retention legislation is due to expire in December 2016 and the government is currently discussing its options to replace it. The Cabinet Office said the Anderson review would be published soon and his ‚Äúthorough and comprehensive report will be important as we draw up new legislation‚Äù. But privacy campaigners fear the Anderson review will focus on the legalities of the surveillance laws rather than the bigger picture. The home secretary had tried to fix the problem of requiring the cooperation of the US internet giants in last summer‚Äôs Dripa legislation which asserted the ‚Äúextra-territoriality‚Äù of UK intercept warrants and requests for communications data. But US law has various blocks on sending data overseas which has limited the impact of the move. An international treaty would allow these blocks to be dismantled to facilitate data exchange between trusted countries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-02T16:36:59Z,world,World news,"Syria: Isis advance on Aleppo aided by Assad regime air strikes, US says","The US has accused the Syrian government of providing air support to an advance by Islamic State militants against opposition groups north of Aleppo. Fighters opposing the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, have made the same claims since Sunday, when Isis began advancing towards the town of Azaz near the Turkish border. The seizure of Azaz, 20 miles north-west of Aleppo, would imperil the main opposition supply line into Syria‚Äôs biggest city, the rebel-held east of which has been besieged by government forces for more than two years. A post to a Twitter account used by the US embassy in Syria said late on Monday: ‚ÄúReports indicate that the regime is making air strikes in support of [Isis‚Äôs] advance on Aleppo, aiding extremists against Syrian population. ‚ÄúWe have long seen that the regime avoids Isis lines, in complete contradiction to the regime‚Äôs claims to be fighting Isis,‚Äù the embassy said in a separate tweet.
The Isis offensive, which began on Sunday, was the first launched inside Syria by the jihadist group since it was forced out of northern Aleppo 18 months ago in a six-week battle that claimed the lives of at least 1,500 opposition fighters and allowed government forces to tighten a stranglehold around the city. Since then, loyalist forces have twice attempted and failed to completely surround Aleppo. Rebel groups, including Islamist and more mainstream factions, had consolidated supply lines north to the Turkish border after the second failed attempt in March. Islam Alloush, a spokesman for the Islamic Front, one of the main opposition groups in northern Syria, said: ‚ÄúYesterday, the regime bombed Mare‚Äôa (which was held by the opposition) exactly at the same time when Isis was attacking us, and this helped them greatly. ‚ÄúIt has become a matter of fact since 2013 that the Syrian regime has bombed us to stop us fighting Isis properly. Isis have never attacked Syrian planes. They owe their success to the regime.‚Äù
A second opposition leader from the Suqr al-Sham group said: ‚ÄúThey have hit us with Grad rockets, artillery, air strikes and everything else since Sunday. They have not hit an Isis position.‚Äù On Sunday a Syrian air force jet attacked a marketplace in the Isis-held city of al-Bab, 30 miles north-east of Aleppo, killing at least 30 civilians, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based monitoring group. Opposition groups have repeatedly pleaded for US air strikes to deter Isis from taking ground in the north. US warplanes have often attacked targets in eastern Syria, but there have been few forays around Aleppo. Strikes by the US and an Arab coalition were decisive in forcing Isis out of the Kurdish border town of Kobani in January and have been instrumental in pushing the terror group back from parts of Iraq‚Äôs Kurdish north. However, Washington has faced persistent criticism that it lacks a uniform strategy to deal with the group, which remains in control of a vast area of land roughly the size of Jordan that straddles the border between Iraq and Syria. The US says it is about to begin training vetted anti-Assad rebels in Syria‚Äôs north. However, more than four years into the civil war, a strong Salafi jihadi alliance has emerged from the fractured opposition to take a lead role in much of the fighting. ‚ÄúIt will be hard now for us to fight our own battles,‚Äù said an Islamic Front member, Mahmoud Hamza.Separately, at a meeting in Paris of members of a US-led coalition against Isis, a senior American official pledged to make it easier for the Iraqi army to get hold of new weapons to support its effort to recapture Ramadi and other lost territory. Tony Blinken, the US deputy secretary of state, was responding to an appeal from the Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, who complained that promised military support had failed to materialise and that western sanctions made it hard for his government to buy Russian and Chinese arms. ‚ÄúArmament and ammunition, we haven‚Äôt seen much. Almost none. We‚Äôre relying on ourselves, but fighting is very hard this way,‚Äù Abadi said early on Tuesday. Blinken, who was representing the Obama administration at the Paris meeting after John Kerry, the US secretary of state, broke his leg, said that US anti-tank rockets were on the way to Iraqi forces to help them counter Isis truck bombs, and said that constraints on Iraq‚Äôs access to weapons would be lifted. ‚ÄúWe will redouble our efforts,‚Äù Blinken said. The anti-Isis coalition is supporting the Iraqi military effort with air strikes, drone surveillance and other intelligence. The UK, which is carrying out air strikes and flying surveillance drones over Iraq as part of its contribution to the coalition, said in Paris that it would contribute ¬£2m to EU-UN funding for stabilising areas recaptured from Isis. The Paris meeting ended in a coalition statement vowing support for Abadi and his plan to win back Ramadi and other territory lost in Anbar province, including the development of an Iraqi national guard as an umbrella for the various armed groups fighting Isis. It also said that only the formation of a new government in neighbouring Syria would ‚Äúcreate the necessary conditions to reverse the tide of extremism and radicalism generated by the regime‚Äôs abuses‚Äù. However, both Russia and Iran, which were not invited to the Paris meeting, restated their commitment to the Assad regime on Tuesday. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said: ‚ÄúIt is absolutely clear to me it was a mistake ‚Äì still is ‚Äì not to coordinate the air strikes with the activities of the Syrian army. That‚Äôs what we believe must be done ‚ÄúThat is what, unfortunately, our American colleagues cannot accept for ideological considerations,‚Äù he told Bloomberg Television in an interview. Meanwhile, Iran‚Äôs president, Hassan Rouhani, was quoted on the state news agency IRNA as saying: ‚ÄúThe Iranian nation and government will remain at the side of the Syrian nation and government until the end of the road. ‚ÄúTehran has not forgotten its moral obligations to Syria and will continue to provide help and support on its own terms to the government and nation of Syria.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-02T16:35:21Z,world,World news,Missile firm offers to recreate MH17 crash in bid to clear Russia,"A Russian defence conglomerate has suggested recreating the MH17 plane crash by shooting another Boeing 777 aircraft out of the sky using a Buk missile system. Almaz-Antey, which makes the Buk systems, said such an experiment would help prove its thesis of how the plane was shot down over eastern Ukraine in July last year. All 298 people on board died in the incident. Almost all the circumstantial evidence appears to point to a Buk system fired from separatist-controlled territory. Russia has denied supplying the system to the separatists, just as it has denied providing any military aid, despite much evidence to the contrary. At a press conference in Moscow on Tuesday Almaz-Antey presented an ‚Äúexpert report‚Äù on the crash, in which it said it believed the plane had indeed been downed by a Buk system. However, it placed the launch position in a different place to others, and said the attack could only have been carried out using a discontinued Buk M-1 system, which it claimed the Ukrainian army operated but the Russian army did not. The company‚Äôs general director, Yan Novikov, said Almaz-Antey was prepared to stage a reconstruction of the crash, ‚Äúdespite the significant costs involved‚Äù, in order to prove the angles. He said the company could invite international observers could take part. ‚ÄúThey would probably buy an old out-of-service plane, fly it on autopilot, and then shoot it down over a military testing ground,‚Äù said Igor Korotchenko, a Russian defence analyst. ‚ÄúThe aim would be to get all the angles the same and show the damage.‚Äù Almaz-Antey said it had carried out its own investigations as it was furious at having been put on EU and US sanctions lists along with other companies involved in Russia‚Äôs actions in east Ukraine. Russia‚Äôs defence ministry has previously suggested MH17 may have been shot down by a Ukrainian fighter jet, and state television gave prominent airtime to people who claimed to have seen a second plane in the sky. That story is now changing, possibly under the weight of evidence that a Buk surface-to-air system was indeed involved. The Dutch commission investigating the tragedy has not yet published its final report. An Almaz-Antey expert presented several slides showing graphs, equations and 3D-reenactments, which he said showed that damage to the aircraft was consistent with the impact from a Buk missile but only from the older Buk M-1 system. The company representatives said they had used secret information about the properties of the missiles, which the Russian defence ministry had agreed to declassify especially for the purposes of the report. They said they could not speculate on which side had fired the missile but intimated heavily that they believed it to be the Ukrainians. Novikov said the 9M38(M1) missiles used with the Buk M-1 system had not been produced since 1999. He said Ukraine had 991 of the missiles, which the company knew as it helped perform maintenance on them in 2005. He said they were not currently in use with the Russian armed forces. However, even if all of their findings are correct, it is unclear whether this would prove that Russia had not supplied the missile system. At the press conference it appeared that the representatives were willing to answer only friendly questions. There was no chance to ask how many M1 systems were still in Russia, including decommissioned or out-of-use systems. Reporters from the Associated Press said they saw a Buk system in the rebel-held town of Snizhne in eastern Ukraine on the day of the attack, and there were numerous photographs purportedly of a Buk system being moved through rebel territory. Locals in the nearby town of Torez said they had seen a Buk drive past. In the days after the attack, a rebel commander admitted the rebels had a Buk system, which he believed had arrived from Russia. He later retracted his words. A number of studies using open-source photographs and tracking have suggested the missile was launched near Snizhne, but Almaz-Antey‚Äôs directors said their analysis proved the missile must have been launched further away, near the village of Zaroshchenskoe. Zaroshchenskoe was very close to the front line at the time MH17 was downed, but is believed to have been under rebel control. This made it unclear why Almaz-Antey wanted to recreate the incident and what such a re-enactment would prove. It may mean that Russia is preparing to accept that rebels downed MH17 but is now working to show that the Buk system involved did not come from Russia but was captured from Ukrainian forces. On Sunday the citizen journalist group Bellingcat released a report that it said proved that the Russian defence ministry had used doctored images in an earlier presentation about MH17. Almaz-Antey said it had carried out the investigation as part of an appeal against its inclusion on sanctions lists, saying that the development of a new ‚Äúcluster‚Äù near St Petersburg had become significantly more expensive now that equipment could no longer be purchased from suppliers it had previously planned to use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-02T16:00:00Z,world,World news,Anger and resignation at scene of Chinese cruise ship sinking,"The call that transformed Deng Liping from minivan driver to corpse collector came out of the blue at dawn on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThe government told me to come to the river and pick up the bodies,‚Äù the 52-year-old said. ‚ÄúThey said a ship had sunk, get ready to leave.‚Äù Less than two hours later, Deng and dozens of other volunteer drivers found themselves on the waterlogged banks of the Yangtze river at the scene of what looks likely to be China‚Äôs worst shipping disaster since 1948. Just offshore lay the upended shell of the Eastern Star, a luxury cruise ship that was carrying 458 people, including dozens of elderly tourists and a three-year-old boy, when it capsized and sank on Monday night. By Tuesday afternoon 15 survivors had been found, including the ship‚Äôs captain and chief engineer who were detained for questioning. Five dead were brought to shore. Deng, the driver-cum-undertaker, pointed to 10 bright orange bodybags he had been given to take away some of the hundreds more who are feared dead. ‚ÄúNothing like this has ever happened before,‚Äù he said. Details of the Eastern Star‚Äôs terrifying final moments began to emerge on Tuesday night as darkness enveloped the small port of Damazhou, which rescue teams are using as their base. The vessel was travelling along the world‚Äôs third longest river from Nanjing to Chongqing, a major city in the south-west of the country, when it ran into trouble after hitting a ferocious storm that China‚Äôs weather bureau classified as a tornado. Residents of Miaoling village, around two miles from the boat‚Äôs final resting place, described a furious cyclone that uprooted trees and flooded fields and homes. ‚ÄúIt was a level-12 storm out on the river,‚Äù said Liu Pingshan, a 45-year-old farmer. ‚ÄúI have never seen one like that before. It is very rare.‚Äù The storm alarmed the 406 tourists on the Eastern Star, most of them retirees from eastern China aged between 50 and 80, according to local reports. One passenger, named as 60-year-old Zhang Lifen, was so worried that she called her husband who was hundreds of miles away in Shanghai. ‚ÄúIt is raining heavily and the wind is blowing like crazy,‚Äù she told him, according to the Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper. Less than half an hour later, at 9.28pm, the ship keeled over in the murky brown water. It took less than two minutes for it to sink, according to the People‚Äôs Daily newspaper, the Communist party‚Äôs official mouthpiece.
By dawn a rescue operation had kicked in as hundreds of Chinese troops, police and emergency workers poured into the rural area around Jianli, the nearest city to the disaster. ‚ÄúWe will do everything we can to rescue everyone trapped in there, no matter if they‚Äôre still alive or not and we will treat them as our own families,‚Äù said Chen Shoumin, a senior military commander from Hubei province. Images broadcast on Chinese television showed a rescue worker tapping on the ship‚Äôs hull with a small hammer in an apparent attempt to find survivors trapped in underwater air pockets. As the hours passed, stories of survival began to emerge: first of a 65-year-old woman who was pulled from the wreck, then of Zhang Hui, a tour guide who escaped despite spending 10 hours in the water and not knowing how to swim. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still alive,‚Äù a jubilant Zhang told his wife and 15-year-old son in his first call home, according to Chinese state media. The 43-year-old painted a chilling portrait of the cruise ship‚Äôs last moments. As the rainstorm pounded the vessel, he recalled, he began to notice more and more water coming on board. ‚ÄúThe water continued to seep through even when you shut the windows,‚Äù he said. Within minutes the ship was listing at a 45-degree angle, sending bottles clattering to the floor. ‚ÄúLooks like we are in trouble,‚Äù he told his friend. Seconds later the boat was submerged. ‚ÄúIf it had not happened so fast, a lot of people could‚Äôve been saved.‚Äù During a visit to the disaster site on Tuesday, China‚Äôs prime minister, Li Keqiang, praised the rescue effort and hailed Zhang‚Äôs survival as a miracle. He urged rescuers to ‚Äúseize every second, battle the fatigue and challenge the extremes‚Äù in the race to find survivors, Xinhua reported. Zhang Hongxia, a local doctor, was among hundreds of people gathered on the banks of the Yangtze hoping for further miracles. ‚ÄúThe chance of survivors is really slim,‚Äù said Zhang, who works at Jianli‚Äôs Number Five People‚Äôs hospital. ‚Äú[But] it‚Äôs the duty of a doctor to be here. If we can save one person we will still feel really happy.‚Äù
Mostly, however, the atmosphere was of quiet resignation as Jianli‚Äôs amateur body collectors lined up on the muddy riverbank waiting for their grisly cargo to come ashore. ‚ÄúIt is a natural disaster,‚Äù shrugged Xu Houwu, 62, a subsistence farmer who had also been asked to turn his hand to the funeral trade. ‚ÄúIt is not something we can change.‚Äù By nightfall the families of 17 passengers from Fujian province had arrived in Jianli seeking news of their loved ones and answers. There was anger among some relatives that human errors as well as meteorological conditions might have contributed to the tragedy. ‚ÄúWhy did the captain leave the ship while the passengers were still missing?‚Äù asked Huang Yan, a Shanghai accountant who believed that her husband and father were on board. ‚ÄúThe government must meet its responsibility,‚Äù said Huang Jing, who had two relatives on board. ‚ÄúWe need to learn what happened to our loved ones.‚Äù Additional reporting Luna Lin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-02T15:05:05Z,world,World news,Why Turkey's elections could upend its politics ‚Äì the Guardian briefing,"What‚Äôs happening? Turkey holds its parliamentary elections on Sunday 7 June. In Turkey‚Äôs last parliamentary elections, in 2011, 43 million of the country‚Äôs 50 million eligible voters came to the polling station. On Sunday, a similar number are predicted to turn out to elect 550 people to form the 25th parliament of Turkey. The parliament is known as the grand national assembly. Turkey is an emerging democracy and has an interesting electoral system, which will be tested during this election. The president is hoping his party will gain a ‚Äúsuper-majority‚Äù in the parliament, allowing it to make changes to the constitution without holding a referendum, and thus enabling it to introduce stronger presidential powers and change the shape of Turkish politics. What‚Äôs the background?
Turkey has a president and a prime minster. The prime minister is the leader of whichever party wins a majority in parliamentary elections, such as those being held on the weekend. The president used to be appointed by parliament, but a referendum in 2010 changed that to allow for direct presidential elections, the first of which was held last August and won by Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. Erdoƒüan had been, until that point, prime minister of Turkey and leader of the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP). Erdoƒüan claims the current parliamentary system is ineffective and is calling for Turkey to move to a strong presidential system of government, which he believes necessary to turn Turkey into a world power. In order to strengthen presidential powers, the ruling party would need to change Turkey‚Äôs constitution, which can happen in different ways depending on how many seats the ruling party wins. A party needs to win 276 seats to form a government, but if it wins 330 seats it can call referendums on proposed constitutional changes throughout its rule. If it wins 367 seats ‚Äì a two-thirds majority ‚Äì it can change the constitution without calling a referendum, giving the ruling party an enormous amount of power. Despite a constitutional requirement that the president should remain impartial during parliamentary election campaigns, Erdoƒüan has been touring the country campaigning for the AKP, in the hope that his party will win 367 seats and make the constitutional changes to presidential powers that he would like. In the 2002 parliamentary elections, the AKP won almost 60% of the country‚Äôs seats and was just four seats shy of the 367-seat threshold that would have allowed it to make constitutional changes without referendums, despite winning only 34.3% of the vote. The reason for this discrepancy is Turkey‚Äôs electoral system, which reallocates the seats won by small parties if they do not receive a certain percentage of the national vote. Erdoƒüan is hoping this electoral quirk will work in his party‚Äôs favour again this year, though polling suggests he will be disappointed, with the AKP predicted to win the election, but not the super-majority Erdoƒüan is hoping for. How does the voting system work? Turkey is broken into regions that can elect a certain number of MPs based on population. However, Turkey employs the D‚ÄôHondt voting system, which requires a party to win a certain percentage of the national vote in order to take up any seats it has won. The D‚ÄôHondt method is used in other countries such as Denmark, Spain, Israel, Poland and Russia, but Turkey has the highest threshold of any country in the world, requiring a party to receive 10% of the national vote before any of its elected representatives can enter parliament. What this means is that if a party wins 40 seats but receives only 9.55% of the national vote, as the True Path party (DYP) did in the 2002 Turkish elections, it forfeits those 40 seats, which are then reallocated to larger parties. This system gives larger parties an obvious advantage, as they often end up with bonus seats, allowing the ruling party to increase its parliamentary majority dramatically.
To put the Turkish system in context, if a 10% threshold applied in the UK, the current parliament would be made up of Conservative, Labour and Ukip MPs only, with the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Greens and all other parties forfeiting their seats. Under the Turkish system, the Conservatives would have gained 28 bonus seats, Labour would have gained 49 and Ukip would have increased the number of seats it won from one to 10.
The 10% threshold does not apply to candidates who run as independents, and some parties use this to their advantage. For example, in the 2011 elections the Peace and Democracy party (BDP) received only 5.67% of the vote across the country, but 35 of their members were elected as independents ‚Äì and then rejoined the BDP after the election. Who are the parties?
Founded by politicians of various existing conservative parties in 2001, the Islamicconservative Justice and Development party (AKP) has ruled Turkey since it won in landslide elections in 2002. In the last national elections the party gathered 49.8% of all votes. The former foreign minister Ahmet Davutoƒülu became party leader and prime minister after Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan was elected as president of Turkey in a popular vote last year. He also stands as the party‚Äôs top candidate on 7 June, despite his often criticised and only thinly veiled support for the AKP, when as president he should be impartial. One main target for the AKP is to win a twothirds majority ‚Äì or 367 seats in parliament ‚Äì in order to change the current constitution and introduce an executive presidential system without a referendum. This seems to have become an unattainable goal. While it is pretty much certain that the AKP will emerge as the winner from the elections, recent polls suggest that they might lose up to 10 points ‚Äì which would put a referendum, for which the party needs a three fifths majority, or 330 seats, out of reach. The AKP faces a number of serious challenges in this year‚Äôs elections. Internally the party is more divided than ever before. Furthermore, an important number of AKP voters show little support for the party‚Äôs executive presidency plans. Foreign policy troubles, a stalling economy and the government‚Äôs increasing authoritarianism might drive an important number of former AKP voters to cast their ballots for one of the opposition parties.
Established by Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, the founder of the Turkish Republic, in 1923, the Republican People‚Äôs party (CHP) is the oldest party and represents the main opposition. The party leader and its top candidate is Kemal Kili√ßdaroglu. In the last parliamentary elections, the CHP was able to garner 25.98% of all votes. The CHP‚Äôs election manifesto is centred on economic and labour issues: the party promises to introduce higher pensions, to tackle the current unemployment rate of 11.2%, and to improve employment among young people. It also promises to increase the minimum wage from 950 lira (¬£235) to 1,500 lira a month, whereas the work week is not to exceed 40 hours. The CHP supports the reform of the current constitution, introduced by the military junta after the 1980 military coup, but opposes the AKP‚Äôs plans of an executive presidency. The CHP is the only party that organised primaries for the candidates standing in the 7 June elections and the election manifesto was written over a period of eight months and in cooperation with unions, trade chambers and other civil society groups. While the party has certainly changed under its current leader, many voters, especially Kurds and the religiously conservative, still distrust the CHP as a dogmatic and elitist party, making an election victory highly unlikely.
The far-right Nationalist Movement party (MHP), informally known as the Grey Wolves, will likely retain its place as the third largest group in the Turkish parliament. In 2011, the party got 13.01% of all votes, and runs again under the leadership of Devlet Bah√ßeli. While the MHP supports a certain degree of Kurdish and minority rights ‚Äì the party promises in its manifesto that Cemeviler, Alevi houses of worship, will receive state support ‚Äì they are against the peace process between the government and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers‚Äô party (PKK), arguing that the Kurds need to accept the authority of the Turkish state. They promise to end all ongoing negotiations should they come to power. Therefore the MHP draws their support mainly from a non-Kurdish base and is likely to generate MPs in all major Turkish cities. The MHP is expected to improve their vote count this year but has no traditional stronghold anywhere in the country. Polls suggest they will take votes both from the ruling AKP as well as from the main opposition CHP, from Turks who do not agree with the peace negotiations or who long for a return to more Turkish-nationalist government policies. Lately both Erdoƒüan and AKP candidates have criticised Kurdish politicians and the peace process in campaign speeches, well aware that the MHP might eat into their nationalist voter base.
Often described as Turkey‚Äôs answer to Greece‚Äôs Syriza and the Spain‚Äôs Podemos, the pro-Kurdish Peoples‚Äô Democratic party (HDP) arguably has the highest stakes in this year‚Äôs national elections. In order to enter parliament after 7 June, it will have to garner at least 10% of the national vote to get over the election threshold. Should it succeed, it will secure at least 50 seats, but if it fails all of these seats will go to the other parties and might hand the AKP a huge majority. Founded in 2012 and led by chairman Selahattin Demirta≈ü and chairwoman Figen Y√ºksekdag, this democratic-socialist party will stand the first time as a party. In 2011 the HDP‚Äôs MPs stood as independent candidates since Turkey‚Äôs election threshold of 10% only applies to political parties. It is the only political party in Turkey that has a 50% women‚Äôs quota. The HDP centres its election programme on minority rights, the rights of women and LGBTs and aspires to end ethnic, religious and gender discrimination. The party promises to drive forward the Kurdish peace process and to introduce mother-tongue education. It also plans to abolish obligatory (Sunni) religious lessons in schools in favour of electives that correspond with pupils‚Äô religious beliefs. The HDP describes itself as an environmentalist and anti-capitalist party that opposes nuclear power and vows to improve workers‚Äô rights. What are the issues? An Ipsos poll conducted earlier this year found that the most significant issue for Turkish voterswas the condition of the economy, closely followed by unemployment. The AKP has campaigned strongly on these issues, claiming credit for the financial growth experienced by Turkey, which is now the world‚Äôs 17th-largest economy. The CHP, however, claims that the financial growth Turkey has experienced has led to greater inequality between rich and poor and has pledged, if elected, to tackle youth unemployment, which sits around 20%. A key issue in the campaign is rights for the 14 million Kurdish people in Turkey. The AKP originally promised they would increase rights for Kurds by establishing Kurdish-language media and university departments, but the party seems to have changedits mind on these issues, with Erdoƒüan claiming earlier in the campaign that there was ‚Äúno longer a Kurdish problem‚Äù. The AKP‚Äôs refusal to engage on Kurdish issues could see it lose support and bleed seats to the pro-Kurdish BDP. Both main parties have promised that, if elected with a sufficient majority, they will make changes to Turkey‚Äôs constitution, which was written in 1982 by the military leaders who ruled Turkey. The AKP promises a completely new constitution, focused on the individual and freedom, though opponents fear the changes are to consolidate Erdoƒüan‚Äôs power. The CHP promises to change the constitution to introduce press freedoms - Turkey is currently ranked 148th in the world for journalistic freedom by Reporters Without Borders - a reduction in the electoral threshold to 3% and greater rights for minority ethnic groups.

2015-06-02T13:07:54Z,world,World news,"Tahera Ahmad: 'This isn't about me and a soda can, it's about systemic injustice'","Tahera Ahmad‚Äôs allegations of discrimination on a United Airlines flight over the weekend spread like wildfire. ‚ÄúPeople know this isn‚Äôt just about a can of diet soda,‚Äù she told the Guardian after arriving back in Chicago on Monday evening. The level of interest, she said, shows ‚Äúthere‚Äôs something greater to the story that resonates with many minority groups not only in this country, but all over the world‚Äù. Ahmad, who is a chaplain at Northwestern University, has received support from countless people on every corner of the globe, which she finds to be proof that her experience isn‚Äôt uncommon. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about me and a soda can,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs about systemic injustice that is perpetuated throughout our community.‚Äù
Ahmad had been traveling to speak at a conference that was promoting dialogue between Israeli and Palestinian youth in Washington DC. While on her flight to DC on Friday, she requested an unopened can of diet soda, but was told by a flight attendant that it was against policy to give passengers unopened cans because these could be used as weapons. The flight attendant then gave the man next to her an unopened can of beer prompting Ahmad‚Äôs calls of discrimination. Another man across the aisle to say to Ahmad, ‚ÄúYou Muslim, you need to shut the fuck up. You know you would use it as a weapon, so shut the fuck up.‚Äù Ahmad recounted the details of her story on her Facebook page while in-flight, sparking global coverage, and leading to calls for a boycott of the airline. The airline has since released a statement where they call the incident a ‚Äúmisunderstanding regarding a diet soda‚Äù and do not label it as discrimination or mention the hate speech.
‚ÄúI asked United to recognize it as an act of discrimination,‚Äù Ahmad said, ‚Äúmy hope was they would say, ‚ÄòYou know what, this should have never happened and here‚Äôs what we are going to do to make sure this never happens to anyone again.‚Äô‚Äù But that doesn‚Äôt look to be happening, leading Ahmad and her supporters to continue their boycott of United. According to Ahmad ‚Äì who filed a formal complaint with United Airlines after exiting the plane with the pilot escorting her to customer service ‚Äì there will be an investigation into her allegations, but the airline has not yet announced any plans to discuss issues around potential discrimination on their flight. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre basically failing to recognize the humiliation that happened to me,‚Äù she told the Guardian. ‚ÄúSo I am going to look into options to ensure that of course this type of discrimination doesn‚Äôt happen again. Not to minorities, not to anybody else.‚Äù As for the alleged policy of unopened cans that led to this mishap: Shuttle America who was operating the United Airlines flight 3504 that Ahmad was on doesn‚Äôt actually have one that discusses cans being used as potential weapons if unopened. ‚ÄúThere is no policy difference in serving alcoholic or non-alcoholic canned beverages to passengers,‚Äù says Bob Birge, director of corporate communications at Republic Airways Holdings, which owns Shuttle America, ‚Äúno differentiation in opened or unopened cans, and no policy speculating what may or may not be done with a container.‚Äù Birge also tells the Guardian they have yet to receive a formal complaint from Ahmad on their end, unlike United Airlines, and cannot further formally address the issue with staff because like beverage services on a flight, ‚Äúthere is a process passengers are expected to follow if they have a complaint or issue they would like addressed‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe extraordinarily unprofessional and humiliating treatment of one of our community members is shockingly disappointing,‚Äù the Northwestern University president, Morton Schapiro, said in an official statement released on Monday. As Ahmad‚Äôs story continues to garner more attention, she has also begun receiving an enormous amount of hate-filled messages and phone calls. ‚ÄúSomebody called me and acted like they were a United representative,‚Äù Ahmad told the Guardian. Realizing that the caller might not be an actual employee of the airline, Ahmad asked for evidence of his employment. ‚ÄúSo he said, ‚ÄòWhat? You don‚Äôt believe me? You want to see my dick? You want to suck on my dick? I know you Muslims like that.‚Äù Ahmad‚Äôs social media account has also been continually hacked. The hate hasn‚Äôt concerned the woman considered to be a ‚Äúleading Muslim woman‚Äù by the White House. She plans to continue using the momentum of her story to elevate the conversation. In a 2013 study conducted by Pew Research Group, 45% of respondents said that Muslim Americans face ‚Äúa lot‚Äù of discrimination, and 28% said Muslims are subject to discrimination. ‚ÄúFerguson happened, ‚Äòblack lives matter‚Äô happened, and what is it these minority groups were saying? They were saying: understand my pain; understand my injustice. There is a lot of pain there,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúAnd I think that‚Äôs why this story resonates with so many people.‚Äù Ahmad is pushing for United Airlines to call this incident what many have joined her in calling it: discrimination, because ‚Äúthis is just one example of injustice that continues to happen and I cannot remain silent‚Äù.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-02T13:04:57Z,world,World news,Turkey at a crossroads as Erdoƒüan bulldozes his way to lasting legacy,"The rolling hills by the Black Sea, 90 minutes north-west of Istanbul, have long been prized for their dense forest and pristine lakes. Now the water buffalo that graced this landscape and supplied the city with much of its dairy produce are vanishing from what Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, the president of Turkey, has turned into one of the world‚Äôs biggest building sites. About 2.5m trees are being cleared from an area of 6,000 hectares (15,000 acres). The lorries are bumper to bumper, 24 hours a day. The locals can barely sleep, nor cross the street for the noise and the traffic. ‚ÄúThe forests are gone, the villages are gone, the livestock is gone,‚Äù says Cemalettin G√ºn, a farmer. Prominent among the tens of thousands of election posters covering Istanbul is the explanation for the construction frenzy. ‚ÄúWe are building the world‚Äôs biggest airport,‚Äù boast the posters of the governing Justice and Development party, or AKP, that Erdoƒüan created and turned into the most formidable political machine in the country‚Äôs history.
Erdoƒüan loves gargantuan, world-beating projects ‚Äì a huge election poster of himself and the prime minister, Ahmet Davutoƒülu, entered the Guinness Book of Records last week as the biggest ever, anywhere. And he seems to like felling trees. Less than a year ago in Ankara he moved into a new presidential palace of pharaonic proportions, worthy of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu or Saddam Hussein. It outstrips Washington‚Äôs White House by a factor of 30. The staff include five experts, who check Erdoƒüan‚Äôs food for poisoning or contamination. The Ankara palace also required a major exercise in forest clearance. Turkish courts, most recently last week, repeatedly ruled the building illegal. ‚ÄúLet them try to knock it down. I‚Äôm moving in anyway,‚Äù the president responded. When Turkey goes to the polls on Sunday, in what is shaping up to be an epic and fateful election, Erdoƒüan and his legacy will be the main, if not the only, issue on voters‚Äô minds. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what he calls the new Turkey,‚Äù says Cengiz √áandar, a leading political analyst. ‚ÄúThis is about his legacy and he‚Äôs very ambitious. He needs a strong presidency. He‚Äôs also very uneasy about corruption allegations and needs safeguards. Some fear it might be Turkey‚Äôs last election ‚Äì before a dictatorship.‚Äù
The reason for such worries is that Erdoƒüan has turned the ballot into a kind of referendum on his one-man drive to rewrite the country‚Äôs constitution, abolish parliamentarianism and install a powerful new executive presidency occupied by himself. Paradoxically, he is not even running for election. As head of state since last August, following a three-term, 12-year premiership, he is supposed to be non-partisan, above the political fray. Instead he is pounding the country, speaking himself hoarse. During a recent campaign week, he notched up 44 hours on loyalist national television. ‚ÄúErdoƒüan has proven since 1994 ‚Äì when he was mayor of Istanbul ‚Äì that he can reach any goal he sets himself,‚Äù says Metin Y√ºksel, the deputy editor of Sabah, a daily newspaper and AKP mouthpiece. ‚ÄúNo opposition has been able to stop him. Turkish voters like a leader.‚Äù The main question in the election is whether Turkish voters will opt not so much to stop Erdoƒüan as to clip his wings and deny him, for now, his big plans for systemic change, entrenching his own power. Since his 2002 landslide thrust Turkey into a new era that started with great promise and in recent years, by general consensus, has degenerated into whimsy and authoritarianism, Erdoƒüan has led the AKP to three election victories, increasing its vote every time and securing comfortable absolute majorities in the 550-seat parliament in Ankara.
Constitutional grapple To change the system, the AKP needs a two-thirds, or 367-seat, majority enabling it to rewrite the constitution. Failing that ‚Äì and it looks highly improbable ‚Äì it needs a three-fifths, or 330-seat, majority, which would allow it to call a plebiscite on constitutional revision. That, too, is unlikely, according to the opinion polls. But there is general agreement that the party is the slickest, most organised political machine Turkey has ever seen. All bets are off. The AKP owns the bureaucracy, controls the media, has returned the army to barracks and marginalised the military, traditional arbiters of Turkish politics. Erdoƒüan used his final term as prime minister to curb the independence of the key institutions of state ‚Äì the constitutional court, the parliament, the central bank, the prosecution and judiciary services.
Independent media are cowed. Social media are regularly threatened. Schoolchildren are prosecuted for making fun of a president who appears increasingly thin-skinned. He remains the undisputed party leader and is said to have vetted for loyalty to him the AKP‚Äôs lists of candidates for seats next Sunday. In discussions on the election campaign, the name of Davutoƒülu, who is party president, hardly crops up, while talk of Erdoƒüan is ubiquitous. ‚ÄúThis is a presidential system already. It‚Äôs just not legal,‚Äù says √áandar. ‚ÄúThe question is whether he can legalise it and legitimise it.‚Äù There are ample indications that he may fail. In Istanbul‚Äôs wondrous Grand Bazaar, the traders are often seen as representing Erdoƒüan‚Äôs core constituency ‚Äì conservative, religious small business owners. To ask a few questions about the election is to press the button on a vigorous debate revealing sophisticated and nuanced views on what is at stake. Firat Inci, a 32-year-old bazaar restaurateur originally from the southern town of Siirt, has always voted for the AKP and for Erdoƒüan. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a fantastic person. You need to understand his background and what he has achieved. We used to have military coups every 10 years and Erdoƒüan pushed back 70 years of military domination.‚Äù
But, for the first time since he has been able to vote, Inci this time is opting for the opposition HDP, or People‚Äôs Democratic party, a new grouping of leftists and liberals mainly representing the large Kurdish minority that has always struggled to be represented in parliament. ‚ÄúErdoƒüan‚Äôs attitude and behaviour make me uncomfortable,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe got drunk on power. And a presidential system won‚Äôt be good for Turkey.‚Äù Sezgin Tanrikulu, a human rights lawyer and an MP for the main opposition CHP, or Republican People‚Äôs party, echoes the allegations of presidential megalomania. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre so glued to power that they could try anything to keep it. It‚Äôs a fixation. But they‚Äôre on the defensive.‚Äù To judge by his non-stop speechifying, Erdoƒüan views politics as a majoritarian blood sport in which the winner takes all, loyalty is rewarded and opposition denounced as treachery. It is a highly polarising approach, especially for a head of state who is supposed to preach inclusiveness.
Kadir Karapinar, who co-owns a small shoemaking business in Istanbul‚Äôs bustling Beyoƒülu district, criticises the reluctance to compromise. ‚ÄúIn Turkey, supporting a political party has become like supporting a football team. You can be either with one party or against them, but none really wants to be a party for everyone in Turkey.‚Äù The AKP and Erdoƒüan, he adds, use very divisive language to rally their base. ‚ÄúThey still present themselves as victims. They say that anyone who votes against them wants to return to the Turkey of 15 years ago. But I have always defended the right of women to wear a headscarf, the right to practise one‚Äôs religion freely. If anyone is being victimised in Turkey today, it is those that criticise Erdoƒüan.‚Äù
After years of such aggressive rhetoric from Erdoƒüan, particularly following the protests that erupted in central Istanbul two years ago and spread like wildfire around the country, the president‚Äôs us-and-them narrative may be taking its toll. If half the country still adores him, the other half now seems to revile him. This is one reason that Nedim ≈ûener, an investigative journalist jailed for a year in 2011 on terrorism charges that were then dropped, believes that Erdoƒüan‚Äôs presidential campaign will flop. ‚ÄúMaybe Erdoƒüan wants this, but he can also see that it‚Äôs not possible. He is just using it to rally his support. It is too dangerous, there is a lot of tension, there could be clashes if you try to change the system. All opposition groups oppose constitutional change because it‚Äôs too important and it‚Äôs about Erdoƒüan and one-man rule. It‚Äôs become a symbol, like the palace in Ankara. The palace has become this hate object.‚Äù
A neo-classical presidency? Even within the AKP, it is hard to discern support for an executive presidency. Senior figures are reluctant to challenge Erdoƒüan directly but have meekly voiced their reservations. A trio of senior critics ‚Äì Erdoƒüan‚Äôs predecessor as president, a deputy prime minister, and the economics minister ‚Äì are not running for parliamentary seats, however, and have less to lose by speaking out. There is no doubt that the AKP will win the election for a fourth consecutive term. The question concerns the margin of victory, with some polls putting the party at 41-45% of the vote. That would leave Erdoƒüan sulking in his vast palace and be seen as a defeat. ‚ÄúThere is governing fatigue within and with the AK party,‚Äù says ≈ûener. But the key to the all-important parliamentary arithmetic is the new and unknown element of the HDP, mainly representing the Kurds but also bringing together younger civil libertarians born of the mass protests against Erdoƒüan‚Äôs overweening control in 2013. The HDP‚Äôs leader, Selahattin Demirta≈ü ‚Äì young, telegenic, and persuasive ‚Äì has been the surprise star of the campaign. But Turkey has one of the highest thresholds in the world for entering parliament. A party must get 10% of the vote nationally to qualify for seats. The HDP can win roundly in the Kurdish heartlands of the south-east and still fail to muster the national 10%. There are up to 70 seats at stake. Most of them will go to the AKP if the HDP fails to get in in Ankara. ‚ÄúThe critical point is the HDP,‚Äù says ≈ûener.
Karapinar is thinking about voting for the HDP, which is contesting its first election. ‚ÄúDemirtas is a very good politician, and I like the things he says. But what about the connections of his party? It is difficult for me and many Turks to support such a thing.‚Äù This is a reference to the HDP‚Äôs links with the PKK, the Kurdish guerrillas at war with the Turkish state for most of the past 30 years. Inci in the Grand Bazaar gives the HDP the benefit of the doubt over the PKK and will vote for the new party, which in the opinion polls is hovering around the 10% mark.
‚ÄúWe fully expect that there will be attempts at cheating,‚Äù said Ay≈üe Erdem, the HDP‚Äôs co-leader in Istanbul and an ethnic Turk. ‚ÄúThe AKP has every reason to try and keep us under the threshold. But we are prepared. There will be someone with a smartphone at every ballot box.‚Äù If the HDP scrapes in, the ruling party‚Äôs majority could be imperilled and the presidential ambitions wrecked. But if the AKP gains the seats from an HDP failure, Erdoƒüan‚Äôs plans will be boosted. He has managed the referendum issue before. In his final term as prime minister, he pushed through and won a popular vote to make the president directly elected by the people. He then stood and won by more than 50%.
His supporters say there is no point in having a directly elected president unless the office is vested with executive powers. Erdoƒüan and the ruling party are playing the ethnic card, fanning fear among Turks that a pro-Kurdish party in parliament will spell the end of democracy, while also jeopardising the ongoing peace process between the Turkish government and the PKK. ‚ÄúWe want to tell those who vote for the HDP: if the HDP gets over the threshold, if the ruling AK party loses power, there will be no peace process left,‚Äù the deputy prime minister, Yal√ßin Akdoƒüan, said. ‚ÄúThis plan only aims to bring chaos to Turkey.‚Äù In arguing for the constitutional changes, Erdoƒüan commonly invokes the US and French systems as inspiration. √áandar says this is misplaced. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be French or American, more like South American.‚Äù Erdem says: ‚ÄúWe need to get the 70 MPs. That‚Äôs the only thing that will stop Erdoƒüan changing the constitution on his own. People are aware of that. This is about the democratisation of Turkey. It‚Äôs not about the system; it‚Äôs about Erdoƒüan. The presidential system would mean dictatorship.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-02T11:16:40Z,world,World news,Danish cowboy bares all in bid to be prime minister,"Conversations tail off mid-sentence; students stop to take selfies and parents shield young children‚Äôs eyes. The cause of their embarrassment: giant posters of a man wearing nothing but a cowboy hat, a gun holster and a knowing smile. This is John Erik Wagner, and he wants to be Denmark‚Äôs next prime minister. It may not be a conventional political billboard but, in this time of frenetic campaigning before the Danish general election this month, every available tree or lamppost is plastered with images of politicians and wannabes, and a relatively unknown candidate needs to work hard to make an impression.
For Wagner, a 51-year-old Copenhagener, the way to do that was to bare all. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been trying to get elected for 10 years now, and this is my third election, so I thought I‚Äôd try something different,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúOther candidates‚Äô posters are boring ‚Äì just like passport photos ‚Äì so I wanted mine to surprise people.‚Äù He adds: ‚ÄúIt helps to look good if you want to be in government and people say I have a nice body, so I thought, ‚ÄòThis is me, here I am.‚Äô I wanted to get my name out there.‚Äù But it‚Äôs not just his name that‚Äôs out there. Wagner‚Äôs so-called ‚Äúpenis posters‚Äù are attracting attention from all over the world. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had interest from China, Italy and Spain so far as well as a lot of people in Denmark. People seem to like them ‚Äì and most Danes are okay with nudity,‚Äù he says.
On 18 June, when voters decide the makeup of the country‚Äôs 179-strong parliament, prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt of the ‚Äúred block‚Äù centre-left Social Democrats will go head to head with former premier and opposition leader Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen of the ‚Äúblue block‚Äù centre-right party, Venstre. The resulting government is likely to be a coalition, with the anti-immigration Danish People‚Äôs party forecast to gain more seats than in previous elections.
But what does Wagner stand for, other than Stetsons and unabashed nudity? Key policies include making trips to the dentist free (Danes currently pay around 300 DKK ‚Äì about ¬£30 per visit) and scrapping unemployment benefit by introducing a basic income and making everyone work six months on and six months off. ‚ÄúI know what it is like to be out of work,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a clothes designer by trade but I don‚Äôt have any work right now. So I want a job. I want to go into government to get work. And help other people who don‚Äôt have work.‚Äù Anyone interested in finding out more about Wagner‚Äôs policies can visit his Facebook page (‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time for a website‚Äù) to read his manifesto and catch a glimpse of the man behind the oiled torso. Recent posts include Grace Jones‚Äôs Slave to the Rhythm video; pictures of Wagner, clad in double denim, petting a horse, as well as selfies with his Chinese crested powderpuff, Dolly. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs my dog, named after Dolly Parton,‚Äù he says.
‚ÄúI really like country music and westerns ‚Äì I‚Äôm inspired by the Burt Reynolds/Clint Eastwood cowboy look, like in my poster. It‚Äôs my style. And I have many women ‚Äì and some men ‚Äì getting in touch saying they like it, and me!‚Äù Wagner is confident about his chances in the election. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs going to be a more successful year for me,‚Äù he says. But if he doesn‚Äôt get elected this year, he‚Äôs got a plan B: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do one more run, but that will be my last. I‚Äôve worked as a municipal garbage man before. So if it doesn‚Äôt work out, I might consider going back to that.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ This article was amended on 3 June 2015 to remove a reference to a red block and blue block coalition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-02T11:00:03Z,world,World news,Was this indigenous leader killed because he fought to save Ecuador's land?,"Dark clouds loom over the Tundayme bus station where Jos√© Isidro Tendetza Ant√∫n said goodbye to his family for the last time. The moody skies above the Cordillera del Condor would have been a familiar sight to the indigenous leader as he set out on 28 November to join a protest meeting against a huge Chinese-backed mine being carved out of his ancestral homeland. He never arrived. Four days later, his son Jorge found Tendetza‚Äôs body in an unmarked grave, showing signs of torture and strangulation. Six months on, that murder continues to reverberate among the residents of this jungle mountain range straddling Ecuador‚Äôs Amazon frontier with northern Peru.
Tendetza was a prominent critic of President Rafael Correa‚Äôs government, which he accused of making a U-turn on its pledge to respect nature and indigenous lands. In 2008, Ecuador became the first country in the world to legally recognise the rights of nature in its constitution, but it has since approved a series of mega-projects, including large-scale mines and hydroelectric dams ‚Äì mostly in Chinese hands. One of seven siblings, Jos√© Tendetza grew up in the Cordillera del Condor, learning to farm, hunt and fish just as his forefathers had. This biodiverse cloud forest is the home of the Shuar, Ecuador‚Äôs second-largest indigenous group who fought both the Incas and the Spanish conquistadors, but are now struggling to cope with the arrival of El Mirador ‚Äì a $1.4bn gold and copper mine. Locals say the community has experienced a surge of conflict since work began at El Mirador, which has been owned by Chinese company EcuaCorriente SA ‚Äì a subsidiary of CRCC-Tongguan Investment ‚Äì since it was bought from a Canadian firm in 2010. Shuar families have already been displaced by the project, which if completed will result in the destruction of 450,000 hectares of cloud forest. Tendetza‚Äôs family, supporters and lawyers suspect that his opposition to the mine led to his death ‚Äì the third violent death of a Shuar leader in six years. (Freddy Taish was shot during a military operation against illegal mining in 2013 and Bosco Wisum died from gunshot wounds in clashes with police in 2009.) Tensions are still high. On a recent visit to the Shuar territory, the Guardian was followed and filmed by men who locals identified as employees of the mine‚Äôs security detail. Ecuador‚Äôs ambassador to the UK, Juan Falconi Puig, said the government had offered a $100,000 (¬£66,000) reward to anyone who could provide accurate information about the crime. In a letter to the Guardian, he said the investigation into Jos√© Tendetza‚Äôs death would be independently overseen by the Shuar federation. Then, on 23 May Ecuador‚Äôs interior minister, Jos√© Serrano Salgado, announced on Twitter that police had arrested two men on suspicion of Tendetza‚Äôs murder. The two suspects are both Shuar men employed as labourers by EcuaCorriente, and according to Serrano, one was found in possession of Tendetza‚Äôs mobile phone. In another tweet the minister praised the police and attorney general‚Äôs office and said they would pursue the ‚Äúintellectual authors‚Äù of the crime. The two men, however, have not been charged with any crimes, after a judge ordered their release for procedural reasons following a preliminary hearing. Bruno Segovia, a lawyer representing the Tendetza family, says they remain sceptical. ‚ÄúThe family knows the accused men and say they have never had any problems with them,‚Äù he told the Guardian. Tendetza‚Äôs relatives say they have long lost faith in the authorities. Just a week after the murder, helicopter-borne police armed with automatic weapons raided Tendetza‚Äôs family‚Äôs home in Yanua hamlet. The raid was allegedly ordered by the local prosecutor with the purported aim of finding evidence and ‚Äúweapons‚Äù which would explain his death, according to the US-based NGO Amazon Watch, which, along with 13 other non-governmental organisations, wrote a letter calling for transparency in the state‚Äôs investigation into the murder. ‚ÄúMy brother was a leader who defended our rights, our rivers, the rights of nature as the government had set out but we don‚Äôt believe the government any more,‚Äù said Tendetza‚Äôs brother Carlos, as seasonal rain drummed on the corrugated iron roof of the family home. With quick, dark eyes framed in an angular face atop a wiry frame, Carlos resembles his late brother, a man who friends and family describe as a charismatic and natural leader.
At the time of his death, Tendetza, 47, was organising local indigenous federations which were protesting against the contamination of local rivers by mining sediments and the eviction of local people, both Shuar and colonos ‚Äì a term used for mixed-race Ecuadorian settlers. He had filed a complaint against El Mirador mine with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. His supporters say he had been the subject of a campaign of harassment, and had received a string of threats against his life and home. In 2012 his house and crops were set on fire by a group of men his family claim were EcuaCorriente employees. The last time Tendetza‚Äôs family saw him, he was getting on the bus to a small town called Bomboisa, on his way to meet his uncle, Domingo Ankuash, and other Shuar leaders. The family say they planned to discuss how they would report the harassment they faced to the UN climate change summit in Lima the following month. He never arrived. Four days later, his son Jorge, alerted by a tipoff, travelled to the morgue in the town of Yantzaza, where he discovered that his father‚Äôs corpse had been pulled from the Zamora river by mine workers. An autopsy had been carried out, and Tendetza was buried in a grave marked ‚Äúno name‚Äù. At the request of his family, the body was exhumed and a second autopsy was carried out. While the first autopsy concluded the cause of death was drowning, the second determined that Tendetza had been asphyxiated. Segovia, the family‚Äôs lawyer, said witnesses had said his hands had been bound to the waist and the body had shown cuts and bruises. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs curious that a body is found in the river and without any investigation, without identifying the body, without letting the family know so they could investigate what happened, they bury it as ‚ÄòNN‚Äô ‚Äì no name,‚Äù said Segovia. Tendetza‚Äôs brothers blame his death on his opposition to EcuaCorriente, the company he worked for as a temporary labourer until 2006 when he witnessed a family‚Äôs home being burned down to allegedly drive them off land ceded to the company. From then on, he actively opposed the company‚Äôs plans to build El Mirador.
In a statement to the Guardian, a spokesman for EcuaCorriente said: ‚ÄúWe regret that insinuations have been gathered which constitute an affront to the company‚Äôs reputation and law-abiding behaviour. We have demonstrated, and we will continue to do so, total respect and regard for people and cultures, and that is reciprocated by the communities which surround us, who as proof, participate and mostly collaborate in the decent and respectful work of our company. ‚ÄúThe loss of a human life causes consternation, even more so when some of Mr Tendetza‚Äôs relatives are workers with the company, to whom appropriate condolences were paid at his death. ‚ÄúWe fully trust in the Ecuadorian state‚Äôs ongoing investigations through the ministry of the interior and the police; whose conclusions we expect to expose those responsible for such a deplorable incident.‚Äù The impact of El Mirador is clearly visible as soon as you enter the Shuar‚Äôs ancestral lands where fields and woodland are now dotted with orange signs marked ‚Äúprivate property‚Äù demarcating the areas bought by the Chinese company. As we cross a swollen river that has washed part of the road away, a sign in Spanish and Mandarin on a clapboard house warns: ‚ÄúThe person or company which enters or does damage to this property will be criminally prosecuted or subjected to indigenous justice.‚Äù We are followed. A motorcyclist in a balaclava films our movements on a red digital camera then speeds away but continues to trail us. Security guards at checkpoints also film us, surreptitiously at first, then openly when they realise they have been spotted. The mist rolls back and a red scar emerges on an emerald hillside. It‚Äôs several kilometres away but heavy diggers can be seen on the edge of the site. El Mirador‚Äôs first opencast mine will be 1.5km across and 650m deep. To extract some 2m tonnes of copper, about 145m tonnes of earth and rocks will be excavated, according to the company‚Äôs 2010 environmental impact assessment report, producing hundreds of millions of tonnes of acidic tailings during its lifespan. Environmentalists are horrified.
‚ÄúA mine like this shouldn‚Äôt have been developed in an area like this. There‚Äôs too much at stake,‚Äù said Richard Kamp, the director of E-Tech International, a US-based engineering consultancy which has studied the potential environmental impacts of El Mirador since 2011. His principal concern is the company‚Äôs plan to store millions of tonnes of toxic mining waste in an enormous tailings pond just half a mile from the Quimi river. The river flows into the Zamora river, which in turn supplies the Santiago river which winds south into Peru connecting with the Mara√±√≥n, a major tributary in the Amazon watershed. Kamp cites the Mount Polley mine spill in British Columbia, Canada, in August 2014 as a worrying precedent. A dam at a waste pond burst releasing 4.5m cubic metres of toxic slurry into virtually untouched forest, affecting an area mostly populated by First Nation peoples. Historic decision According to lawyer Mario Melo ‚Äì who helped Tendetza bring his case against El Mirador at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights ‚Äì Ecuador failed to seek prior, informed consent from the Shuar to develop El Mirador mine on their land. In failing to do so, the government reneged on its commitment to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, said Melo, who last year won a landmark ruling obliging the country to apologise to the Sarayaku people for drilling for oil in their territory without their consent. Although he was largely responsible for Ecuador‚Äôs historic decision to recognise the rights of nature, President Correa has said the 2008 constitution does not prohibit the country from using its non-renewable resources. Correa ‚Äì who has warned against ‚Äúinfantile environmentalism‚Äù ‚Äì argues that Ecuador‚Äôs natural riches offer the best chance for ‚Äúsovereign development‚Äù to improve education, healthcare and standards of living. But his political opponents accuse the president of handing out a string of oil, hydroelectric and mining concessions in an effort to secure Chinese funds. The map of government land concessions is a patchwork of geometric boxes overlaying southern Ecuador‚Äôs mountains and rivers.
Any hope of respecting the rights of nature was ‚Äútotally erased when the government began to give away concessions like flyers‚Äù, said Carlos P√©rez, the flamboyant leader of the Ecuador‚Äôs Kichwa Confederation, which represents the country‚Äôs largest indigenous group. P√©rez ‚Äì a former ally turned opponent of President Correa, who has been jailed three times during the current administration ‚Äì said most of the concessions had gone to Chinese companies.Ecuador started borrowing from Beijing in 2008 when it defaulted on $3.2bn of foreign debt, and the country‚Äôs dependence on Chinese credit shows no signs of abating. Analysts say the country has racked up more than $15bn of Chinese debt, but the terms of the loans lack transparency and may include a ‚Äúsovereignty immunity waiver‚Äù that would allow China to seize Ecuadorian assets if the country fails to repay them. The government says the investment has helped improve public services across the country. For the Shuar, however, the opening up of indigenous territory to foreign resource extractors has so far brought misery. Tendetza‚Äôs family say it has rained solidly and heavily since Jos√© was killed. It is the wettest rainy season they can remember. ‚ÄúWe, the Shuar, are the owners of all this, the forest, the waterfalls, the animals, the rivers,‚Äù said Carlos Tendetza with a broad sweep of his hand encompassing the horizon and beyond. ‚ÄúBut the company is destroying it and we‚Äôve got nothing but abuse in return.‚Äù The once-warlike tribe resisted the Spanish for centuries and was notorious for the practice of shrinking heads. Much has changed, but the continued advance of the mine and the perceived lack of justice over his brother‚Äôs death has made the Tendetza consider taking matters into their own hands. ‚ÄúWe are civilised now,‚Äù he added, as if giving voice to an internal debate. ‚ÄúBut we are willing to fight to the death to get our own back.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-02T08:15:49Z,world,World news,Australian law groups urge Coalition to pressure Nauru over growing legal crisis,"Australia‚Äôs peak legal bodies have called on the federal government to intervene in the growing legal crisis on Nauru after a senior Australian lawyer scheduled to appear for asylum seekers on the island was denied a visa. Jay Williams, a barrister, was denied a visa by the Nauru government shortly before he was scheduled to appear in two cases on the island, one of which could see the president, Baron Waqa, and the justice minister, David Adeang, face contempt of court charges. The second case relates to the lawfulness of the detention of more than 1,000 asylum seekers at the Australian-run detention centre on the island. The visa decision is being challenged in a fresh judicial review, where it is being argued that the Nauruan justice secretary ‚Äúexercised power for an improper purpose‚Äù in an attempt to ‚Äúpervert the course of justice‚Äù. The Australian Bar Association president, Fiona McLeod, said the asylum seekers held in detention were still in Australia‚Äôs care, and should be afforded proper legal representation. ‚ÄúThese recent developments are most concerning,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey indicate a continued pattern by the Nauru government of failing to observe the rule of law, which commenced with the sacking of magistrate Peter Law and their failure to renew the visa of the chief justice, Geoffrey Eames, over a year ago. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs vital that clients, including those placed in the care of the Australian government, have access to legal representation, and the Australian Bar Association would urge the Australian government to intervene to ensure that this occurs.‚Äù The president of the Australian section of the international commission of jurists, John Boyd, also called on the government to place pressure on Nauru to allow Williams to enter the country. ‚ÄúThe Australian government should bring pressure to bear to allow a visa to be granted for Mr Williams to have access to the court,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAustralia has a duty of care in respect of these people and neither the Australian government nor the Nauruan government should be scared of the rule of law.‚Äù Major concerns about the state of democracy on Nauru continued to be raised by opposition MPs and human rights groups. Recently the government also blocked access to Facebook and other websites, and deported the general manager of telecommunications provider Digicell. The Nauru government has continued to object to concerns about the island, and has rejected criticism of the nation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-02T07:48:26Z,world,World news,Philippines police to mount strong case against accused Australian paedophile,"A detective with the bureau of investigation in the Philippines says prosecutors have a ‚Äúvery strong case‚Äù against Melbourne man Peter Scully, who was arrested in March for allegedly operating a global paedophile ring from Mindanao. Scully will face court in the Philippines on Tuesday to enter a plea in one of two court cases against him, having been charged with the murder of a 12-year-old girl, human trafficking and child sexual abuse offences. Scully, 51, is accused of sexually abusing at least eight girls over a three-year period, with police alleging he streamed their torture to paying customers using the internet. His victims ranged from 18 months to 13 years old, police allege. Speaking to Guardian Australia from the Philippines on Tuesday, a senior investigator on the case, Roy Zu√±iga, said it had been a difficult investigation. ‚ÄúWe began investigating Scully in January, after the investigation of serious child abuse videos commenced and those videos showed a male, Caucasian perpetrator,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe had so few leads to begin with, and working with our foreign law enforcement counterparts we were able to identify the man. From that case, we found other cases of child abuse involving him. ‚ÄúWe definitely now have a very strong case against Mr Scully.‚Äù The investigation has also involved Dutch and Australian authorities. Zu√±iga said police would be pursuing the maximum penalty of life imprisonment for Scully, who has been living in the Philippines since 2011. Customers allegedly paid Scully up to $10,000 to view the child exploitation and abuse material, police say. Another investigator on the case, Angelito Magno, told the ABC that one video involved an 18-month-old baby girl being hanged upside down while being tortured. ‚ÄúShe was crying all the time,‚Äù he told the ABC. Four of Scully‚Äôs alleged victims have provided statements to police. According to statistics from the United Nations and the FBI in the US, there are about 750,000 child sex predators online at any one time. The Australian federal police described the sexual exploitation of children online and through child sex tourism as ‚Äúone of the most serious emerging transnational crime threats in the Asia-Pacific region‚Äù.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-02T07:30:15Z,world,World news,South China Sea: Australia won't rule out expanded surveillance flights,"The Australian government has not ruled out expanding its existing program of surveillance flights over the South China Sea amid regional tensions over China‚Äôs land reclamation activities in disputed territory. The office of the defence minister, Kevin Andrews, said Australia would ‚Äúcontinue to transit the South China Sea‚Äù but emphasised that such patrols were not a new phenomenon and that the government had not had any formal discussions with its close ally, the US. The government moved to clarify its position after a report in the Australian newspaper on Tuesday said Canberra was actively considering sending a P-3 surveillance aircraft within 12 nautical miles of artificial islands built by China, the standard extent of territorial seas from a coastline. Australian government lawyers believed such a flight would comply with international law, the report said, ‚Äúbecause only land features above high tide can generate territorial rights‚Äù. The opposition‚Äôs defence spokesman, Stephen Conroy, supported a potential ‚Äúfreedom of navigation‚Äù exercise within 12 nautical miles of the artificial islands, saying the structures were not internationally recognised. ‚ÄúWe can do that. International law is on our side,‚Äù Conroy said. A spokeswoman for Andrews issued a statement on Tuesday saying it was in the interest of all countries ‚Äúto ensure free and unencumbered transit through international waters, including those in the South China Sea‚Äù. ‚ÄúAustralia will continue to transit the South China Sea, including conducting maritime surveillance missions consistent with our rights under international law, as it has been doing for more than three decades now,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt is well known by all countries in the region that Australia has been patrolling the South China Sea from the air for over 30 years as part of ‚Äòoperation gateway‚Äô. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been doing it on an ongoing basis since 1980 and will continue to in the future as part of Australia‚Äôs enduring contribution to the preservation of regional security and stability in south-east Asia.‚Äù China objected to recent US military surveillance missions over the disputed region, but a Pentagon spokesman suggested that US patrols within 12 nautical miles of the artificial islands ‚Äúwould be the next step‚Äù. Andrews‚Äô spokeswoman said the Australian government had ‚Äúnot had formal talks with the United States on ‚Äòfreedom of navigation‚Äô missions in the South China Sea‚Äù. The minister had met the US defence secretary, Ash Carter, twice but ‚Äúthe expansion of current operations or new missions in the South China Sea was not discussed‚Äù, she said. Australia‚Äôs deputy opposition leader, Tanya Plibersek, who previously warned against language that would escalate tensions, said her party had sought briefings from the government on the South China Sea issue. Plibersek, Labor‚Äôs foreign affairs spokeswoman, avoided expressing a view on the potential surveillance missions but said the territorial disputes were ‚Äúplainly making some of China‚Äôs neighbours anxious‚Äù. ‚ÄúOf course, we take no position on the territorial disputes in question, but we do say that it is important to have freedom of navigation and freedom of flight through an area that is an extremely busy trading route, an area that Australian vessels have been travelling through for many years,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe urge the parties, of course, to use international laws and norms to settle any disagreements about sovereignty and, of course, it is important that this area remains open to trading.‚Äù But Conroy, Labor‚Äôs defence spokesman and deputy leader in the Senate, was prepared to venture an opinion on the maritime patrols. He backed the legitimacy of Australia‚Äôs program to sail and fly through the region. ‚ÄúThis is nothing new. Let‚Äôs be clear. Australia will continue to travel through internationally recognised waters and we call on all countries that have been constructing artificial islands and reclaiming land to settle this matter through the normal international processes,‚Äù Conroy said. Asked about potential travel within 12 nautical miles of the structures, Conroy said: ‚ÄúIn international law there is no claim because these are recognised under the international law of the sea as international waters and we can safely and legitimately enter these waters at any stage.‚Äù Peter Jennings, the executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, also backed further ‚Äúfreedom of navigation‚Äù missions. Jennings said such missions were likely to trigger criticism from the Chinese government, but he argued the bigger risk was not to take such action. ‚ÄúFailing to do so makes a de facto concession to China‚Äôs claim for treating the area for internal sovereign control,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat does put the freedom of navigation and air space access at risk.‚Äù But Hugh White, the professor of strategic studies at the Australian National University, said he would not be surprised if the government decided to back away from the proposal, which he described as risky. White told the ABC: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a smart idea to try standing up and bringing on a confrontation where the international law is not plainly on your side, and international law is not plainly on anyone‚Äôs side on this issue. It‚Äôs a very muddy question.‚Äù He questioned the motivations of the US: ‚ÄúI think for the US certainly the concern about these artificial islands is really just a kind of pretext to draw what one might call a red line around China‚Äôs expanding regional power and influence.‚Äù The debate followed comments from the secretary of the Australian Department of Defence, Dennis Richardson, that China‚Äôs land reclamation activity in the South China Sea ‚Äúhad been at a pace and scale over the last two years beyond anything we have previously seen‚Äù. This raised legitimate questions about its purpose, Richardson told a Senate estimates committee hearing on Monday. Asked whether any exercises were planned to test the Chinese government‚Äôs territorial claims, Richardson said ‚Äúno decisions have been taken at this point‚Äù. The acting chief of the Australian defence force, vice admiral Ray Griggs, told the same hearing that HMAS Perth was in the western part of the South China Sea. Andrews told a security summit in Singapore on Sunday that Australia was concerned about ‚Äúthe prospect of militarisation of artificial structures‚Äù and countries should ‚Äúagree as soon as possible‚Äù on a code of conduct for the area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

di,‚Äù I insisted, although making any disturbance at night was against the rules. Madobe lurched forward through the doorway to flick his knuckle into my eye. ‚ÄúJesus!‚Äù I shouted. The noise angered another guard. He argued with Madobe. Hitting was against the rules. They argued in whispers until one of them tossed me the padlock keys, which landed with a clink on the floor. Madobe liked to abuse me. He was adept with his knuckle, and sometimes the eye would hurt for a day or two. That morning I decided to protest his behaviour. When the chains were off, after dawn, Bashko tried to delivered my usual bowl of beans.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I shook my head. ‚ÄúNo chum-chum?‚Äù he said, using our word for food. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù ‚ÄúMadobe hit me.‚Äù Dhuxul woke up, and Bashko translated my complaint. Other guards upheld my story. Dhuxul gave the men a phlegmatic order and went out. He returned for lunch with a hot restaurant meal of spiced rice and boiled goat, in foam trays, for everyone. The men ate with relish on the patio and Dhuxul placed a plate for me near my pillow, on the floor. The food smelled delicious, but I didn‚Äôt move. At last Dhuxul made an offer. Madobe was asleep in the other room, but he would punish him ‚Äútonight,‚Äù Bashko translated.Now would I eat? Refusing this concession risked punishment. I had to meet him halfway. Yes, I told Bashko, after Dhuxul punished Madobe, I would eat. Not before. I pushed away the plate. We would save the rice and goat for tonight. Dhuxul looked annoyed, but he picked up my chains from a pile on the floor and moved to the other room. I heard Madobe‚Äôs voice. The chains clinked. Big deal, I thought ‚Äì more pirate theatre. Dhuxul wanted to fake me out. But the guards on the patio looked concerned. They moved aside and I saw Madobe in Dhuxul‚Äôs clutches, bent forward with his chained hands yanked behind his back. Dhuxul smacked him across the head. Naturally my conscience was appalled. I hated Madobe, but I didn‚Äôt like to see him chained and smacked on my account. The pirates, though, were bent on acquainting me with hunger and confinement, with the prospect of death, above all with the rule of force. They were acquainting me with Somalia. ‚ÄúOK Michael?‚Äù Bashko repeated. The boss had made his concession. I had to respond. ‚ÄúOK,‚Äù I said. And Madobe quit thwacking me. * * * Hostages made famous by media coverage grow more expensive, as a rule, so my family made the agonising decision to keep my case quiet. It was not easy: whenever negotiations faltered, so did my mother‚Äôs faith in the tactic, and sometimes she warned negotiators and officials around her that she wanted to tell the world. The final decision was always hers, and I don‚Äôt question it. The media blackout didn‚Äôt shorten my stay in Somalia, but my guards did listen to the radio like eager kids after each video we made in the bush. They wanted to hear my name on the BBC, and it frustrated them to hear nothing. ‚ÄúMichael!‚Äù Bashko came to me one day in 2013 with some hot news. ‚ÄúAmerica ‚Äì no ransom!‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, they won‚Äôt pay.‚Äù I shook my head in agreement. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù he chided. ‚ÄúAmerica no money?‚Äù He had honestly expected a ransom from Washington. The optimism made my head swim. I thought it was well known in kidnapping circles that the US and British governments paid nothing (normally). Garfanji should have known it before he financed my capture; Bashko should have known it by now. After I went free, at least one FBI agent would express real surprise that these men were so ignorant of US policy. But Bashko hardly knew the difference between Britain and France. Months passed, then years. The bosses thought I could make them rich while I slept in their houses in chains. They hit up every conceivable source of cash ‚Äì governments, families, employers, institutions of any kind. The demands were outrageous, fanciful, and for a long time I sensed negotiations had stalled. During one rare phone call with my mother in 2013 I blurted in German that a rescue ‚Äúwould be welcome‚Äù. By then I didn‚Äôt mind getting killed. For Bashko it seemed the height of western evil that helicopters might arrive before a fat sack of money; but I was numb to the risks of a rescue, and I imagined, naively, that the US no-ransom policy would require a consistent military response. My case was particularly difficult. Two governments had to be prodded for help; two governments had to jostle for command. I spent 32 months as a hostage, and it is possible that the oscillation between US and German responsibility lengthened my time in Somalia. In the end I owed my freedom to a ransom cobbled together by my family and a number of US and German institutions. But it came without warning. I suppose Bashko did try to tell me; but rumours of a ransom surfaced every month, and I quit paying attention. The pirates‚Äô wispy gossip and promises of freedom were more maddening than the raw passage of time, so I learned to listen to them with distant bemusement, the way an old man watches TV. * * * The morning of 23 September 2014, was not unusual. I woke up in the dark and waited for a guard to toss over keys for my chains. I undid the padlocks, went for a piss, and came back to face a sullen bowl of beans. After breakfast I had a phone call with a mysterious American negotiator named Bob. My Somali translator, Yoonis, let me talk for 30 seconds before he yanked the phone from my hands. Bob managed to explain exactly nothing. Yoonis said, ‚ÄúProof of life, only!‚Äù Around noon I had to use the toilet, and from the high, broken-tiled, sun-shot bathroom I heard the front compound gate open for a car. That was strange ‚Äì cars came at night, as a rule. A young Somali named Hashi stood outside the door with his gun. ‚ÄúMichael? Gari,‚Äù he said. Michael, your car is here. ‚ÄúWhat gari?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm busy.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo problem.‚Äù When I came out the men were buzzing with enthusiasm. Three Somalis were showing off a clear plastic sack of bound hundred-dollar bills. The bag was sealed. I couldn‚Äôt tell if the bills were real. ‚ÄúYou are going free!‚Äù they said, but I didn‚Äôt believe it. I‚Äôd heard it too many times, and I had grown stunted and cramped. My brain felt like a fish in a swamp. ‚ÄúYou must pack your bags,‚Äù one of them said. ‚ÄúYou are going to the airport.‚Äù I had a bag of dirty clothes. I threw them together but still wasn‚Äôt convinced. I climbed into the car with two men, Yoonis and another translator. Normally eight armed men crammed me, blindfolded, into the car. Not this time. We drove through Galkacyo ‚Äì what the men had called Haradheere for almost two years ‚Äì and out some distance into the bush, where another car waited. ‚ÄúGet out,‚Äù said Yoonis. ‚ÄúYou are free.‚Äù I felt bewildered but I climbed into the new car and found myself alone with a strange driver, a Somali who spoke American English. I was still convinced that the promise of freedom was false. But, to my surprise, he dialled a number while he drove, and on the phone I heard not just Bob, the negotiator, but my mother. ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù I was astonished. ‚ÄúNot in Galkacyo.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, we‚Äôre in California,‚Äù my mother said. ‚ÄúYour driver will take you to a hotel,‚Äù Bob explained, ‚Äúand another Somali will drive you to the airport. Your pilot‚Äôs name is Derek.‚Äù
Galkacyo‚Äôs decrepit Abdullahi Yusuf International Airport, to the northeast of town, was just a dry airstrip with a few low buildings, just like I remembered. Now, on the asphalt, a small single-engine plane waited. Next to it stood Derek, a short leathery man in mirrored sunglasses ‚Äì a bush pilot. When we pulled next to the plane and I opened the door, he stood under the wing to snap a photo. ‚ÄúFor your mother,‚Äù Derek said in a British accent. He shook my hand and gave me a backpack stuffed with clothes. Derek said he would deliver me to Mogadishu. From there I would take an American C-130 to Nairobi. Relief was not quite the word ‚Äì I was still too shattered to feel relief or excitement or joy ‚Äì but it seemed incredible to me that Derek could fly a plane. He was the first competent man I‚Äôd met in a long time. I fastened my seatbelt. Derek climbed in and slammed his door. A Somali on the tarmac asked us to wait ‚Äújust half an hour.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat for?‚Äù said Derek. ‚ÄúA journalist is coming, he wants to take your picture,‚Äù said the Somali. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I told Derek. I wouldn‚Äôt hear for days what was happening in another part of Galkacyo. The ransom had to be divided. Everyone connected to me would want a cut of the money. Within two days several ranking men ‚Äì including Dhuxul, Ahmed Dirie, and Ali Duulaay ‚Äì would sit down for a tense meeting in front of a house belonging to a boss called Nuur Jareer. Duulaay and Ahmed Dirie, my kidnappers, wanted a large share of the $1.6m ransom. But by now they were outsiders. They had to demand the money from the sub-group that held me, which included Dhuxul and Nuur Jareer. Guards at the meeting aimed their weapons in a complicated Mexican standoff, for mutual security, according to people who described the scene to me later. But the man aiming at Duulaay pulled his trigger. Gunfire unleashed by the others killed Ahmed Dirie, his brother, and one more of my kidnappers. Duulaay died on the spot. The boss Nuur Jareer was injured. Dhuxul pulled him to safety, but within another three days Nuur Jareer would die of his wounds. Later I heard the group had invested $2m to hold me. The top men must have been sorely disappointed. The plane began to roll forward. Derek and I put on headsets. ‚ÄúGalkacyo tower, Galkacyo tower,‚Äù he radioed. ‚ÄúRequest permission to take off,‚Äù he said and gave his call sign. ‚ÄúTwo souls on board.‚Äù No response. Another delay. ‚ÄúSometimes they don‚Äôt answer,‚Äù he mumbled. I was still shell-shocked and confused. My brain would feel cramped for months. People say, ‚ÄúYou must have been overjoyed,‚Äù but any ransom is a filthy compromise, and I had long ago given up on hope as a dangerous indulgence. As the plane moved forward, I looked at the cracked and sun-beaten white buildings of the airport ‚Äì these objects of fantasy for two and a half years ‚Äì with mute animal wonder. ‚ÄúGalkacyo tower, Galkacyo tower,‚Äù Derek repeated. ‚ÄúRequest permission for takeoff. Two souls onboard.‚Äù At last there was some noise from the radio. ‚ÄúYes, OK,‚Äù crackled a Somali voice," and Derek lined up his plane. ‚Ä¢ Follow the Guardian Long Read on Twitter: @gdnlongread""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-02T04:00:07Z,world,World news,Iranians warn that distrust could replace sanctions as obstacle to business,"With relatives and friends returning to Tehran in search of opportunities ahead of the expected lifting of economic sanctions, Haj Hossein holds court at his Grand Bazaar shop and doles out business advice. He warns his cousins, nephews and old acquaintances returning from abroad about corrupt judges and scheming entrepreneurs. ‚ÄúI tell them not to believe and not to trust anyone,‚Äù stresses the 70-year-old merchant, who primarily sells rugs but trades anything that comes his way. ‚ÄúThey think they are still in Europe or America, but this is a different country, with very different rules.‚Äù
Decades of economic isolation have made Iran‚Äôs business scene difficult to navigate for outsiders accustomed to playing by globally accepted principles. Attempts to shift state-owned property to private hands have led to the creation of a complex conglomerates with shadowy ownership structures. The corrupt legal system also favors the well-connected, giving rise to an environment of distrust. ‚ÄúYou have to bribe,‚Äù says Haj Hossein, ‚Äúbut also make sure you are paying the bribe to someone who can actually help you.‚Äù The number of breach-of-contract cases has skyrocketed since the start of nuclear negotiations in 2013, when foreign investors began to reset their sights on the Iranian economy, says Alireza Darbandi, a corporate lawyer who handles dozens of cases in Tehran as well as provincial courts. ‚ÄúMany Iranians will return to the country to invest, but will be the victims of schemers and charlatans,‚Äù Darbandi predicts. Alireza Keyvani, an engineer and entrepreneur, moved back to Iran from North America last year to start an acquisitions company focused on the burgeoning hi-tech scene. ‚ÄúI thought I would be in everything from robotics to medical equipment,‚Äù he says. After signing several contracts laying out his business plan, Keyvani says that he learned that one of the partners had cut his company out of the deal and was receiving a commission directly from the client. Keyvani sought legal action, but his lawyer warned him against taking the case further. Keyvani‚Äôs former business partner would likely try to bribe the judge or produce forged documents, the lawyer argued. ‚ÄúI had to wake up to see Iran as it really is,‚Äù Keyvani recalls. The absence of rule of law has allowed impostors to thrive. Darbandi says most of his cases involve ‚Äúsomeone pretending to be an intelligence officer or a Revolutionary Guard Corps commander‚Äù, who intimidates and manipulates the investor. Later, it is difficult to prove that the perpetrator had used false identity. While he advises potential investors to protect themselves by seeking legal advice, Darbandi says he ‚Äúcannot guarantee a peaceful and productive business experience‚Äù in Iran. The atmosphere of distrust has raised the cost of financial transactions, most of which only take place after extensive negotiations and legal guarantees, says Ahmadreza Mohammadi, a business analyst in Tehran. Even these do not guarantee a desirable outcome, however. Mohammadi says he witnessed many cases in which ‚Äúboth sides find a way to create difficulty‚Äù.
As foreign investors await Iran‚Äôs economic opening pending the nuclear deal, businessmen such as Keyvani are discovering that the country lacks the necessary legal system to protect the interests of private investors. The Islamic republic ranks 130th on the 2015 Ease of Doing Business index (pdf) of 189 global economies, below Mozambique, Pakistan and Lesotho. Iran‚Äôs standing in the index improved by two points since 2014, but remains among the region‚Äôs lowest. GCC countries remain the primary destination for many potential investors. ‚ÄúIf the business practices in Iran are unethical, it is partially because of the sanctions, which provided great opportunities for corruption and created monopolies,‚Äù says Keyvani. ‚ÄúTo have global business ethics, one has to be part of the global community.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-01T23:03:30Z,world,World news,Nauru blocks visa of Australian barrister for deportee and asylum seekers,"The Nauruan government has blocked a visa application from an Australian barrister involved in a high-stakes case that could see the Nauruan president Baron Waqa and justice minister David Adeang face contempt of court charges. Australian barrister Jay Williams was seeking to appear in court to represent Rod Henshaw, an Australian who lived on Nauru and who was deported in controversial circumstances by the Nauruan government. He also represents more than 1,000 asylum seekers on the island in an ongoing legal case surrounding their detention in the Australian centre on the island. The Nauruan government is now seeking to strike out Henshaw‚Äôs claim as well as those on behalf of the asylum seekers who alleged their human rights are being violated in the detention centre. In an email from the Nauru immigration office, Williams‚Äôs application for a business visa is refused with only the words ‚ÄúThis is denied‚Äù provided to explain the decision. The visa refusal is now facing an appeal in the Nauruan district court, while the government is continuing with its own motion to strike out both major court cases. The application for judicial review by Henshaw, obtained by Guardian Australia, said the decision to deny Williams‚Äôs visa is a breach of natural justice and procedural fairness, and names the secretary of justice, Lionel Aingimea, as the respondent. ‚ÄúThere was no evidence or other material to justify the making of [the] decision to deny the legal representative of the plaintiff a visa,‚Äù it said. It said Aingimea ‚Äúexercised power for an improper purpose, to deny the plaintiff his constitutional and common law right to legal representation‚Äù and was an attempt to ‚Äúpervert the course of justice‚Äù. A series of other court documents also reveal that the Nauruan secretary of justice personally intervened to prevent Williams being admitted to the Nauruan supreme court. Williams applied for admission as a barrister of the Nauruan supreme court on 10 October 2014. But two weeks later, on 28 October 2014, he was issued with a summons by the district court of Nauru, facing charges of accessing a restricted area dating back to events in January. Aingimea‚Äôs objection came a day after Williams was charged with the offence. While on a previous visit to Nauru in February 2014, Williams had been a passenger in a car with a Salvation Army employee, Adam Savage, who dropped Williams off at the airport. On his way to the airport, Savage turned off onto the airstrip entrance ‚Äì a restricted area ‚Äì and performed a number of ‚Äúdonuts‚Äù on the airport runway. Savage said in a statement that Williams urged him not to take the action, and Williams was not charged at the time. In a letter to the Nauru DPP, Williams‚Äôs counsel said the charges were ‚Äúbaseless‚Äù and a way to block the proceedings. ‚ÄúA baseless charge is brought against Mr Williams, in an attempt to block his admission and to further obstruct the Henshaw matter and the asylum seeker case,‚Äù the letter said. It continued: ‚ÄúIf at any stage, the Office of Public Prosecutions has received undue interference or pressure from members of the executive, to prosecute the charge against Mr Williams, without foundation and without evidence, then the Office of Public Prosecutions has a duty to the court and to the administration of justice to vigorously resist such interference and pressure, no matter what the professional or personal cost may be and ventilate such interference and pressure with the court at the first opportunity.‚Äù The charges were later dropped by the DPP and Williams succeeded in being admitted. But in May 2015 his business visa was denied without reason, despite the imminent proceedings. A legal challenge to the visa decision is now under way. The maze of dynamic legal proceedings on the island have emerged as part of an ongoing dispute that first began when Henshaw ‚Äì a former resident of Nauru ‚Äì received a deportation order from the government. His deportation was temporarily halted by former magistrate Peter Law. But Law himself was then deported from the country and prevented from re-entering, in the first of a series of blows to the integrity of the judiciary on the island nation. Henshaw, whose wife died on the island in 2013, said the long-running case was a serious denial of natural justice and had placed immense pressure on him. ‚ÄúPsychologically it‚Äôs just devastated me, quite frankly. Whatever way this case goes, I would have liked this to have been over, quite frankly, a lot sooner.‚Äù ‚ÄúNot being able to get back to the island to visit my wife‚Äôs grave has been difficult enough, but being bashed around the head with these proceedings has been incredible hard. ‚ÄúThere are serious consequences here for these proceedings. You‚Äôve got to wonder how the Australian government and the New Zealand government feel about these kind of decisions.‚Äù Henshaw and Law‚Äôs deportation was followed by the resignation of the former chief justice, Geoffrey Eames, as well as the solicitor general Stephen Bliim. While his legal case is a civil claim relating to seeking damages, his claim was later amended to include the contempt of court charges against the Nauruan president, Baron Waqa and the justice minister, David Adeang, following the deportations. Further concerns continue to be raised about Nauru, with the blocking of several websites including Facebook and the recent deportation of the general manager of telecommunications provider Digicell. The Nauruan government and Adeang have not responded to requests for comment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-01T20:05:10Z,world,World news,"David Cameron must be willing to walk away from EU talks, says Boris Johnson","David Cameron should be prepared to walk away from his EU negotiations and allow Britain to forge a ‚Äúglorious‚Äù future outside the European Union if the talks fail, Boris Johnson has said. In his first speech in parliament for seven years, the mayor of London set himself as the potential leader of the Tories‚Äô no campaign, saying that Britain could be just as prosperous if it negotiates a free trade agreement with the EU.
‚ÄúIf you are going to go into a difficult international negotiation of this kind then you have got to be prepared to walk away if you don‚Äôt get the result that you want,‚Äù the new Tory MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip said. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt get the deal that is either in the interests of this country or of Europe, we should be prepared to strike out and forge an alternative future that could be just as glorious and just as prosperous with a free trading arrangement.‚Äù Johnson qualified his remarks by saying that he was confident the prime minister would succeed in his EU negotiations as he praised Cameron for embarking on a ‚Äúschmooze-athon‚Äù across Europe. Johnson told MPs: ‚ÄúWe now have a Tory majority government with a clear mandate to seek change and therefore a government in the most powerful position in our lifetimes to deliver reform and improvement in Europe. We can. We can win that argument by being relentlessly positive and of course by making it clear that what we are advocating is not simply in the interests of Britain but in the entire EU. ‚ÄúI congratulate the prime minister and the elan and the success with which he has begun his pan-European schmooze-athon in the chancelleries of Europe. I believe his efforts will be crowned with success.‚Äù The London mayor, who first made his name as the Daily Telegraph‚Äôs Brussels correspondent by baiting the former European commission president Jacques Delors in the early 1990s, has been keen in recent months to quash speculation that in private he is strongly pro-EU. Johnson knows that he will need to emphasise his Eurosceptic credentials if he is to succeed Cameron as Tory leader. But Johnson‚Äôs remarks suggest that he might even be prepared to take a leading role in his party‚Äôs no campaign, which will be launched after the prime minister concludes his EU negotiations. The ranks of this group will swell if Cameron is seen to have secured a weak deal. Johnson has been made a member of Cameron‚Äôs political cabinet and is due to be given a full cabinet post when his term at City Hall ends next May, by which point the prime minister hopes to have completed his EU negotiations. Johnson, who has recently had a biography of Winston Churchill published, warned both sides in the EU debate to be careful about claiming the mantle of Britain‚Äôs wartime leader. Churchill argued in favour of a ‚ÄúUnited States of Europe‚Äù but said that Britain should not be a member. The London mayor said: ‚ÄúI notice, in the course of trying to settle this argument over the last few days, assorted speakers have invoked the memory of Winston Churchill in one way or another. I have tell you Churchill was absolutely useless on this subject. He is biblical on this matter. You can find a text to justify almost any proposition about our relations with Europe that you choose. But one thing he believed in passionately ‚Äì and that was in parliament as the expression of the will of the British people. He would want to see that democratic principle upheld today.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-01T20:00:56Z,world,World news,Mitch McConnell seeks to limit transparency in surveillance reform bill,"The Senate‚Äôs top Republican renewed his quest to gut surveillance reform on Monday, this time removing a measure that would disclose major reinterpretations of surveillance law made by a secret court. Privacy-minded legislators, fresh off what appeared to be a victory after the Senate agreed on Sunday night to advance the USA Freedom Act, said that the latest legislative gambit by Mitch McConnell of Kentucky would leave the public vulnerable to what Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon has called ‚Äúsecret law‚Äù. McConnell‚Äôs amendment would strip the bill of its mandate to ‚Äúmake publicly available‚Äù novel interpretations of the law before the secret Fisa court ‚Äì a measure that advocates consider an early warning system to alert Congress and the public of efforts by the intelligence agencies to expand their powers.
‚ÄúRepublican leaders lost the fight to continue mass surveillance of Americans through the Patriot Act and now they want to water down the commonsense reforms that have overwhelming bipartisan support in the House and Senate,‚Äù Wyden, a Democrat on the intelligence committee, told the Guardian on Monday. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a strong bipartisan coalition ready to slam the door shut on this latest attempt to prolong the dragnet and strip out new rules on transparency from the USA Freedom Act.‚Äù Senate aides said on Monday that McConnell was already running into headwinds, however, making it unclear if the version of the bill without the transparency requirement will come up for a vote. Privacy campaigners, some of whom consider the USA Freedom Act to be an insufficient fix for widespread government surveillance, denounced McConnell‚Äôs amendment. Some believe it would end up costing the compromise bill its remaining support in the House of Representatives ‚Äì which would ensure that portions of the Patriot Act that expired at midnight would not be restored, via passage of the USA Freedom Act. Without the transparency provisions ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a very high likelihood this bill goes down in flames in the House‚Äù, said Patrick Eddington of the Cato Institute, a former House staffer. In a statement, Constitution Project attorney Rita Siemion said: ‚ÄúThe Senate should reject the harmful and unnecessary amendments proposed by Majority Leader McConnell ‚Äì especially those designed to keep the American people in the dark about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance [Fisa] court ‚Äì and send the bill to the president‚Äôs desk without any additional delays and without weakening the bill.‚Äù McConnell also seeks to pass other amendments to the USA Freedom Act, which ends the NSA‚Äôs bulk collection of US phone data, a move by the majority leader which would delay the end of the phone-data dragnet for a year. These amendments would require the top US intelligence official to certify the implementation of the new phone-records regime; demand notification of changes made by telecoms companies to the kinds of call records they generate; and revise the creation of a new public-interest advocate before the Fisa court, which currently only hears from the government.
McConnell on Monday morning referred to the amendments as ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù. The amendments would only need a simple majority to pass ‚Äì all but ensuring their adoption by the GOP-led Senate, where the majority of Republicans oppose surveillance reform and have advocated renewing the Patriot Act in its entirety. But the amendments are being met with opposition from most Democrats as well as libertarian-minded Republicans, who view them as so-called ‚Äúpoison pills‚Äù designed to weaken the product of marathon negotiations between Congress, the Obama administration and the intelligence community. It is also unlikely that the provisions would pass muster in the House, where GOP leaders have sought to retain pressure on the Senate to pass their bill as is. ‚ÄúThe USA Freedom Act is a good, strong bill,‚Äù Kevin McCarthy, the Republican House majority leader, said in a statement on Monday. ‚ÄúIt protects civil liberties. It provides for the capabilities our intelligence agencies need to keep the homeland safe. And it passed with a veto-proof majority of 338 votes in the House. Now is not the time to be playing games with our national security. The Senate should act quickly and send the USA Freedom Act to the president‚Äôs desk.‚Äù Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, warned McConnell that changing the USA Freedom Act would imperil House passage of the revised bill, and increase the amount of time during which three sections of the Patriot Act that expired at midnight on Sunday are no longer available to the FBI. ‚ÄúAny departure from this carefully crafted compromise will undoubtedly reduce support for it in the House and prolong the expiration of these intelligence tools, and I urge the Senate to pass the USA Freedom Act as is and without any further delay,‚Äù Schiff said on Monday. The White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, dismissed the one-year transition period as ‚Äúcompletely unnecessary‚Äù and continued to push for the passage of the House version of the USA Freedom Act. ‚ÄúWe believe that six months is enough,‚Äù Earnest told reporters on Monday. ‚ÄúThe Senate should not start getting into a game where it passes amendments that require House consideration again. ‚ÄúThey have had a year and a half to exercise that prerogative and, now that they have blown through that deadline, most people would acknowledge that is a privilege they should relinquish ‚Ä¶ rather than get into additional political gamesmanship.‚Äù On the Senate floor on Monday, the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, Richard Burr of North Carolina, said he hoped a final vote on the USA Freedom Act could proceed by lunchtime on Tuesday. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe that the threat level has dropped to a point where we can remove some of the tools ‚Äì if anything, the threat level has gotten higher, and you would think we‚Äôd be talking about an expansion of tools,‚Äù Burr said. ‚ÄúBut I accept the fact that this debate has gotten to a point where a bulk data storage capacity within the government is not going to be continued long term.‚Äù Additional reporting by Dan Roberts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-01T18:54:35Z,world,World news,Cold turkey and shackles ‚Äì¬†how Afghan 'clinic' helps drug addicts,"Agha Shahi had been using drugs for 10 years when his family decided it was time for rehab. In Uruzgan, an impoverished and often-neglected rural province in southern Afghanistan, there was only one place to go: the private home of a freelance treatment guru. In the provincial capital, Tarin Kot, a hand-painted sign of an opium smoker points to Hamidullah Bawari‚Äôs drug ‚Äúclinic‚Äù. In a small courtyard among well-tended flowerbeds, a handful of recovering addicts shuffle around with their feet in chains. The treatment here is rudimentary, consisting of little more than cold turkey eased by painkillers. Even cigarettes are banned. In the first 72 hours, patients have their heads shaved and their ankles shackled. ‚ÄúIf we didn‚Äôt have chains on, we would escape like this,‚Äù Shahi says as he snaps his fingers. Despite its basic amenities, facilities such as this fulfil an urgent need, even if it is the brainchild of an amateur drugs counsellor who buys his painkillers at the local bazaar. A recent US-funded drug survey suggests that up to 11% of the Afghan population use drugs. The report, which is the first nationwide toxicological survey of drug use in Afghanistan, was based on saliva, urine and hair samples from more than 10,000 Afghans. Addiction, the report says, is particularly endemic in rural areas where about 39% of households tested positive. Such estimates are notoriously tricky, particularly because Afghanistan‚Äôs last census was conducted in 1979. In earlier estimates, the UN put the number of addicts at 1.6 million, or around 5% of the population. Regardless of the exact number, health authorities are overpowered. Over the past decade, international donors have helped Afghanistan set up about 100 treatment centres across the country, offering space to over 30,000 addicts.
Tawab Saljuqi, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Public Health, said the government had achieved a lot with limited resources. ‚ÄúBut the pool of addicted is increasing, and the resources are decreasing,‚Äù he said. Bawari, the director of the Tarin Kot clinic, opened his home to addicts three year ago. Every day he saw addicts in the street, rummaging through rubbish to find sellable items for their next fix. ‚ÄúI thought, ‚Äòthey have a family too. What would I do if I were in their place?‚Äù says Bawari, whose only training consists of a four-day course with the ministry of counter narcotics. Bawari‚Äôs house can accommodate upto 40 patients, but rarely sees more than 20. A month‚Äôs treatment costs $100 (¬£65), a hefty expense for families. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very difficult for the family to bring a person here,‚Äù says Shahi. Shahi, rail-thin with a thick black beard, started using when he was in his early 20s. Friends who had migrated to Iran returned with a drug habit, and he quickly got hooked on opium and heroin. Even after treatment, many patients are doomed to live perpetually on the edge of addiction. Jobs are scarce and the abundance of poppy fields and drug smugglers in Uruzgan make a habit even harder to kick. ‚ÄúIf they leave this place and don‚Äôt find a job, they will start using again,‚Äù says Bawari. Yet, a job is not always a safeguard against addiction. Jalil, 22, worked with the highway police, protecting lorries driving from Tarin Kot to Kandahar. His work, rife with corruption and close to drug routes, helped sustain a heroin habit he said cost him about ¬£20 a day. ‚ÄúWhen I brought my son here, he was very weak, almost dead,‚Äù says his father, Zafron. It took him five years to notice Jalil‚Äôs habit, and he is grateful to Bawari for his treatment. ‚ÄùHe gave a second life to my son.‚Äù
The clinic is men-only but plenty of women and children are addicted too. In the US survey, 11% of rural children tested positive for drugs, most of them exposed through second-hand smoke or from residue in rugs and pillows. Until recently, Save the Children ran a drug clinic in Tarin Kot that was free of charge for both genders. But at the end of May, after treating more than 500 patients over two years, the organisation handed over the programme to the provincial health directorate of Uruzgan, which did not have the money to maintain it. Jennifer El-Sibai, spokesperson for Save the Children, said the closure was an indirect consequence of aid cuts in Australia which funded the clinic. ‚ÄúWe were hopeful we might continue the programme in some form. However that has not happened,‚Äù she said. Afghanistan‚Äôs drug crisis also illustrates a wholesale failure to eradicate opium. This year‚Äôs poppy harvest is expected to beat all records, surpassing last year‚Äôs unprecedented 224,000 hectares. Since 2001 the US has spent $8.4bn on combating drugs in Afghanistan. On a recent visit to Kabul, William Brownfield, assistant secretary of the State Department‚Äôs bureau of international narcotics and law enforcement affairs, suggested that other countries should take more responsibility. Brownfield told reporters in a briefing that in the US, ‚Äúthe amount of heroin consumed that is of Afghan origin is about 4% ‚Ä¶ There should be more nations and governments that are focusing their efforts and resources to this problem‚Äù.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-01T18:47:17Z,world,World news,Houthi rebels release American journalist held in Yemen,"Houthi rebels have released at least one of ‚Äúseveral‚Äù Americans in captivity in Yemen, the State Department has confirmed, as neighboring Oman plays peacemaker for the region‚Äôs warring factions. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf identified the freed American as Casey Coombs. An official told the Associated Press that Coombs, who had been injured under unknown circumstances, had reached Oman. Harf said Coombs was in ‚Äústable condition‚Äù and said diplomats in Oman were ‚Äúproviding all consular assistance‚Äù. Harf added that the US was ‚Äúgrateful to the government of Oman‚Äù for its assistance, and that the US was aware of reports of other Americans being held in Yemen. Assistant secretary of state Anne Patterson was in Oman to talk with ‚Äúa wide swath of Yemenis‚Äù, Harf said, and ‚Äúa variety of organizations inside Yemen‚Äù. She would not confirm that Patterson had met with Houthi leaders. Patterson had held talks about ‚Äúthe crisis writ large‚Äù, Harf said, in an effort to broker peace between all sides. Working with a ‚Äúthird-party country‚Äù as mediator was preferable, Harf said, to ‚Äúsending in American assets‚Äù to free the captives. In December, a failed raid by US special forces resulted in the deaths of the American journalist Luke Somers and South African teacher Pierre Korkie, who were held by al-Qaida militants in south-east Yemen. There are believed to be at least three Americans still held by Houthi militants, who took over the capital of Sana‚Äôa and ousted the US- and Saudi-backed government earlier this year. An official in Sana‚Äôa told Reuters the Houthis still held another captive, who appears to be American Sharif Mobley, who disappeared from his pre-detention trial in 2014 and briefly resurfaced in May. Terrorism charges against Mobley were dropped under the government of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, but he remained in custody, accused of murdering a prison guard. The official said that the American is of Smoali origin and had been detained for several years on suspected links to terrorism. A campaign of air strikes against the Houthis, led by Saudi Arabia and assisted by US intelligence, has complicated any tentative diplomacy. Before the Houthi takeover, the US had few contacts with leaders of a militia that has fought against a key US ally, Saudi Arabia, and is accused of acting as a proxy force of Iran. Oman is the only country of the Gulf Cooperation Council that has not joined the military campaign in Yemen, where Houthi forces continue to fight against coalition forces, various militias and al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. On Monday, coalition forces launched another round of air strikes on Yemeni cities. Many members of Yemen‚Äôs ousted government, including President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, fled to Saudi Arabia to escape a conflict that has killed as many as 2,000 people. A Yemeni government spokesperson said the United Nations envoy to Yemen had made progress toward a longer ceasefire and the release of several detained people. The Omani News Agency reported that a missing Singaporean had also been evacuated to Muscat on Monday, after coordination with ‚Äúrelevant authorities in Yemen‚Äù. Late on Sunday, Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, told CNN ‚Äúit looked like [one of the captives] was going to be let out of the country, escorted toward the airport and then many officials changed their minds‚Äù. Unknown militants have also detained a French woman, Isabelle Prime, and on Monday released a video in which she pleaded for assistance and appeared frail and in poor health. A French official confirmed the video‚Äôs authenticity and said the government was ‚Äúmobilized to obtain [her] release‚Äù. Prime was kidnapped in February. She had been working as a consultant for a World Bank project. The translator with whom she was captured was freed in March.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-01T18:32:54Z,world,World news,Tehran auction shifts millions of pounds worth of art in spite of sanctions,"In Tehran‚Äôs luxurious Grand Azadi hotel, a row of women dressed in black with red headscarves hold the lines open to bidders as the auctioneer tries to conjure up increasingly large sums with his hammer. As artworks are displayed, prices in the tens of billions of Iranian rials ‚Äì hundreds of thousands of pounds ‚Äì light up the large Samsung screen on the wall. In the crowd are some familiar faces including actors, politicians and the retired Iranian football star Ali Daei. The auction of modern and contemporary Iranian art, which is jockeying to be among the big auctions in the Middle East, is an annual event and was being held for the fourth time. But this year was different: the prices that were bid were astonishing for a country still struggling with international sanctions. And the auction, held on Friday, made nearly double what had been predicted, totalling ¬£4.3m. A tree trunk painting by celebrated Iranian poet and painter Sohrab Sepehri sold for around 28bn rials (¬£560,000), becoming the most expensive painting ever sold in Iran. Other works that attracted large sums include those of the New York-based artist Manoucher Yektai and sculptor Parviz Tanavoli, as well as pieces by Bahman Mohassess and Aydin Aghdashloo. ‚ÄúIt exceeded our expectations,‚Äù a Tehran auction spokeswoman told the Guardian. ‚ÄúWe sold almost 180% ... [of] what we had estimated. We had buyers both from inside and outside Iran. Out of 126 works that had been presented, 125 of them were sold.‚Äù Due to sanctions, Iran‚Äôs banking system is cut off from the outside world but that did not stop international bidders participating in the auction. ‚ÄúForeigners had an intermediary paying on their behalf in Tehran,‚Äù the spokeswoman said. The event was sponsored by Samsung‚Äôs Iran branch, among other companies. Shiva Balaghi, a cultural historian of the Middle East at Brown University, said the auction showed art purchases were increasing in Iran. ‚ÄúThe growing art market in Iran is significant and is sustained by a new generation of local collectors,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe recent Tehran auctions have been showing consistently strong prices. There has been notable interest in Iranian modern masters like Sohrab Sepehri, Marcos Grigorian and Parviz Tanavoli.‚Äù Interest in Iranian art from the 1950s through the 1970s is also strong on the international front among private collectors and museums, Balaghi said. ‚ÄúThough prices for these works are rising, they are still fairly modest compared to their western counterparts,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúFor relatively smaller sums, one can build a significant collection of modern and contemporary Iranian art. So for Iranians, art is a smart financial investment as well as a way to tap into one‚Äôs cultural heritage.‚Äù The record for the most expensive Iranian artwork was set by Tanavoli‚Äôs sculpture Oh Persepolis, which sold for $2.8m (¬£1.8m) at Christie‚Äôs Dubai in 2008. Balaghi added that the sanctions will mean art auctions in Tehran will be largely limited to domestic collectors. She said: ‚ÄúThe integration of the Iranian art market with the international art market will only really happen when sanctions are lifted.‚Äù
Nicky Nodjoumi, whose ink on paper work The Accident was recently acquired by the British Museum, also had a work sold in Tehran on Friday. An Iranian art journal has put him in the list of top 10 Iranian artists. ‚ÄúThere has been some criticism to the auction but overall, I think it‚Äôs a positive move,‚Äù Nodjoumi told the Guardian. ‚ÄúIt would be a financial help to Iranian artists, something that we didn‚Äôt have much in the past.‚Äù Nodjoumi‚Äôs acrylic work in Tehran‚Äôs auction, called Last Touch, was the first piece by him to have gained official permission for sale inside Iran. He has many works that have been critical of the Iranian establishment. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt believe the sums I was hearing from the auction,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt is a question for people like me that how can a country be under sanctions and then sell works in such staggering amounts?‚Äù According to the Tehran Times, the famous Iranian actor Reza Kianian, who conducted the auction, said: ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt think that we could organise the second edition of the Tehran auction and now, I am happy that the fourth edition is being held.‚Äù The auction is run by Alireza Sami-Azar, a former head of Tehran‚Äôs Museum of Contemporary Art, which has a hidden treasure of original works by the likes of Jackson Pollock, Francis Bacon, Andy Warhol, Edvard Munch, Ren√© Magritte and Mark Rothko. The attitude of Iranian politicians towards art is also changing. Last month, Tehran‚Äôs mayor replaced billboards ads in the city with art pieces by local and international artists, including Picasso and Magritte, for a period of 10 days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-01T17:03:44Z,world,World news,South Africa beach service to honour slaves drowned in 1794 shipwreck,"A small, solemn memorial service will be held on one of South Africa‚Äôs most popular beaches on Tuesday, close to a recently discovered shipwreck where more than 200 African slaves drowned at the bottom of the sea. The Portuguese ship, the S√£o Jos√©-Paquete de Africa, was sailing from Mozambique to Brazil when it sank in turbulent waters near Cape Town in December 1794. Researchers say it is the first time that the remains of a slavers‚Äô ship that went down with its human cargo on board has been identified. Albie Sachs, a former constitutional court judge, will give a speech welcoming diplomats, activists and community leaders at the ceremony on Clifton beach, near the wreck site. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs profound and terrible to feel this is one of the most beautiful beaches in the whole world and within such a short distance lie the bodies of 200 slaves who died there,‚Äù the 80-year-old said on Monday. ‚ÄúPresumably they were still in shackles or they could have swum to shore. This has been an untold story that has repercussions and reverberations for us today. Somehow their memories survive even though they‚Äôre not in the history books.‚Äù The S√£o Jos√© was making one of the earliest voyages of the transatlantic slave trade from east Africa to the Americas, which persisted well into the 19th century. More than 400,000 east Africans, shackled in ships‚Äô holds, are estimated to have made the four-month, 7,000-mile journey from Mozambique to the sugar plantations of Brazil between 1800 and 1865. The S√£o Jos√© had only been sailing for 24 days when, tossed by strong winds in view of Lion‚Äôs Head mountain, it was smashed on submerged rocks 100 metres from shore. An estimated 212 slaves perished. About 300 survived and were resold into slavery in the Cape. The Portuguese captain, Manuel Jo√£o, and his crew were also rescued. The wreck lay undisturbed for nearly 200 years but was found in the mid-1980s by local amateur treasure-hunters who misidentified it as the remains of an earlier Dutch vessel. But in 2011 Jaco Boshoff, a maritime archaeologist, discovered the captain‚Äôs account of the wrecking of the S√£o Jos√© in local archives. Those on board ‚Äúmade ropes and baskets and continuing like this were able to save some men and slaves until five in the evening, when the ship broke to pieces‚Äù, it recorded. Evidence steadily built. Copper fastenings and copper sheathing indicated a wreck of a later period, and there was also iron ballast ‚Äì often found on slave ships as a means of counterbalancing the variable weights of their human cargo. The Slave Wrecks Project, an international collaboration, found an archival document in Portugal stating that the Sa√µ Jos√© had loaded 1,500 iron bars as ballast before she departed for Mozambique. Further research located a document in which a slave was noted as sold by a local sheikh to the captain of the Sa√µ Jos√© prior to its departure, definitively identifying Mozambique Island as the port of departure for the slaving voyage. Objects retrieved from the ship this year include fragile remnants of shackles, iron ballast to weigh down the ship and its human cargo, copper fastenings and a wooden pulley block. There has been no trace of human remains. Boshoff, co-originator of the Slave Wrecks Project and principal archaeological investigator on the Sa√µ Jos√© excavation, said: ‚ÄúThe more information we get the better. The memorial service will be a bit more emotional, but when we start work again we‚Äôll have to dial back the emotion.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúEvery day there are discoveries made but, in the history of the slave trade, this one is important. It‚Äôs the first time we‚Äôve been able to look at a ship that sank with slaves still on board.‚Äù The wreck site is located between two reefs and is prone to strong swells, making conditions difficult for archaeologists. So far only a small percentage has been excavated. ‚ÄúThere is a lot to do,‚Äù Boshoff said. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt scratched the surface. It‚Äôs a wide-ranging project and I‚Äôm fortunate it‚Äôs on my doorstep.‚Äù A public symposium, called Bringing the S√£o Jos√© Into Memory, will be held in Cape Town on Wednesday. Some of the recovered objects are to be displayed on long-term loan at the Smithsonian‚Äôs new National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC. Lonnie Bunch, director of the museum, who is due to attend Tuesday‚Äôs event, said: ‚ÄúPerhaps the single greatest symbol of the transatlantic slave trade is the ships that carried millions of captive Africans across the Atlantic never to return. ‚ÄúThis discovery is significant because there has never been archaeological documentation of a vessel that foundered and was lost while carrying a cargo of enslaved persons. The S√£o Jos√© is all the more significant because it represents one of the earliest attempts to bring east Africans into the transatlantic slave trade ‚Äì a shift that played a major role in prolonging that tragic trade for decades. ‚ÄúLocating, documenting and preserving this cultural heritage through the S√£o Jos√© has the potential to reshape our understandings of a part of history that has been considered unknowable.‚Äù Plans for divers from Mozambique, South Africa and the US to deposit soil from Mozambique Island, the site of the Sa√µ Jos√©‚Äôs embarkation, on the wreck site has been abandoned due to Cape Town‚Äôs volatile winter weather and high tides. For Sachs, an anti-apartheid activist who lost an arm and the sight in one eye in a bombing in Mozambique while in exile in the 1980s, the international flavour of the day will be important. ‚ÄúThere is a wonderful cooperation between the Smithsonian and the Iziko Museums of South Africa. People are diving together and compiling the information together. This is a beautiful example of present-day globalisation recovering an example of terrible globalisation from the 18th century. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a healing to have people getting together to memorialise the dead. I was nearly killed by a car bomb planted by South African agents in Mozambique. Mozambicans saved my life. Here South Africans are honouring colleagues from Mozambique for this commemoration.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-01T15:15:56Z,world,World news,Rightwing Northern League makes gains in Italian elections,"He is virulently anti-immigrant, has called for Roma camps to be razed and once referred to the euro as a ‚Äúcrime against humanity‚Äù. Matteo Salvini, the bombastic rightwing leader of Italy‚Äôs xenophobic Northern League, has even accused Pope Francis of doing a disservice to Catholics by promoting dialogue with Muslims. None of this appears to be doing him any harm at the ballot box. On the contrary, in the divided and economically battered Italy of 2015, it seems to be a winning formula. The 42-year-old is riding high after his party made significant electoral gains in central and left-leaning parts of Italy, results that reflect growing opposition to the EU and concern over the thousands of migrants landing on Italy‚Äôs shores each week. In what can only be viewed as a personal affront to Matteo Renzi, the charismatic left-of-centre prime minister who used to be mayor of Florence, Salvini‚Äôs Lega Nord, as it is known in Italy, even managed to win 20% of the vote in Tuscany ‚Äì unheard of in the leftwing bastion of the country that counts Renzi as its favourite son. Salvini called the Tuscan result ‚Äúsensational‚Äù. Although Renzi‚Äôs Democratic party (PD) emerged from Sunday‚Äôs regional elections as the overall victor, it lost a bellwether race in Liguria, in northern Italy, to the League-backed candidate from Silvio Berlusconi‚Äôs centre-right Forza Italia, and was trounced by the League in Veneto, the region around Venice.
Apart from the rightwing resurgence, the results also reflect dissatisfaction with Renzi on the left wing of his party, where his support is waning. ‚ÄúI have been listening to chatter on the television for an hour: I am happy that we are a bogeyman for lots of mummies, it must mean we are right,‚Äù a gleeful Salvini said on Italian radio. ‚ÄúThree months ago it was unthinkable that the League would be fundamental in Liguria or able to win again in Veneto. Our work begins tomorrow; for many parties it ends tonight.‚Äù Salvini, who often appears at events wearing T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts ‚Äì he once posed for the cover of Oggi magazine in nothing but a green tie ‚Äì could not be more different to the other Matteo. Renzi, a former boy scout with Machiavellian political instincts, came to power after an intra-party coup last year and promised to reform Italy. He is seen by many, particularly those outside of Italy, as the only viable option to lead the country among a host of politicians who are either too rightwing, too anti-establishment or, on the left, relics of the past. But Sunday‚Äôs election results show that ongoing economic pessimism ‚Äì despite the economy showing meagre growth for the first time after years of stagnation ‚Äì is fuelling opposition to the prime minister and could challenge his ambition to rebuild a lasting centrist majority in Italy. ‚ÄúWe are the real alternative to Renzi,‚Äù Salvini said in a Facebook post. On Twitter, he thanked supporters and warned Renzi ‚Äúwe‚Äôre coming‚Äù, using his usual signoff #Salvini.
Salvini is nipping at Renzi‚Äôs heels in large part because he has managed to turn what was a regional force in Italy into a national party. The Northern League started as a secessionist party that argued for a separation of rich northern Italy from the poor south, but Salvini has ‚Äì with mixed success ‚Äì changed the party‚Äôs focus. He likes to compare the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean to an invasion and is a frequent critic of Italy‚Äôs Roma population. He has claimed that Muslims in Italy are ‚Äútrying to impose a way of life that is incompatible with ours‚Äù. He has even called on Italians to renounce their nationality and ask for asylum so that they can get benefits. The question now, according to Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst at Teneo Intelligence who follows Italian politics, is whether Salvini will emerge as the new leader of Italy‚Äôs centre-right bloc, therefore replacing Berlusconi, the former premier who was forced to step down from high office following a slew of sex and corruption scandals. Salvini had an answer to that question on Monday: ‚ÄúI am the leader of the centre-right,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBerlusconi knows how to read the numbers.‚Äù There was only one real bright spot for Renzi on Sunday, and even that was somewhat dulled. The PD won the race in Campania, in southern Italy, but did so with a slate of candidates who have been criticised by anti-mafia authorities for their links to corruption and organised crime.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-01T15:13:51Z,world,World news,Berlin becomes first German city to make rent cap a reality,"Berlin has become the first city in Germany in which rent-control legislation has come into force in a bid to put the brakes on some of the fastest rising rents in Europe. From Monday, landlords in the capital will be barred from increasing rents by more than 10% above the local average. Such controls were already in place for existing tenants but have now been extended to new contracts.
‚ÄúThe rent ceiling is very important for Berlin because the difference between the rent paid in existing contracts and new contracts is so high,‚Äù said Reiner Wild, managing director of the Berlin Tenants‚Äô Association. ‚ÄúThe other problem is that we have 40,000 more inhabitants per year. Because of this situation the housing market is very strong.‚Äù Berlin is pioneering the rent cap after the national parliament approved the law, aimed at areas with housing shortages, in March. Berliners say flat-hunting is becoming increasingly competitive. ‚ÄúWe were looking for the best part of a year,‚Äù said Vlasis Tritakis, a student. He, his partner Sofia and their 18-month-old son moved out of a flat-share into a one-bedroomed apartment in the district of Kreuzberg in April. But sooner or later they will have to find a place big enough for his son to have a room of his own. They say they don‚Äôt stand much of a chance against competition from potential tenants with better finances. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how we will do it,‚Äù said Tritakis. Although rents are still low compared with other European capitals, Wild says it is vital to keep the city affordable for lower-income residents. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want a situation like in London or Paris,‚Äù said Wild. ‚ÄúThe reality in Paris or London is that people with low income have to live in the further-out districts of the city.‚Äù
Wild said his organisation would like to see more action taken to address the problem, including the building of more affordable housing. Kerstine Appunn and her boyfriend took three and a half months to land a spacious two-bedroomed flat in Prenzlauer Berg, one of Berlin‚Äôs pricier inner-city districts, where organic cafes populate the pretty, tree-lined streets. ‚ÄúI heard that it was quite good going to find somewhere you really like without making too many compromises in such a short time, and in such a nice area,‚Äù Appunn, a journalist, said. ‚ÄúBut I guess we are paying for it. It is quite expensive for Berlin.‚Äù Average rents in the German capital rose from just over ‚Ç¨5.50 (¬£3.60) a square metre in 2005 to close to ‚Ç¨9 last year, according to a report by property services company Jones Lang LaSalle. Between 2013 and 2014, rents went up by more than 9%. Lance Anderson, a translator, arrived from the UK in 1998. He moved into a two-bed flat close to Potsdamer Platz, in the heart of the city, six years ago, before ‚Äúthings went crazy‚Äù in terms of rent rises.
‚ÄúI used to be able to pay my rent for the whole month just by working one shift as a waiter,‚Äù he said of his housing situation in 2003, when he lived in a shared flat in a now very desirable neighbourhood on the eastern edge of Kreuzberg. He conceded that the flat was heated with coal stoves and said it was directly above a flat that a neighbouring tenant rented just for his dogs. But Anderson also says Berlin‚Äôs much-bemoaned gentrification has had its benefits: better places to eat out; more diverse, international communities; and the pleasant feeling of living in a lively, populated city. But he says it is difficult to adjust to the rapid rise in rents in a city where wages are still low. ‚ÄúAll my friends who have been in the city a long time have old leases ‚Äì we know we cannot afford to move,‚Äù Anderson said. ‚ÄúWe are stuck in our flats, kind of like polar bears on our little ice sheets. It sounds like a privileged position to complain about, but for example for couples wanting to move in together ‚Äì it‚Äôs like: ‚ÄòWell, can we really afford to?‚Äô‚Äù ‚Ä¢ This article was amended on Wednesday 3 June 2015 to correct a misspelling of ‚Äúbrakes‚Äù in the opening paragraph.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-01T15:12:38Z,world,World news,Hey neighbor! A 'Black Lives Matter' sign on your lawn is an act of solidarity,"St Louis has become a region awash in signs. In the impoverished, majority black north, block after block of houses post signs with a stark message: ‚ÄúWe must stop killing each other‚Äù. In the region‚Äôs racially mixed, wealthier center, houses post signs with another message: ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù. Together, the signs tell the story of a region struggling to deal with questions of race and violence in the aftermath of the Ferguson events and a spate of homicides. On the blighted city‚Äôs Page Boulevard sits Better Family Life, a nonprofit organization whose vice-president of community outreach, James Clark, spearheaded the ‚ÄúWe must stop killing each other‚Äù campaign. ‚ÄúOne day I walk into the gas station, and a young man says: ‚ÄòWith all this crime and violence going on, man, we got to stop killing each other,‚Äô‚Äù Clark recalls. ‚ÄúNext day, walk into the office, a young man is standing at the front table: ‚ÄòMr Clark, man, my cousin got killed last week. We got to stop killing each other.‚Äô Walk into my office after about an hour, a grandmother calls: ‚ÄòMr Clark, my son didn‚Äôt come home last night. We don‚Äôt know where he is. We got to stop all this killing.‚Äô For about three days, that message came to me.‚Äù
After years of a steady drop in crime, homicides surged in St Louis in 2014, up more than 30% from the year before. The trend continues in 2015, with incidents including two rolling gun battles on the highway, a toddler shot in a park, and a homicide near the baseball stadium in broad daylight. Most of the victims were black. The violence has prompted more than 2,000 homes in the St Louis region to place ‚ÄúWe must stop killing each other‚Äù signs on their lawns since April. According to Clark, ‚Äúwe‚Äù, in St Louis, is everyone. ‚ÄúWhat these signs have done is establish a narrative,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt is a narrative that is of course relevant to us in the African American community, but it is also a narrative that can go to police officers ‚Äì you all must stop killing people. This is a message everyone can reflect on. I‚Äôve got drug dealers and gang members and pastors, the whole spectrum of people, saying: ‚ÄòWe are with you.‚Äô‚Äù Clark says the demand for the signs is so high his organization cannot produce them fast enough. He sees the grassroots, door-to-door campaign as a public outpouring of frustration by those who have been ‚Äúsystematically shut out‚Äù. He says he saw the rise in violence coming since 2005, but no one believed him. I ask what makes people believe him now. ‚ÄúThe bodies keep dropping,‚Äù he answers. ‚ÄúWhat we have is a new mentality: ‚ÄòI will kill‚Äô. This is not like the 1990s, when crime was over drugs. Today it comes from disconnected individuals who have no hope, nothing they really value, because no one has valued them.‚Äù Clark plans to plaster the St Louis region with signs, expanding beyond the black neighborhoods of St Louis into the whiter suburbs. ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter is a good campaign,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt raises public awareness of the biased-ness that exists in America, the inherent racism that discounts black lives. But as an African American, I think that black lives have to matter first in the black community. We can promote that message on parallel tracks.‚Äù ‚ÄòWe‚Äô is everyone in St Louis On the other side of town, across the famed ‚ÄúDelmar Divide‚Äù that separates white St Louis from black, two white retirees, Ben Senturia and Margaret Johnson, are discussing structural racism. They are among a group of 10 activists who have been trying to get white people to place ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù signs on their lawns. ‚ÄúThere came a time when we were trying to figure out: ‚ÄòAs white folks, how do we participate and be supportive?‚Äô‚Äù Senturia recalls. ‚ÄúOne idea that came out is that we could try to promote the long-overdue conversation about race in the white community by creating yard signs that had a little bit of edge, and that would get people thinking and talking to each other.‚Äù ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù is a national movement, and Senturia is adamant that he and his partners are acting not as leaders but in a support role. The goal of the signs is to create conversation. ‚ÄúOne of the principal questions people ask is ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt all lives matter?‚Äô‚Äù Senturia says. ‚ÄúThe answer is that all lives do matter in theory. But in practice, it‚Äôs not equal. There is structural racism and it‚Äôs important to emphasize that not just white lives matter, black lives matter as well.‚Äù ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù signs have been a source of controversy in St Louis. Since January, roughly 1,500 signs have been posted in the region, with coffee shops, churches and bookstores serving as distribution centers. Senturia hopes to ultimately post 5,000 signs, expanding into the wealthier suburbs, which have resisted the campaign. Many signs have been stolen or defaced, and both Senturia and Johnson tell of white people afraid to post them for fear of what their neighbors will think. ‚ÄúThe fact that people have difficulty putting up the sign ‚Äì what does that tell you?‚Äù Senturia asks. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre certainly not post-racial if you can‚Äôt put up a sign in the neighborhood without feeling afraid.‚Äù In an era of heated political conversation, St Louisans are staking their claims on the front yard. To drive through St Louis is to witness parallel communities coping with strife, struggling to find ways to articulate their anger and grief. As much as Clark supports ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù, Senturia and Johnson support the ‚ÄúWe must stop killing each other‚Äù campaign. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs terrific,‚Äù Senturia says. ‚ÄúThe more the merrier. When it comes to these sign campaigns, it is an uphill battle.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A worker at the station discovered her on Sunday after opening the suitcase, which had been moved from a locker to a left-luggage storage room when it was unclaimed. ‚ÄúThere was an abnormal odour when we opened the suitcase,‚Äù a spokesman at the baggage storage company said. ‚ÄúThen we saw hair.‚Äù The body was that of a woman aged between about 70 and 90, and 140 centimetres tall (4ft 7in) tall, who had been folded into the case, according to Japanese media reports. The bright yellow case was left in an unlocked coin locker on 26 April, according to the media reports. It measured 70cm x 50cm x 25cm (28in x 20in x 10in). Police said they had no leads on the woman‚Äôs identity, but were investigating cause of death and examining CCTV footage from around the station. Nothing unusual was observed about the suitcase, no odour or anything, said Junichi Omoto, a spokesman for regional train company JR East. ‚ÄúWe were surprised and horrified,‚Äù he said.

2015-06-01T13:47:54Z,world,World news,Mediterranean migrant death rate slows after search-and-rescue boost,"The rate at which migrants are drowning in the Mediterranean has slowed since the resumption of widescale rescue operations in May, with the death toll falling below the equivalent figure from the same period last year.
The number of deaths in the first five months of 2015 has exceeded 1,800 and is at least five times higher than the death toll for the same period of 2014, when 425 migrants drowned between Italy and Libya. But the rate dropped significantly in May, after several EU navies sent ships to bolster rescue efforts and a private rescue mission run by M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res and the Migrant Offshore Aid Station returned to the high seas. Fewer than 100 migrants drowned last month, down from 329 in May 2014, despite more migrants crossing the Mediterranean, the UN said. In each of the previous months of the year, the death tolls had far outstripped their 2014 equivalents. Britain was among the European navies to send additional rescue ships to assist the Italian coastguard, after about 800 migrants drowned in a shipwreck in April. HMS Bulwark has been saving lives in the Mediterranean since the start of May. The EU border agency, Frontex, also announced plans last week to quadruple its area of maritime operations. Campaigners say it is impossible to draw definitive causal links between the fall in deaths and the increase in rescue operations. But Will Turner, who leads MSF‚Äôs Mediterranean missions, nevertheless welcomed the rise in state-led rescue efforts and called for them to continue. ‚ÄúWe welcome all increases in search-and-rescue capacity ‚Äì as long as it remains in place, and there isn‚Äôt a blurring of lines between military operations and the life-saving humanitarian work,‚Äù he said. Turner said search-and-rescue operations were not the reason thousands of migrants were attempting to reach Europe. ‚ÄúWe still don‚Äôt feel that having search and rescue, which should be there regardless, is a pull factor. From what we see and from the people we meet from Syria, Eritrea and Somalia, people are willingly taking these journeys because there‚Äôs no safe alternative.‚Äù More than 46,000 migrants have reached Europe by boat in 2015, according to the UN, compared with 41,243 between January and May 2014.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-01T13:08:20Z,world,World news,Pont des Arts love locks removed after Parisians lose affection for eyesore,"As far as Paris and padlocks are concerned, it‚Äôs the end of the affair. The French capital has had a definitive falling out with the estimated 1m ‚Äúlove-locks‚Äù that it says are threatening some of the city‚Äôs most historic monuments.
On Monday, workers armed with bolt cutters closed off the celebrated Pont des Arts over the Seine, where a railing collapsed last year under the weight of so many locks, and began breaking hearts around the world. Parisian officials have had a turbulent relationship with the trend since it hit Paris in 2008. When the first dewy-eyed couples began declaring their undying love by writing their initials or names on a padlock, attaching it to a monument and throwing the keys into the River Seine, it seemed relatively harmless.
Since then, however, the locks have grown like metal barnacles over bridge railings, palisades, and parapets. Some have even been spotted on the Eiffel Tower. Lisa Anselmo and Lisa Taylor Huff, two Americans who live in Paris, had started a campaign to persuade the city authorities to clamp down on the locks. Their petition currently has more than 10,400 signatures. Anselmo told journalists she was thrilled by the decision to remove the padlocks. ‚ÄúI hope this is the beginning of the end for this destructive trend,‚Äù she said. Local officials had tried to persuade visiting lovers to take selfies and post a digital declaration of love online, but were forced to admit the campaign was a failure.
Paris city hall has denied being a killjoy. ‚ÄúThis phenomenon gives rise to two problems: a lasting degradation of the heritage of Paris and a risk to the safety of visitors: Parisians and tourists,‚Äù it said in a statement. Bruno Julliard, a deputy mayor, said he hoped to kiss goodbye to such an ‚Äúugly‚Äù trend.
‚ÄúWe will cut away almost a million locks weighing 45 tonnes,‚Äù Julliard said of the Pont des Arts. He warned that similar measures would be taken on the nearby Pont de l‚ÄôArchev√™ch√©, behind Notre-Dame cathedral, another stop on the path of true lock-love. The Pont des Arts will be closed all this week while the locks are removed. To prevent their return, the authorities plan to install padlock-proof glass panels, which will also make graffiti easier to remove, after the summer. ‚ÄúWe still hope that Paris will remain the capital of love and romance,‚Äù Julliard added.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-06-01T11:45:06Z,world,World news,Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor memoirs 'censored' by church,"The Catholic church has been accused of pressuring one of its senior figures to censor extracts of his memoirs relating to a sexual abuse scandal. Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O‚ÄôConnor, the former leader of the church in England and Wales, is said to have been forced to cut chunks from his new book relating to the crisis in his ministry in which he failed to report a paedophile priest to the police and let him continue working. The clergyman, Michael Hill, was later jailed twice for sexually assaulting young victims. Among the sections understood to have been cut is one in which Murphy-O‚ÄôConnor defends the right to protect priests when they have erred. Murphy-O‚ÄôConnor, while Bishop of Arundel and Brighton, moved Hill to the chaplaincy at Gatwick airport despite being warned he was a danger to young people. The cardinal faced calls to resign over the scandal. In the published version of An English Spring, the extract about the duty towards fellow clergy is said to have been replaced with a lament about bishops‚Äô failure to prioritise abuse victims over their priests. Associates of the cardinal, who did not wish to be named, told the Guardian that he had been obliged to censor his work. One said: ‚ÄúA number of us, his friends, were asked to read the typescript in draft. I understand that pressure was put on the cardinal by church authorities to excise sections of the chapter on Michael Hill along with other material in the book.‚Äù The source claimed that Murphy-O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs official publicist at the church‚Äôs headquarters insisted on reading the draft and making cuts. ‚ÄúHe [Murphy O‚ÄôConnor] is a senior prince of the church and he should have just gone ahead and ignored them,‚Äù the source said. When contacted by the Guardian, Murphy-O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs publicist refused to comment specifically on the allegations of censorship. She said in a statement: ‚ÄúThe cardinal‚Äôs memoirs are his memoirs. It‚Äôs his work and he signed off on it.‚Äù In other sections that were cut, it is understood that he accuses the church of not being prepared to root out systemic paedophilia. Asked if church officials had applied pressure, Murphy-O‚ÄôConnor said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather not answer that question. Everything I‚Äôve written is what I wanted to write. Any help I got with writing the book was purely personal.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ This article was amended on Monday 1 June 2015 to restore a comment by Murphy-O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs publicist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-01T11:12:55Z,world,World news,Beijing bans smoking in public places,"Qi Xingming woke up on Monday morning and took his place on the frontline of China‚Äôs war on cigarettes. Wearing a red armband and a panama hat emblazoned with the name of a Brazilian footballer, the 60-year-old migrant worker made his way to one of Beijing‚Äôs top hospitals and began his hunt for illegal smokers. ‚ÄúWhen I say stop, they stop,‚Äù said Qi, one of around 1,100 ‚Äúanti-smoking inspectors‚Äù deployed on the streets of the Chinese capital by the Communist party as part of a renewed crackdown on tobacco in one of the world‚Äôs most cigarette-addicted nations.
Beijing is home to around 4.2 million of China‚Äôs 300 million smokers, according to official figures. But under rules that came into effect on Monday they are now forbidden from smoking in all public places. Cafes, bars, restaurants, hotels, schools, railway stations and hospitals ‚Äì such as the one where Qi normally works as a cleaner ‚Äì must now be entirely smoke-free, according to the regulations. Smokers who flout those rules face fines of 200 yuan (¬£21) while business owners who allow them to do so could be forced to pay 10,000 yuan. China‚Äôs state-run media urged its citizens to get behind the campaign. ‚ÄúThis time we should mobilise everyone,‚Äù Gregory Tsang, an anti-tobacco campaigner, told CCTV‚Äôs lunchtime news, urging viewers to snitch on smokers by calling a special hotline or sending photographs of offenders to a recently launched social media account. Campaigners say the new rules are some of the toughest in Asia but stubbing out smoking in a country with such a long-standing love affair with the cigarette will not be easy. Chairman Mao, a chain smoker, once told his doctor that it was not an addiction but a ‚Äúbreathing exercise‚Äù. Deng Xiaoping ‚Äì another heavy smoker ‚Äì was seen fidgeting nervously during a 1986 lunch with the Queen, until he was told he could smoke. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen a man light up more cheerfully than that,‚Äù Geoffrey Howe, the then foreign secretary, later recalled.
China‚Äôs masses also developed a taste for the cigarette. More than half of Chinese men are smokers, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) while seven of the world‚Äôs top 10 cigarette brands are Chinese. Around 740 million people are forced to breath in secondhand smoke, according to Xinhua, China‚Äôs official news agency, while the average age at which Chinese people start smoking is under 11. China has repeatedly pledged to rein in smoking but cigarette production has surged with factories churning out 25 trillion cigarettes since 2003. If those were laid out tip-to-tip they would stretch 2.1bn km or 52,496 times around the world, state media claimed. The consequences of so much smoking are dramatic. Every 30 seconds somebody dies in China as a result of tobacco use, according to the WHO. While Beijing‚Äôs battle against industrial air pollution makes global headlines, studies suggest smoking is in some ways a far greater risk. Beijingers often wear smog-busting facemasks when levels of a tiny airborne particle called PM2.5 hit 200. But the PM2.5 level in a restaurant where just three people are smoking is three times that, Bernhard Schwartl√§nder, the WHO‚Äôs representative in China, claimed this year. With five smokers in the restaurant, PM2.5 levels would climb to 1,200. ‚ÄúWe do need the ‚Äòwar on air pollution‚Äô. But we also need a ‚Äòwar on tobacco‚Äô,‚Äù the WHO said last week. The latest phase of that war began on Monday morning as anti-smoking placards went up in bars, restaurants and once smoky basement clubs such as the Ding Junhui snooker hall. Within hours of the ban starting, ashtrays had vanished from the club‚Äôs tables and staff had posted anti-smoking notices next to posters of snooker greats such as Steve Davis, Stephen Hendry and John Higgins. One English-language warning, next to a photograph of Ken Doherty, the Irish snooker champion, read: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt smok‚Äù [sic]. Another, in Chinese, said: ‚ÄúWe encourage our members to follow the [no-smoking] rules. We are sorry for any inconvenience it causes.‚Äù Sun Jianlin, the club‚Äôs 22-year-old floor manager, said: ‚ÄúBefore there would be lots of people smoking but it‚Äôs all changed now.‚Äù Three soggy cigarette butts discarded in a dustbin in the men‚Äôs toilet suggested not everything had changed but otherwise the club appeared smoke-free. Li Dongjing, a real estate developer who was playing on table 15, said he had anticipated the ban by swapping his smokes for a 1,200-yuan e-cigarette. ‚ÄúI think smoking is bad. I wanted to change,‚Äù the 35-year-old said. At Tongren hospital, Qi claimed he was winning his battle against errant smokers with nothing but politeness. When he spotted someone smoking in an illegal area he told them: ‚ÄúExcuse me. The smoking ban kicks in today. You‚Äôd better not smoke here. ‚ÄúThey say: ‚ÄòOK‚Äô,‚Äù he said. By Monday afternoon, Qi said he had persuaded 10 people to put out their cigarettes. But the hospital cleaner was losing his own battle against tobacco. ‚ÄúI smoke the cheap ones, the ones that cost 7 to 10 yuan per pack,‚Äù he admitted, grinning to reveal nicotine-stained teeth. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a habit. I can‚Äôt stop.‚Äù Additional reporting Luna Lin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-01T11:00:00Z,world,World news,Northern Alabama‚Äôs only abortion clinic fights to survive lawmakers' onslaught,"On a sweltering Saturday morning in Huntsville, Alabama, nearly two dozen protesters line up along Sparkman Drive, down the road from a dollar store, a car dealership and an assortment of churches. Motorists cruising down the four-lane road honk their horns at the gaggle of activists, who recite prayers through a megaphone and hold signs outside a nondescript beige building that would otherwise go unnoticed. ‚ÄúWell, of course, as an American I‚Äôm against killing,‚Äù says Huntsville resident George Barry, who says he has participated in local anti-abortion protests since the early 1980s, and today grasps a large yellow sign that includes pictures of fetuses and the message ‚ÄúKilling a baby ‚Ä¶ is a bad choice‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to believe that judges are allowing the killing of the innocent,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúJustice is defending the rights of those who can‚Äôt defend their own rights. Who is more innocent than a child in the womb?‚Äù Dalton Johnson, the owner of the Alabama Women‚Äôs Center, the only abortion clinic in northern Alabama, eventually pulls into the parking lot. He chats with several pro-choice advocates on site and heads inside the building without paying much attention to the protesters. The Ohio native, who has faced steadfast opposition from activists, legislators, and lawyers since opening his clinic 14 years ago, now faces a proposal that could force his practice to once again relocate ‚Äì or close for good. In one of the Alabama General Assembly‚Äôs final days in session, the House of Representatives on 26 May voted 79-15 to prohibit abortion clinics from operating near many public schools. If the law is passed, the Alabama department of public health will no longer be allowed to issue or renew a health center license to an abortion clinic located within 2,000ft of a K-12 school‚Äôs campus or property. This week Alabama state representative Ed Henry, the sponsor of the anti-abortion legislation, told lawmakers the bill would keep schoolchildren away from protesters on both sides of the issue, effectively shielding them from seeing any kind of explicit signs or photos near their schools. Henry, who did not respond to multiple requests from the Guardian for comment, failed to mention to his fellow elected officials that abortion providers would face the same limitations as sex offenders.
‚ÄúMost of these women who have had abortions are bitter, shrill, and angry,‚Äù Reverend James Henderson, a former executive director of the Christian Coalition of Alabama who helped draft the bill, said at the protest. ‚ÄúAll they need to do is what all of us as sinners do ‚Äì just come to the place where we seek God‚Äôs truth, see that we‚Äôre sinners, in this case with this horrible sin, and confess it to Jesus Christ.‚Äù Alabama Reproductive Rights Advocates, a local nonprofit opposed to anti-abortion efforts, blasted Henry for his ‚Äútargeted attack‚Äù, which it said further denied access to women‚Äôs health-care services in northern Alabama. Democratic state representative Chris England said the anti-abortion measure would enforce an arbitrary restriction on abortion clinics, unnecessarily burdening women by forcing them to drive longer distances to obtain medical services that are protected by federal law. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no real rational relationship between that footage and keeping children from being exposed to things happening outside, not inside, the clinic,‚Äù England said. ‚ÄúIn effect, it will shut down a Huntsville clinic for something that has nothing to do with the services provided by the clinic.‚Äù The Alabama Women‚Äôs Shelter, one of only five abortion clinics in the entire state, would be directly impacted ‚Äì a new school will open across the street later this year. The clinic has already faced numerous attempts to restrict how and where it performs abortions. According to Johnson, the Alabama Women‚Äôs Center has averaged between 100 and 150 abortions a month. More recently, that number has risen to nearly 200 abortions a month, due to new restrictions on other clinics across the state. An estimated 9,000 abortions were performed in Alabama during 2012. During last year‚Äôs legislative session, lawmakers passed a measure requiring women to wait at least 48 hours to receive an abortion. That law, Johnson says, not only has forced women to wait longer for an abortion, but meant they must make multiple trips to a clinic, effectively deterring them from exercising their constitutional rights in part due to financial constraints.
A year earlier, Govenor Robert Bentley signed off on the Alabama Women‚Äôs Health and Safety Act. Among other things, the act required abortion clinics to meet new building code requirements such as upgrading emergency fire systems and making doors and hallways as wide as an ambulance gurney. Johnson says he tried to make those improvements to the Alabama Women‚Äôs Center‚Äôs long-time location in Huntsville‚Äôs medical district, but the process dragged on for months without resolution. The center shut down for four months last year, in order to retrofit a new facility on Sparkman Drive. It then reapplied for a department of public health license and reopened in October 2014. Along the way two separate legal fights, one challenging the clinic reopening and going after its primary physician for medical fraud, brought the clinic into dire financial straits. Johnson says he is now roughly $1m in the red, doubling his debt and draining his retirement account. For the first time he has launched a crowdfunding campaign to replenish the center‚Äôs funds. A separate and ongoing lawsuit makes such preparations even more necessary. Alabama officials are currently appealing a federal judge‚Äôs 2014 ruling that tossed out a law requiring doctors who terminate pregnancies to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. If an appeals judge reserves the ruling, Johnson says the Alabama Women‚Äôs Center will effectively become the state‚Äôs only abortion clinic, as its doctor is the only person who both performs abortions and has admitting privileges. ‚ÄúIf the admitting privileges ruling gets overturned, this will be the only place for abortions,‚Äù Johnson says. ‚ÄúThat would mean one clinic, and one physician, in the state ‚Ä¶ These are scary times for abortion in the United States.‚Äù The current anti-abortion legislation now rests in the hands of the Alabama senate. The bill needs the upper chamber‚Äôs approval in the final days of the session. Then it would head over to the governor. A spokesperson for Bentley, who has signed off on pro-life measures during recent legislative sessions, did not respond to a request for comment. Susan Watson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union‚Äôs Alabama chapter, said her group would consider taking legal action if the legislation passed through the statehouse. But, Johnson said, no matter who took the lead, a lawsuit challenging the anti-abortion legislation must happen, given its potential impact across the nation.
There is a chance the Alabama Women‚Äôs Center will someday close. If that happened, Johnson said, Huntsville residents would be forced to travel at least 100 miles to the closest abortion clinics ‚Äì Birmingham to the south, Atlanta to the east or Nashville to the north. He said the already difficult decision to terminate a pregnancy would take longer, become more costly, and for some people would no longer be an option. Despite the high-stakes abortion battle, Johnson remains calm about what‚Äôs next, perhaps because he has somehow endured for so long in his lonely fight to ensure Alabama women have access to abortion services. He also remains vigilant, knowing the most important battles have yet to be decided. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like what my mother says: ‚ÄòYou never get a break,‚Äô‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs never been a quiet time. You‚Äôre constantly facing an uptick in the laws being passed.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-01T10:34:30Z,world,World news,"Let God be a 'she', says Church of England women's group","A group within the Church of England is calling for God to be referred to as female following the selection of the first female bishops. The group wants the church to recognise the equal status of women by overhauling official liturgy, which is made up almost exclusively of male language and imagery to describe God. Rev Jody Stowell, a member of Women and the Church (Watch), the pressure group that led the campaign for female bishops, said: ‚ÄúOrthodox theology says all human beings are made in the image of God, that God does not have a gender. He encompasses gender ‚Äì he is both male and female and beyond male and female. So when we only speak of God in the male form, that‚Äôs actually giving us a deficient understanding of who God is.‚Äù Stowell said discussions over terminology arose out of a Westminster faith debate on whether the consecration of female bishops would make a difference in the Church of England.
The matter has been discussed within the transformation steering group, a body that meets in Lambeth Palace to ‚Äúexplore the lived experience of women in ordained ministry‚Äù. The group has issued a public call to bishops to encourage more ‚Äúexpansive language and imagery about God‚Äù. The Rev Emma Percy, chaplain of Trinity College Oxford and a member of Watch, said the effect of using both male and female language would be to get rid of ‚Äúthe notion that God is some kind of old man in the sky‚Äù. She said many people in the church had been having this debate for a long time. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just the church moves slowly. [The debate] caught the imagination now because we‚Äôve got women bishops so in a sense the church has accepted that women are equally valued in God‚Äôs sight and can represent God at all levels. We want to encourage people to be freer, and we want to get the Liturgical Commission to understand that people are actually quite open to this and there is room for richer language to be used.‚Äù In her role at the university, Percy said she had noticed people had become more open to modern terminology. ‚ÄúIn the last two or three years we‚Äôve seen a real resurgence and interest in feminism, and younger people are much more interested in how gender categories shouldn‚Äôt be about stereotypes. We need to have a language about God that shows God can be expressed in lots of diverse terms,‚Äù she said. The Church of England consecrated the Rev Libby Lane as its first female bishop in January and has selected two more female bishops in the past few months. Hilary Cotton, the chair of Watch, said the shift towards gender-equal language was already at an advanced stage in some sections of the church. ‚ÄúThe reality is that in many churches up and down the country something more than the almost default male language about God is already being used,‚Äù she told the Telegraph. ‚ÄúQuietly clergy are just talking about God as ‚Äòshe‚Äô every now and then.‚Äù A spokesperson for Lambeth Palace said: ‚ÄúThe transformations steering group is an independent group made up of women clergy exploring issues relating to the reception of women in ministry. The archbishop of Canterbury, as a gesture of hospitality, offers a meeting space at Lambeth Palace, but does not have a formal role in the group or participate in its discussions. The College of Bishops is updated regularly on the group‚Äôs work. ‚ÄúAny change in the formal liturgy of the Church of England would require consent, revision and final approval of the General Synod. Even prior to that point there would need to be substantial consultation with the Liturgical Commission.‚Äù The palace added that it was worth noting the Eucharistic Prayer contains the line: ‚ÄúAs a mother tenderly gathers her children, you embraced a people as your own.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-01T08:58:01Z,world,World news,China's activity in South China Sea 'beyond anything previously seen',"China‚Äôs rapid claim on contested islands in the South China Sea is beyond anything seen previously and raises legitimate questions about Beijing‚Äôs intentions in the region, the secretary of the Australian defence department, Dennis Richardson, said. Richardson told a Senate estimates committee on Monday that the military buildup on China‚Äôs reclamation program in the South China Sea ‚Äúdwarfs‚Äù what other nations in the region have done previously. ‚ÄúThe land reclamation activity by China in the South China Sea has been at a pace and scale in the last two years beyond anything we have previously seen. It dwarfs what the other claimant states have done, and the size of the land reclamation does raise questions about its purpose,‚Äù Richardson said. China has reportedly started building up its military presence in the artificially created islands, in a region believed to be rich in oil and gas reserves. Several countries have laid claim to the islands, situated just north of Brunei, and the naval corridor is an important shipping route for Australian vessels. Labor has also raised concerns over mounting tension in the South China Sea and has urged the government to tread carefully.
The shadow foreign minister, Tanya Plibersek, told ABC radio: ‚ÄúAustralia and our Asian neighbours in particular and others in the region have an expectation of being able to move freely now and in the future in this area.‚Äù She urged the government to take a softly-softly approach to China‚Äôs land reclamation program. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important that we continue to see freedom of movement in that area, particularly freedom of shipping, but making sure that we use language that calms the situation rather than inflames it is very important,‚Äù Plibersek said. ‚ÄúOur contributions should be to ensure that tensions are de-escalated and understandings between the parties continue to improve.‚Äù Plibersek‚Äôs comments followed those made by the defence minister, Kevin Andrews, who has voiced opposition to any move by China to militarise the disputed islands. Andrews hit out at Beijing‚Äôs reclamation program during an Asian security summit in Singapore on Sunday. ‚ÄúWe remain concerned by any developments in the South and East China Sea which raise tensions in the region,‚Äù he told the summit. ‚ÄúAustralia has made clear its opposition to any coercive or unilateral actions to change the status quo in the South and East China Sea. This includes any large-scale land reclamation activity by claimants in the South China Sea. ‚ÄúWe are particularly concerned at the prospect of militarisation of artificial structures,‚Äù he continued. Andrews urged all the parties involved in the dispute ‚Äì which include China, Malaysia, Brunei, Vietnam, Taiwan and the Philippines ‚Äì to sign a code of conduct immediately, in a bid to ease tensions. ‚ÄúDisputes must be resolved peacefully and Australia urges all parties to exercise restraint, halt all reclamation activities, refrain from provocative actions and take steps to ease tensions,‚Äù Andrews said. ‚ÄúBecause when tensions are high, the risks of miscalculation resulting in conflict are very real.‚Äù The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, echoed the defence minister‚Äôs call for multilateral cooperation. ‚ÄúThe only path to working out all these issues ‚Ä¶ is through international negotiation and discussion.

There has been his language: a lexicon of feel-good words infused with the precision of a conflict-resolution professor. And there has been his belief that small things can lead to big things in his splintered country. Now, at 68, ensconced beneath the arches in the white, colonial-era office that has been the headquarters of every Turkish Cypriot leader since independence, Akinci has his chance to act. ‚ÄúWe have had enough of suffering,‚Äù he told the Guardian in an interview conducted, in part, under a pergola in his garden. ‚ÄúYes, it is important to admit that suffering took place, that it was mutual, that mistakes were made,‚Äù he said of the inter-communal strife that has long estranged Greeks and Turks on Cyprus. ‚ÄúBut it is also high time that we look to the future.‚Äù For Turkish Cypriots, living in what officials politely describe as a state of limbo, the future would mean cohabitation with their Greek compatriots in an island reunited as a federal state.
It has taken Akinci, a three-time mayor of Turkish-controlled Nicosia, Europe‚Äôs last divided capital, more than 40 years to get here. And he comes with impeccable credentials. When bi-communal contacts were publicly eschewed, the leftwing moderate was going in the opposite direction, working with his Greek counterpart to establish what to this day remains among the most durable exemplars of reconciliation: a common sewage system that spans both sides of Nicosia‚Äôs UN-patrolled ‚Äúdead zone‚Äù.Almost 41 summers have elapsed since Turkish troops ‚Äì responding to a coup aimed at enosis, or union, with Greece ‚Äì invaded the island in what Ankara has long viewed as its greatest military victory since the sack of Smyrna in 1922. With the army‚Äôs seizure of the island‚Äôs northern third, about 200,000 Greek Cypriots were forced to flee south as about 40,000 Turkish Cypriots ran the other way. In their separate spheres, the exchange of populations cemented decades of bloodshed and division with the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus unilaterally proclaiming independence in 1983.
Ever since, one of the world‚Äôs most intractable ethnic disputes has defied mediation. Cyprus has come to represent a graveyard for high-level diplomats courting failure. But the election of Akinci may be the game-changer so desperately needed to break the deadlock. In his four weeks in power, the soft-spoken peacenik has wasted little time. First came a decision to dispense with the visa requirement for his self-declared state; then a highly symbolic stroll, arm in arm, across the island‚Äôs buffer zone with Greek Cypriot president Nicos Anastasiades; and last week, an array of confidence-building measures ranging from increasing the crossing points connecting the two communities to linking mobile telephone and electricity grids ‚Äì widely seen as the most positive signs yet that inter-ethnic relations are on the mend. In Anastasiades, who heads Cyprus‚Äô internationally recognised south, Akinci has found a willing partner. At talks held this month ‚Äì the first since they were stalled last October ‚Äì both leaders agreed to personally participate in the process and meet regularly. For both men ‚Äì contemporaries who hail from the southern town of Limassol ‚Äì the resumption of negotiations has never been more pressing. Time, they both agree, is the great adversary. ‚ÄúThe passage of time is not helping a solution,‚Äù sighed Akinci, mourning the loss of common memories of co-existence. ‚ÄúThe more time passes, the more the division becomes consolidated. This is a fact that everyone should understand.‚Äù
Few, it seems, understand this more than Akinci‚Äôs own constituency. Beyond the confines of the ‚Äúpresidential palace‚Äù lies a place at odds with the rest of the world. Under international sanction, cut off from global institutions and recognised only by Turkey, the enclave has been forced for more than 30 years to endure in a diplomatic twilight zone where nothing is quite as it appears. ‚ÄúOn every level, economically, socially, politically, it‚Äôs as if we don‚Äôt exist,‚Äù Ozdil Nami, the Turkish Cypriot negotiator in talks, said. ‚ÄúWe live in a country where regular contact with the rest of the world is severely jeopardised.‚Äù
Seated in his pristine office, also overlooking the manicured lawns of Akinci‚Äôs quarters, the straight-talking 48-year-old lists the litany of abnormalities afflicting the pariah republic. There‚Äôs the issue of direct flights, which are banned, and exports that can‚Äôt take place and absence from any political platform that might confer recognition. Young Turkish Cypriots are unable to participate in international sporting events. And when the Olympic torch arrived in Cyprus before the London Games in 2012, they were denied the pleasure of seeing it because no insurance company would cover its passage through an area perceived to be governed by an illegal regime. ‚ÄúEven cultural contacts are restrained,‚Äù Nami lamented. ‚ÄúTake the recent European song contest. It was impossible to nominate someone. Even if we had applied, no one would reply!‚Äù While tourism is booming and per capita income has reached $11,500 (¬£7,500) ‚Äì compared with $26,000 in the south ‚Äì Turkish Cypriots, more than ever, are yearning for normality in a state that not only functions but does so independently out of the shadow of an increasingly authoritarian Turkey.
‚ÄúI feel I live in a very abnormal country,‚Äù said Fikri Toros, who heads the Turkish Cypriot chamber of commerce. ‚ÄúIt contradicts EU fundamentals enshrining freedom of movement,‚Äù added the British-educated businessman. ‚ÄúOur phone operators, for example, are linked with every other country except one another; that deprives Cypriots of communication and technology which is bloody difficult to accept in 2015.‚Äù The quest to solve Europe‚Äôs longest running dispute has, until now, always crashed on the two communities‚Äô inability to give way on the thorny issues of governance, territory and security. ‚ÄúWhat we shouldn‚Äôt have is yet another disappointment,‚Äù asserted Akinci whose election, unusually, has been positively received by Greek Cypriots. ‚ÄúWe have to be careful in our messages. We have to have empathy. When we look at them, and they look at us, it is important that it is not enemies but future partners that we see.‚Äù With reunification, would come international law and order. ‚ÄúThe younger generation has a very blurred picture of the future. They don‚Äôt know what tomorrow will bring.‚Äù Growing numbers have, in fact, voted with their feet ‚Äì either emigrating or moving two steps ahead of politicians. Since 2003 when checkpoints were first opened, ever more Turkish Cypriots have availed themselves of services in the south ‚Äì seeking healthcare there, dining in its finer restaurants and, in the case of those who can afford it, sending their children to English-language schools. Among them is Esra Aygin, a journalist, who thinks nothing of crossing the UN-patrolled ‚Äúgreen line‚Äù. ‚ÄúAt 7am you‚Äôll see lots of cars at the checkpoints with kids strapped in the backseat being taken to school,‚Äù she enthused, driving her daughter back across the buffer zone from ballet class. ‚ÄúIt is becoming increasingly normal for Turkish Cypriots to also come over for the clubs and bars and the beach. They love Ayia Napa.‚Äù Open-minded and astute, Aygin is typical of the younger generation who want to savour their Cypriot heritage in a reunited Cyprus. At 35, she has no recollection of life before the invasion or any of its intra-ethnic woes. What she does know is that Cyprus is too small to be divided. ‚ÄúTurkish Cypriots see no future in this setup. The state that was established with the argument that it would be recognised hasn‚Äôt happened and will never happen,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs obvious that we will never be able to stand on our feet, or have a say in how this country is run, unless we have a solution.‚Äù
The Islamification ‚Äì in the form of enforced religious classes and mosque construction ‚Äì of a Muslim society that is perhaps one of the most secular in the world has exacerbated the sense that time is running out. So, too, has the arrival of thousands of settlers from dirt-poor Anatolia: migrant workers who now exceed the 120,000 strong Turkish Cypriot population, who also turned out in droves to support Akinci. ‚ÄúAfter not being Turkish enough, we are told we are imperfect in another way by not being religious enough,‚Äù said Aygin. ‚ÄúThere is a feeling that [in 1974] Turkey came and helped us but, ever since, has wanted us to pay. What we want is our dignity back.‚Äù Akinci says the message from Ankara is one of peace. ‚ÄúThey want a solution and they want it sooner rather than later,‚Äù insisted the leader who was given a red-carpet welcome when he had his first official meeting with Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, the Turkish president, in May. ‚ÄúIt is our fate as Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots to live together on this island. The Cyprus problem has been negotiated exhaustively. All that is needed, now, is determination, political will and a shared wisdom and vision.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-01T07:00:13Z,world,World news,First Christian football captain in Iran as Rouhani puts focus on minorities,"As Iran‚Äôs national football team prepared to head to the World Cup last year, Andranik Teymourian stood next to his teammates while they lined up to kiss the holy Islamic book, the Qur‚Äôan, as part of the farewell ceremony. Athough he is not a Muslim, the Iranian Armenian didn‚Äôt want to rock the boat and so performed the ritual for travellers, which is a quintessential part of Iranian culture. The cleric holding up the Qur‚Äôan could hardly disguise his amusement at the scene. The 32-year-old midfielder, known as Ando ‚Äì or Samurai, due to his hairstyle ‚Äì is not shy of showing his Christianity, often crossing himself on the field. In April, Teymourian, who has played for Bolton Wanderers and Fulham, became the first Christian to lead Iran‚Äôs football team as its permanent captain. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy that as a Christian I play in a Muslim team,‚Äù he said in a recent interview. ‚ÄúI have Armenian roots but I hold the Iranian passport and I‚Äôm proud of that, I hold my flag high. I hope I can enhance the good reputation of Armenian people in Iran.‚Äù Ethnic Armenians make up the majority of Iran‚Äôs estimated 300,000 Christians. Armenians are fully integrated in Iranian society, from the musician Loris Tjeknavorian to Sombat Hacoupian, who founded one of the country‚Äôs most famous men‚Äôs clothing brands and is now a household name. Although Islam is Iran‚Äôs official religion, it recognises Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians as accepted religious minorities. They are permitted their house of worship and usual religious services, and have reserved seats in the Iranian parliament. In a country where alcohol and pigmeat are forbidden, Christians are allowed to distil booze and eat pork. There are at least 600 churches in Iran, including the sixth-century St Mary Church of Tabriz, mentioned by Marco Polo in his travel book. The adjacent province of West Azerbaijan boasts the ancient St Thaddeus Monastery, a Unesco world heritage site. When Hassan Rouhani came to power in 2013, he appointed Ali Younesi, a former intelligence minister, to serve as his special assistant in minorities‚Äô affairs. It was the first time such a position had been created. Significant improvements have since been made but many big challenges remain. In April, as Iran‚Äôs northern neighbour, Armenia, commemorated the centenary of the 1915 genocide, the Iranian government, which is usually nervous about public gatherings, took a rare decision to allow Iranian Armenians to stage a protest in front of the Turkish embassy in Tehran. The official attitude towards other minorities has also changed. In February, Younesi announced that Jewish students officially no longer had to go to school on Saturdays, the sabbath day in the Hebrew calendar. Iranian school weeks run from Saturday to Thursday, and Friday is the end of the Iranian week. ‚ÄúThere are numerous reasons why my family left Iran in 1987, but an important one was the decision by the Iranian government that year not to officially recognise the holy sabbath as a religious day off for Jewish students,‚Äù an Iranian-Israeli, Meir Javedanfar, blogged recently as he hailed the new decision. Rouhani‚Äôs administration has tried to revamp Iran‚Äôs image, especially concerning the official attitude towards the country‚Äôs Jewish community, after it was badly tarnished under his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was notorious for his Holocaust denials and antisemitic tirades. Rouhani took Iran‚Äôs sole Jewish MP to New York with his entourage in his first visit to the UN general assembly. He has since condemned the mass killings of Jews by the Nazis as crime against humanity, tweeted a Rosh Hashanah blessing for Jewish new year, and honoured Iranian Jewish soldiers who lost their lives in the eight-year war against Iraq in the 1980s. Since his appointment, Younesi ‚Äì who is a Muslim cleric ‚Äì has visited synagogues and churches across the country. According to the reformist Shargh daily, he said after one of those visits in the city of Shiraz: ‚ÄúIran belongs to all Iranians from any ethnic or religious groups and all of them have a right to live peacefully along other citizens.‚Äù He was also quoted as saying: ‚ÄúNo one is allowed to suppress or infringe the rights of any minority groups. We all have equal rights.‚Äù The government last year donated nearly half a million dollars to Tehran‚Äôs Jewish hospital. But hardliners, who are strongly opposed to such conciliatory moves, have not remained quiet. Instead, they have held Holocaust denial cartoon competitions in the capital. Iran is believed to have the largest Jewish population in the Middle East after Israel. But the country‚Äôs Jewish population slumped after the Islamic revolution, when many Iranian Jews emigrated to Israel or other countries. In spite of animosity between Iran and Israel, Iranians are the least antisemitic people in the Middle East, according to the latest poll by the US-based Anti-Defamation League (ADL). However, although Iranian Jews are free to practise their faith like other minorities, some report feeling like second-class citizens. The situation of Zoroastrianism is much better. Iranians were Zoroastrians before Islam arrived in Iran and the country‚Äôs culture is a mixture of Islamic and Zoroastrian traditions. Many traditions survive from those ancient times, such as Nowruz, or Persian new year, which is a holy day for Zoroastrians but also the most important holiday for millions of Iranian Muslims. Amid improvements, one notable exception is the Baha‚Äôi faith, which is still banned and its followers persecuted and even imprisoned. Those in jail include Faran Hesami, a Bah√°‚Äô√≠ mother of a four-year-old, who was arrested for teaching members of the community in Iran who are banned from university because of their religious affiliation. Seven Bah√°‚Äô√≠ leaders have been imprisoned for the past seven years, each serving 20-year sentences.
‚ÄúSome 100 Bah√°‚Äô√≠s are wrongly imprisoned solely because of their religious beliefs, thousands more are excluded from higher education, and the Bah√°‚Äô√≠ community as a whole is discriminated against in employment and prevented from freely assembling for worship and community activities,‚Äù said Diane Ala‚Äôi, the representative of the Bah√°‚Äô√≠ International Community to the UN in Geneva. Iran also remains highly sensitive towards the issue of conversion. Muslims who convert to other religions risk being arrested. More than 90 are behind bars, includuing pastor Saeed Abedini, who holds an Iranian American citizenship. Muslims whose denominations are not accepted by Iran, such as Gonabadi dervishes, face persecution, with many of their members in jail. Rouhani is trying to improve the situation of ethnic groups. Earlier this year, Iran unveiled the first book in Kurdish language to be officially taught in schools in the country‚Äôs Kurdistan region. However, widespread persecution persists against Arab, Kurdish and Azeri activists. In December 2013, in a rare example of a politician from a minority group being promoted in Shia-dominated Iran, a Sunni woman, Samieh Baluchzehi, who belongs to the country‚Äôs Baluchi ethnic minority, was chosen as the mayor of a provincial city.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-01T06:00:12Z,world,World news,"How Mohamed Morsi, Egypt‚Äôs first elected president, ended up on death row","Surrounded by golden mantlepieces, tasselled curtains and a coterie of suits, Mohamed Morsi did not have the air of a man about to be ousted as president. He talked a good game, too. It was 29 June 2013, the day before much-hyped demonstrations that were expected to give the Egyptian military the cover they needed to sweep Morsi from power. But asked whether he trusted the army, Morsi replied with one word: ‚ÄúGedan.‚Äù Absolutely. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre busy now,‚Äù he later added, ‚Äúwith the affairs of the army itself.‚Äù But evidently not busy enough ‚Äì this was Morsi‚Äôs last interview as president. Two days on, army chief Abdel Fatah el-Sisi gave him an ultimatum to leave office. And two days after that, on 3 July, Sisi ordered his arrest. Morsi has spent the past 23 months in jail, on trial in an ever-increasing number of cases ranging from espionage to incitement, as his successors in power seek to guarantee that he never tastes freedom again. Sisi, by contrast, became president in Morsi‚Äôs place, overseeing a crackdown on most forms of opposition with tens of thousands of dissidents detained, and thousands killed. The biggest proportion of them have been supporters of Morsi‚Äôs Muslim Brotherhood ‚Äì a provocation that led the group last week to make what amounted to a call for an armed insurgency.‚Äù
That process may reach its apogee on Tuesday. Given a preliminary death sentence in the second of his four trials last month, Morsi will find out whether it has been upheld. The outcome is expected to be appealed in a process that will take years. Whether Egypt‚Äôs regime would follow through with such a provocative act also remains to be seen. But should the conviction eventually stand, Morsi would become the world‚Äôs first ex-president to be executed since Saddam Hussein in 2006. It is a shocking fate for a man who less than three years ago became the first Egyptian president to reach office through free elections. How he reached this nadir depends on who you ask. Supporters say he was doomed from the start. They argue that when Hosni Mubarak was toppled in 2011, his regime remained largely intact, and was able to undermine Mubarak‚Äôs elected successor from the moment of his election. ‚ÄúThe struggle was inevitable,‚Äù Brotherhood official, Ahmed el-Khoufi, told me last week. Khoufi is one of more than 100 men given a provisional death sentence alongside Morsi, accused of collaborating with Hamas to escape from jail during the 2011 uprising. He‚Äôs now on the run. He adds, ‚ÄúIt was inevitable that there would be a clash between [the supporters of] a revolution that called for freedom, social justice and human dignity, and a regime that ruled Egypt for decades.‚Äù But Morsi‚Äôs initial bedfellows in that revolution, the leftists, liberals and moderates who would later join Mubarak‚Äôs allies to call for Morsi‚Äôs exit, have a different narrative. They argue that instead of maintaining a working relationship with other revolutionary factions, he quickly alienated them, and acted only in the interest of the Brotherhood. ‚ÄúThe Brotherhood had a degree of political stupidity,‚Äù says Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, a former Brotherhood big beast who ran against Morsi in 2011, and was once considered the election‚Äôs frontrunner. ‚ÄúThey thought they could protect themselves from the conspiracy of the Mubarak regime through [just] their own organisation. They were arrogant. But it‚Äôs impossible in the aftermath of any revolution to be protected by anyone other than the owners of that revolution: the people.‚Äù In June 2012, on the day of his election, Morsi seemed to understand the need to maintain appearances. In a symbolic, if slightly awkward, gesture, he stood before crowds in Tahrir Square, the crucible of the 2011 uprising, and unbuttoned his jacket. The point was to show that he wasn‚Äôt wearing a bulletproof vest ‚Äì and that as a representative of the people, he was not afraid of them.
But he would need more than gestures to maintain unity. He won the election, but only just. And many who got him over the line in the run-off had voted not from conviction ‚Äì but because they saw him as marginally more preferable to his opponent in the final round: Mubarak‚Äôs last prime minister. But rather than keeping everyone onside, Morsi was seen as increasingly divisive, open only to Islamist ideas, and loyal only to the Brotherhood. In October, at celebrations to mark one of the Egyptian army‚Äôs most mythical victories, he invited a man convicted of assassinating his predecessor, Anwar Sadat. It was a highly provocative gesture that did nothing to assuage fears that Morsi‚Äôs election marked the gateway to a more extremist Egypt. But the event that may have sealed his fate came a month later, in November 2012. Seeking to fast-track a controversial, Islamist-slanted constitution, Morsi awarded himself total executive control, allowing himself to bypass judicial procedures to ensure the text was put to a public vote without further debate. The decision led to deadly street fights between Brotherhood supporters and leftist and liberals outside the presidential palace. Within 10 days, he revoked his decision. But for those who had been on the fence, it was a point of no return. Even Morsi, in his final interview, admitted that it was a mistake: ‚ÄúIt was not meant to be, but it contributed some kind of misconception in society.‚Äù Mohamed Aboul Ghar, the leader of Egypt‚Äôs social democratic party, and one of the leading liberal voices to emerge after 2011, says it was the moment he realised Morsi wouldn‚Äôt last. The day before Morsi decided to rule by decree, Aboul Ghar had been locked in talks for five hours with the president and other political leaders. The aim was to decide what to do about the constitution, whose drafters had reached an impasse. The talks were promising. Both sides made compromises, and Morsi seemed very happy, remembers Aboul Ghar. ‚ÄúHe said: I think we‚Äôve [taken] a very important step, and we are going to save the constitution, we‚Äôre going to find a compromise, and sort out this big problem in Egypt.‚Äô‚Äù
By Aboul Ghar‚Äôs account, Morsi promised to meet again with his opponents the next day, to finalise their deal. But that never happened. Instead, says Aboul Ghar, ‚Äúon the next day there was this emergency decree. This clearly [showed] to me that it is not him who decides anything. He made these suggestions [to his superiors in the Muslim Brotherhood], and he was told: ‚ÄòShut up. You make this decree.‚Äô Since then, we were invited [to meet Morsi] many times, and we all refused to meet him.‚Äù The Brotherhood portray it differently. They saw the decision to ram through the constitution as their only option, and a reasonable response to months of intransigence from both the deep state, and from secular-leaning politicians such as Aboul Ghar. At each attempt to hasten Egypt‚Äôs democratic transition and establish consensus, they claim they were respectively thwarted by hostile institutions, and immature liberal politicians who refused to work with Morsi in cabinet. ‚ÄúThis is the situation,‚Äù Morsi told me, when asked why he hadn‚Äôt appointed more ministers from other political backgrounds. ‚ÄúWe offer them [positions], and they refuse.‚Äù In a move that contributed to the Brotherhood‚Äôs bunker mentality, the supreme court dissolved the Brotherhood-led lower house of parliament in the days before Morsi‚Äôs election. It was a decision that forced Morsi to govern without his parliamentary power base ‚Äì a situation he felt the deep state had engineered to undermine his ability to get anything done. Then in the days before the constitutional debacle, he feared that something similar was about to happen: another intervention from the supreme court that would scrap the committee tasked with drafting the constitution, and bring the whole transition back to square one. Without a constitution, the Brotherhood‚Äôs thinking went, there could be no new parliament, and without a parliament, Egypt would be stuck in transitional limbo. But whatever the intention, his decision smacked of dictatorship, and meant that Egypt‚Äôs divisions would only deepen as Morsi‚Äôs tenure continued. His opponents felt there was little point engaging with him. And Morsi saw little point in trying ‚Äì the fact that the Brotherhood had been on the winning side in every post-revolutionary election gave them an erroneous sense of their own invincibility. But by late May, they should have been worried. By this point a significant proportion of the population had started to mobilise against them.
Crucially, these people didn‚Äôt just include the usual suspects ‚Äì such as Aboul Ghar. A new campaign group, Tamarod, caught the imagination, and encouraged millions of Egyptians, many of whom had voted for Morsi, to sign a petition calling for early elections. Sensing their moment, the business elite, which controlled the media, launched a full-on decapitation strategy. As June wore on, their newspapers and TV cast Morsi and the Brotherhood as terrorists, and holding them solely responsible for Egypt‚Äôs deep-rooted economic problems and fuel shortages. Aboul Fotouh, Morsi‚Äôs former ally, supported calls for early elections, and for anti-Morsi protests. But he also argues that these protests were egged on by a campaign to ‚Äúsmear the president, to smear the revolution, and to make people feel that revolution didn‚Äôt bring any stability or any security.‚Äù Which came first may never be established, but amid an increasingly hysterical national conversation, the military also began to move behind the scenes. Leaked recordings of conversations between top generals suggest that the army, supported by the Gulf monarchies, may have helped to fund Tamarod, the grass-roots anti-Morsi campaign. And on 23 June, the army‚Äôs leadership summoned several western ambassadors, and hinted that they were mulling an intervention. But Morsi‚Äôs arrest, let alone his execution, was still by no means a certainty. On 29 June, our interview was delayed while Morsi negotiated with Sisi in the next-door room. The die may have been cast, but it had not yet come to a rest. Even after 30 June, when millions turned out to oppose him, negotiations continued. Behind the scenes, some of Morsi‚Äôs opponents say that while they were adamant that the president should step down, they were also open to the Brotherhood‚Äôs continued political involvement in some form. Even on 3 July, one source said that Saad el-Katatny, the Brotherhood‚Äôs parliamentary leader, was offered the chance to attend a televised meeting about the decision to hold new elections, a symbolic gesture to show that the Brotherhood would not be completely sidelined.
But as ever, the Brotherhood did not compromise. Throughout this final fortnight, people such as Aboul Ghar feared that Morsi might make some gesture of reconciliation, and so avert the worst of public anger. ‚ÄúI thought that Morsi would be a little bit wiser, [that he‚Äôd] do something positive,‚Äù says Aboul Ghar. ‚ÄúBut as it‚Äôs very clear to me, Morsi didn‚Äôt have any power. Absolutely nothing. It was the Maktab Irshad [the Brotherhood‚Äôs management board] who had full power ‚Ä¶ They didn‚Äôt see that their supporters [were] not supporting them any more. They didn‚Äôt see any of these things.‚Äù On 2 July, Morsi‚Äôs allies say he did give in on some counts ‚Äì but it was too late. On 3 July, he was arrested along with his closest advisers. And so began the still-unfinished crackdown on all Brotherhood activity. The Brotherhood argue that what happened next ‚Äì the massacres, the mass-arrests, Morsi‚Äôs death sentence ‚Äì was scripted from the beginning, and that they were given no chance to beat a dignified retreat. They point out that within days, on 8 July, the army and police had already gunned down more than 50 pro-Morsi protesters in a massacre outside the Republican Guards‚Äô club in east Cairo. Ahmed el-Khoufi, the Brotherhood official also awaiting confirmation of a death sentence on Tuesday, says: ‚ÄúSince the start of that first massacre outside the Republican Guards, it was clear that this path was a piece of theatre that still hasn‚Äôt finished.‚Äù
But as ever in Egypt, there is no single, linear truth. It was the army who toppled Morsi, and whose leaders have since tried to stamp out dissent ‚Äì Islamist and non-Islamist alike. But in the weeks following Morsi‚Äôs ouster, the moderates who provided the smokescreen for the army‚Äôs return to political life still carried some influence. The head of the supreme court was made acting president. Egypt‚Äôs leading liberal, Mohamed ElBaradei, was appointed vice-president, and was allowed to pick the prime minister, Hazem el-Beblawi, an economics professor from Aboul Ghar‚Äôs social democratic party. For much of July, Baradei and a team from the EU led negotiations with the Brotherhood, attempting to get them to quit their huge protest camp at Rabaa al-Adawiya in east Cairo before the hardliners dismantled it by force.
The August massacre at Rabaa, which saw soldiers shoot dead over 800 pro-Morsi protesters, was initially not a forgone conclusion. Nor was Morsi‚Äôs prolonged incarceration. In mid-July, a general claimed to me that his fate had not yet been decided, and that he might even be released once the country calmed down. But the longer the Brotherhood stayed in the streets, and the harsher their rhetoric became, the more likely a full-on crackdown seemed. Their intransigence became embarrassing for the new government, and gave more ammunition to those within it who wanted a harder-line solution.The then prime minister, Hazem el-Beblawi, argued to me last year: ‚ÄúThere was an increasing anger among the people: how come you want us to believe that you bring us peace and security if there is a direct insult to you in the street, defying you, and you are doing nothing?‚Äù At this point, Sisi was not yet officially heading the country ‚Äì but Beblawi suggested he had an increasing say in how things were run. ‚ÄúGeneral Sisi and the army played a major role in 30 June,‚Äù said Beblawi. ‚ÄúThere is no doubt about this. And his popularity at that time was very high. It still is. Also he was the head of the army, and the army was about the most organised and solid organisation [in Egypt]. So these are facts of life. If I go to sports, and you have next to you the best football player, definitely he has more supporters than I do. If I go with a singer, he definitely will have supporters. So these are facts.‚Äù Perhaps the defining post-Morsi moment, and the one that would define Morsi‚Äôs fate, came on 24 July. That was the day Sisi made a speech that shifted the balance of power in favour of the hardliners. Since the Brotherhood had snubbed ElBaradei‚Äôs appeals for compromise and refused to leave the streets, Sisi now asked the Brotherhood‚Äôs opponents to return to Tahrir Square in their millions, to give him a mandate to tackle terrorism. It was a thinly veiled attempt to circumvent peaceniks such as ElBaradei, and win support for the eradication of the Brotherhood, and his own political ambitions. ‚ÄúI was shocked,‚Äù remembers Khaled Dawoud, then the spokesman for ElBaradei‚Äôs political coalition. ‚ÄúI remember very well waking up late, because it was Ramadan, and seeing [Sisi] on the TV in his full military uniform and these super-dark sunglasses, and [hearing] this very hardline speech, and thinking: ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs this? Why are you asking for a mandate? You are only the defence minister.‚Äô‚Äù But two days later, many Egyptians appeared to have fewer qualms: millions turned out to give Sisi his mandate. On the same day, prosecutors brought the first formal allegations against Morsi, accusing him of escaping from prison in 2011 ‚Äì an allegation that prosecutors seemed happy to overlook when he ran for president, but which now may have him executed. Later that night, police shot dead more than 80 Brotherhood protesters. And just under three weeks later, soldiers moved on the camp at Rabaa, killing over 800 in the worst state-led massacre since at least Tiananmen Square. Any hopes that Morsi might leave prison ended there, and the confidence he expressed in the army on 29 June seemed more misplaced than ever. Still, he got one thing right that Saturday, as he sat on a golden-rimmed armchair at Cairo‚Äôs Qubba place. ‚ÄúIt has been a very difficult year,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I think the coming years will also be very difficult.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-01T04:18:27Z,world,World news,Nauru asylum seeker waited three months for tests after shadow found in throat scan,"A female asylum seeker on Nauru who was unable to eat solid foods due to throat pain spent three months without receiving further health testing after a shadow was found in an ultrasound scan, a former detention worker has alleged. New submissions lodged to a Senate inquiry that is investigating serious allegations and conditions at the Nauru detention facility by three unnamed workers on the island have detailed further concerns about medical treatment and sexual assaults. In one submission a case manager at the centre wrote that the poor levels of medical treatment available at the centre directly contributed to asylum seekers‚Äô mental health and wellbeing deteriorating. It detailed one incident where a female asylum seeker began experiencing throat pain and was unable to swallow solid foods. An ultrasound was performed by International Health and Medical Services that revealed a shadow which required further tests using a camera down her throat. When she was later taken to the Nauru hospital ‚Äì known as Ron hospital ‚Äì she was unable to be treated. ‚ÄúShe was scheduled twice to go to the Ron hospital and turned up for her appointments, to be told that they were unable to do the testing due to parts not available for the equipment,‚Äù the submission said. ‚ÄúThis asylum seeker went about three months without having access to food that was easy to swallow such as soup, yoghurt, soft fruit, and relied on her husband to sneak food out of the mess when there was food available for her to eat. Many emails were sent to appropriate stakeholders regarding her issue with food and accessing food appropriate for her to eat, with no outcome.‚Äù It added that her mental health faced a drastic decline, and the woman feared making a complaint because she was worried that medical treatment may be withheld. The case manager wrote that ‚Äúasylum seekers often discussed how they did not feel safe in their accommodation and feared being watched in their room by other stakeholders or asylum seekers‚Äù. The staff member reiterated concerns outlined by former integrity commissioner Philip Moss in his review into allegations at the centre, and said that asylum seekers feared giving information to staff ‚Äúand would not complain because they might be targeted‚Äù. A second former senior Save the Children staff member who worked predominantly with unaccompanied minors on the island said violence against refugees on the island was ‚Äú100% foreseeable‚Äù, and that the immigration department had been aware of attacks on private contractors on the island. ‚ÄúOver the course of my time in Nauru, several foreign workers were attacked by Nauruan locals whilst visiting the community, including a female staff member of one stakeholder organisation who was seriously assaulted whilst going for a run. Other foreign workers were attacked while returning to OPC1 accommodation after a meal at a restaurant,‚Äù the submission said. The incidents led to the immigration department advising that all staff remain in pairs when outside the detention facility. ‚ÄúDespite this, DIBP saw fit to send vulnerable single women, men and unaccompanied children into the community, when it was well known that sections of the community would be hostile towards them.‚Äù A third submission from an anonymous staff member said that during their time on the island two employees, one male and one female, were both sexually assaulted by Nauruans. The Senate inquiry heard in May from the private contractors at the centre, Transfield Services, Wilson Security and Save the Children. Transfield were unable to answer a series of basic questions about their operations on the island, and face being recalled to the inquiry. The immigration department is set to appear at a later date before the committee.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-06-01T00:20:45Z,world,World news,Stone throwers could be jailed for 10 years under new Israeli bill,"Protesters who throw stones at moving vehicles could be jailed for up to 10 years following the approval on Sunday of a bill by an Israeli ministerial legal committee. The bill, which faces a series of parliament readings before coming into effect, would amend an existing law that allows stone throwers to be jailed for 20 years, but only if it can be proven they intended to inflict harm. The new version would enable 10 years imprisonment for ‚Äúthrowing stones or other objects at travelling vehicles in a manner that could endanger the passenger‚Äôs safety‚Äù or harm the vehicle, the bill read. The justice minister, Ayelet Shaked, of the far-right Jewish Home party, who presented the bill and heads the ministerial committee for legislation that approved it, noted that stone throwers were receiving ‚Äúvery soft punishments compared to their crimes‚Äù, because intent was difficult to prove. ‚ÄúThe amendment to the law effectively places the responsibility on the stone thrower and not the prosecutor,‚Äù she wrote on her Facebook page. ‚ÄúAnyone who throws stones at cars or people has to assume someone will get hurt.‚Äù Palestinians target Israeli cars on West Bank roads with stones almost every day, and clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police in the West Bank and east Jerusalem tend to involve stone throwing. The legislative move came as the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, said Israel faced an ‚Äúinternational campaign to blacken its name‚Äù aimed at delegitimising its very existence. The international community disproportionally singled it for condemnation while remaining silent on major conflicts and human rights abuses in other countries, he said. Netanyahu made the comments on Sunday at a meeting of his new cabinet just two days after a Palestinian proposal to suspend Israel from world football was dropped at the last moment. Netanyahu warned that such efforts to boycott Israel continued. Palestinians accelerated their campaign to boycott Israel and Israeli-made products after peace talks collapsed in 2014. ‚ÄúWe are in the midst of a great struggle being waged against the state of Israel, an international campaign to blacken its name. It is not connected to our actions; it is connected to our very existence. It does not matter what we do; it matters what we symbolise and what we are,‚Äù Netanyahu said. ‚ÄúI think that it is important to understand that these things do not stem from the fact that if only we were nicer or a little more generous ‚Äì we are very generous, we have made many offers, we have made many concessions ‚Äì that anything would change because this campaign to delegitimise Israel entails something much deeper that is being directed at us and seeks to deny our very right to live here,‚Äù he said.

2015-05-31T23:54:53Z,world,World news,"South China Sea tensions demand 'calming' response, says Labor","Labor is urging the government to tread carefully in its handling of rising tensions in the South China Sea, after the defence minister Kevin Andrews expressed concerns about China‚Äôs move to militarise disputed islands. China has reportedly started building up its military presence in the artificially-created islands, believed to be a region rich in oil and gas reserves. Several countries have laid claim to the islands, situated just north of Brunei, and the naval corridor is an important shipping route for Australian vessels.
‚ÄúAustralia and our Asian neighbours in particular and others in the region have an expectation of being able to move freely now and in the future in this area,‚Äù the shadow foreign minister Tanya Plibersek told ABC radio on Monday. She urged the government to take a softly-softly approach to China‚Äôs land reclamation program. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important that we continue to see freedom of movement in that area, particularly freedom of shipping, but making sure that we use language that calms the situation rather than inflames it is very important,‚Äù Plibersek said. ‚ÄúOur contributions should be to ensure that tensions are de-escalated and understandings between the parties continue to improve.‚Äù Andrews hit out at Beijing‚Äôs reclamation program during an Asian security summit in Singapore on Sunday. ‚ÄúWe remain concerned by any developments in the South and East China Sea which raise tensions in the region,‚Äù he told the summit. ‚ÄúAustralia has made clear its opposition to any coercive or unilateral actions to change the status quo in the South and East China Sea. This includes any large-scale land reclamation activity by claimants in the South China Sea.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe are particularly concerned at the prospect of militarisation of artificial structures,‚Äù he continued. Andrews urged all the parties involved in the dispute ‚Äì which include China, Malaysia, Brunei, Vietnam, Taiwan and the Philippines ‚Äì to sign a code of conduct immediately, in a bid to ease tensions. ‚ÄúDisputes must be resolved peacefully, and Australia urges all parties to exercise restraint, halt all reclamation activities, refrain from provocative actions, and take steps to ease tensions,‚Äù Andrews said. ‚ÄúBecause when tensions are high, the risks of miscalculation resulting in conflict are very real.‚Äù The opposition leader Bill Shorten echoed the defence minister‚Äôs call for multilateral cooperation. ‚ÄúThe only path to working out all these issues ‚Ä¶ is through international negotiation and discussion. There‚Äôs no other path to long-term peace than that,‚Äù Shorten told reporters on Monday. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all in this together‚Äù Labor has asked the Coalition for a briefing on the situation in the disputed region.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-31T23:01:03Z,world,World news,UK police requests to access phone calls or emails are granted 93% of the time,"Ministers are facing calls to curb the scale of police access to private phone and email records, after a report by privacy campaigners found officers were making a request every two minutes and getting access in 93% of cases. The figures, released to Big Brother Watch under freedom of information laws, found there were more than 730,000 requests for communications data between 2012 and 2014 from forces across the UK. There were annual increases in applications in each of those years, peaking at just under 250,000 last year, according to the report. It also uncovered a huge disparity in how many requests were being allowed by each force, with some, such as Essex, rejecting 28% of requests but others, such as Cheshire, turning down only 0.1%. The report comes at a sensitive time for the government, which is sitting on an official report about surveillance powers by David Anderson QC, who has warned that it ‚Äúwon‚Äôt please everybody‚Äù.
At the same time, Theresa May, the home secretary, is seeking to revive legislation that would give the security services and police extra surveillance powers, including strengthening the warranted powers of police and spies to intercept the content of calls and messages as well as communications data. Critics of proposals for the new investigatory powers bill ‚Äì unveiled in the Queen‚Äôs speech ‚Äì say there is already too much information gathered on the activities of citizens and insufficient transparency about whose information is accessed, what kinds of cases the data relates to and how each request is approved. In light of the Big Brother Watch report, David Davis, a Conservative former shadow home secretary, said the scale of police access to communications data was ‚Äúout of control‚Äù and called for officers to get approval from a judge before accessing the information. ‚ÄúBefore we make any further changes to the law, we need to understand it and we need to get it back under control, which means a better warrant system or judicial approval system,‚Äù he said. Davis also said the ‚Äúastonishing range‚Äù of rejection rates ‚Äì from 0.1% to 28% ‚Äì suggests there is something wrong with the way requests are being handled. He said it was already a ‚Äúdisgrace‚Äù that there was not more information on how the police are using private data, saying there was ‚Äúoverwhelmingly a case for massively more transparency in this area‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe government‚Äôs primary argument for extending the ability to collect communications data is that somehow there is a shortfall,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut they refuse to provide the information that would prove or disprove their case.‚Äù
Tom Watson, the campaigning Labour MP who is a favourite to be deputy leader, said: ‚ÄúOur intelligence and police services remain in danger of losing public legitimacy for the surveillance they conduct. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs absolutely vital that people understand for what reason this information is requested so frequently. Of course, there has to be secrecy about the nature of the intelligence but it is not unreasonable for public policymakers to know the terms on which these investigations are undertaken,‚Äù he said. The government is bracing itself for a battle over civil liberties in the next few years, as May makes the case for more powers for the security services and police to access private communications data and intercept the contents of messages. The legislation, formerly known as the communications data bill, was previously blocked by the Liberal Democrats in 2013 at a time of renewed scrutiny of the intelligence services over the revelations of US whistleblower Edward Snowden. May has sought to justify the revival of the surveillance bill by saying police forces and the security agencies have a gap in their capabilities because their current powers do not allow them to access certain new technologies. However, Renate Samson, chief executive of Big Brother Watch, said the tiny rate of rejections raised questions about the claim that police forces are being frustrated in their quest for information.
‚ÄúModern policing and the use of technology in investigating crime should be more transparent,‚Äù Samson said. ‚ÄúWe are repeatedly told that communications data plays a significant role in modern policing, yet the report‚Äôs findings pose serious questions about the internal approval process, which differs from force to force. ‚ÄúWith police forces making over 730,000 requests for communications data in the past three years, political mutterings of diminishing access to our communications are clearly overstated. If greater access to our communications is to be granted, increased transparency and independent judicial approval should be introduced as standard. ‚ÄúUntil these safeguards exist, the public will have little confidence that the powers to access their communications are being used only when it is truly necessary and proportionate.‚Äù The group‚Äôs report made five policy suggestions, including the introduction of judicial approval for all requests, a revised definition of what constitutes ‚Äúcommunications data‚Äù, standardised procedures for making requests for all forces and telecoms companies, and making police forces produce ‚Äútransparency reports‚Äù about how they make requests. Communications data is defined by Big Brother Watch as ‚Äúthe who, where and when of any text, email, phone call or web search‚Äù.
A ‚Äúdesignated person‚Äù ‚Äì who must not be involved in the investigation and who must have a working knowledge of human rights legislation ‚Äì is approved to access those details. Currently, the police and security services generally require approval from a secretary of state when they want to intercept the contents of communications. Sir Anthony May, the interception of communications commissioner, reported this year that the intelligence agencies and all other authorities collectively had permission to look at communications data more than half a million times in 2014, but he dismissed claims that there was any ‚Äúsignificant institutional overuse of communications data powers‚Äù. However, he did say: ‚ÄúA proportion of the applications did not adequately deal with the question of necessity or proportionality. There were some examples where the powers had been used improperly or unnecessarily.‚Äù This included ‚Äúbreaches‚Äù in the way legally privileged material ‚Äì private conversations between lawyers and their clients ‚Äì had been handled by the various agencies. Responding to the report, a Home Office spokesman said: ‚ÄúIt is absolutely vital that our police and security services are able to obtain communications data in certain, limited circumstances, to protect the public and ensure national security. ‚ÄúThis information helps to disrupt terrorist plots, smash criminal networks and keep us safe, and it is a government priority to ensure our legislation is updated to deal with changing threats and evolving technologies.‚Äù
Ch Supt Stephen Graham, head of the West Midlands Police intelligence department, said: ‚ÄúMobile phones now play a vital role in the investigation of crimes and help to locate missing people or in cases where we have threats to life. ‚ÄúThe application to obtain these details is subject to guidance and strict codes of practice. All police forces are regularly and rigorously inspected by an independent body on the way in which we use this tactic. ‚ÄúThe information gives details of when a call was made and which phone number was called. It may also give details of the location of the people making and receiving the call but would not include what they say or what data they pass on within a communication ‚Äì including text, audio and video. ‚ÄúPeople may think that it is an extension of police powers when all it is doing is giving us the ability to do what we already do.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-31T17:14:52Z,world,World news,NYU confronts stereotypes with exhibition of racially charged art,"When the late British writer, art connoisseur and friend of the Queen, Sir Harold Acton, bequeathed his family‚Äôs Italian villa to New York University in 1994, the gift included a vast trove of art valued at hundreds of millions of pounds. But among the 6,000-piece collection were 35 works that left some of La Pietra‚Äôs new owners feeling uncomfortable. Ellyn Toscano, who has served as the director of La Pietra since 2004, recalls being taken aback the first time she was confronted by the pieces that are now known as the ‚ÄúBlackamoors‚Äù, a collection of sculptures and paintings of black figures, elegantly dressed and depicted in acts of servitude ‚Äì and are located throughout the villa‚Äôs grounds. ‚ÄúYou go to a room and there is a Blackamoor holding a lantern, lighting the way,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI had been working in the south Bronx for 20 years, and [the statues] have these strange resonance with [black] lawn jockeys,‚Äù she adds, referring to the controversial ‚Äì some say misunderstood ‚Äì lawn statues in the US that are seen as romantacising the US‚Äôs history of slavery.
Toscano says that during her first tour of La Pietra, Italian art historians viewed the works as an afterthought and not particularly controversial because they were considered as minor decorative art in comparison with the ‚Äúimportant‚Äù other works on display in the 15th-century villa. ‚ÄúBut to an American racialised consciousness, the Blackamoors are startling,‚Äù she says. Now, NYU in Florence has assembled a thematic exhibit called ReSignifications in which both established and emerging artists are presenting new work inspired by the controversial decorative art. The exhibit is part of an effort by NYU to come to terms with its own holding of the racially charged art and, Toscano says, is meant to help students studying at the campus ‚Äúconfront and understand them‚Äù.
The work on display is centred around the theme of the objectification of black bodies today ‚Äì whether in sport, stereotypes, or the anonymous images seen in the news every day of black migrants fleeing war and economic hardships in Africa for Europe via the Mediterranean. The controversial works on display in La Pietra are believed to have been collected by Acton‚Äôs parents in the 1920s and 1930s, but are from the 17th and 18th century, when bourgeoisie owners of such statues ‚Äì made by local craftsmen in Italy ‚Äì wanted their homes to emulate those of aristocratic families. ‚ÄúBlackamoors were currency. People were buying and trading them. They were in the rooms where people were having parties and socialising. These objects became synonymous with what it meant to be an upper middle-class person,‚Äù said Prof Awam Amkpa, curator of the NYU exhibit. Amkpa says the ‚Äúcontext of objectification‚Äù of black bodies is continuing, even as progress has been made to stamp out historical objectification. Whether it is images on the news of police shootings in the US against ‚Äì predominantly ‚Äì black men, the presence of African migrants in Europe, or atrocities in Africa, such as the kidnapping and raping of women by the Boko Haram in Nigeria, Amkpa says the exhibit puts today‚Äôs objectification of the black body in the context of history. Blackamoor imagery has even seen a revival in some fashion houses, including Dolce & Gabbana in their spring 2013 show. The NYU exhibit has also highlighted Italy‚Äôs own particular colonial relationship with Africa, which Toscano says is not often discussed in Italy today. Slaves were brought to Italy on Portuguese ships, Toscano says, and were used as house servants during the renaissance. ‚ÄúThere is a record of the Sassetti family ‚Äì the family that built La Pietra ‚Äì buying a slave girl. There is a chapel and a painting where all the children of the family are depicted and there is a black girl off to the side, which we assume was her,‚Äù Toscano says. Slavery in Italy was different to that in America, she says. It did not endure ‚Äì unlike the US ‚Äì and children born to black mothers and white fathers were free, taking on the status of a white person. Local factories in Florence and Venice still produce Blackamoors, which Amkpa says wealthy people still buy. But today they are also being sold in Africawhere they are purchased by wealthy people in Angola and Nigeria, he says. ‚ÄúIt is kind of stunning, but that tells you that it is not just about race but about class and aspirations of people who have come into money and want to live up to the stereotype of that wealth.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-31T16:44:36Z,world,World news,Creationist hopes his fossil find will get two plaques ‚Äì one fitting his world view,"If a Canadian museum decides to exhibit a recent fossil discovery, the man who found it, Edgar Nernberg, hopes it will be displayed with two plaques. One would contain local paleontologists‚Äô explanation, that the fossil is around 60 million years old. The other would explain Nernberg‚Äôs view that his find is from the past 6,000 years, after the world began. Nernberg is a long-time excavator, fossil collector and creationist. He believes in the biblical history of the creation of the world, not the scientifically accepted one. The Calgary Sun newspaper, to which he has sent between 30 and 40 letters on the subject, has said he is the ‚Äúgreatest promoter of creationism in Alberta‚Äù. Fossils found in Alberta are the property of the province, but in keeping with Canada‚Äôs trademark reasonableness, Nernberg said he was comfortable with his find going to scientists whose beliefs were ‚Äúdiametrically opposed‚Äù to his. ‚ÄúWe agreed to disagree but we‚Äôre amicable about it,‚Äù he said. Nernberg‚Äôs discovery ‚Äì which he called a ‚Äú10 out of 10‚Äù and the University of Calgary described as ‚Äúastounding‚Äù ‚Äì is roughly 4ft-square and includes five fossilized fish. Nernberg found it while digging a basement for a new home in the Paskapoo Formation, a roughly 60-million-year-old rock formation under Calgary. ‚ÄúThe first thing I said to myself is: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre coming home with me,‚Äô‚Äù said Nernberg. ‚ÄúThe second thing I said is: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to have to get a fishing license.‚Äô‚Äù Nernberg contacted paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky about the fossil. She said it was one of the only fish fossil finds in Calgary in the last few decades. ‚ÄúBecause complete fossils are relatively rare from this time period in Alberta, any such discoveries are significant as they shed light on the nature and diversity of animals that lived not long after the extinction of the dinosaurs,‚Äù said Zelenitsky, an assistant professor at the University of Calgary, in a statement. ‚ÄúThese fossil fish are important because they are very primitive representatives of a large group of bony fish known today.‚Äù Nernberg said he was happy his fossil was going to the Royal Tyrrell Museum, even though the museum uses scientific explanations of the world with which he fundamentally disagrees. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôd like to maintain possession of it, but then only a few people would see it,‚Äù he said. This is why the fossil will not be on display at the Big Valley Creationist Museum, which is about 70 kilometers away. Nernberg donated money to help create the museum, which includes a replica of Noah‚Äôs Ark that he built. The museum‚Äôs exhibits are designed to provide geological proof of the great flood described in the Bible and show that dinosaurs and humans lived at the same time. Nernberg believes the science museum has the best tools to prepare and maintain his fish fossil. The museum has invited him to watch the process and is making him a replica of his find. When it does go on display though, he hopes two plaques will account for the fossil‚Äôs history. ‚ÄúI would hope they would do it willingly,‚Äù he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-31T15:35:33Z,world,World news,Justice for Jos√©? Border shooting of Mexican teen raises constitutional issue,"Anger, pain and disbelief rang in the voice of Araceli Rodr√≠guez as she talked about her son‚Äôs killing by an American agent, whose 10 rounds shot through a border fence have raised questions over policing and whether the US constitution can apply to a Mexican teenager on foreign soil. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs still a part of me,‚Äù Rodr√≠guez said of her son, Jos√© Antonio Elena Rodr√≠guez, who was 16 when border patrol agent Lonnie Swartz shot him dead in October 2012. ‚ÄúEven though he‚Äôs not here he‚Äôs still my son in spirit, in soul, in thoughts, in words. My son, my son, my son.‚Äù She remembered him in terms any mother would find familiar, through his hopes and everyday joys. ‚ÄúHe liked cloudy days, chocolate cookies, spending time with his sisters,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe was a 16-year-old boy who would today be 19, full of passion for life [and] love. He wanted to be a soldier, to serve his country, to know what life is. ‚ÄúHe was a wonderful son, and they snatched that away from in a moment. It‚Äôs unforgivable.‚Äù Rodr√≠guez‚Äôs grief has turned to anger and bafflement over the delays and twists of the American justice system. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see the case to have a trial, or why there are so many questions when it‚Äôs clear that he was murdered,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not just saying that ‚Äì it‚Äôs a reality. They threw away his life.‚Äù But to the US, Jos√© Antonio‚Äôs killing raises serious and knotty questions about the role of the border patrol and the potential impunity of its agents when acting on one side of the border with effects on the other. Last year, with a federal investigation dragging on and the statute of limitations for a civil suit drawing near, Rodr√≠guez sued in federal court. She aims to bring evidence against Swartz before a judge and jury. ‚ÄúThe whole world knows what justice would be,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúTo have my son‚Äôs killers pay for what they did, that would be justice.‚Äù Agents rushed in Although the Justice Department has refused to release its video of what happened at the border on the night of 10 October 2012, Rodr√≠guez‚Äôs attorneys have pieced together events from witness accounts. Neither the government nor Swartz‚Äôs attorney have disputed this version of the facts. Jos√© Antonio was walking down a road along the border fence in Nogales, Mexico, the attorneys say, as border patrol agents and local police officers swarmed in response to a 911 call about men scrambling across the border. As those men climbed the 18ft fence back into Mexico, agents rushed in. The police report on the incident says that people began to throw rocks.
As the suspects ran past Rodr√≠guez, Swartz reached the fence, pointed his gun through a small gap between posts, and fired his weapon 12 times. He hit the teenager with 10 rounds, an autopsy showed ‚Äì eight of them in the back. Rodr√≠guez died about 30ft from the bluff on which the fence stands. The border patrol initially suggested that Rodr√≠guez was among those throwing rocks. Witnesses said the teen was only walking home from playing basketball. The federal government quickly announced it would investigate whether Swartz had used excessive force. An investigation continues and was cited in the government‚Äôs choice not to comment for this story. When Rodr√≠guez‚Äôs mother sued, the Justice Department recused itself from defending Swartz, saying he could still face criminal charges. Swartz‚Äôs attorney, Sean Chapman, also declined to comment on pending litigation. But he argued in court that although the shooting was ‚Äúhorrible and tragic‚Äù, his client could not be held liable. He urged the judge to dismiss the case outright, arguing the US constitution did not apply to foreign citizens on foreign soil, at least until the supreme court explicitly stated otherwise. Cross-border impunity ‚ÄúThe attorney is saying that the day the agent shot Jos√© Antonio he was protected, because from a constitutional perspective there was no clearly established law,‚Äù said Lu√≠s Parra, a lawyer for the Rodr√≠guez family. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre of the opinion that that‚Äôs absurd. The agent would be acting with total impunity, and we reject that. The family rejects that. They want justice. They want the Department of Homeland Security to start being transparent about what their officers are doing.‚Äù The Rodr√≠guez legal team alleges that Swartz violated both the fourth and fifth amendments of the constitution, because he shot Rodr√≠guez without justification, and say that in the right circumstances, the US constitution protects foreigners abroad.
Lee Gelernt, a senior attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union and a professor at Fordham University, argued the case in court this week. ‚ÄúThe constitution applies because the border patrol agent was on US soil,‚Äù Gelernt told the Guardian. ‚ÄúThe only thing that happened in Mexico was the bullet hitting the young man. The test the supreme court has set for determining when the constitution applies to an action across the border is a very practical test.‚Äù Gelernt asked the judge to weigh the facts of the case, and not to set a ‚Äúbright line rule‚Äù saying the constitution does not apply ‚Äúbecause Jos√© Antonio was a Mexican citizen on Mexican soil and that that‚Äôs the heart of it‚Äù. ‚ÄúA bright line rule would have enormous ramifications,‚Äù Gelernt said, before laying out Chapman‚Äôs argument. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs saying an agent can shoot on the US side but can‚Äôt be hit with constitutional liability ‚Äì even though the actions may have been criminal, even on US soil, with the gun up to the fence, and shots through the fence that killed a civilian Mexican teenager for no reason.‚Äù In the 2008 case Boumediene v Bush, the supreme court ruled that the constitution extends beyond US territory except in ‚Äúimpractical or anomalous‚Äù circumstances. Gelernt contrasted that case, which dealt with Guant√°namo Bay, and this one: ‚ÄúThis was not a military case. Jos√© Antonio was not accused of a crime, he was not sneaking over the border, and he had the right not to be arbitrarily killed.‚Äù In court, Chapman brought up a more recent case: that of a 15-year-old boy, Sergio Adrian Hern√°ndez, who was shot dead in an altercation with the border patrol in 2010. In April a federal appeals court ruled that the teen‚Äôs family could not sue because the fourth amendment could not be asserted by a Mexican citizen on Mexican soil. On the fifth amendment, the five judges of the fifth circuit ruled: ‚ÄúNo case law in 2010, when this episode occurred, reasonably warned [the agent] that his conduct violated the fifth amendment.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe may not like it, but the law is the law,‚Äù Chapman said. The ambiguity in the law may yet come before the supreme court again, however, since the losing side in the Rodr√≠guez case will likely appeal, raising the case to a higher court. Should the ninth circuit appeals court eventually rule in that the constitution applied to Rodr√≠guez, contradicting the fifth circuit ruling, the case could force the supreme court to resolve questions of impunity and the constitutional rights of non-Americans abroad. Overlooked killings Recent reports and investigations into the use of force by the border patrol have produced damning conclusions. In 2013 a Customs and Border Protection review found that between 67 reported abuses, including 19 that resulted in deaths, the border patrol showed a ‚Äúlack of diligence‚Äù and that agents often shot at suspects in cars, endangering bystanders, passengers and each other. An investigation by the Arizona Republic found that between 2005 and 2013 at least 42 people were killed by border patrol and customs officers, including 13 Americans. Officials said at the time that agents who used excessive force were disciplined, but the investigation noted that ‚Äúin none of the 42 deaths is any agent or officer publicly known to have faced consequences‚Äù. The Mexican government has lodged complaints about several of the shootings, and in January backed the Hern√°ndez family in court. Border patrol officials say their use-of-force policy mandates that agents not fire their weapons absent a ‚Äúreasonable belief‚Äù of ‚Äúimminent danger‚Äù. As in the cases of police officers accused of abuses, agents have cited this controversial grey area in the rule when explaining their actions in deadly incidents. Lu√≠s Parra drew comparisons between the federal agency and police departments, noting that with more than 21,000 agents, the border patrol amounts to one of the largest police forces in the nation, second only to the NYPD and nearly twice as large as the Chicago PD. ‚ÄúYou look at the cases out of Missouri, New York and Baltimore, and the set of facts that occurred here, and you would believe that there would be a huge uproar about Jos√© Antonio,‚Äù Parra said, referring to recent, high-profile deaths of African American men at the hands of police. ‚ÄúAnd in those cases there are at least answers, if not justice.

2015-05-31T15:20:18Z,world,World news,Facelift for little-known Paris pagoda that houses 10-metre Mir√≥ Buddha,"Hidden in a wood on the outskirts of Paris is an African pavilion-turned-pagoda that houses the largest Buddha in Europe, made in the Paris atelier of the Spanish artist Joan Mir√≥. The Grande Pagode is an eclectic cultural, religious and artistic treasure, but most of those strolling and jogging around the Lac Daumesnil in the Bois de Vincennes, do not even know it is there. Now France‚Äôs Buddhist community, which celebrated the reopening of the pagoda this weekend after a ‚Ç¨1m (¬£720,000) facelift, is hoping to attract new visitors. Unveiling the renovated listed building, Liliane Lefait, administrator of the French Buddhist Union ‚Äì an umbrella group for several Buddhist organisations set up following the waves of immigration from Vietnam and south Asia in the 1960s ‚Äì said: ‚ÄúThis place is open for everyone and anyone to visit. It‚Äôs a very calming, peaceful place. I feel calm just coming here, even without praying.‚Äù Despite it being 28 metres (92ft) high, you cannot see the pagoda for the trees. It was originally built in 1931 as the Cameroon pavilion for the international colonial exhibition and was constructed to resemble a traditional African home ‚Äì but three times the size ‚Äì using long-established materials and decorations.
When the exhibition closed, most of the buildings were torn down, but the Cameroon pavilion and neighbouring Togo building, both constructed of wood, were left standing. The pavilion briefly became the Museum of Wood, before the site was acquired by France‚Äôs International Buddhist Institute and transformed into the Grande Pagode, home to the 10-metre-high (33ft) golden buddha statue, which was created in six parts in Mir√≥‚Äôs atelier and reassembled in situ.
Lost among the foliage, the building fell slowly into disrepair over the past four decades until the Paris city authorities acquired the site and came up with the funds to renovate it. ‚ÄúThe Asian members of the Buddhist community were quite zen about it even though it really is an important place for them to meet and share occasions. But when holy people came from Asia, where they have wonderful pagodas that are well-kept and decorated, they were shocked at the state of ours,‚Äù Lefait told the Guardian. ‚ÄúNow we are absolutely delighted with it.‚Äù The pagoda is open intermittently from April to October on holiday weekends.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-31T15:08:45Z,world,World news,Stonewall chief: 'It‚Äôs a better time to be gay than it was. But not for all',"Stonewall has its offices on the 13th floor of a condemned block by Waterloo station, but its chief executive has a particular reason to be fond of the crumbling edifice that houses the LGBT rights organisation. ‚ÄúThis building used to be occupied by the Department of Education,‚Äù explains Ruth Hunt. ‚ÄúSection 28 was devised in the place that Stonewall now works out of ‚Äì there‚Äôs something satisfying about that.‚Äù Even more so with the organisation rolling out a groundbreaking anti-homophobia campaign in schools, including faith schools, funded by the DoE, nearly 30 years after the passing of the Conservatives‚Äô controversial law to prevent what they saw as the promotion of homosexuality. Almost half a million pounds will go towards training local groups to become ‚Äúeducation champions‚Äù and deliver training on LGBT equality in schools, where, says Hunt, ‚Äúwe have a very big problem‚Äù. According to Stonewall research, 75,000 young people were bullied last year for being gay; 90% of secondary school teachers have witnessed homophobic bullying in schools, but only 17% have received training to tackle it.
‚ÄúSo many young lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people have an awful time at school,‚Äù Hunt says. ‚ÄúTeachers don‚Äôt necessarily feel equipped to deal with this bullying either. It‚Äôs essential that teachers get the right training so they can stop and prevent homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying. We need to teach young people about diversity ‚Äì including different families ‚Äì so they can live, work, and socialise in 21st-century Britain.‚Äù It has been a frenetic first six months for the head of the UK‚Äôs largest LGBT-rights organisation. In that time, Stonewall has begun to represent trans people after years of dispute and resentment ‚Äì a move Hunt describes as ‚Äúa real joy‚Äù. In its dealings with the transgender community in the past, Stonewall, as she bluntly puts it, ‚Äúcocked up‚Äù. Originally, the organisation was wary of dwarfing smaller trans groups, but worked alongside Press For Change, a gender identity organisation. ‚ÄúIt was about doing what we could to empower the trans community by not doing T,‚Äù she says. But she is clear that ‚Äì whatever the original intentions ‚Äì Stonewall let the trans community down. ‚ÄúWe made a series of cockups, so it didn‚Äôt look like we were trying to support people, it looked like we were a bit crap,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe invited speakers with a transphobic history, we nominated them for awards, we made a film for secondary schools which included the word ‚Äútranny‚Äù unhelpfully [...] we were often in positions of privilege and opportunity with ministers where we could have talked about trans issues. By not doing, we were doing more harm.‚Äù Winning back that trust has been ‚Äúbloody hard‚Äù. In an initial meeting with about 50 of Stonewall‚Äôs fiercest critics, she told them the organisation was weaker for their absence. ‚ÄúIt was never about, ‚Äòdon‚Äôt worry Stonewall is here and we can help you‚Äô, it was about ‚Äòwe are all weakened by this and actually we all have something to gain‚Äô.‚Äù Hunt worked for Stonewall for nine years before becoming chief executive, taking over from Ben Summerskill, who was in the role for a decade. Since taking up the top job, she has had to rapidly develop a thick skin. She‚Äôs been criticised for being too timid ‚Äì for example for not joining a boycott of the Dorchester hotel, owned by the Sultan of Brunei, who gave approval to Brunei‚Äôs new penal code, which urges death by stoning for same-sex sexual activity. Sometimes, doing the right thing for campaigners on the ground and being seen to do the right thing by her own UK base can clash. ‚ÄúWe have now bred a generation of campaigners who think hashtag bring back our girls, hashtag boycott, is in some way contributing to that social movement internationally, but it isn‚Äôt always the most helpful way of going about things,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a constant stretch internally when I‚Äôm going, ‚Äòcome on, let‚Äôs get out there and say stuff‚Äô and our team is saying ‚Äòwell, actually that‚Äôs not helpful‚Äô.‚Äù Hunt is only 35 (‚ÄúI lack gravitas. But I‚Äôm all right with that,‚Äù she says) and, of course, she‚Äôs a woman. Does that bring its own challenges? ‚ÄúYes. But I think that it is generally a different experience for women in leadership,‚Äù she offers. ‚ÄúI get accused of running a dyke mafia ‚Äì by virtue of me being a lesbian. I have to work harder to demonstrate that I get it ‚Äì people expect me not to be as effective as I am sometimes. But we have a very traditional support base. They love Stonewall and they worked with Ben for 10 years and it is going to take time to gain their trust.‚Äù She‚Äôs also had comments on her style and hair and has been told she is ‚Äútoo designer‚Äù. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think Ben ever got such observations about his style or his glasses, his hair, and it‚Äôs new to me,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm comfortable with, or used to, and I am toughening up fast.‚Äù Hunt has also been criticised for her faith. She is a Catholic who still goes to church, but was ‚Äúnaive‚Äù enough to imagine it wouldn‚Äôt come under scrutiny. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been harder for me to come out as a Catholic than it was to come out as a lesbian ‚Äì easily,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAt least I had the backing of a community when I came out as a lesbian.‚Äù Faith can still be a real barrier to gay people being able to exercise their rights, despite historic legislation that enabled gay couples to marry last year. ‚ÄúIt is doing significant damage to people‚Äôs mental health ‚Äì we have to do something about it,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThere are also many faith leaders who are gay and many faith leaders who are distressed by the constant exclusion of LGBT people from their communities and parishes.‚Äù As for the pope, Hunt says he needs to decide on his message and exactly what he wants to achieve. ‚ÄúI think he oscillates wildly between different positions,‚Äù she says ‚Äì though she is realistic about the chances of her getting his attention. ‚ÄúI think there is more Stonewall can do, but then I don‚Äôt think Pope Francis is going to be tweeting me directly anytime soon for top tips on how to run the Vatican,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúStill ... we‚Äôre happy to help them set up their LGBT network as soon as they say the word.‚Äù With the passing of major legislative landmarks in the UK ‚Äì the gay marriage bill, equal parenting rights, rights in the workplace ‚Äì one of the major challenges facing Stonewall today is not the establishment, but apathy. ‚ÄúWe are a movement that has been motivated by individual interest in our own rights and we have a challenge now to shift to a place where we are interested in other people‚Äôs rights ‚Äì and that‚Äôs hard,‚Äù she says. Although one of Stonewall‚Äôs aim should be ‚Äúto stop functioning one day‚Äù, Hunt thinks there is still much to fight for. Hate crimes against LGBT people remain stubbornly high ‚Äì one in six LGBT people have experienced a hate crime but three quarters did not report to police, according to Stonewall research. ‚ÄúReporting rates are still as low as ever, conviction rate is still as low as ever ‚Äì it‚Äôs the one area where we have made no impact.‚Äù Hate is a long way from being obliterated, she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a better time to be gay than it was. But only for some, not for all,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThere is still so much going on that we don‚Äôt know the half of, so we‚Äôre not stopping yet by any means, even if it doesn‚Äôt lend itself to the side of a bus like it once did.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-31T14:22:38Z,world,World news,Schools reopen in earthquake-devastated Nepal,"Hundreds of thousands of Nepalese children have returned to school in Nepal for the first time since two earthquakes last month killed more than 8,700 people and injured 23,000. Schools have been shut in the poverty-stricken south Asian state since the tremors, which left thousands of classrooms badly damaged. At the Adarsha Saula Yubak Higher secondary school in the small village of Khokana, about 10 miles south of Kathmandu, red stickers indicated the cracked buildings were unsafe. As children filed into wooden huts constructed in the school grounds by parents and volunteers, the school‚Äôs principal, Saroj Bhakta Acharya, addressed the students, telling them not to be afraid. ‚ÄúWe will resume our school in this bamboo made hut so do not worry about the earthquake,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe will spend a week, playing and talking about good things.‚Äù
Acharya told students that school uniform was not compulsory for those who had lost their possessions and called for a minute‚Äôs silence for student Rupa Maharjan, 15, who was killed in the earthquake. Of the school‚Äôs 1,300 students, only half were present. ‚ÄúWe can understand their mood,‚Äù said Acharya. ‚ÄúOut of our 56 teachers, 16 of them have lost their houses completely and are still living outside.‚Äù Though aid agencies and local authorities have tried to find alternatives, almost a million children across Nepal are still without classrooms. Hari Prasad Aryal, the district education officer of Gorkha district, the epicentre of the 25 April quake, said almost 80% of the area‚Äôs schools resumed classes on Sunday though few students attended. Almost all the schools in the district had been severely damaged. ‚ÄúIn those areas where people are living away from their villages in camps, we have asked school administrations to run temporary schools at the area where people have been staying,‚Äù he said. The task of rebuilding tens of thousands of schools is a huge burden for Nepal. Officials have said total reconstruction costs for the country will be $7bn (¬£4.6bn), a third of the annual GDP. Some estimates are as high as $20bn. Millions have been left homeless. In Dolakha district, which was badly hit in the second earthquake, about half of the 450 schools reopened on Sunday, with around half their students attending on average, said the district education chief, Lok Bahadur Lopchan. ‚ÄúWe are running schools from a temporary shelters,‚Äù Lopchan said. ‚ÄúWe are hoping more students will come to school in coming days.‚Äù In Khokana, parents described children who were still frightened of being inside. Gita Shahi, 35, said her seven-year-old daughter was afraid. ‚ÄúWe are still living in the field under the tarpaulins, ‚Äù she said. However, Sabina Shahi, 11, said she was pleased to see her friends again. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better to be in the school though I am scared of another earthquake,‚Äù she said. Unicef has warned the disaster could reverse the progress Nepal has made in education over the last 25 years, during which primary school enrolment has risen from 64% to more than 95%. ‚ÄúThe longer children stay home, the more difficult it will be for them to return to school,‚Äù Tomoo Hozumi, Unicef‚Äôs Nepal representative, told AFP. Chhori Laxmi Maharjan, a clinical psychologist at the Ankur counselling centre, Kathmandu, said going to school would help children. ‚ÄúWhat they were doing before the earthquake was going to school, playing with friends and having a certain routine,‚Äù Maharjan said. ‚ÄúThis will help them them heal.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-31T13:41:27Z,world,World news,Canadian law professors challenge 'colonial' law on royal succession,"A law enacted in Canada to ensure the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge‚Äôs first-born child could become head of state regardless of gender was unconstitutional and smacked of colonialism, a Canadian court will hear. Almost two years after the birth of Prince George, two law professors from Quebec‚Äôs Laval university are to challenge a law enacted to ensure that, had the duchess given birth to daughter, the child could become Queen. The case, which starts on Monday in a court in Quebec, will examine the constitutional history of Canada and its legal relationship with the UK. Genevi√®ve Motard and Patrick Taillon, both professors of constitutional law, will argue that, although the British monarch is Canada‚Äôs head of state, the UK is a foreign country, and the Canadian parliament merely ‚Äúassented‚Äù to the changes made by the British parliament and did not properly amend Canadian law. ‚ÄúThe position seems to be that, still, British law applies automatically in Canada, which we consider to be a colonial position, and it‚Äôs a throwback to ancient times,‚Äù said Andr√© Binette, one of the legal team representing Motard and Taillon. The case stems from 2011, when the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were newly married and expected to start a family. The 15 member countries of the Commonwealth where the Queen is head of state hastily agreed to modernise succession laws. The changes allowed a first-born child, regardless of gender, to succeed to the throne and for a sovereign to marry a Catholic. Those 15 countries then introduced laws to reflect the changes and, in 2013, the Canadian parliament adopted an act ‚Äúassenting‚Äù to the alteration of the British royal succession. But, the professors will claim, it did so without consulting with the 10 provinces that make up Canada. The plaintiffs are not arguing whether an older daughter should have precedence over her younger brother in the line of succession. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not really about the content of the legal change. Of course, everybody agrees with gender equality,‚Äù Binette said. Rather, the object of the case was to determine to what extent the federal parliament could amend the constitution without the participation of the provinces, he said. Motard and Taillon, supported by the Quebec government, and Canadian Royal Heritage Trust, a monarchist organisation, contend that, because Canada is a sovereign state with its own constitution, its parliament must alter Canadian law to implement the royal succession reform. They will argue there is a Canadian law regarding succession, which determines who can become Canada‚Äôs head of state. In 1931, the statute of Westminster gave legal recognition to an independent Canada, but the British parliament had retained, at Canada‚Äôs request, the power to alter royal succession law. In 1982, however, the Canada Act severed any residual jurisdiction that the British parliament had over Canadian law, including Canadian royal succession, the plaintiffs will claim. ‚ÄúWhile Australia, New Zealand and the other Commonwealth members involved have made changes in their own laws in parallel to the British law, Canada has chosen simply to assent to the British law,‚Äù Binette said. ‚ÄúWe believe that the 1982 Canada Act has severed all remaining legal ties with the UK and that includes the monarchy.‚Äù The hearing, before Justice Claude Bouchard, of the superior court of Quebec, is expected to last 10 days. If the case succeeds, it could take three years for Canada to obtain the consent of all 10 provinces to enable it to change its royal succession law. ‚ÄúBut now there is no urgency because Princess Catherine had a boy,‚Äù Binette said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-31T13:01:52Z,world,World news,Yanis Varoufakis dismisses rumours he intends to resign as 'grossly premature',"Greece‚Äôs finance minister has denied he is on the brink of resigning, as his country prepares to enter a crucial month that could determine its future in the eurozone. Yanis Varoufakis rebuffed speculation that he could soon throw in the towel, less than five months after the leftwing Syriza party was voted in. Such talk is ‚Äúgrossly premature‚Äù, tweeted the economics professor-turned -politician.
He channelled the spirit of John Maynard Keynes, telling a follower ‚Äúin the long run we are all dead‚Äù ‚Äì but that in the medium term he is going nowhere.
Varoufakis‚Äôs position has looked less secure since the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, shaped his Brussels negotiating team, seemingly sidelining his finance minister. The finance ministry was also embroiled in a row after selecting economist Elena Panaritis to be Greece‚Äôs new representative at the International Monetary Fund. Some Syriza MPs had criticised the choice of Panaritis, who is a former MP for the leftwing Pasok party, which agreed Greece‚Äôs first bailout. Officials from Greece have been locked in talks with creditors over the weekend in an attempt to agree a package of economic reforms. Outstanding issues include pensions, labour market reform, VAT rates and Greece‚Äôs budget targets. Athens had hoped to reach a deal by Sunday, but insiders were suggesting a breakthrough could come within the next 48 hours. Jos√© Manuel Barroso, the former European commission president, warned on Sunday that it was vital to find a solution quickly. He told the BBC‚Äôs Andrew Marr show: ‚ÄúSometimes I get the impression that people are waiting for an accident so that they can really focus [on] avoiding a bigger disaster. It‚Äôs too long, this time that has been taken to find a solution. I believe it‚Äôs important now to find that solution.‚Äù The consequences of a Greek default, or its exit from the eurozone, would be negative for both Greece and Europe, Barroso added. Greece‚Äôs final tranche of bailout funds will remain frozen until agreement is reached, leaving it perilously short of money to pay a series of financial demands in June. Tsipras was understood to be planning a telephone call with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and French president, Fran√ßois Hollande, in the next couple of days. He is pushing for a political intervention to break the deadlock. Greece is scheduled to pay back ‚Ç¨1.6bn (¬£1.2bn) to the IMF in June, starting with a ‚Ç¨305m (¬£219m) payment on Friday, and analysts fear it will struggle to find the money. The possibility of Greece defaulting on its obligations to the IMF is causing ripples in the financial markets. Shares fell on Friday as the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch√§uble, warned that the positive comments from Athens officials were ‚Äúnot fully reflected‚Äù in the talks with its creditors. Greece could hold all of its June IMF payments until the end of the month, which is also the date when its current bailout programme with the eurozone expires. It then faces making two repayments to the European Central Bank over the summer, totalling ‚Ç¨6.7bn (¬£4.8bn), which could be particularly challenging. ‚ÄúWe believe meeting the ‚Ç¨1.6bn in payments to the IMF by the end of June will be difficult. Payments of ‚Ç¨3.5bn on bonds held by the ECB on 20 July appear even more unlikely,‚Äù said Michael Gapen, an economist at Barclays.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-31T10:16:02Z,world,World news,"Russian entry ban on politicians shows EU sanctions are working, says Rifkind","Russia‚Äôs entry ban on 89 European politicians and military leaders shows sanctions against the country are working, Sir Malcolm Rifkind has said. The former foreign secretary and former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg are among the list of figures barred from entering the country. ‚ÄúIt shows we are making an impact because they wouldn‚Äôt have reacted unless they felt very sore at what had happened,‚Äù Rifkind told BBC Radio 5 Live. ‚ÄúOnce sanctions were extended, it‚Äôs had a major impact on the Russian economy. ‚ÄúThis has happened at a time when the oil price has collapsed and therefore a main source of revenue for Mr Putin has disappeared. That‚Äôs pretty important when it comes to his attempts to build up his military might and to force his neighbours to do what they‚Äôre told. ‚ÄúIf there had to be such a ban, I am rather proud to be on it ‚Äì I‚Äôd be rather miffed if I wasn‚Äôt,‚Äù he added. Rifkind‚Äôs comments came as the European Union responded with anger to Russia‚Äôs ban on politicians, calling it ‚Äútotally arbitrary and unjustified‚Äù. It said no explanation had been provided for the list, which was shared this week after several requests by diplomats for transparency. ‚ÄúThe list with 89 names has now been shared by the Russian authorities. We don‚Äôt have any other information on legal basis, criteria and process of this decision,‚Äù an EU spokesman said on Saturday. ‚ÄúWe consider this measure as totally arbitrary and unjustified, especially in the absence of any further clarification.‚Äù Many of the figures reportedly included on the list have previously spoken out against the Kremlin. Clegg urged his Liberal Democrat ministers to avoid attending last year‚Äôs Winter Olympics in Sochi because of Russia‚Äôs anti-gay laws. He also argued that the country should lose the right to host the 2018 World Cup after Russian troops allegedly downed the civilian airliner Flight MH17 in eastern Ukraine last July. Others reportedly barred include the general secretary of the EU council, Uwe Corsepius, the former EU enlargement chief, Stefan F√ºle, as well as British intelligence and military chiefs, including the MI5 director general, Andrew Parker, former MI6 chief Sir John Sawers and the chief of the defence staff, Gen Sir Nicholas Houghton. ‚ÄúI understand that they would like the sanctions removed; I want them removed and want to see good relations with Russia,‚Äù Rifkind said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very important that Russia, Britain and western Europe as a whole work amicably together, but we can‚Äôt ignore the fact that for the first time since the end of the second world war, part of the borders of a European territory has been violated by a military attack, and that is unacceptable.‚Äù Russia invaded Hungary and Czechoslovakia during uprisings in 1956 and 1968 respectively. A Russian foreign ministry official confirmed that the ban was a result of EU sanctions against Russia. ‚ÄúAn answer to some European countries demanding to explain why these names have been put on the lists of persons banned from entering Russia is quite simple ‚Äì this was done as a response to a sanctions campaign unleashed against Russia by some Germany-led countries of the European Union,‚Äù the unnamed official told Russian news agency Tass. The official said Russia had previously recommended that envoys of countries that have imposed sanctions on Russia should apply to Russian consular offices before their trips to check whether they are barred from entering the country. ‚ÄúHowever, our partners preferred not to do so and asked to notify them through diplomatic channels,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust one thing remains unclear: did our European co-workers want these lists to minimise inconveniences for potential ‚Äòdenied persons‚Äô or to stage a political show?‚Äù The UK foreign office said Russia‚Äôs action would not cause the EU to change its position on sanctions. ‚ÄúThe way for Russia to get the sanctions lifted is to remove its troops from Ukraine and comply with its obligations under the Minsk agreements,‚Äù a spokesperson said. ‚ÄúThe EU and member states are urgently seeking more transparency from the Russian authorities for this move.‚Äù The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said on Friday the Netherlands would not abide by the ban as it was ‚Äúnot based on international law, was not transparent and could not be challenged in a court of law‚Äù. The German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said the list would hamper peace efforts. ‚ÄúAt a time in which we are trying to defuse a persistent and dangerous conflict, this does not contribute towards that,‚Äù he said.
Swedish MEP Anna Maria Corazza Bildt, who was among the list of barred names, tweeted: ‚ÄúBeing on this list does not change my commitment to the people of Ukraine,‚Äù while the former Czech foreign minister Karel Schwarzenberg welcomed his inclusion, stating: ‚ÄúWhen I saw the other names, I found out I was in a very decent club. I consider this a reward.‚Äù Sanctions were imposed on Russia after the country annexed Ukraine‚Äôs Crimea region in March 2014. More than 6,200 people have been killed in fighting between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian separatists. But Russia has repeatedly dismissed accusations from Ukraine, Nato and western powers that it is supporting the separatists with arms and troops. This article was amended on 1 June 2015. Rifkind said Russia‚Äôs role in the Ukraine crisis was the first time since the end of the second world war that the borders of a European territory had been violated by a military attack. In fact, Russian troops entered Hungary and Czechoslovakia during uprisings in 1956 and 1968 respectively.

2015-05-31T08:00:07Z,world,World news,"Whether Greece does a deal or defaults, the prospects seem equally grim","As Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and his finance minister Yanis Varoufakis have discovered the hard way, international financial deal-making is a world away from the thrill of a barnstorming election campaign. But with Varoufakis sidelined after a series of less-than-helpful public interventions, Tsipras and his colleagues appear to be in the final stages of agreeing a deal with the country‚Äôs eurozone creditors and the International Monetary Fund ‚Äì renamed the ‚ÄúBrussels Group‚Äù to assuage the Greek public‚Äôs hatred of the ‚Äútroika‚Äù. Every day last week saw a fog of claims and counterclaims about how much progress was being made by officials in Brussels and their political bosses, who discussed the issue on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Dresden. But there is at last a feeling that both sides are making progress. If Tsipras pulls off a deal and skirts default, it will be a political and personal triumph, in the face of extraordinary odds. And if he can persuade Greek voters to back him in the messy compromises he will inevitably have to make to win over the lenders ‚Äì especially the IMF, which is reportedly taking a particularly tough line ‚Äì it will be close to miraculous. As Gabriel Sterne of Oxford Economics pointed out last week, while two-thirds of the Greek public believe Syriza should be willing to compromise, almost 60% thought that should not include pension reform ‚Äì likely to be a red line for creditors. Sterne believes there is now almost a 50/50 chance that the country could be forced out of the single currency.
The sad truth for the Greek people is that none of the roads ahead of them looks anything but grindingly hard. This is a country where GDP collapsed by a quarter in the aftermath of the crisis; where unemployment remains above 25%; and where average wages fell by almost 18% in real terms between 2008 and 2013. The latest reports suggest that Angela Merkel and Fran√ßois Hollande will discuss the issue with European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday. But with every day of fruitless talks that passes, bank deposits drain out of Greece as nervous savers squirrel their money abroad, investors postpone spending plans and holidaymakers opt for Ibiza instead of Crete, for fear of being caught out by a summer Greccident. Bank deposits have hit a 10-year low, according to the latest data. And the political turmoil has strangled the tentative economic recovery that got under way last year. Separate figures released last week confirmed that Greece has slipped back into recession. If a deal is done, the country is likely to face another bout of painful structural reforms and stringent spending cuts, to satisfy the Brussels Group that it‚Äôs not throwing good money after bad ‚Äì and there appears little hope that the debt forgiveness Tsipras and Varoufakis once so stirringly advocated will be part of the package. That means Greece will still face hefty repayments, and the scrutiny of its paymasters, for years to come. And if no deal is forthcoming by the 30 June deadline both sides appear to have set (though Athens must cobble together the money for several debt repayments before then), then Greece faces the risky and uncertain prospect of defaulting on its debts and crashing out of the euro. Euro-exit would at least come with the benefits of a drastic devaluation in the currency ‚Äì a New Drachma, perhaps. Hordes of holidaymakers would presumably follow, keen to take advantage of the cut-price ouzo, and over time Greece might be able to attract inward investment as a cheap location for manufacturing for the European market. But in the short-term, Grexit would mean capital controls, financial market chaos, and soaring inflation. The Greek people have already endured extraordinary hardship. But as another debt deadline looms, it‚Äôs hard to foresee an outcome that will bring anything but more tough times ahead. Amazon tax battle goes on There has been outrage that Amazon, by routing transactions through a Luxembourg-based company called Amazon EU Sarl, has diverted sales worth billions of pounds and euros out of major markets such as Germany, France and the UK ‚Äî thus ensuring that resulting profits are beyond the reach of tax authorities in those countries. Last week, in the face of a tax crackdown by George Osborne ‚Äì and probable similar moves across Europe ‚Äì it emerged that Amazon has caved in. It has begun opening Amazon EU Sarl branches in all its major European markets, and sales are now flowing through these branches, where any profits will be taxed. It is an important victory. But make no mistake: Amazon has not given up the fight. There are fierce battles to come before the retailer pays much corporation tax in Europe. Round two has already begun. This second struggle concerns the tax affairs of Amazon EU Sarl itself. Given that this is where most of Amazon‚Äôs European revenues are pooled, you might expect it to have large taxable profits. You would be wrong. Amazon EU Sarl ‚Äì which has little in the way of conventional running costs ‚Äî has paid little or no tax for much of its life. The reason for this lies with the royalties Amazon EU Sarl pays to a controversial partnership called Amazon Europe Holding Technologies SCS, which are tax deductible. AEHT is also based in Luxembourg, but has its partners back in the US. Thanks to a Luxembourg tax ruling, these royalties wash straight through AEHT, untaxed. In the US these payments go untaxed again, lost in a mismatch of tax rules between America and Luxembourg. The European commission is fighting to unravel this tax arrangement, but Amazon will resist fiercely. Without a breakthrough on this second front, the first victory ‚Äì getting Amazon to recognise UK transactions in a taxable UK entity ‚Äì is hollow. Those boycotting the company over its tax affairs should be under no illusion: the battle is not won. Master of universe out of touch with real world Dick Fuld ‚Äì the man once known on Wall Street as ‚Äúthe gorilla‚Äù ‚Äì has had more than six years to ponder what went wrong at Lehman Brothers, the once-mighty American investment bank that he used to run. So when he made his first public remarks since the 2008 crisis last week, his audience was eager to hear the fruits of his reflections. His answer? An unforeseeable perfect storm of forces swept away the Wall Street institution. But, ultimately, the fault could be traced back to politicians in Washington, for promoting the ‚ÄúAmerican dream‚Äù of home ownership for low earners, leaving them exposed when interest rates rose. The gorilla himself, evidently, was entirely innocent. Fuld may be an extreme example of the dangerous beasts that once roamed the financial jungle. But his unrepentant performance was a stark reminder of the gulf that still remains between Wall Street and the real world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-31T07:30:06Z,world,World news,Anna Erelle: ‚ÄòIn front of me was this man who had killed women and children‚Äô,"Anna Erelle is the pseudonym of a French journalist who spent a month undercover investigating the secretive world of jihadi brides for a Paris magazine. Last year, she created a fake Facebook profile under the name of M√©lodie, a 20-year-old recent convert to Islam. During the course of her investigations, she made contact with Abou Bilel, a notorious Islamic State fighter, who asked her to travel to Syria to be his wife. Her subsequent article led to Isis issuing a fatwa against her. Today, she lives under police protection and cannot reveal her true identity. Her book, In the Skin of a Jihadist, is published next month. One of the things that surprised me about Abou Bilel is that he used emoticons in his interactions with you‚Ä¶ Like a teenager! But he was twice the age of M√©lodie and he was talking like he was as young as she was. Was it stressful leading a double life? At the time, everything moved so quickly I didn‚Äôt have time to think about me. I had always to think about M√©lodie and her next step, the next lie‚Ä¶ Since the book, I realised maybe I was more affected than I thought. It‚Äôs like the aftermath of an earthquake. Did you ever feel guilty about lying? No. For a few minutes at the beginning, maybe, just before taking on the identity of M√©lodie. At first, I felt I was a journalist, I didn‚Äôt want to lie about my job, but then in front of me was this killer who had killed women and children and so many people. A few months after, when I heard that he had died [there are conflicting reports about whether Abou Bilel is alive or dead], I thought for a few minutes ‚Äì and they were long, hard minutes ‚Äì whether it was my fault he died because he‚Äôd told me too much and the organisation had killed him for that. I cried, actually, because I don‚Äôt want to be involved in the death of anybody, even the worst person in the world. Was there anything you liked about Abou Bilel the more you got to know him? Nothing. I think I always try to find a little bit of good in a person, I look for it. But I tried to search for it in him for one month and I didn‚Äôt find it. He is someone without humanity. What is the attraction for young women who fly out to Syria and Iraq to join Isis forces? Multiple reasons. First, these are girls who are maybe too naive. They really think they will help the population, so they go for that. But now, for one year or so, we have seen a lot of girls going to Syria or Iraq because they think they will make a good marriage and become somebody very important when they are married to a powerful man. The scary stuff is that the girls are now as drunk on power as the men. I was thinking about the three girls in your country [Kadiza Sultana, Shamima Begum and Amira Abase, who flew to Syria from east London in February] who went and it was so sad because they went to join one of their best friends [Sharmeena Begum] and I thought: ‚ÄúMy God. They saw how this girl‚Äôs family had been destroyed and they still went.‚Äù And they went, smiling like nothing was wrong! Do you think part of the allure is that they believe they will become famous? Probably yes, for some of them. For some, it‚Äôs not a game, it‚Äôs a goal ‚Äì they want to help. For others, it‚Äôs a little bit‚Ä¶ not fashion‚Ä¶ but yeah, all these people want a little bit of success, they want to be famous. They want to put their name in the story of Isis so when they arrive, they are happy to go on Twitter to show how powerful they are. Do you think the rise of social networking has helped Isis? Yes, but it‚Äôs not just social networking, it‚Äôs the way they use it. They are very intelligent in the way they communicate. Before, terrorism was not like this ‚Äì it was secret and insidious. But then they went on Twitter and Facebook and said: ‚ÄúYes, we are murderers. You can be like us. Do you want to come?‚Äù And lots of people said yes! It appeals to a generation that feels lost, doesn‚Äôt see any future. They think in Syria, everything is possible. When have you been most scared throughout this process? The day I discovered there was a fatwa against me on the internet. I wasn‚Äôt scared of Abou Bilel but the first time I Skyped him and saw him in a car with high technology [the back of his car contained a bulletproof vest and an Uzi submachine gun], it was really intense. Do you have any regrets? No. Not a single thing because I did my job. I don‚Äôt know if I did it well, but I did it with a lot of precautions. Today, I don‚Äôt regret it because I learned a lot about Isis and I learned a lot about me too: where are the lines, the boundaries, which I will not cross. Since the Charlie Hebdo atrocity, you‚Äôve been under police protection. What has that been like? To begin with, I had police at my place and every time I went for a meeting, they would come with me. Now I‚Äôm just under surveillance. I‚Äôm not afraid of yesterday. I‚Äôm not afraid today. But I‚Äôm very concerned about the future. In the way of thinking of these people, they never let go. When they call for revenge, they actually want to do it and they will try to do it even if they have to die to achieve it. I‚Äôm scared for the future because at the moment there‚Äôs lots of publicity around the book and so now I have the cops and many people around me but when that dies down in a few weeks, I will be anonymous and it will be easier for them. Is it true that the police made you give up your dog for your own safety? Yeah, but only for two months. It‚Äôs funny actually because I have a really big dog with a face like a teddy bear and the cops said: ‚ÄúYou can recognise her really easily on the streets.‚Äù It was the period of Charlie Hebdo and everyone was really paranoid. Two months after, I phoned the police and said ‚ÄúPlease can I have my dog back? I miss her so much!‚Äù and they said OK. What advice would you give to a teenage girl thinking of flying out to join Isis? If she wants to help people, she can help people here instead. She can be useful around her neighbourhood. To the teenagers who want to go for marriage, I would say: ‚ÄúOK, go but you will never come back. Your child will never know your parents or your family and never see where you grew up. It‚Äôs hell and when you enter hell, you can never get out.‚Äù Do you feel lonely? Sometimes, yes. For me, there is a before and after this story because my life changed, not only with the cops and security but also because many people came into my life and many others left it because they were worried about being seen with me. I‚Äôve grown up a lot. In the Skin of a Jihadist is published by HarperCollins (¬£12.99).

2015-05-31T00:45:31Z,world,World news,'No Diet Coke for you': Islamophobia claim prompts United Airlines boycott,"What happens when you ask for an unopened can of Diet Coke on an airplane? If you‚Äôre a Muslim woman, according to one report, you don‚Äôt get served. And the man sitting next to you gets an unopened can of beer just fine. Tahera Ahmad, a Muslim chaplain at Chicago‚Äôs Northwestern University, documented these allegations from onboard a United Airlines flight this weekend in an episode that almost immediately went viral ‚Äì and led to pledges to boycott the airline. On her Facebook page, Ahmad claimed a flight attendant was ‚Äúclearly discriminating against me‚Äù after she asked for an unopened of soda for hygiene reasons and says was told, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm sorry. I just can‚Äôt give you an unopened can, so no Diet Coke for you.‚Äù
When the man next to her allegedly got an unopened beer can from the in-flight service, Ahmad said she was told something even more inflammatory: ‚ÄúWe are unauthorized to give unopened cans to people, because they may use it as a WEAPON on the plane.‚Äù Ahmad said her fellow passengers were of no help: ‚Äúyou Moslem, you need to shut the F** up,‚Äù Ahmad said, in the Facebook post, that she was told by another male passenger across the aisle. ‚Äú[y]es you know you would use it as a WEAPON, so shut the F** up.‚Äù Ahmad did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but Muslim activists took to social media to call the alleged incident an ‚Äúinexcusable‚Äù act of bigotry as other social media users said they would boycott United Airlines based on what they interpreted as open discrimination.
United Airlines spokesman Charles Hobart told the Guardian that the airline was attempting to contact Ahmad in order to ‚Äúget a better understanding of what occurred during the flight‚Äù. Hobart also said United was discussing the alleged incident with Shuttle America, United‚Äôs regional partner that operated the flight. Republic Airways, which owns Shuttle America, did not respond to a request for comment on its beverage policy. Federal Aviation Administration policy forbids carrying on unopened alcoholic beverages but does not appear to have a specific ‚Äúunopened can‚Äù regulation. Ahmad told the Chicago Sun-Times that she received an apology from the flight attendant on behalf of herself and the other passenger, saying that the United employee had ‚Äúacknowledged it was unethical and said he never should have said anything‚Äù. The story of Islamophobia at 30,000 feet went viral just hours after an anti-Islam protest in Phoenix drew global attention following a lethal incident in Texas earlier this month.

2015-05-30T23:01:08Z,world,World news,The heat and the death toll are rising in India. Is this a glimpse of Earth‚Äôs future?,"Roads have twisted in the heat. Hospitals are overwhelmed by thousands of dehydrated people, the poor, the elderly and children among the worst hit. Urgent instructions to wear wide-brimmed hats and light-coloured cotton clothes, use umbrellas and drink lots of fluid have been issued by the government. India is struggling to cope with one of the deadliest heatwaves to hit the subcontinent. And its attempt to do so is raising a question for the whole planet ‚Äì how can humans cope with the kinds of temperatures that scientists fear may become ever more common? In only 10 days, the death toll is reported to have reached around 1,800, a 20-year high. The brunt of the burden has fallen on the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, where 1,300 people have died, the highest loss of life due to heat the state has known, according to officials. By comparison, 447 people in the state died from the heat last year. The blistering temperatures may, mercifully, be about to break, as there are signs that the longed-for monsoon may be arriving in the form of showers and thunderstorms in the south. But as temperatures neared 50C in recent weeks, leave for doctors has been cancelled and the government has issued warnings for people to stay indoors and stay hydrated. For many, though, that isn‚Äôt an option. The greatest loss of life has been among the elderly and the poor, in particular day labourers who have little alternative but to risk their lives in the heat for fear of losing their livelihoods.
‚ÄúPeople are dying and suffering, and I think it shows us the vulnerability that exists even in an area that is used to very hot weather,‚Äù said Peter Stott at the Met Office in Exeter. ‚ÄúIt can still have a major impact.‚Äù It is hard to say for sure whether any single extreme weather event is a result of manmade climate change, but this is a scenario we should get used to seeing more of, scientists say. As the effects of climate change take hold and global temperatures creep up, extreme heat events will become more common. ‚ÄúRecent research shows that heatwaves are currently five times more frequent than they would be in the absence of human-caused warming, and the chance of any particular heatwave being caused by climate change is 80%,‚Äù a spokesperson for Greenpeace said, adding that unless efforts are made to cut carbon emissions, heatwaves are forecast to be 12 times more likely by 2040. These trends will push the capabilities of the human body beyond the limits of the cooling systems it has evolved and raise serious questions about the future of food production and farming. Globally, more than half of all working hours outside the home are spent outdoors, mainly in agriculture. As the heatwave in India shows, those who have to work outside in hot conditions are at the greatest risk of heat exhaustion and heatstroke. There are reports that construction workers in the Indian city of Gurgaon had no choice but to continue working all last week in temperatures higher than 43C, in order to earn their wage of 200 rupees a day (about ¬£2). ‚ÄúIf everybody had the same lifestyle as Europeans and Americans, it wouldn‚Äôt be so much of an issue, but most of the food that is generated and grown in south-east Asia, Latin America and parts of Africa comes from small landholders,‚Äù said Mark Maslin, professor of climatology at University College London (UCL). ‚ÄúIn the south of the US people in air-conditioned tractors are farming vast areas in an industrial way, but most of the world works on smallholders producing enough food to feed themselves and enough surplus to provide food for the local towns and cities.‚Äù This problem is exacerbated by the fact that humidity in the areas most affected by climate change poses an insurmountable challenge to the way the human body deals with heat. ‚ÄúHumans can survive for short periods in environments hot enough to cook a steak, as long as the air is dry,‚Äù said Matthew Huber of the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of New Hampshire, who has studied the extent to which humans might adapt to heat stress as a result of global warming. Those same temperatures in more humid climates would kill us. ‚ÄúHumans have a vast and nearly unique capacity to cool themselves by sweating ‚Äì but this only works when the air is relatively dry,‚Äù he added. In very dry conditions, people can work outside in temperatures of up to 40C. But the safety cutoff drops below 30C when you have very high humidity. To calculate the limits in which it is safe for people to work in extreme heat, scientists rely on a measure of temperature that takes into account both the heat and the humidity. This is known as the wet-bulb globe temperature. At wet-bulb temperatures higher than 35C, human skin can no longer itself cool down through evaporation. The US military suspends training and physical exercise when this temperature exceeds 32C. Peak wet-bulb temperatures measured in the heatwave in India are around 30-31C. ‚ÄúWhile this value is less than the 35C threshold, that threshold is the value for a healthy, fully hydrated person in the shade who is not engaged in labour,‚Äù said Huber, explaining why the heatwave in India has been so lethal. ‚ÄúOn the other hand, for poor workers in India, not working can also carry serious consequences.‚Äù
In recent years, several groups have used this measure to make predictions about what rising temperatures will mean for workers worldwide, and to paint a picture of what global productivity will look like as average temperatures creep up. A recent study published in Nature Climate Change estimates that heat stress has already reduced global labour to 90% of capacity during the hottest months of the year. Under the most dire climate change projections, this could fall as low as 40% by 2200. The regions predicted to be worst affected include India, northern Australia and the south-east of the US. But countries that cannot afford technological adaptations such as air conditioning will be affected the most. ‚ÄúAs climate change starts to bite and these heatwaves come, people in poor countries are very vulnerable because they don‚Äôt have another source of income,‚Äù said Maslin. ‚ÄúSo if their crops fail and they are not able to work outside, they don‚Äôt have the money to buy food so they starve.‚Äù The effects of crop failure are also likely to have global repercussions in terms of food security. In 2009, Maslin was involved in a report published by UCL and medical journal The Lancet on how to manage the health effects of climate change. It said that the biggest threat from climate change was to food and water security. ‚ÄúYou have a double whammy: your populations are increasing and the heatwaves are increasing. So the amount of food you can produce is going to decrease and there you have a major crisis,‚Äù Maslin said. He pointed to a Russian heatwave in 2010 that affected global wheat prices. Although numbers are hard to pin down, it is forecast that many people will be forced to leave their homes, making climate migration an international issue. About 17 million people were displaced by natural hazards in 2009, and 42 million in 2010, according to a British government report. People who work outside, in extreme cases of climate change, may become seasonal migrant workers, Huber said. In the short term, policies that could help include instituting international work standards for heat conditions, or even switching to night-time working to reduce exposure. ‚ÄúI predict that access to air conditioning ‚Äì or an equivalent technology ‚Äì will become a fundamental right enshrined in international law,‚Äù Huber said. Nevertheless, such technological solutions come with their own problems. Relying on air conditioning for survival means that power cuts ‚Äì which are common during heatwaves ‚Äì would become life threatening. Much better, scientists say, would be to reduce global warming. The next Lancet commission, a follow-up to the 2009 report, is due next month. ‚ÄúIt focuses on cutting emissions and why this is so important for global health,‚Äù Maslin said.‚ÄúThe reason is that, as far as economists can see, there is no way of ensuring those people have enough money to be protected from the problem of not being able to grow food.‚Äù Stott agreed. Bleak as the picture is, he said: ‚ÄúThe key thing is where emissions go. When we think about the future, it‚Äôs a very different world depending on what happens to carbon emissions ‚Äì and there‚Äôs still plenty of opportunity to avoid those worst effects. The next few years are crucial. It‚Äôs all to play for.‚Äù HOW THE BODY REACTS TO HEAT Cooling The body works hard to keep its core temperature at around 37C. As it heats up, blood vessels expand, sending blood to the surface of the skin to cool it down. Sweating increases in an attempt to cool the surface of the skin through evaporation, though high humidity can make this impossible. Heat exhaustion After several days of heat exposure, the body‚Äôs attempts to cool itself down begin to take their toll. Lost fluids and salts cause muscles to stop working, leading to cramps and weakness. Reduced blood flow to the brain causes headaches and dizziness. The elderly and people with high blood pressure are most at risk. Heatstroke The body‚Äôs cooling system becomes overwhelmed and shuts down, and body temperature can rocket to 41C or more in 10 minutes. Organs can no longer function, and if heatstroke isn‚Äôt treated fast, the brain overheats, sometimes leading to death. Sunstroke This is the most common type of heatstroke, caused by the sun shining directly on the head and neck for long periods. ‚Ä¢ The article was amended on 6 June 2015 to correct the affiliation of academic Matthew Huber.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-30T21:26:34Z,world,World news,Manuela Carmena set to lead Spain‚Äôs ‚Äòindignados‚Äô to power in Madrid,"The candidate enters the stadium, fist pumping the air and shaking as many hands possible en route to the podium, as thousands of supporters cheer wildly. For most politicians, scenes like that are an invaluable part of the campaign, a chance to flaunt their supporters in the face of the opposition: but not so for the woman poised to become Madrid‚Äôs mayor. ‚ÄúRallies are one person going blah, blah, blah and then leaving,‚Äù Manuela Carmena tells the Observer. ‚ÄúI refuse to do them.‚Äù To her, rallies simply reinforce the chasm between people and their politicians. ‚ÄúWe said no to rallies. Instead we held meetings in neighbourhoods and said, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre your candidates, tell us if what we‚Äôre doing is good or bad, ask us questions.‚Äô We gave the word to people ‚Äì we didn‚Äôt want to speak.‚Äù Months ago, the 71-year-old retired judge was a little-known figure in Spain. But at the helm of Ahora Madrid, a leftist coalition that ran in Madrid‚Äôs recent municipal elections, the former Communist activist has become a prominent voice of the political and social transformation sweeping Spain. The electoral campaign saw artists come together to back her campaign, flooding social networks with artwork that cast her as a symbol of change, while street artists spread her message across the city. One week before the election, polls said the 10-point gap between the conservative People‚Äôs party (PP) ‚Äì which has ruled Madrid for some 20 years ‚Äì and Ahora Madrid had narrowed to a virtual tie. Last Sunday, as Spaniards cast their ballots in municipal and regional elections, the PP squeaked out a win in Madrid, but failed to secure a majority. The result means Carmena and Ahora Madrid could join forces with the Socialists, wresting power from the PP and into the hands of a group with roots in Spain‚Äôs indignado movement.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been really exciting,‚Äù says Carmena in an interview at the barebones offices donated to Ahora Madrid for the campaign, one street from the Madrid plaza where the indignados launched their movement in 2011. ‚ÄúYou wonder, what just happened? Truthfully, we were unknown candidates, we didn‚Äôt have any money for the campaign. I like to say we ran on the currency of hope.‚Äù Ahora Madrid is not a political party, she explains, but rather a coalition of leftist groups, which includes Podemos and thousands of citizens. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a platform of people who have come together to change things.‚Äù The changes they envision for the city are straightforward, ranging from doing away with home evictions when possible and providing alternative accommodations when not, to guaranteed electricity and water for households that cannot afford utilities, and developing a plan to create jobs for young people and the long-term unemployed. The priority is to tackle the inequality that colours Madrid, says Carmena, citing neighbourhoods where nearly one in three are unemployed, compared with others where unemployment sits at 6%. As mayor, Carmena has also promised to slash her salary by more than half. Those are the concrete aims. But starting with her first day in office, Carmena is promising a radical overhaul in how politics is carried out in the city. ‚ÄúI think for a long time politics established itself in very violent ways ‚Äì rigid, reactive attitudes with authoritarian structures.‚Äù The time has come, she says, to usher in ‚Äúa feminine way of doing politics‚Äù, turning Madrid into an incubator of policies centred around the values of coexistence, caring and non-aggression. ‚ÄúTo govern is to listen,‚Äù says Carmena, repeating her oft-used phrase from the campaign. It comes as little surprise to Carmena that two of the most prominent voices leading the push for democratic regeneration in Spain belong to women ‚Äì her own and that of Ada Colau, whose Barcelona En Com√∫ movement is likely to govern Barcelona. ‚ÄúI think the world is increasingly realising the need to abandon vertical attitudes and move towards a deepening of democracy,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThose are values of the new feminine culture that will likely be the culture of the 22nd century.‚Äù Her views echo the frustrations that emanated from Spain‚Äôs plazas four years ago, when hundreds of thousands of indignados rallied against a political class whose priorities were seen to be out of step with those of the people. It is a movement primarily spawned and supported by young Spaniards, yet in Madrid its leaders include a septuagenarian, laughs Carmena, pointing to the nearly 50-year difference that exists between her and the youngest member of her team. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs curious. It was like all of a sudden they looked at me and said, this generation did things that were very interesting. And in me they saw ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì maybe a caring grandmother.‚Äù She sees parallels between the indignado generation and her own. Born years after Spain‚Äôs civil war, Carmena co-founded a group of leftwing lawyers during the Franco dictatorship, and signed up to the outlawed Communist party. Her generation, she says, was able to free itself of the fear that gripped her parents‚Äô generation, instead quietly seizing on the small openings they saw in Franco‚Äôs regime.
Inspired by the May 1968 events in France, she and her friends constantly pushed the boundaries. ‚ÄúWe questioned everything. Everything seemed like it needed to be questioned.‚Äù They ran huge risks. ‚ÄúWe were in jail for a short while. I was arrested, they threw me out of university,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThose were repressive acts, but they allowed us to confirm how society was changing: they gave us a lot of energy.‚Äù Tragedy struck in 1977 when five colleagues were gunned down by a far-right group at her law office in Madrid. Her voice shakes as she recounts the incident, one of the deadliest moments in Spain‚Äôs transition to democracy. ‚ÄúWhat an injustice. The rest of us grew older, we had disappointments, we had failed relationships, we had everything: children, grandchildren. Their lives just stopped that day.‚Äù It is these experiences she draws on to lead Madrid, building bridges along the way between her generation of activists and Spain‚Äôs indignados. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really interesting. I sometimes realise that my proposals are more reformist than the young people who didn‚Äôt even realise that you can do things another way.‚Äù These days, she travels by bicycle, blogs on justice issues and has even designed a board game about judicial processes. As the prospect of taking on Madrid‚Äôs top job looms, a major task lies in overcoming the city‚Äôs political divide. Many in Madrid cast their vote for the conservative PP, whose promises to defend businesses and lower taxes espouse a different vision of the city than that put forward by Carmena and Ahora Madrid. ‚ÄúOur challenge is to seduce those who didn‚Äôt vote for us,‚Äù she says. It is exacerbated by her rival, the PP‚Äôs Esperanza Aguirre, who has sought to stoke fears about Ahora Madrid. Last week Aguirre said the leftist group wanted to use the mayor‚Äôs office as ‚Äúa springboard to destroy the western democratic system as we know it‚Äù. Carmena likened the remarks to the ‚Äútantrum of a spoiled child‚Äù, in an interview with broadcaster Cadena Ser. The end of the campaign means it‚Äôs now time to end the war of words, says Carmena. ‚ÄúNow it is time to use the language of doing. We‚Äôre going to convince them and they‚Äôre going to say, you were right. You live better in a society that is more just and equal.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ This article was amended on Sunday 31 May 2015 to change the headline.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-30T20:16:42Z,world,World news,Denmark‚Äôs radical parties vie for power as terror casts a shadow over poll,"Wearing his trademark flat cap, Lars Aslan Rasmussen was full of optimism as he began canvassing in N√∏rrebro, a volatile Copenhagen enclave that epitomises the two dominant issues of the Danish election, immigration and welfare. But the mood swiftly changed. Aslan Rasmussen was surrounded by a group of extreme Islamists as he distributed leaflets at the suburban train station, a labyrinth of dark passages, cracked windows, graffiti and very un-Danish litter. ‚ÄúThey said I should leave their territory and that Muslims are not allowed to vote. They were very aggressive and told me that you don‚Äôt go to paradise when you participate in democracy.‚Äù A Social Democrat with a Turkish father and Danish mother, Aslan Rasmussen is trying to step up from the city council, where he has a reputation as a role model for integration. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs serious. I‚Äôm not the only one with this experience,‚Äù he said in a capital brimming with election posters for aspiring politicians with Muslim names. ‚ÄúThe Islamic groups are very active, trying to stop people from voting. There are some areas where I‚Äôm afraid to go alone. The police need to be in this area to make sure that people are not afraid to vote.‚Äù N√∏rrebro station is close to where Omar el-Hussein, the Valentine‚Äôs Day shooter, was killed by police in an exchange of fire less than 24 hours after the radicalised gangster launched a lone jihad against a country once called the happiest on Earth. It is surrounded by austere estates that terrorism experts regard as parallel societies, where Danish values are despised and extreme Muslims espouse sharia law. As Aslan Rasmussen was being intimidated, Uzma Ahmed loaded her cargo bike‚Äôs goods compartment with election posters and slowly pedalled through N√∏rrebro. She stopped at the traffic lights on the edge of N√∏rrebro‚Äôs urban park. To the right lay the station. Ahmed, a 40-year-old former youth worker standing for the new Alternative party, turned left. ‚ÄúI was prepared [for the threats] and that is why I have allied myself with the shawarma-owners, stores and kiosks,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I had a discussion with one of the shawarma-owners. He said: ‚ÄúSister, I can‚Äôt vote for you. You know it is forbidden, haram. The brotherhood says so.‚Äô‚Äù Ahmed, born of Pakistani parents in Odense, Denmark‚Äôs third-largest city, continued: ‚ÄúAfter the terror attacks, now the election is on, everyone fears we‚Äôre going to be stigmatised further.‚Äù Her route took her past the internet cafe where police arrested some of Hussein‚Äôs five alleged accomplices. They are now on remand, charged with helping to furnish him with weapons. Ahmed‚Äôs Alternative party is hoping to secure 2% of the nationwide vote required for entry to Christiansborg, the Danish parliament, the former royal palace that acts as the setting for Borgen, the cult television drama about a female Danish prime minister. She trundled past kebab joints, halal butchers and shops selling beaded wedding dresses and gaudy jewellery, squeezing by a couple of beggars seeking charity from shoppers in chadors and ankle-length black coats. The refusal of summer to materialise reinforced N√∏rrebro‚Äôs grittiness. Ahmed asked the owner of an open-all-hours grocery store for permission to display her apple green portrait. ‚ÄúIf you can find space, then you can have it,‚Äù he said. The shop was crammed with Middle Eastern pulses, oriental pickles and sauces, with not an inch of spare wall. Ahmed turned over a milk crate and, struggling on tiptoe, taped the poster to the ceiling. ‚ÄúThat should draw people‚Äôs attention,‚Äù she said, beaming. Her homespun entry into national politics could not contrast more profoundly with the juggernauts of the three main parties, now running at full tilt after the Social Democrat prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, dissolved parliament, three months before her term expired. Opinion polls, viewed with suspicion after the recent British experience, suggest that Denmark will reject Thorning-Schmidt and her red bloc. But the numbers are closing in Thorning-Schmidt‚Äôs favour; the blues currently lead by 51% to 49%. If the margin remains the same on 18 June, the prime minister will probably be Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen, leader of the right-leaning Liberals, and he will underpinned by the anti-immigrant Danish People‚Äôs party. Both the DPP and the Liberals are vying to be the second-biggest party, behind Thorning-Schmidt‚Äôs Social Democrats, currently polling 25%. Unusually, the DPP does not wish to enter a coalition. It intends to support the Liberals in parliament, using its muscle to force through issues it regards as critical. L√∏kke Rasmussen is promising working Danes that he will allow them to keep more of their income. Denmark has some of the highest tax rates on the planet. In order to fund tax cuts, he would need to reduce the country‚Äôs generous welfare payments and foreign aid disbursements. The link between immigration and welfare was emphasised in studies by the Confederation of Danish Employers that are helping L√∏kke Rasmussen justify some of his policies. The first showed that three of every four refugees granted asylum between 2000 and 2003 were unemployed more than a decade on. The second, an analysis of 40,000 jobs created in the private sector since 2011, suggests that 75% were taken by foreigners, mostly from Poland, the Baltic states and Romania, as well as shop workers from Sweden prepared to accept the going rate of ¬£10.50 an hour in a nation with no legislated minimum wage. The Liberals interpret these figures as evidence that benefits need to be cut to encourage Danes to get off the dole. Currently an unemployed person aged 30 or more can claim a minimum of ¬£1,377 a month from the state, as well as other packages such as housing assistance. L√∏kke Rasmussen is concerned that some families can accrue as much as ¬£45,000 a year in welfare, and he advocates imposing a benefits ceiling. Uzma Ahmed‚Äôs thousand-watt smile evaporates as she discusses what she sees as the portrayal of ethnic minorities as workshy social security scroungers: ‚ÄúThe people I talk to want a nice future. They know to get that you need to have a job. They want a job.‚Äù Ahmed blames nepotism and discrimination against Muslims as almost insurmountable obstacles. She says immigrants lack the connections that Danes use to advance their careers. ‚ÄúWhen you want a job and you don‚Äôt have a nice network, you can‚Äôt get it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhen talking about immigrants, Danish politicians don‚Äôt admit that what they‚Äôre really talking about is Muslims or brown people.‚Äù Ahmed is campaigning for what she calls ‚Äúthe new we‚Äù in a country where 10% of the 5.5 million population are from ethnic minorities. Immigration loomed large in the first of the party leaders‚Äô televised debates. But the probable kingmaker, Kristian Thulesen Dahl, leader of the Danish People‚Äôs party, benefited from remaining silent on his signature issue. Dahl, an accomplished debater, was judged to have won the contest after maintaining an inscrutable mask as Thorning-Schmidt was lacerated on immigration by Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen, the sparky head of the Red-Green Alliance. ‚ÄúHelle, you‚Äôre standing here in competition with the blues about who can turn their back on most refugees,‚Äù said Schmidt-Nielsen. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not looking after Denmark and the Danes properly if I do not ensure that we can cope,‚Äù responded the premier. ‚ÄúWe have to acknowledge that we cannot take in all the refugees who want to come to Europe.‚Äù The clash highlighted the schisms that exist over immigration within the red bloc. Thorning-Schmidt proudly reiterated that her Social Democrat government introduced the first tightening of immigration laws in 12 years. The tone of the early salvoes dismayed Noura Bittar S√∏borg, a Syrian asylum seeker who fled Homs in 2011 and has managed to bring her father, mother and younger sister to Denmark. She is still trying to secure safe passage for another sister. S√∏borg, 26, describes herself as a secular humanist from a Muslim background. ‚ÄúImmigrants have the smallest voice. We‚Äôre afraid they will take our children away, or send us back to war zones,‚Äù she said. Now married to Allan, a builder, S√∏borg is helping to stage a feminist play called Welcome to Denmark. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid of a rightwing government. What if they tighten the rules and make it harder for me to claim nationality?‚Äô Like the Red-Green Alliance, S√∏borg is scathing about Thorning-Schmidt‚Äôs humanitarian credentials: ‚ÄúShe has a blue mind. She‚Äôs like a ‚Äònice‚Äô Syrian detective who smiles to your face and kicks your arse.‚Äù Her dissatisfaction extends across the political spectrum: ‚ÄúEvery election they play the immigrant card. We‚Äôre the easiest target.‚Äù The Valentine‚Äôs Day shootings have undoubtedly influenced the manifesto of the Danish People‚Äôs party and shaped the thinking of the Liberal leader. As he left the funeral of security guard Dan Uzan in February, L√∏kke Rasmussen admitted he was bewildered by the hatred levelled by Hussein towards a society that had offered sanctuary from conflict to his Palestinian parents. The DPP says it aims to regain control of Denmark‚Äôs open borders and to prosecute imams such as Abu Bilal Ismail, a preacher at the radical Grimh√∏jvej mosque in second city Aarhus, which is accused of sending more fighters to Syria than any other Muslim institution. Last summer Ismail told worshippers at a Berlin mosque: ‚ÄúAllah destroy the Zionist Jews, they are no challenge to you. Count them and kill them to the very last one. Don‚Äôt spare a single one of them.‚Äù He insisted that he was exhorting God to exterminate the Jews and was not inciting hatred. Security in Denmark remains at the highest level. As it tries to prevent a new atrocity, the country‚Äôs police force is stretched to such an extent that many crimes are going undetected. Pollsters have yet to reveal whether February‚Äôs shootings will affect voters‚Äô intentions, but the talk among DPP leaders just after the annulment of parliament was whether they would benefit from ‚Äúshy‚Äù supporters, just as the Conservatives did in Britain. Lars Aslan Rasmussen‚Äôs experience may bolster their cause. Beneath his cap, Aslan Rasmussen had a message for the Salafists: ‚ÄúI may not arrive in paradise, but I will come to N√∏rrebro station again today. I will never let you set the agenda.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-30T20:00:04Z,world,World news,China cares little for other countries‚Äô territorial claims,"Under the leadership of the Communist party, China is building what an American admiral, Harry Harris, calls a ‚Äúgreat wall of sand‚Äù in the strategically important waterways of the South China Sea.
The Chinese are dredging the sea bed to transform a few reefs and rocks in the Spratly group of islands and atolls ‚Äì which they claim ‚Äì into man-made islands with a runway that can support military flights. This has caused great concern among their neighbours. The Chinese government rejects international criticisms, asserts its sovereign right to build on the islands, and demands that American naval surveillance aircraft overflying the new islands leave the Chinese air control zone immediately. There are also reports that China has begun to put heavy weapons on one of them. While one of the new islands looks like an unsinkable aircraft carrier in the making, it is unlikely to be built to project Chinese air power. In the age of long-range missiles and precision weapons, immovable aircraft carriers are easy targets. What really motivates the Chinese government is something more strategic. By transforming rocks into islands, the Chinese government is creating a reality on the ground in asserting its sovereignty over these disputed rocks and laying the ground to claim the territorial waters around them. The Chinese statement that they will eventually allow others to use facilities on the islands for disaster relief or rescue operations is significant. To take advantage of them, users will no doubt need to acknowledge Chinese sovereignty. The fact that the United Nations convention on the law of the sea is clear on what constitutes an island with territorial water ‚Äì which should exclude such man-made structures ‚Äì is not deemed an insurmountable obstacle in China. The ruling Communist party has never allowed the law to restrict what it can do. Even in the international community it has a record of successfully imposing its will on other states, notwithstanding the norm. The classic case is Taiwan‚Äôs international status. Taiwan has a permanent population, a defined territory, a democratically elected government and the capacity to enter into relations with other states, and thus meets all the criteria for statehood under the Montevideo Convention of 1934. It has also never come under the jurisdiction of the People‚Äôs Republic of China. But the Chinese government lays claim to Taiwan and insists on other states not violating its ‚Äúone China principle‚Äù. By dogged insistence and skilful use of leverage, it has successfully persuaded most nations not to challenge its assertion that Taiwan is not a country but a ‚Äúrenegade province of China‚Äù. It has reason to believe it can achieve the same with the Spratly islands. This is exactly why Vietnam and the Philippines, which also claim the same islets, are deeply concerned. Most other states in east Asia also find the Chinese move discomfiting. It is the apparent casualness with which China asserts its claims regardless of other conflicting claims that is disconcerting. What will China do next? In its rush to secure this crucial waterway for Chinese shipping, Beijing is seeking to strengthen its efforts to build a new ‚Äúmaritime silk road‚Äù through the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean to east Africa and the Mediterranean. But it is counter-productive. For the maritime silk road idea to succeed, it must be embraced by China‚Äôs maritime neighbours. They need to feel reassured that the Chinese are not aggressive. The island-building delivers the opposite effect. Maritime powers with no involvement in the disputes, such as the US and Australia, are also concerned as the Chinese move is a big step forward to laying claim to territorial waters around these man-made islands. If China should successfully claim all of the Spratly islands, it would transform most of the South China Sea, one of the most important maritime routes in the world, into a ‚ÄúChinese lake‚Äù. The US has sent a naval aircraft and may dispatch ships close to the new islands to demonstrate that it does not acknowledge that any change of status under international law has taken place. It needs to do so to protect the freedom of navigation, but it is a dangerous game that is being played ‚Äì by both sides. Steve Tsang is professor of contemporary Chinese studies at the University of Nottingham",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-30T20:00:04Z,world,World news,"South China Sea islands are Chinese plan to militarise zone, claims US","Dozens of long, flat boats swarm across turquoise waters, inside the pale, curving arc of a new island they have created from open sea in just a few months. The Chinese dredger barges can reach up to 30 metres below the surface, cutting out and scooping up huge quantities of sand and coral for land reclamation projects. The technology is sophisticated, but the idea is simple: debris is collected from the seabed and piled up until it creates an island.
Sometimes the slurry is pumped straight from the boats in heavy plumes, landing between barriers marking off what will become solid ground. If the areas being dredged and reclaimed are too far apart, it is loaded on to smaller boats that ferry it over before dumping it in place. Decades old, the technology has been used around the world to build projects ranging from Hong Kong‚Äôs main airport and entire districts of Singapore to the ostentatious villa settlements on Dubai‚Äôs Palm Islands ‚Äì man-made islands which form the shape of a tree. But what was once largely a practical concern of urban planners and developers has been thrust into the international spotlight by Beijing‚Äôs decision to use the technology to consolidate its presence on a string of islands in the South China Sea. In barely two years, more than 2,000 acres, an area more than twice the size of New York‚Äôs Central Park, has been carved from what were open stretches of the South China Sea.
The area is a busy shipping route connecting to the Strait of Malacca and the Pacific and is believed to have rich oil and gas deposits, meaning that the tiny specks of land that dot it have been contested by many neighbouring powers for decades. Some countries, including Vietnam, Malaysia and Taiwan, have used land reclamation to expand or plan expansion of the islands so that they can better support human life and, by extension, troops and other military capacity. However, China is the only power to have begun turning reefs, which are under water at high tide and therefore not considered land under international law, into permanent islands. This weekend Beijing‚Äôs conversion of open ocean it claims as its own into land that could be used to claim even more ocean triggered a serious escalation in the long-running dispute. US defence secretary Ashton Carter yesterday demanded an ‚Äúimmediate and lasting halt‚Äù to the reclamation projects after stepping up surveillance flights and a naval presence around the new islands. His demand has been supported by other regional powers alarmed at the speed of the developments. ‚ÄúChina has reclaimed over 2,000 acres, more than all other claimants combined, and more than in the entire history of the region. And China did so in only the last 18 months,‚Äù Carter told the Shangri-La regional dialogue in Singapore. ‚ÄúIt is unclear how much farther China will go. That is why this stretch of water has become the source of tension in the region and front-page news around the world.‚Äù China‚Äôs breakneck pace of island construction is partly a result of technological improvements. The country has become a world leader in land reclamation, creating more than 10,000 square kilometres along its coastline, but managing projects on a remote ocean outcrop is much harder than pushing out the shoreline by a few hundred kilometres near home.
‚ÄúTechnical constraints were a factor in the past for the reclamation of islands. The islands were too far away from the mainland for any construction work to be carried out,‚Äù said Du Xiaojun, researcher at the National Institute for South China Sea Studies. Reefs are ideal locations for land reclamation because they rise far above the surrounding seabed, making them accessible to dredger barges. Recently released photos show more than 30 such ships clustered around one of the new islands, explaining the dramatic speed of the expansion. One ship working in the South China Sea, tracked by Jane‚Äôs Defence Weekly, can suck up 4,500 cubic metres of debris an hour from the seabed. It has recently been at work on perhaps the most controversial aspect of the disputed expansion, runway construction. One of the peculiarities of Beijing‚Äôs longstanding claim over the two South China Sea island chains, the Paracels and the Spratlys, is that they lie so far from the country that it has been effectively impossible for the Chinese military to patrol the area from its existing bases hundreds of nautical miles away. But tarmac is already being laid on Fiery Cross Reef for an airstrip which is potentially long enough to support most military and surveillance planes. Even more disturbingly for China‚Äôs regional rivals, the airstrip may be intended as part of a wider web of bases and supply stations. Plans on the website of the China State Shipbuilding Corporation laid out details of an airstrip complex at the Johnson South Reef, with a CGI image of the outpost containing windmills for power and greenhouses for food, although they have been taken down. Beijing insists that the reclamation projects are part of an effort to support civilians and shipping in an area which has both heavy traffic and difficult weather and has brushed off reports that recent US satellite photos showed two artillery vehicles on one.
‚ÄúThe Nansha [Spratly] Islands is in a distant sea area with busy shipping routes and vulnerable to marine perils,‚Äù Ouyang Yujing, head of the foreign ministry‚Äôs department of boundary and ocean affairs told the official Xinhua news agency. He listed China‚Äôs responsibilities for ‚Äúmaritime search and rescue, disaster prevention and mitigation, marine scientific research, meteorological observation, ecological environment preservation, safety of navigation and fishery production‚Äù. Objections to the plan are born of fear and discrimination, say officials and analysts in China. They argue that other nations‚Äô projects to boost their claims on disputed outposts, from expansion to sponsoring civilian communities, have gone largely unchallenged. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs obviously unfair for the west to question China‚Äôs intentions in its reclamation projects. It shows that the west has wilfully misjudged the situation in the South China Sea,‚Äù said Xu Liping, researcher at the Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies inside the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a leading government thinktank. However, no other power has created dry land from stretches of open sea and, whatever their current use, Beijing‚Äôs top generals and politicians are well aware of the islands‚Äô vital strategic importance to a country that is aiming to project its naval power ever further from its shores. The various outcrops claimed by China cover just 13 square kilometres in total, but are key to controlling 2m square kilometres of sea and critical routes to the Pacific, according to a recent US state department assessment of Beijing‚Äôs claims. Analysts, including Xu, describe them as one of China‚Äôs ‚Äúcore interests‚Äù, and the government has flirted with officially giving the area that status, which would put it on a par with areas such as Tibet and Taiwan, and therefore be seen as critical to national sovereignty and a possible trigger of military action.
That hardline view may have been behind a recent editorial in the Global Times, a fiercely nationalist government-controlled paper which warned that war was inevitable if the US tried to stop the reclamation projects. Beijing has since said that the paper speaks only for itself and that the government is focused on maintaining peace and stability in the area, but there is little question that the tabloid‚Äôs stance has been embraced by some hardliners within the Chinese military and government. ‚ÄúThe Global Times‚Äô editorial has expressed a certain view,‚Äù Xu said. ‚ÄúChina is determined to defend its sovereignty in the South China Sea and others should not test its bottom line or challenge its core interests.‚Äù Beijing‚Äôs arguments have the weight of decades of history. The current claims were first expressed in recognisable form on a government map created several years before the communists swept to power in 1949, according to a US state department report . However, they are somewhat vague, defined by a ‚Äúnine-dash line‚Äù, drawn on maps without detailed coordinates and never officially submitted to an international body. The lines often sit closer to the coast of nearby countries than to the nearest island on which China is anchoring its claim. Washington has always said that it takes no position on the sovereignty dispute, but objects to the islands because China is using the tiny new territories to take control of surrounding air and water, with a string of military warnings to stay away from one island recently captured on film by CNN. ‚ÄúTurning an underwater rock into an airfield simply does not afford the rights of sovereignty or permit restrictions on international air or maritime transit,‚Äù said Carter, warning that China may find decades of dusty agreements far harder to transform than the sea itself. He added: ‚ÄúAmerica, alongside its allies and partners ... will not be deterred from exercising these rights.‚Äù Additional research by Luna Lin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-30T16:35:44Z,world,World news,Silvio Berlusconi mistakenly arrives at leftist party rally in Italy local elections,"Italy‚Äôs 78-year-old former premier, Silvio Berlusconi, mistakenly turned up at a rally for a candidate from a left-leaning party on Friday night, instead of his own Forza Italia. The incident occurred in the town of Segrate, near Milan, during the rally for Paolo Micheli, a mayoral candidate in local elections taking place on Sunday. Supporters of Micheli, who is backed by the centre-left Democratic party, were astonished as Berlusconi and no less than six bodyguards swept into the square where the rally was being held. He wandered around the square for several minutes before asking someone the candidate‚Äôs name. Berlusconi then said: ‚ÄúYoung people, I‚Äôm counting on you to vote Paolo,‚Äù before hastily departing after being informed of his error by a member of his entourage. Micheli later posted on his Facebook page: ‚ÄúWith the support of the Cavaliere I can say I‚Äôve won.‚Äù It seems that Berlusconi got lost while looking for the hall where the mayoral candidate for Forza Italia party, Tecla Fraschini, was holding a campaign event. 20 million voters go to the polls on Sunday to elect governors in seven of Italy‚Äôs 20 regions, as well as the mayors of more than 1,000 cities and towns. The elections are the first in Italy since prime minister Matteo Renzi‚Äôs Democratic party scored a resounding victory with 40% of the vote in the European elections last year. The ballots are seen as a test for both Renzi and for Berlusconi‚Äôs fading Forza Italia, which faces a growing challenge for rightwing votes from the anti-immigration Northern League, which is led by rising star Matteo Salvini. Five of the seven regions holding elections are governed by the left, one is led by the League and another by Forza Italia.
Bookmakers suggest the left will win six regions, with Veneto in the north-east remaining with the League. Renzi, 40, appears to remain popular with voters after almost 18 months as prime minister. Giovanni Orsina, political scientist at the Luiss University in Rome, said: ‚ÄúThe alternatives to Renzi are not very attractive ‚Äì he remains the only serious political offer.‚Äù A poor performance could spell the end of Berlusconi‚Äôs political career, Orsina added. In March the billionaire businessman was acquitted by Italy‚Äôs top court of charges of paying for an underage prostitute and using his political clout to cover it up. He has also performed a stint of community service for tax fraud. This article was amended on 1 June 2015. It originally stated that the elections are the first in Italy since Renzi‚Äôs Democratic party won power with just over 40% of the vote. They are the first since the party scored a resounding victory in the European elections last year, not since the general election in 2013. This has been clarified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-30T15:00:02Z,world,World news,Health workers say ‚Äònon‚Äô as 35-hour week takes blame for France‚Äôs problems,"Nurse C√©cile Ngoue cannot stop and talk, she insists, or she will be late for her shift after attending a demonstration against reforms to working hours in French hospitals. French health service workers like 52-year-old Ngoue have taken to the streets in recent days to protest against changes to the 35-hour working week, viewed outside France as totemic of the country‚Äôs rigid employment laws. Ngoue, dressed in her uniform whites, stops all the same, and says: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not lazy and we‚Äôre not opposing reform. We‚Äôre just asking for a little humanity in these changes. Everyone expects us to make sacrifices, but what about those higher up? We‚Äôre the wrong target, but the usual target. Like everyone else, we want time to rest and spend with our families. The problem isn‚Äôt the number of hours: it‚Äôs a lack of staff. We cannot work until we drop.‚Äù Nothing divides France like the 35-hour week, or to give its correct name, the loi Aubry, after Martine Aubry, the Socialist minister who pushed it through in 2000 when she was part of a centre-left government ‚Äúcohabiting‚Äù ‚Äì sharing power ‚Äì with a centre-right president. When the centre-right controlled France between 2002 and 2012, it moaned about and tinkered with the 35-hour law, but did not repeal it. Easings and adjustments ‚Äì what the French call d√©tricotage, or unravelling ‚Äì now mean companies can negotiate, for example, for working time to be calculated not weekly but annually ‚Äì at just over 1,600 hours a year. Les 35 heures has become the scapegoat for all the country‚Äôs economic woes. France‚Äôs neighbours regard the rule with a mix of scorn and envy, as evidence of supposed Gallic laziness. But that overlooks the fact that France‚Äôs hourly production figures are higher than Britain‚Äôs or Germany‚Äôs. As the law has been loosened, companies have taken a flexible approach to the 35-hour week, paying overtime at higher rates, say. As a result, the ‚Äúactual‚Äù hours worked have crept up: by 2012, state researchers found, the average number of hours worked by full-time staff in France was 39.5.At some companies, such as EDF, which is 85% state-owned, staff have it written into their contracts that they can claim between 27 and 31 days on top of the 27 days‚Äô paid annual leave. A deal signed by EDF with staff in 1999, as the 35-hour working week came into effect, allowed some staff to work a 32-hour week. In a report in 2013 the French state auditors noted that the average number of hours worked by staff at EDF was 1,570 hours a year, well below the 1,607 hours a year expected of a full-time post according to the Code du travail. EDF is trying to buy out this privilege in return for longer hours. President Fran√ßois Hollande and his socialist government, led by Manuel Valls, have repeated their commitment to les 35 heures. But is France to be congratulated for creating work-life balance for its citizens, or criticised because it cannot afford such a luxury at the height of a global economic crisis? The arguments rage ‚Äì and les 35 heures remain.
Nobody denies France‚Äôs labour market has problems: stubbornly high unemployment; paltry growth; stifling and often incomprehensible set of employment laws (the latest edition reportedly runs to 3,689 pages); high social security charges; and complicated hire-and-fire rules that mean French employers prefer precarious short-term contracts over stable jobs. However, Eric Heyer, a director at the Observatoire fran√ßais des conjonctures √©conomiques thinktank, says it is unfair for critics to fixate on the 35-hour law: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just false, but ridiculous to blame the 35-hour week for all France‚Äôs economic woes. If you look at the macroeconomics, there was no sudden drop in production or the economy following the introduction of the 35-hour week, and at the time France‚Äôs economy held out rather well. It‚Äôs not so great now, but that‚Äôs not the fault of the loi Aubry.‚Äù The law was aimed at increasing employment: the thinking was that if weekly hours were reduced, companies would have to engage more staff. Economists still disagree on whether this actually happened. Heyer cites official figures showing the law created 350,000 new jobs. This is far short of the hoped-for 2m new jobs vaunted by its supporters, he says, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs not nothing‚Äù. He added: ‚ÄúThe 35-hour week was the subject of enormous negotiations at the time it was brought in. All those who negotiated and took part in the discussions benefited. It was a win-win situation for employers and employees. The employees saw their working time go down without a drop in pay, and companies introduced the principle of counting working time over a year.‚Äù The changes that brought health workers on to the streets last week, it is worth noting, do not involve requiring staff put in more than 35 hours a week, but they would limit generous overtime payments (that mean the French health service now owes its staff ‚Ç¨75m in unpaid hours), by introducing longer shifts, with more days off in between. ‚ÄúIt was not initially anticipated that the 35-hour week would be applied to hospitals,‚Äù Heyer said. ‚ÄúHospitals are a regulated sector and couldn‚Äôt create new jobs. Besides, the number of new nurses is limited by the numbers coming out of medical schools, which is also regulated. Hospitals needed 5,000 new workers and found there were only 3,200 ‚Äì so there‚Äôs a shortage.‚Äù Heyer said: ‚ÄúThe problem is that when someone is asked to work more than 35 hours ‚Äì and they have the right to say no ‚Äì the 36th hour and those after are paid at almost 25% more. This has created a huge bill. Obviously it needs rethinking.‚Äù Even the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, never knowingly overly left-leaning, does not have a particular problem with the 35-hour week. Nicola Brandt, an OECD senior economist, told the Observer: ‚ÄúThe problem with France‚Äôs labour market is a combination of factors. There are relatively high non-wage costs, including social contributions, and a high minimum wage. There‚Äôs high unemployment among older workers and young ones. ‚ÄúWe might argue about the methodology used to establish the benefits of a 35-hour week, but it didn‚Äôt make that much difference and it‚Äôs not the single biggest issue in the French employment market. In most cases, the employees and employers negotiate and adjust the law to suit their needs. If France went back to a 39- or 40-hour week, I‚Äôm not sure it would make much difference.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-30T13:15:37Z,world,World news,"EU naval mission rescues more than 4,200 migrants in 24 hours","More than 4,200 migrants trying to reach Europe have been rescued from boats in the Mediterranean in the past 24 hours, the Italian coastguard has said. In some of the most intense Mediterranean migrant traffic of the year, a total of 4,243 people were saved from fishing boats and rubber dinghies in 22 operations involving ships from Italy, Ireland, Germany, Belgium and Britain. The announcement on Saturday came a day after 17 bodies were found on one of the boats off Libya. The nationalities of the victims have not yet been released. Migrants escaping war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East this year have been pouring into Italy, which has been bearing the brunt of Mediterranean rescue operations.
Most depart from the coast of Libya, which has descended into anarchy since western powers backed a 2011 revolt that ousted Muammar Gaddafi, and calmer seas and warm spring weather is encouraging departures. Last month, about 800 migrants drowned off Libya when their 20m fishing boat capsized and sank. The accident led to the European Union agreeing a naval mission to target gangs smuggling migrants from Libya, but a broader plan to deal with the influx is in doubt due to a dispute over national quotas for housing asylum-seekers. About 35,500 migrants arrived in Italy from the beginning of the year up to the first week of May, the UN refugee agency estimated, a number which has swelled considerably since. About 1,800 are either dead or missing. Most of those rescued on Friday and Saturday are expected to reach ports in southern Italy during the weekend. HMS Bulwark, the Royal Navy ship sent by the government to assist with search-and-rescue operations in the Mediterranean, took more than 740 migrants to the southeastern Italian port of Taranto early on Saturday. European Union authorities have pressed member states to share the burden of housing refugees more fairly through a resettlement quota system. However, an EU plan to disperse 40,000 migrants from Italy and Greece to other countries met with resistance this week. Britain said it would not participate and some eastern countries have called for a voluntary scheme.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-30T11:52:56Z,world,World news,"David Norris, hero of gay marriage vote: ‚ÄòAt 71, with a liver transplant, I‚Äôm too old to wed‚Äô","After helping to win a globally unique battle for marriage equality last weekend, Senator David Norris was basking in glory at being hailed a key architect of Ireland‚Äôs momentous referendum vote to allow same-sex marriages under the constitution. Just days later, he is rueful as he reflects that he is too old and a little bit too choosy to tie the knot at his age. ‚ÄúI am being realistic. I don‚Äôt think there is going to be a queue for the hand of a 71-year-old man with a liver transplant. In any case, I am quite picky. Throughout my life I have gone for quality rather than quantity. Of course, 50 years ago I would have absolutely loved to have been married but it simply didn‚Äôt enter my horizons at that stage.‚Äù He reacts with horror to the suggestion he will at least be the preferred best man at the weddings of same-sex couples tying the knot once the law is enacted by the end of the year. The gregarious politician and Trinity College Dublin academic protests that he could be bad luck for newlyweds: ‚ÄúI would say no. I have been a best man at one wedding of a beloved Israeli friend to a Spanish policeman and it ended in divorce,‚Äù Norris says as he shelters from the rain hammering down on the front of Leinster House, Ireland‚Äôs parliament. The country is now, according to Yahoo, the favourite destination for same sex-marriages. Wearing the international symbol of the gay movement, a rainbow flag, over a pinstripe suit, Norris chortles when it is suggested his cloak makes him look like a gay version of Batman. With a Yes vote clinched, the thousands who had gathered inside Dublin Castle to hear the outcome gave Norris a rapturous hero‚Äôs welcome when he arrived last Saturday afternoon. While gay bars and clubs around the castle opened all day and night to celebrate victory, Norris confesses he stayed away from the festivities. ‚ÄúI was pulled in pieces by different radio and television stations on Saturday night, but at 8.30pm I went to a neighbour‚Äôs house, took off my shoes, put up my feet and had a small glass of red wine. That was it! Because I have had a liver transplant and have to take it easy these days.‚Äù Norris recalls a thorny conversation he had long ago with a firmly Catholic woman in the days when homosexuality in the republic was still a crime. ‚ÄúIn the early days of the gay movement I was assailed by a fundamentalist Christian who shouted into my face: ‚ÄòYou are not just about decriminalisation. You have the homosexual agenda. The next thing you will be looking for is homosexual marriage.‚Äô I adopted a pleased expression, took out a pen and a piece of paper and said, ‚ÄòWell what a splendid idea, thank you madam. Have you got any further suggestions?‚Äô‚Äù It was Norris‚Äôs legal cases against the Irish state, which went all the way to the European court of human rights, that eventually pushed the then Fianna F√°il-Labour government in 1993 to decriminalise homosexuality. ‚ÄúI did not envisage in my lifetime a country where every single political party would be strongly in favour of a Yes vote for marriage equality, nor did I foresee Dublin Castle yard filled with thousands of jubilant gay people, their families, friends and heterosexual supporters all cheering a major advance in gay rights.‚Äù His career as a politician has been marked with controversy, especially during the 2011 Irish presidential campaign. Norris had originally stood to be Irish president but his campaign crumbled after allegations over a former partner, Ezra Nawi, who had been convicted of the statutory rape of a 15-year-old Palestinian boy in 1992. Norris came under fire when it emerged that he had sent a letter to an Israeli court, written on parliamentary notepaper, which said that Nawi had been lured into a ‚Äúcarefully prepared trap‚Äù and had unwisely pleaded guilty to the charges. There was some opposition to the referendum result, not least from the Vatican, where a Holy See official last Wednesday described the result as a ‚Äúdisaster for humanity‚Äù. Norris‚Äôs shoulders shake with laughter when he is shown the quotes from Rome. ‚ÄúThe Roman Catholic church‚Äôs views on sexuality have been a disaster for humanity.‚Äù Norris, who is a practising Christian and a prominent member of the Church of Ireland, then paraphrases St Matthew‚Äôs gospel when Christ put down hypocrites and moralisers. ‚ÄúIt shows they are out of touch. They should take the beam out of their own eye rather than looking for the speck of dust in other people‚Äôs eyes.‚Äù Opponents of same-sex marriage in Ireland claim that the new legalisation will end up with LGBT couples suing churches that refuse to bless their unions in places of worship. The senator is dismissive of these fears. ‚ÄúSome churches such as the Unitarian church and the Presbyterian church in America do celebrate gay marriages. The referendum that was passed was about civil marriage and civil marriage alone. However, bearing in mind, as I have often said, that priests routinely bless agricultural machinery, domestic pets and bombs, I don‚Äôt think it would kill them to give a blessing to two human beings who love each other. But that is up to them,‚Äù Norris said. He defends the new generation of gay activists such as Panti Bliss aka Rory O‚ÄôNeill, the drag queen and articulate unofficial spokesperson for the Irish LGBT community. ‚ÄúI thought the comment of one newspaper report that the gay community would be stupid to listen to political statements from a man in a skirt pretty wide of the mark. It doesn‚Äôt matter what gender you are or what clothes you are wearing, it is the quality of your ideas that counts.‚Äù Norris tempers his obvious glee over the Yes vote, and the Catholic hierarchy‚Äôs discomfort, with a note of caution: ‚ÄúWe have to await the legislation and make sure that elements such as pension discrimination and a section of the equality legislation that would allow religious institutions to fire people for being gay are cleared up. ‚ÄúHowever, much more important is the position of gay people in the majority of countries where they are harassed, persecuted, imprisoned, beaten, tortured and murdered. In the elation of our own triumph we must not forget our oppressed brothers and sisters.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-29T22:17:38Z,world,World news,US formally drops Cuba from terrorism 'blacklist',"The United States has formally dropped Cuba from its list of state sponsors of terrorism, the State Department announced on Friday, adding a symbolic punctuation mark to talks that aim to end decades of antagonism. The removal of Cuba from the terrorism list eliminates an obstacle to restoring diplomatic ties between the countries after a 50-year estrangement. Cuban diplomats had urged rescission as a condition of normalizing relations, alongside the restoration of bank services for Cubans in the US. But the removal will have a limited impact on US economic sanctions, which remain in place under the embargo that has been imposed by Congress for decades. Rescinding the designation against Cuba is ‚Äúan important step‚Äù, an American official told Reuters, before qualifying that ‚Äúas a practical matter, most restrictions related to exports and foreign aid will remain due to the comprehensive trade and arms embargo‚Äù. Taking Cuba off the list has two main consequences, diplomatic and economic, said Christopher Sabatini, a Columbia University professor who specializes in Cuba studies. ‚ÄúThis is something that for a long time sort of stuck in the craw of the Cubans, who really resented being lumped together with countries like Iran and Syria,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs important on a diplomatic, transactional level, and on a financial one while it doesn‚Äôt remove all the obstacles, it eases the possibility of one of Obama‚Äôs principle reforms and opens up opportunities for US travellers and banks.‚Äù Sabatini said that with Cuba off the list, American banks and credit card companies would have less to fear of the risks to their reputation and finances that could be imposed by the bad publicity and potential fines of doing business with a designated sponsor of terror. The next steps, Sabatini suggested, were discussions about freedom of movement for American diplomats in Cuba, who face tight restrictions on where they can go and whom they can meet, for fear of their fomenting dissent among citizens. ‚ÄúThis is a game of chess,‚Äù Sabatini said. ‚ÄúThese are not friendly countries, there are decades of distrust. But the next move is basically Cuba‚Äôs for normalizing relations, and the question is will it allow for the unfettered travel of US diplomats. ‚ÄúPresident Obama has gone out on a limb here, it‚Äôs a risky move. There‚Äôs very vocal opposition to these changes and they will cry foul unless these concessions are reciprocated.‚Äù While some businesses and travelers have taken advantage of the relaxed rules surrounding Cuba, major banks and financial institutions remain wary of the legal minefield put in place by the embargo. ‚ÄúThe embargo is still the big 800lb gorilla in the room,‚Äù said David Schwartz, chief executive of the Florida International Bankers Association. ‚ÄúLifting the terror designation is a help to foreign banks that are dealing with Cuba and have had that concern, and this may in their mind ease that burden. ‚ÄúBut although the administration is pushing to the limit of what they can do, to go any further would require lifting the embargo,‚Äù he said. In December, Obama ordered the State Department to review Cuba‚Äôs presence on the terror list and report back to him within six months, as part of his administration‚Äôs new policy toward the island nation.
When that review was complete, Obama wrote to Congress in April, saying the Cuban government had ‚Äúnot provided any support for international terrorism‚Äù in the past six months, and had ‚Äúprovided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future‚Äù. In its statement on Friday, the State Department said: ‚ÄúWhile the United States has significant concerns and disagreements with a wide range of Cuba‚Äôs policies and actions, these fall outside the criteria relevant to the rescission of a State Sponsor of Terrorism designation.‚Äù A handful of outspoken congressman, including Florida senator and Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio, immediately denounced rapprochement. Rubio said that to take Cuba off the list would be a ‚Äúterrible mistake‚Äù, but he and allies such as representatives Pete King and Scott Garrett failed to muster congressional resistance against the rescission. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush agreed with Rubio, his unofficial rival for the Republican 2016 nomination, in calling the move a mistake. ‚ÄúObama seems more interested in capitulating to our adversaries than in confronting them,‚Äù he said Cuba was placed on the list in 1982 for supporting communist rebels in Latin America and Africa, but the US has not accused the island nation of direct military assistance for a foreign terrorist group in years. Recent State Department reports have criticized Cuba for offering safe haven to members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, Farc, and the Basque separatist group Eta. Cuba has since distanced itself from Eta, and is currently hosting peace talks between Farc and the Colombian government.
Frank Calzon of the Center for Free Cuba, a pro-democracy group, brought up Farc as well as American fugitives who fled to Cuba in his criticism of the Obama administration. ‚ÄúThe president has given up the one leverage he had to obtain fugitives that murdered Americans and who are enjoying the hospitality of the Castro regime,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúCuba‚Äôs listing as a sponsor of terror was renewed for years under this president. I think it‚Äôs shameful that Mr Obama acquiesced to Ra√∫l Castro‚Äôs pressure.‚Äù Both the president and Congress were criticized by Joe Connor, an American whose father was killed by a bomb set by Puerto Rican nationalists, one of whom escaped prison to Cuba. ‚ÄúWe are truly living in an upside-down society,‚Äù Connor said, when ‚ÄúObama capitulates to the likes of Cuba and then Congress, who is supposed to represent the people, capitulates to Obama.‚Äù But the Cuban-American community has grown increasingly divided by age and politics, as evinced by other groups who voiced support for the removal. The Washington DC-based Cuba Study Group said it was ‚Äúpleased‚Äù by the rescission from the list. ‚ÄúFor years, the arguments justifying Cuba‚Äôs continued inclusion [were] becoming more political than factual,‚Äù the group said, before urging Congress to lift the embargo. ‚ÄúWhile today‚Äôs announcement is important and symbolic, the US‚Äôs complex web of codified sanctions still create significant obstacles which hinder our ability to assist Cuba‚Äôs civil society and thus facilitate peaceful change,‚Äù its statement read. Younger Cuban Americans have also supported rapprochement with Cuba, forming organizations such as Cuba Now, which supports greater business ties between US and Cuban companies. Ric Herrero, executive director of the group, welcomed the change of Cuba‚Äôs status. Conceding ‚Äúthere is much to criticize about the Cuban government‚Äôs repressive practices‚Äù, he described Cuba‚Äôs place on the list as ‚Äúthe result of domestic political calculations rather than factual findings‚Äù. ‚ÄúBy lifting the designation, a cloud is lifted that will make it easier for US citizens and American businesses to embrace the new regulatory environment in support of the Cuban people.‚Äù Roots for Hope, a nonprofit led by young people in the Miami area, similarly advocates for greater interaction with Cubans, and has allied with tech companies to build internet infrastructure on the island. The only countries that will now remain on the US terror list are Iran, Sudan and Syria.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-29T21:43:56Z,world,World news,Canada's conservatives under pressure after another senior minister resigns,"The political pact binding Canadian conservatives together has come under renewed strain after yet another senior cabinet minister announced that he was bailing out of the increasingly unpopular government of Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper. Justice minister Peter MacKay declaration on Friday that he would not to seek re-election in this fall‚Äôs upcoming federal election came after former foreign minister John Baird unexpectedly announced he was leaving politics earlier this year, increasing speculation that even the ruling Conservatives are seeing the end of days for their majority government in October. MacKay‚Äôs resignation came on the heels of news that Canada‚Äôs economy shrank by 0.1% in the first three months of 2015, the first quarterly contraction since 2011, representing a significant setback for the Harper government‚Äôs oil-based economic policy. ‚ÄúWith economic numbers like these heading into the election, Mr Mackay won‚Äôt be the last cabinet minister to jump off this ship,‚Äù tweeted economist Jim Stanford of the trade union Unifor. A former defence minister, foreign minister and attorney general in successive Harper governments, MacKay played a key role in uniting right-wing factions to form the modern Conservative Party. He is considered a moderate in Ottawa and is often mentioned as a future party leader. MacKay is also one of the few personally popular members of the Harper government, having entertained Canadians during his bachelorhood with a love life that included a public jilting by a billionaire heiress and rumours of dates in rural Nova Scotia with Condoleeza Rice, which the former US secretary of state has denied. Currently married to Iranian-born singer and activist Nazanin Afshin-Jam, MacKay cited ‚Äúentirely personal reasons‚Äù for his retirement during a press conference attended by the prime minister in Stellarton, Nova Scotia. Harper contributed a eulogy emphasizing MacKay‚Äôs commitment to the common cause. ‚ÄúI love what I do‚Äù MacKay said. ‚ÄúBut simply put, I love my family more.‚Äù But he hinted strongly he would one day return to politics, citing his father‚Äôs advice: ‚ÄúNever lock a door when you leave, unless you have to.‚Äù Sympathetic observers see MacKay‚Äôs resignation as an obvious step for a potential future leader. ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs probably decided the odds of Harper going anywhere soon aren‚Äôt very great and he wants to make some money,‚Äù said Brian Lee Crowley, director of the rightwing Maconald-Laurier Institute. ‚ÄúHe could spend a few years making good money and when it‚Äôs time for Harper to go he would be well placed to return.‚Äù Others see it differently. ‚ÄúI think MacKay sees the writing on the wall and is getting out before he is booted out,‚Äù said Maude Barlow, head of the leftwing Council of Canadians. ‚ÄúCanadians have had it with this government.‚Äù Most polls agree, showing Harper winning a weak minority if the election were held today. If the same result occurs in October, according to University of Toronto political scientist Nelson Wiseman, there will be ‚Äúmassive pressure‚Äù on opposition leaders to overthrow the government. ‚ÄúBoth McKay and Baird realize that in a minority situation, unless it‚Äôs very close to a majority, they‚Äôre toast,‚Äù Wiseman said, predicting that the opposition New Democrats and Liberals will combine to defeat any Conservative minority government at the earliest opportunity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-29T16:10:00Z,world,World news,Orthodox Jewish sect's female driver ban condemned by Nicky Morgan,"The education secretary has condemned an ultra-Orthodox Jewish sect‚Äôs decision to ban women from driving, saying the edict was ‚Äúcompletely unacceptable in modern Britain‚Äù. Nicky Morgan, who is also the minister for women and equalities, spoke as the Department for Education launched an investigation into the order issued by the Belz sect, which runs two schools in Stamford Hill, north London. A letter to parents said that, from later this year, children driven to school by women would be turned away. Parents in the area defended the ban on Friday, saying it was part of the choice they made when they agreed to live within the Belz community. Women rejected the characterisation that they were oppressed, and the schools wrote to Morgan, saying the notice had been misrepresented. The group runs Talmud Torah Machzikei Hadass, a boys‚Äô primary school, and Beis Malka, a primary school for girls. Both have been rated good by Ofsted. The schools had said that, from August, any child driven to school by their mother would be turned away at the school gates. The letter said the ban was based on the recommendations of Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach, the Belzer spiritual leader in Israel. It said that if a mother has no other choice but to drive her child to school ‚Äì such as a medical reason ‚Äì she should ‚Äúsubmit a request to the special committee to this effect and the committee shall consider her request‚Äù. Morgan condemned the edict, which was first reported by the Jewish Chronicle. In a statement provided to the Guardian, she said: ‚ÄúThis is completely unacceptable in modern Britain. If schools do not actively promote the principle of respect for other people they are breaching the independent school standards. Where we are made aware of such breaches we will investigate and take any necessary action to address the situation.‚Äù
The Department for Education later confirmed that an investigation was under way. Outside the schools on Friday, the Guardian found parents were broadly supportive of the decree. Jacob ‚Äì not his real name ‚Äì who said he had sons at one of the schools, said he and his wife had actively chosen to be part of the Belz sect because of its strict regulations. ‚ÄúMy mother drives, my mother-in-law drives, if my wife wanted to drive, she could drive tomorrow, we could take our children to another school. We‚Äôd have a discussion about it, as in any marriage. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not forbidden in Jewish law. But this is our tradition, this is our choice to be a little more pious. So my wife doesn‚Äôt want to drive. This isn‚Äôt Saudi Arabia, no one‚Äôs going to be punished, or whipped or whatever, or even ostracised.‚Äù Jacob insisted the group did not want to impose its rules on others. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not saying ‚Äòall the women of London shouldn‚Äôt drive‚Äô, that would be ridiculous. We‚Äôre saying, let us get on living our lives how we want to live it ‚Äì stop saying that we are oppressed.‚Äù Another Stamford Hill man, who said he was part of the Belz community, said: ‚ÄúI agree with the policy of women not driving. Hasidic women have never driven cars. No one is unhappy. Not one of my friends would let his wife drive.‚Äù Many women in the community expressed the same view. Outside the Beis Malka school, as schoolgirls left early on Friday to get home in time for the sabbath to start, several women drove large people-carriers close to the school, but parked some distance away. One woman, who was walking to collect her daughter, said the letter had not bothered her. ‚ÄúI walk everywhere, I don‚Äôt need to drive. I have five children: I would need to drive a very big car, and that‚Äôs not an option for me. There‚Äôs maybe a few occasions where it would have been more convenient to have a car, but I can‚Äôt think of many. Everything we need is here in Stamford Hill.‚Äù Another Belz woman said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt drive, because I want to be part of this community.‚Äù She said the ban did not apply universally. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no ban on driving in other parts of the Jewish community. I can choose to educate my children in a different schools, there are over 20 to choose from in Stamford Hill. But I believe that if you join a private school you have to abide by their rules.‚Äù
Another Stamford Hill mother, who gave her name as Judith, said not only was she happy with the ban, but had rejected the offer of dispensation from rabbis who said she would be permitted to drive because she was divorced and had a disabled child. ‚ÄúI choose to be part of this community, it‚Äôs my choice,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúFamily purity is exceptionally important to us, there‚Äôs no bigger priority for us than raising a pure Jewish family.‚Äù In a letter to Morgan on Friday, the school said it regretted the language used in its original decree. ‚ÄúWe accept that the choice of words was unfortunate and if a negative impression was created by our letter then we unreservedly apologise for that,‚Äù it said. Ahron Klein, chief executive of the schools, said the Belz community was guided by ‚Äúreligious principles and strong traditional values‚Äù and that it was concerned by the erosion of these values, ‚Äúcaused by the proliferation of technology and the declining standards of visual and printed media‚Äù. He wrote: ‚ÄúWe are proud of what we stand for and we do not feel the need to excuse ourselves for our deeply held beliefs and staunchly maintained way of life. It has withstood the test of time and is not prone to the vagaries of passing fads.‚Äù But he said ‚Äúthe issue of women driving cars became conflated with broader issues which we intended to address‚Äù and that those women who chose to drove would be ‚Äúrespected within our community‚Äù. It was unclear whether that meant that women could continue to drive their children to school. Hackney council, which covers Stamford Hill, said it was ‚Äúcontinuing to work with the Department of Education‚Äù, and confirmed that the Stamford Hill schools in question are independent. The Board of Deputies of British Jews distanced itself from the decree, saying the letter was from a marginal and unaffiliated group. A former member of another ultra-Orthodox sect said on Friday that she faced pressure from her family when she decided that she wanted to drive. The woman told Radio 4 that her husband was ‚Äúvery disturbed with the idea‚Äù as it was ‚Äúunheard of in my immediate community, family and friends. None of the women drove.‚Äù The woman, who left the community just over two years ago when her marriage ended, said: ‚ÄúThis is a very insular community with very little contact with the outside world. It‚Äôs actually incredible how that works: how you can have a world that exists within a world.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-29T15:53:37Z,world,World news,Palestinians withdraw call to suspend Israel from Fifa,"The Palestinian Football Association has withdrawn its call to have Israel suspended from Fifa in a chaotic last minute climbdown at the congress of football‚Äôs governing body in Zurich. Following days of negotiations, and the mediation of Fifa president Sepp Blatter, the Palestinian moves at the scandal-ridden congress appeared comprehensively outmanoeuvred by feverish Israeli lobbying and the opposition of senior Fifa officials, including Blatter. As details of an impending deal emerged, the Palestinian delegation came out of the last round of talks expecting the congress to vote on an amendment to refer the main sticking point, the status of five Israeli clubs based in illegal settlements on the West Bank, to the United Nations. But the Palestinian move was overruled by Blatter, to the clear dismay of the Palestinian delegation, whose lawyer tried to appeal from the floor. Instead, the issue will be referred to a new Fifa committee. Palestinian delegation members complained after the vote that the amendment voted on was not the one it had drawn up, which called explicitly for UN referral. The announcement came at the end of a long day in which Palestinian delegation members had insisted they would not back down on the suspension vote. The PFA has accused Israel of hampering its activities and restricting the movement of players between the Gaza Strip and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israel cites security concerns for the restrictions it imposes and the country‚Äôs football association and has argued that it has no control over security forces. Fifa has been trying to settle the matter for two years. Blatter this month travelled to the region to meet Israel‚Äôs prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas to try to avoid a vote, which would have seen Israel join only two other countries in being suspended ‚Äì apartheid era South Africa and Yugoslavia. Palestinian football chief Jibril Rajoub announced the delegation‚Äôs change of position only as he mounted the podium to speak. ‚ÄúI decided to drop the suspension but it does not mean that I give up the resistance,‚Äù he said to scattered applause. ‚ÄúA lot of colleagues who I respect and I appreciate explained to me how it is painful for them to hear in this family about the issue of suspension,‚Äù said Rajoub. Palestinian sources confirmed that Rajoub had been under huge pressure to withdraw the suspension motion from delegates. ‚ÄúIt is true everyone was putting pressure on him to withdraw,‚Äù said one. Blatter has always made clear he opposed a vote on suspension. Following the withdrawal of the request to suspend Israel over claims of its racist and discriminatory policies towards Palestinian football, 90% of delegates voted to set up a new monitoring inspections committee to oversee a mechanism to ensure movement of players and equipment. The size of the vote in favour of the motion ‚Äì 165-18 ‚Äì is likely to be the only consolation for the Palestinian side, which has been pushing a long-term campaign over what it says are Israeli abuses of Palestinian football. The outcome seemed certain to be a cause for celebration for Israel. The effective removal by Blatter of the issue of referral to the UN followed complaints before the vote from members of the Palestinian delegation to the Guardian and other journalists that Fifa officials were attempting to prevent a vote on the substantive issue of the settlement teams. The threat to suspend Israel had been overshadowed in any case by the explosive allegations of corruption within the world football body as the Zurich congress opened. Announcing his decision to withdraw the suspension motion, Rajoub said he had been persuaded by approaches from other figures involved in world football, including South Africa‚Äôs Tokyo Sexwale. Israeli Football Association president Ofer Eini, addressing the congress after Rajoub, told delegates: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs leave politics to the politicians while we play soccer the best we can.‚Äù Commenting on the outcome, Netanyahu said: ‚ÄúOur international effort has proven itself and led to the failure of the Palestinian Authority attempt to oust us from Fifa.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-29T15:45:28Z,world,World news,In Mexico's tequila-making heartland an age-old craft is in danger of dying out,"Standing tall amid the latticework of burnt orange and blue that embroiders the north-western highlands of Jalisco, Mexico, Armando Acevez takes a sleeve in his hand and wipes it across his sweaty brow. His hands are rough; blistered portraits of a life which for almost two decades has been spent working on this unforgiving terrain. Acevez is a jimador, or cultivator of the blue Weber agave plants whose nectar is the lifeblood of the lucrative tequila industry. The craft of the agave harvest, still done entirely by hand, has remained virtually unchanged since around 1600 when tequila was first invented by the Spanish conquistadors. It is also one that has traditionally remained in families, with each generation teaching the next, ensuring that the mechanisation of the tequila harvest has been kept at bay. Yet traditions of the jimador, a figure still cloaked in romantic mystique in literature and even Mexican telenovelas, are slowly disappearing. While the demand for high-quality tequila is rising year on year, with the industry worth over $1bn and seven out of 10 litres produced now exported worldwide, the younger male generations who would once have taken on the mantle of their fathers to become jimadores are turning away from the agricultural way of life in droves. ‚ÄúAlmost every man in my family has been a jimador, going back generations, it is a tradition,‚Äù says Acevez. ‚ÄúAs long as I can harvest I will keep being a jimador. But most of the jimadores now are old people because none of the young people want to work on the harvest. You find a few young jimadores but there are less and less. I do think we need to start worrying about the future of the traditions because I see the people who start in the harvest are much older than they used to be. I have a son who is 11 and I would not want him to be a jimador.‚Äù Out in the craggy ground of the agave fields, Acevez works alongside a team of about a dozen jimadores, including his brother and his nephew, hacking skilfully at the cores of the succulent ‚Äì known as pi√±as because they look like large pineapples ‚Äì to remove the bitter leaves. Once harvested, these hearts are taken to the nearby Patr√≥n distillery, where they will be cooked, crushed and fermented to become premium tequila.
Miguel Fonseca, Patr√≥n‚Äôs agave chief, said the company need about three and a half million agave plants each year to meet increasing demand. All of the plants need to be harvested by hand by the jimadores to the exact specifications required by their artisan method. ‚ÄúThe jimadores know and they recognise which agaves are ripe to harvest and fit our exact specifications,‚Äù said Fonseca. ‚ÄúThey have harvested the agave in the same way for over 400 years and most of the jimadores will learn from their fathers. But now we have far fewer young people taking on this work because lots of the young people prefer to migrate to the cities or the US.‚Äù
Fonseca predicted increasing demand could force a departure from the harvesting methods that have remained preserved for centuries. ‚ÄúI think maybe in the next 30 or 40 years we will have to, out of necessity, to create a machine to harvest the agave because over time there will not be so many jimadores.‚Äù The dearth of a new generation of jimadores is symptomatic of a widespread decline in agricultural work in Mexico, with figures showing that the farm workforce fell by two million between 1995 and 2010, while pay for agricultural jobs has remained relatively static. This became particularly stark during the agave crisis that hit Mexico in the early 2000s, when not enough succulents had been planted seven years previously to meet demand. The crop‚Äôs price per kilo rose by almost 1,000% but wages for the jimadores remained the same. Concern for the future of traditional agave farmers was echoed by others out in the Jalisco fields. Mariano Meza, 40, said he had been doing the job for over a decade and had noticed the next generation were more reluctant to learn the trade. ‚ÄúThere are not many young people harvesting any more,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe problem is that the young people don‚Äôt like doing this job for a long time, so we don‚Äôt see them in the fields.‚Äù Meza added: ‚ÄúMy son is 17 and he is now studying in the US, so he will not become a jimador and I think it is the same for lots of other young people of his generation: if they can, they are now choosing to go away to study and work rather than stay here to work on the harvest.‚Äù
Chantal Martineau, author of How the Gringos Stole Tequila, said the shift was having an impact on the craft of the industry. Whereas in the past the jimadores had owned their own family agave farms, now it is largely the domain of big agro-businesses. ‚ÄúThere is this mystique around the jimadores; for centuries it has been seen as a very romantic job but the job is changing, becoming lost,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt used to be this very storied role, passed down from father to son. Now, the various tequila producers who I spoke to complained that the jima [the harvest] is not done as well as a few years ago because these jimadores are not being trained by their father, or uncle, and it is becoming more of a day labourer job.‚Äù The causes, said Martineau, were attributable to the lack of protection for traditional farming methods within Mexican law ‚Äì as enjoyed abroad by other protected products such as champagne or cognac ‚Äì as well as the decision by an increasing number of young Mexicans to eschew a life working on the land. ‚ÄúA lot of young people are not taking up the family business, more and more they are turning to jobs outside of agriculture,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúAnd that is really a story that can be seen in Mexico across the board.‚Äù Back in the fields, even the youngest jimador, 24-year-old Juan Acevez, said that despite having been taught the craft by his father and uncle he had no intention of passing it on to his own son. ‚ÄúMy son is one year and a half but I do not want him to become a jimador when he gets older, I prefer that he studies,‚Äù said Acevez. ‚ÄúI did not get a chance to study or go to school so I want that for my son, not for him to be working out in the fields.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-29T14:59:22Z,world,World news,Historic succession complete as Buhari is sworn in as the president of Nigeria,"He has been a military dictator, political prisoner and serial election loser. The rise and fall and rise again of Muhammadu Buhari was complete on Friday when he was sworn in as Nigerian president in front of cheering crowds and with a 21-gun salute. Buhari made history when he became the first challenger to defeat a sitting leader in the west African country in a March election that was more peaceful than many had dared hope. But in taking the helm of Africa‚Äôs biggest economy, the 72-year-old Muslim must get to grips with a deadly Islamist insurgency, high unemployment and even higher expectations ‚Äì an inheritance that some analysts describe as a poisoned chalice. On a day filled with symbolism, the outgoing president, Goodluck Jonathan, handed over the constitution and national flags. Buhari shook hands with the elected president he ousted 32 years ago, Shehu Shagari, and the general who deposed him 20 months later, Ibrahim Babangida, before taking the oath of office. ‚ÄúI, Muhammadu Buhari, do solemnly swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to the federal republic of Nigeria,‚Äù he said, wearing traditional robes and an embroidered cap at the ceremony in Abuja‚Äôs Eagle square. ‚ÄúThat, as president of the federal republic of Nigeria, I will discharge my duties to the best of my ability and in accordance with the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria and the law.‚Äù
He was sworn in by the chief justice, supreme court president Mahmoud Mohammed, and the crowd rose to their feet, dancing and singing his name. The former general then inspected troops in the plaza, decked out in the colours of Nigeria‚Äôs green and white flag, from the back of an open vehicle and waved at supporters who raced forward to record the moment on their phones. ‚ÄúI belong to everybody and I belong to nobody,‚Äù he told the crowds. Striking a note of caution, he warned that the economy was in ‚Äúdeep trouble‚Äù and needed careful management to overcome the impact of low oil prices, slowing growth, high unemployment and the security threat from Boko Haram. He vowed to tackle the militant Islamist group ‚Äúhead on‚Äù but said no victory would be complete without the rescue of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped in Chibok last year. Security was tight at the ceremony attended by African leaders including Jacob Zuma of South Africa and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, as well as US secretary of state John Kerry and France‚Äôs foreign minister Laurent Fabius. In 2010, two car bombs and a grenade blast triggered by militants from Nigeria‚Äôs oil-rich delta region killed 12 people at Independence Day celebrations.
During his brief spell as dictator in the mid-1980s, Buhari sent soldiers into the streets with whips to enforce traffic regulations and ensure commuters formed orderly queues at bus stops. Civil servants arriving late to offices were forced to perform frog squats. Around 500 politicians, officials and businessmen were imprisoned in a populist campaign against waste and corruption. Buhari has described himself as a ‚Äúconverted democrat‚Äù who repeatedly contested and lost elections after civilian rule was restored 16 years ago. He has vowed to unite a nation of 173 million people riven by ethnic and religious fault lines and to hammer corruption. Nigerian newspapers carried unconfirmed reports that some politicians had already returned millions of dollars in the hope of avoiding scrutiny. The most populous country in Africa is also $63bn in debt and borrowing to pay government workers. In the past week it has endured fuel shortages that crippled banks and businesses and grounded flights. Boko Haram‚Äôs six-year uprising has killed more than 13,000 people and driven more than 1.5 million people from their homes. Gains have been made against the group since February in an offensive backed by neighbouring Cameroon, Chad and Niger but the region is far from peaceful. The inauguration marked the end of the once unassailable reign of the People‚Äôs Democratic party. When its defeat in the recent election became clear, the outgoing president Jonathan phoned Buhari to concede defeat, winning plaudits around the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-29T14:47:02Z,world,World news,Golf loses its gloss for China‚Äôs privileged elite,"An hour‚Äôs drive north of downtown Shanghai, on the island of Chongming, lies a little paradise. Lan Hai International Golf Club boasts two 18-hole courses. But the place is not strictly for golfers. It‚Äôs a preserve of those who have profited the most from China‚Äôs economic boom. Any given Saturday morning, you‚Äôll find the elite gliding from hole to hole in their electric golf carts, the players accompanied by two caddies alert to their every command and quick to advise on how to play the course. The game invariably winds up at the clubhouse, its entrance flanked by two superb Italian fountains. For these golfers, the drive from Shanghai is no obstacle; they come and go in powerful sedans. Some even own one of the Tuscan-style villas that rim the links. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lifestyle,‚Äù says the club‚Äôs manager, Zhang Hongze. He‚Äôs convinced Chongming will soon become what Long Island is to New York. His reception room boasts a fireplace right out of a French chateau. This lifestyle, however, is now being targeted by China‚Äôs President Xi Jinping and his powerful ally Wang Qishan, the country‚Äôs anti-corruption boss. Mao Zedong once denounced golf as a bourgeois pastime, and since Xi took office in 2012, the president has led a campaign against excesses by state officials and their friends in business. To dodge the purge, many now avoid displays of conspicuous consumption, even if they got rich the legal way and even if to them golf is merely a means to network with the powerful. Communist party leaders want to show they‚Äôre still close to the common people, and if there‚Äôs one glaring symbol of wealth in China, it‚Äôs golf. Unlike the US, Japan and Korea, where golf is a sport of the leisured middle class, in China high membership fees, equipment costs and associated expenditures make it very much a privilege of the rich. Inevitably, the political storm now sweeping China has hit the golf courses of the nation and the players who use them. In April, five months after submitting to an official government inspection, China Southern Airlines ‚Äì Asia‚Äôs largest carrier by fleet size and passengers carried ‚Äì announced it would no longer offer free golf holidays to its most loyal customers. And last December, the province of Guangdong ordered its officials to steer clear of the fairways, too. The sport is getting a bad reputation in other ways. To be maintained properly, golf courses have to be watered regularly ‚Äì this, at a time when northern China is suffering from chronic water shortages. And building new ones means expropriating farmland, often under highly dubious circumstances ‚Äì this at a time when the most heavily populated country on the planet strives daily to maintain enough arable land to feed its people. In March, China‚Äôs national development and reform commission, the state‚Äôs central planning office, announced the closure of 66 golf clubs ‚Äì about one out of every 10 in the country, according to American journalist Dan Washburn, author of The Forbidden Game: Golf and the Chinese Dream . That‚Äôs a rough estimate, he admits: ‚ÄúNobody knows the exact number of golf clubs in China ‚Äì it‚Äôs somewhere between 600 and 1,000.‚Äù The Chinese government ordered a stop to new construction in 2004, but the number of clubs has tripled since then in other guises, lumped in with acceptable projects such as protected nature reserves.
Golf not only draws the keen eye of many a local politician, but the opening of a new club can bring prestige to the commune that runs it. Municipalities compete with each other to attract investors, and there‚Äôs a strong financial incentive: promoters pay high prices for land expropriated by local governments, who have owned it since Mao collectivised farms in the 1950s. As a result, the People‚Äôs Republic is now home to the two biggest golf clubs in the world: Mission Hills Shenzhen, just north of Hong Kong, which features seven 18-hole resort and championship courses, and Mission Hills Haikou, still under construction on the tropical island of Hainan and which will have 22 golf courses on offer. New clubs have opened in even more exotic locations: for example, in Hunan province‚Äôs Zhangjiajie National Forest Park, whose mountains inspired the ones seen in the sci-fi movie Avatar. At Lan Hai, China‚Äôs anti-corruption campaign is a sensitive subject. The club opened in June 2012, just before Xi came to power. ‚ÄúFor two or three years now, our sport has attracted a great deal of attention,‚Äù club manager Zhang acknowledges, trying to accentuate the positive. ‚ÄúIf there have been illegal practices and people have been punished, that‚Äôs progress.‚Äù But officials who once made a habit of playing 18 holes at Lan Hai now keep a low profile. The way things are in China these days, if golf is to have a future it must become more democratic. Trouble is, what makes it attractive to the nouveau riche is that very feeling of belonging to a select group, far from the madding crowd. ‚ÄúA lot of people pick up golf precisely because they want to become a member of an exclusive club,‚Äù says Washburn. With its cigar lounge, whisky bar and wine cellar stocked with Ch√¢teau Figeac and Ch√¢teau Lafite Rothschild, everything about Lan Hai golf club is a reminder that this is a place reserved for the privileged few. Nevertheless, Zhang hopes the middle classes will see golf as a way to get out of the city and breathe the fresh country air. ‚ÄúTo really last,‚Äù says the manager, seated on a Chesterfield sofa that‚Äôs really ever so British, ‚Äúthis sport must become more popular.‚Äù This article appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-29T13:35:24Z,world,World news,"Part war crimes trial, part performance art: tribunal investigates Congo conflict","No one knows exactly how many people have died in the past two decades in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but Milo Rau, a Swiss theatre director and journalist, puts the figure at six million. No one is quite sure why conflict has raged either, thanks to the labyrinthine complexity of the region: the alphabet soup of armed groups, the seeming lack of ideology and the shadowy involvement of neighbouring countries and multinational corporations. But Rau is determined to unravel at least some of these tangled threads. Today he will begin staging an unprecedented event ‚Äì part political inquiry, part verbatim theatre ‚Äì in eastern Congo itself, hearing evidence from players on all sides of the ongoing tragedy.
‚ÄúThere are no huge battles, there is no Stalingrad,‚Äù he says, explaining why Congo defies the single story that headline writers crave. ‚ÄúInstead you have massacres ‚Äì like the one in Mutarule in which 35 people died last year ‚Äì but they happen every day and, after 20 years, you have six million people dead and you don‚Äôt even have a trial. Through the tribunal we hope to simplify it and give it a human face.‚Äù Costing 900,000 euros (¬£643,969), The Congo Tribunal will take place across six days starting today, first in Bukavu, then later in June in Berlin, where in the 19th century the colonialist empires infamously gathered in a ‚Äúscramble‚Äù to carve up Africa.
‚ÄòNothing has changed‚Äô It took a year to put together a ‚Äúcast‚Äù, including Congolese government and opposition politicians, military officers and rebels, UN and World Bank mandarins and major mining companies, as well as ordinary Congolese citizens, philosophers, economists and lawyers who will all appear before an international jury. Rau, 38, is determined that it will not merely be an exercise in western corporation-bashing, and should differ from the Russell Tribunals on Vietnam and Palestine ‚Äì organised by Nobel-prize winning philosopher Bertrand Russell, and hosted by Jean-Paul Sartre in the 1960s.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not only leftwing people,‚Äù he continues, speaking from Bukavu via Skype. ‚ÄúWe have an advocate of a huge mining company and an advocate of the government. We also try to see it from the neoliberal side. It‚Äôs necessary to have these minerals to produce the computers we‚Äôre talking on. But the most important people are the miners and the citizens to tell what has happened.‚Äù Among these is Th√©ophile Gakinz, a pastor from Bukavu. ‚ÄúThe resources are badly divided,‚Äù he told Rau‚Äôs researchers. ‚ÄúA small group of people takes it all. The rest struggles in misery.‚Äù The tribunal will grapple with the region‚Äôs ethnic, political and economic dividing lines. It will look at the implications of assimilating former rebels into the Congolese government army, whether the UN and NGOs in the region have become a ‚Äúpeacekeeping industry‚Äù, and what impact, if any, American legislation against conflict minerals has had on the ground. Prince Kihangi, a civil society activist who will be on the jury in Bukavu, said: ‚ÄúThe US wants to appear righteous to the rest of the world. Officially they say, hey, we need a law that shows the world that we impose a ban. That we are not involved in this mafia. But because at the same time we need those minerals we must find other ways. ‚ÄúFor us, all these initiatives are fit for nothing. Absolutely worthless. Nothing has changed.‚Äù
The investigations This weekend the tribunal will first hear evidence about three local cases. One concerns the discovery of cassiterite [tin ore] on a hill in Bisie in 2002 that attracted numerous armed groups as well as the Congolese army, who walked away with most of the profits. Four years later a company acquired an exploration licence for the mine from the government, which led to an open conflict with the miners on the site. A key question for the tribunal will be: ‚ÄúDoes the industrial mining of the raw materials in Bisie contribute to the security and economical development of the region, or are the foreign mining companies the only ones who profit?‚Äù The second case examines what happened when a Canadian company bought a gold mining licence and wanted the local population to be relocated, causing conflict.
‚ÄúHas Banro profited from the political instability during the war in order to plunder the natural resources of eastern Congo, or are they pioneers of the industrialisation of the region?‚Äù Peter Mugisho, a local activist, says in a promotional video for the tribunal: ‚ÄúAfter the re-localisation they find themselves in a situation with no access to running water, no access to health services and no access to food. This is a method to exterminate the population.‚Äù The final case concerns a massacre in the village of Mutarule in June last year, resulting in 35 deaths. Although local authorities had repeatedly warned about increasing insecurity in the region, neither the nearby UN peacekeeping mission nor the Congolese army prevented the atrocity.
‚ÄúKey question: Is there no end to the insecurity in eastern Congo because too many local and international players are involved in the numerous conflicts and profit from them, or do they in fact prevent something even worse?‚Äù ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs up to us to protect ourselves‚Äô The tribunal ‚Äì backed by sponsors including the German and Swiss culture ministries ‚Äì moves to Berlin from 26 to 28 June, where it will examine the involvement of the European Union, the World Bank, the international community and multinational corporations. It will be filmed and turned into a documentary that will go on general release next year after a premiere at the Tata Raphael Stadium in Kinshasa ‚Äì where heavyweight boxers Muhammad Ali and George Foreman fought the Rumble in the Jungle in 1974. The project is a natural successor to Rau‚Äôs masterpiece Hate Radio, which reconstructs the broadcasting of a Rwandan radio station that combined pop music with propaganda that fuelled the 1994 genocide. Sylvestre Bisimwa, chief investigator at the Bukavu hearings, says on the video: ‚ÄúPeople say to themselves: the state doesn‚Äôt protect us. It‚Äôs up to us to protect ourselves. ‚ÄúThe victims are left with their pain. They carry their burden alone,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis tribunal will lead to a totally neutral and independent prosecution, and will form a base to fight exemption from punishment in Congo.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-29T13:19:17Z,world,World news,Planet's happiest human ‚Äì and his app,"The happiest man in the world does not own a house or car, or earn any money, and he spends three months each winter alone in a tiny Nepalese hermitage without home comforts or even any heating. Matthieu Ricard does, however, carry in his simple fabric bag a laptop in a padded case, and when our conversation is interrupted by the wail of a loud Himalayan chant, the 69-year-old Frenchman reaches into the depths of his saffron robes to pull out a smartphone, which he quickly silences. A lot of people might consider the key to happiness is getting rid of their technology, I suggest to Ricard. He is a molecular biologist turned Buddhist monk who, for almost a decade, has enjoyed (or laboured under) the title of the most content human on the planet. ‚ÄúI have [a phone] because once I drove for three days and spent one day travelling on horseback in Tibet, only to find that the people I had gone to see were not there,‚Äù he says with a grin. He also keeps his phone charged for safety reasons, having initially been given it in case his isolated mountaintop retreat was approached by Maoist rebels. Ricard is a little embarrassed by the ‚Äúhappiest man‚Äù title. He says it was first coined, perhaps inevitably, in a British newspaper headline, and calls it ‚Äúa total exaggeration‚Äù. But it does reflect the result of a striking piece of research published by neuroscientists in the 1990s which found that, while undergoing meditation, Ricard‚Äôs brain showed a degree of stimulation in areas associated with positive emotions and impulses that was previously unrecorded in scientific literature. Meditating for a long period of time, the University of Wisconsin research suggested, had the potential capacity to alter the brain, a finding which was interpreted more widely as an ability to train oneself in happiness. But while he is frequently described as a ‚Äúhappiness guru‚Äù ‚Äì publishing a book shortly afterwards called Happiness can‚Äôt have hurt ‚Äì Ricard says he was merely the first of many long-term meditators (after 60,000+ hours of meditation) studied who showed similar results. ‚ÄúMy friends tease me about it, you know, ‚Äòhere comes mister happy!‚Äô That‚Äôs OK. I‚Äôm not unhappy, for sure.‚Äù Alongside the robe, shaved head and close relationship with the Dalai Lama, Ricard, who has a manner that it is difficult to resist describing as twinkly, also has a nice line in self-deprecation. He has, at the moment, abandoned his mountain top to tour the world. He has been talking about a new book on altruism, and an app designed to teach meditation, and his last pitstop in Argentina entailed 17 interviews in two days. He resisted the app at first (‚Äúthey are a bit New Age-y, you feel like falling asleep when you hear those apps‚Äù), but finally agreed to something ‚Äúvery traditional‚Äù based on Buddhist tradition. The rest of Ricard‚Äôs time is spent running a small humanitarian NGO from his monastery in Nepal, to which all the revenue from his book sales and speaker fees is donated. The obvious question to be asked of Ricard is what there is to be so happy about when a devastating earthquake in Nepal has led to the deaths of thousands. Because evolution, he says, has equipped us to focus on danger and drama ‚Äúwe have this overwhelming feeling of this wicked world‚Äù. He says: ‚ÄúThe banality of goodness is overlooked. Of course there was a moment [after the earthquake] when everyone ran for their life. But immediately afterwards, there was calm, discipline, helping. They do it in solidarity.‚Äù He insists he sees signs of the perfectibility of humanity everywhere, claiming that globally violence rates are falling, and that signs of grassroots solidarity are everywhere. There is, he argues, ‚Äúsomething in the air‚Äù. He is well attuned to cynicism in any event, especially from ‚ÄúParisian intellectuals‚Äù; his late father, the distinguished philosopher Jean-Francois Revel, was one such, which may or may not be of relevance. But he is also by training and instinct a scientist, having begun studying Buddhism in the late 1960s at the same time as he was completing a PhD at the Pasteur Institute, in Paris. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt like slamming any doors,‚Äù he says of his decision to leave the scientific life for the contemplative one. ‚ÄúIt is that you cross a mountain pass and the next valley is so beautiful you want to settle there. It‚Äôs more like that.‚Äù He chooses to participate in studies on meditation to back up his thesis that altruism can make humans better people, and in so doing can nudge society, bit by bit, towards something better. I wonder how that message goes down at the World Economic Forum in Davos, at which Ricard has become an almost annual fixture, an event which one might conclude had been designed to drive the greatest optimist to despair. The happy monk doesn‚Äôt see it that way. Even among the masters of the financial universe, Ricard sees signs that encourage him. ‚ÄúI think if we can raise our voice and bring those ideas in every possible walk of life, whether in the hermitage, or when I was invited to speak at the UN about gross national happiness ‚Äì why not?‚Äù Meanwhile, he says, ongoing neurological studies suggest that you do not need to own a pair of sandals and have a Himalayan view to develop your capacity for positivity and compassion. Four weeks of ‚Äúcaring mindfulness‚Äù meditation for 20 minutes a day was also shown to alter the brain and enhance the immune system, he says. The lesson? ‚ÄúAnyone can be the happiest man or woman in the world if you look for happiness in the right place.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ This article was amended on 3 June 2015 to clarify a reference to Maoist rebels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-29T11:48:38Z,world,World news,Couchsurfing rapist Dino Maglio escaped investigation for months,"Women travelling in Italy were left at the mercy of a suspected serial rapist in the city of Padua for more than a year after authorities in Italy and the UK failed to cooperate on a rape complaint by a student that was filed in England in 2013. Italian authorities were sent a formal complaint, forwarded by British police, that alleged Dino Maglio had used the Couchsurfing.com website to lure a 20-year-old American woman to his home, and drug and rape her in spring 2013. But an investigation by the Guardian, in conjunction with journalists at the Investigative Reporting Project Italy (IRPI), into the handling of the case found that the complaint fell through bureaucratic cracks and was not investigated for months, despite the woman‚Äôs multiple attempts to pursue justice. Maglio was later convicted of drugging and raping a 16-year-old from Australia who had also stayed with him. According to witness statements more than 15 other women believe they were drugged and abused in the period between the first rape complaint and his arrest a year later. The lack of coordination highlights how rudimentary law-enforcement collaboration can be across the EU in anything other than major international conspiracy cases. Maglio, who went by the name of Leonardo on his Couchsurfing.com profile, is thought to have won the trust of his female guests because he was a police officer. Before he was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in jail last month, he confessed to spiking drinks with tranquillisers and sexually assaulting his victim as she slept. The American woman, Anna (not her real name), was still recovering from her ordeal when she went to a police station in Staffordshire, central England, in April 2013 and reported that she had been drugged and raped days earlier. ‚ÄúI was not in the best state of mind then, naturally; I was still trying to process what had happened,‚Äù said Anna, whose name has been changed to protect her identity. ‚ÄúMy report in a way helped me do that, reinforced the fact that I wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äòcrazy‚Äô ‚Äì that I was in fact a victim of a horrifying crime. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôm still trying to accept.‚Äù After drinking what she believed was a spiked cup of chamomile tea served by Maglio, she recalled feeling suddenly exhausted. The next 48 hours were a blur, but she told the police as many details as she could: how she had seen flashes of Leonardo naked, how he had professed his love for her, how he allegedly had sex with her, even as she slipped in and out of consciousness. She had not even been able to articulate the word ‚Äúno‚Äù. She had chosen Leonardo as a host because he was a police officer, which made her feel it was a safe choice. ‚ÄúAfterwards he took me to the subway. I took a couple of buses. I have no memory of that but I have tickets telling me I took those buses,‚Äù Anna said. Yet after the American‚Äôs statement, it was a year before police in Padua knocked on ‚ÄúLeonardo‚Äôs‚Äù door and arrested him. Police and prosecutors could have tried to stop Maglio earlier, but rules in Italy and and lack of clarity about division of international responsibilities ‚Äì and whose job it was to ensure that Anna‚Äôs complaint was pursued ‚Äì hampered the case. After leaving the Staffordshire police station, Anna recall ed she was told by officers that the process would be difficult and lengthy because her statement would have to be translated and sent to Italy. ‚ÄúAfter that, there was just silence. There shouldn‚Äôt be silence,‚Äù she said. Her complaint reached the desk of the prosecutor, Giorgio Falcone in Padua, in August 2013, but it was essentially meaningless under Italian law because it needed to be filed to an Italian authority before an investigation could be opened. Officials in the prosecutor‚Äôs office say they tried to reach Anna by the email address she had given Staffordshire police. But she said she never received any message. The university email address listed on the Italian translation of her statement, which has been seen by the Guardian, mis-spelt the name of her internationally known university in the US. Unable to find her, Falcone asked Interpol for help. Later that month ‚Äì four months after the initial rape complaint was made ‚Äìdocuments examined by the Guardian show that Interpol was in touch with the Italian police attache at the Italian embassy in London, Giampietro Moscatelli, who asked for his name to be passed to the victim. This information was sent to John Wincott, Anna‚Äôs contact in the Staffordshire police department, according to emails. By that time, Anna had returned to the US, but no one contacted her proactively, she said. When she sent an email to Wincott asking for an update in the case, he told her to file another complaint, this time at the Italian consulate in the US. ‚ÄúThe email was so incredibly unclear. I was just really confused about the whole process,‚Äù Anna said. In the meantime, Maglio continued hosting young women he met through Couchsurfing.com, and Anna was struggling to cope with what had happened to her. ‚ÄúIt really impacted me those first few months and my family,‚Äù she recalled. ‚ÄúI was untrusting of even my closest friends.‚Äù Although she says she felt intimidated by the situation, Anna filed another report of her alleged rape to the Italian consulate in New York in September 2013. The consulate then sent the report by email to the secretary of the president of the court in Padua, which should have sent it to the prosecutor. But Falcone‚Äôs office said it had never received it. Months later, in March 2014, Anna emailed Wincott again to find out if there was any progress on the investigation. He responded: ‚ÄúI hope you are well ‚Ä¶ I have heard nothing regarding your case and I probably won‚Äôt now it has progressed to Interpol ‚Ä¶ If you have a contact number for them that you went to see [sic] in the States give them [a call]. If you have any major issues get back to me and I‚Äôll see if i can find out for you.‚Äù Asked about its handling of the case, the Staffordshire police force told the Guardian that it had sent all relevant information to Interpol and that it then became Interpol‚Äôs responsibility to communicate with the victim. But Interpol offered a different story: it said its function was to act as a liaison between law enforcement officials in different jurisdictions. It declined to comment on the case. Maglio was arrested on rape charges involving the Australian 16-year-old weeks later, but Anna was never informed. In an October 2014 email to Wincott, she asked once again whether there was an update. He indicated there was not. ‚ÄúHope you are OK and let me know if you get an update,‚Äù he wrote. It was not until Anna was contacted last month by the Guardian that she learned Maglio had been arrested for rape, was about to face a verdict in his case, and was allegedly involved in a string of other assaults. ‚ÄúFor the past few days, I‚Äôve been incapacitated. I can‚Äôt bear to tell my family because I don‚Äôt like calling myself a number,‚Äù she said days after learning the news. Lisa Longstaff, a spokeswoman for Women Against Rape, a victim support and advocacy group, said the ‚Äúcareless‚Äù response to Anna‚Äôs complaint was typical in rape cases. ‚ÄúAnd if you ask me what is the reason, we say it is that rape has to be given a higher priority,‚Äù she said. Anna is now in contact with Falcone in Padua. The prosecutor is expected to call for a new trial against Maglio. This article was amended on 29 May 2015 to make clear that Anna is a pseudonym. A reference to a surname that was also used as a pseudonym has been removed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-29T10:54:07Z,world,World news,Merkel to meet Cameron with Germany in a spin over his EU demands,"Berlin‚Äôs rather bombastic cuboid chancellery building, with its round glass front, is known in the vernacular as the Washing Machine, so it‚Äôs a rather appropriate place for Angela Merkel to be meeting the man who has put Europe ‚Äì and not least Germany ‚Äì into a spin with his demands. Having greeted David Cameron on the red carpet with a military guard of honour outside Berlin‚Äôs chancellery on Friday, she has two aims in mind: to keep Britain in the European Union while appearing not to concede to his demands. If a Brexit were to happen on her watch she would consider it one of the failures of her tenure as German chancellor, her advisers have cautiously admitted. Having Berlin as the last stop on his ‚Äúroadshow for a new EU‚Äù ‚Äì as a Die Welt headline referred, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, to Cameron‚Äôs European trip ‚Äì could be seen as something of a boost for the pro-EU camp and puts a positive spin on the freshly elected leader‚Äôs charm offensive. He is welcome here in the most powerful EU country and, says Stefanie Bolzen in a commentary for Die Welt, the world‚Äôs most powerful woman ‚Äúis an unconditional apologist for keeping the kingdom in the union, despite all the infuriation surrounding Cameron‚Äôs manoeuvring‚Äù. Despite the frustrations over what the German government sees as Cameron‚Äôs rather overly confident approach, and the distinct impression that he is ‚Äúspoiling for a fight‚Äù, as Bolzen puts it, in a country more used to consensus than confrontation, there are few in Berlin who want to see Britain leave. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs indisputable that there‚Äôs no European land that, thanks to its history and its language, is so intertwined with the rest of the world. It is one of the UN‚Äôs five veto nations, it has ‚Ä¶ the hardest hitting army in Europe. And with its credo to keep the state small and its belief in the power of the individual, it is ‚Äì certainly for Berlin ‚Äì a reliable counterweight to the French.‚Äù Despite all the warm words Merkel and Cameron will say about each other following their lunchtime encounter, the Rhein Zeitung from Koblenz warns Cameron in an editorial that he is going to be ‚Äútaught a lesson‚Äù in Berlin. ‚ÄúThe EU will not and cannot allow its basic freedoms to be sacrificed on any old domestic political altar. Neither the freedom of movement nor the human rights or the employee protection laws are negotiable. The openness of the market needs to be subject to controls, controls that Cameron wishes to be renegotiated,‚Äù says the paper. ‚ÄúBut he will find himself talking to a brick wall.‚Äù The S√ºddeutsche Zeitung is optimistic about the fact that the question in the EU referendum ‚Äì ‚ÄúShould the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?‚Äù ‚Äì will demand a negative response from anyone who wishes Britain to leave the EU, and that yes campaigns often have more of a chance of success. But Axel Sch√§fer, the deputy leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, warned Britain to hurry up with the referendum. ‚ÄúThe quicker the better,‚Äù he told DPA. ‚ÄúThe impasse which would result if a referendum is not held until the end of 2017 would be bad for the country and for the EU.‚Äù Merkel will likely insist on the same. German business leaders too have warned that a referendum should happen sooner rather than later, and that 400,000 British jobs that are dependent on trade with Germany could be at risk if Britain leaves. Growing numbers of German companies in Britain have said they are plotting their departure in the case of a Brexit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-29T10:30:03Z,world,World news,Pentagon anthrax blunder reveals 'chain of errors' in government lab protocols,"Scientists say the accidental shipment by the US army of live anthrax from a laboratory in Utah could point to deficiencies in the military‚Äôs system for handling the bacteria.
On Wednesday, Pentagon officials told reporters that Dugway Proving Ground in Utah had inadvertently shipped live anthrax to commercial labs in nine states ‚Äì California, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee, Virginia, Texas and Wisconsin ‚Äì and South Korea. The shipments reportedly began in March 2014, when the anthrax was reported to be inactivated after being irradiated. Shipments of the pathogen continued through April 2015, Reuters reported. Officials have said the mistake did not pose a risk to the public, though four civilians have been placed on a preventative course of medication, which usually includes antibiotics. Twenty-two workers in South Korea are being treated preventatively. Military officials said army technicians believed they had inactivated the bacteria at the time it was sent, and that all protocols appeared to have been followed. ‚ÄúThe best I can tell there was not human error,‚Äù chief of staff Raymond Odierno told reporters on Thursday, Reuters reported, while cautioning that the information was based solely on preliminary reports. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is investigating the failure. But beyond a broad sketch of the events that led the dangerous pathogen to be shipped to commercial labs, officials at the Department of Defense have released little information. Rather than respond to a list of questions from the Guardian, the department provided a statement recapping reported facts in the story. It is unclear, for example, what protocols were in place to inactivate the bacteria, and to confirm that status before the anthrax was shipped and received. ‚ÄúThe incident involved exactly the same chain of errors as the CDC shipments of live anthrax bacteria in 2006 and 2014,‚Äù Richard H Ebright, professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, told the Guardian in an email. Ebright said technicians failed to ‚Äúinactivate a sample, followed by a failure to confirm inactivation before shipping the sample, followed by ‚Ä¶ a failure to confirm inactivation upon receiving the sample‚Äù. ‚ÄúThis seems to be a problem that happens pretty regularly,‚Äù said Gigi Kwik Gronvall, a senior associate at the Center for Health Security at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland. ‚ÄúEven if people are not following the protocol ‚Ä¶ then perhaps the protocol should be modified to make sure it‚Äôs easier to follow, and more likely to bring about compliance. It‚Äôs more, to me, that not enough is known about the situation.‚Äù Gronvall noted that the military had made a point of reporting the incident. ‚ÄúIn many other, different places in the world there would be no notice that something happened incorrectly,‚Äù she said. In some cases, clearing laboratories appears to have been left to state officials, as in New Jersey. There, state health, environmental and police hazardous materials responders were sent to the private lab. Eleven months ago, a similar incident played out at CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. There, a lack of ‚Äústandard operating procedures‚Äù led to dozens of employees being exposed to anthrax after a high-containment laboratory inadvertently sent live anthrax to labs with lower contaminant levels, where workers were not equipped to handle such dangerous pathogens. The mistake happened after workers did not fully inactivate a pathogenic strain of the bacteria. Normally labs irradiate anthrax, but scientists at the CDC were working on new methods to inactivate the material for local health departments that might not have expensive irradiation machines. Both Ebright and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) have been critical of the government‚Äôs expansion of high-containment laboratories without an overarching regulatory body. ‚ÄúThere are approximately 1,500 US laboratories authorized to work with fully active, fully virulent, biological weapons agents,‚Äù said Ebright, who has worked to sound the alarm on lab safety since funding increased in 2002. ‚ÄúThis number is too large by a factor of 10 to 20.‚Äù Because labs have at least some risk of making mistakes with such agents, the GAO and Ebright said the more labs, the bigger the risk to the public. At least three agencies, including the defense department, the CDC and the Department of Agriculture, oversee such labs, and regulators largely rely on ‚Äúself-policing‚Äù, the GAO reported. ‚ÄúOversight is critical in improving biosafety and ensuring that high-containment laboratories comply with regulations,‚Äù the report said. ‚ÄúHowever, our work has found that aspects of the current oversight programs ‚Ä¶ depend on entities‚Äô monitoring themselves and reporting incidents to the regulators.‚Äù Stopping the spread of such bacteria is just one problem with such a diffuse system. The GAO also found that labs could duplicate efforts and waste taxpayer money without coordinated government oversight. More labs began working with dangerous agents like anthrax in the 1990s, but the number grew substantially after a number of anthrax-laced letters were sent to lawmakers and media outlets through the US Postal Service in 2001. Since then, the CDC has led the investment of at least $9bn in state and local health agencies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-29T07:51:20Z,world,World news,No relief from India heatwave as death toll reaches 20-year high,"India‚Äôs blistering heatwave will continue for at least another 48 hours, weather officials have said, raising the possibility that the death toll could reach 2,000. About 1,800 people are thought to have died in a week of temperatures touching 48 degrees in some places, the highest number of casualties for more than 20 years. Hospitals across the country have struggled to cope. Lakshmi Singh, a teacher who had brought her four-year-old son to a major government clinic in south Delhi, said: ‚ÄúI have been waiting for five hours to be seen by a doctor. We had no power all night because of the cuts and my little boy is sick now. He is vomiting and has [a] headache.‚Äù Officials at the clinic said most of those who sought help were severely dehydrated and that the old, the very young and the poor had been hardest hit. Hundreds die at the height of summer every year in India, but this year‚Äôs figures are already the highest since 1995, when official data showed 1,677 people succumbed to the heat. Southern India has borne the brunt of the sudden spell of hot, dry weather with the states of Telengana and Andhra Pradesh suffering most. The monsoon, predicted to hit southern India‚Äôs coastline on 31 May, will bring relief from the high temperatures, but it will not reach the parched north of the country for several weeks. In Delhi, children tried to cool off in the ornamental pools around the presidential palace in the centre of the city. Adults sought out the air-conditioned metro and shopping malls. Many were unable to escape the heat however. Raj Thakur, a traffic policeman, said: ‚ÄúI do a 14-hour shift and am suffering a lot. I try to drink water as much as is possible. At night I cannot sleep either and I am not eating well.‚Äù Tourists have fled the city for hill resorts such as Simla and Mussoorie in the foothills of the Himalayas. Temperatures have topped 45 degrees in Delhi, the capital, in recent days. The highest ever recorded in the city is 47.2 degrees, in May 1944.
Earlier this week temperatures of nearly 48 were recorded in Allahabad, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, and in Telengana, in the south. The record for India is thought to be 50.6C, recorded in 1956 in the northern town of Alwar. In some rural areas of India said they were ‚Äúgetting on with life‚Äù. Rubina Parisa, from a small coastal village in Odisha, the poor eastern state, said: ‚ÄúThere are lots of weddings. You can‚Äôt stop everything just because it is hot. It‚Äôs hot every summer anyway, and at least we don‚Äôt have pollution here like in the cities.‚Äù Local authorities have launched awareness campaigns, telling people to stay indoors, drink fluids and wear cool clothing. Many of the casualties have been homeless people or day labourers, among the poorest sections of society. Experts said compiling casualty statistics for heatwaves was extremely difficult owing to the challenges of attributing cause of death and registering fatalities in remote areas. Climate experts said the number of days when temperatures approached 45 degrees has increased in the past 15 years and that nocturnal temperatures in India‚Äôs cities have risen significantly as a result of overcrowding. ‚ÄúThe number of heatwave days may go up from about five to between 30 and 40 every year,‚Äù Arjuna Srinidhi, of the Centre for Science and Environment, told the Hindu newspaper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-29T06:16:02Z,world,World news,Women barred from voting in parts of Pakistan,"In some of the most socially conservative regions of Pakistan this weekend‚Äôs local government elections will be men-only affairs. Local politicians and elders say parties contesting elections for district and village council seats in Hangu and parts of Malakand, districts of the north-western province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), have struck deals barring women from voting. There are fears of similar arrangements across KP, a province bordering Afghanistan where many Pashtun communities observe purdah traditions so strict that many female candidates do not publish photographs on election posters. The cultural difficulties are often compounded by dire security in areas where the Taliban and other militant groups are active. In a parliamentary byelection in Lower Dir this month, none of the eligible 50,000 women in the constituency turned out to vote. One report said mosques broadcast warnings to women, and polling stations were guarded by ‚Äúbaton-wielding men‚Äù who blocked the few women who did try to vote. On Wednesday the high court in Peshawar threw out a petition lodged by 12 women from Lower Dir who demanded the election be re-run. Shahab Khattak, the women‚Äôs lawyer, said the case was dismissed after 15 minutes, during which the judge seemed unsure whether women really were entitled to vote. ‚ÄúThe honourable judge asked whether it was a fundamental right for women to vote,‚Äù Khattak said. ‚ÄúWe said indeed it is a fundamental right and a constitutional right. ‚ÄúThat there has been massive discrimination against women should be clear from the zero participation at the polls.‚Äù Siraj-ul-Haq, leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamist party that jointly controls the KP government, argued that the women of Lower Dir had merely chosen to respect local traditions by not voting. Jamaat-e-Islami governs KP in coalition with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), which is led by the former cricketer Imran Khan. One of the PTI‚Äôs elected provincial representatives told the Guardian that the party had been complicit in keeping women away from the ballot box in KP, including in this weekend‚Äôs poll in Hangu. In the runup to the 2013 general election the PTI in Upper Dir signed a written agreement with other parties barring women from voting and stipulating large fines for anyone breaking the agreement. In the end just one woman‚Äôs vote was recorded. Ijaz Khan, a professor at Peshawar University, said political parties were to blame for not challenging social pressures in the most ‚Äúbackward‚Äù areas of the province. ‚ÄúIn order to win the seat they refuse to take a strong stance with their local chapter,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe PTI may have women who go to their meetings in Islamabad or Lahore, but in the more traditional areas the party compromises on women‚Äôs rights.‚Äù The courts and the provincial government have shown little interest in pursuing the issue of the Lower Dir byelection, but the election commission is investigating. It said it had taken ‚Äúserious notice‚Äù of reports that women would be prevented from voting this weekend. Saima Munir, of the Aurat Foundation, a campaign group, said that if the election commission nullified the result and disqualified the winning candidate it would force dramatic change in the province. Nida Khan, a women‚Äôs activist in Hangu, said elders in her community would continue to act with impunity. ‚ÄúThere is no government writ in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need any Taliban since our so-called politicians with their extremist mindset are enough to push women into the dark.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-29T06:12:12Z,world,World news,Mount Shindake: the moment Japan's volcano erupts in spectacular fashion,"More than 100 people have been ordered to evacuate after a volcano erupted on the tiny southern Japanese island of Kuchinoerabu on Friday morning. Spectacular TV footage captured the moment Mount Shindake exploded, sending columns of thick, black smoke high into the air. Japan‚Äôs meteorological agency raised the alert level to five ‚Äì the highest on its scale ‚Äì and ordered the island‚Äôs 140 residents to evacuate. The agency said no injuries or damage had been reported following the eruption, which occurred eight months after 57 people died after Mount Ontake in central Japan erupted without warning. The agency added that pyroclastic flows, dense currents of rock fragments and hot gases from the volcano had reached the island‚Äôs north-west shore. In Tokyo, the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, set up an emergency response team and dispatched a self-defence force to the island. Abe said he had instructed local authorities to do ‚Äúeverything possible‚Äù to ensure the islanders‚Äô safety. Yoshihide Suga, the government‚Äôs chief spokesman, said a coastguard vessel had also been sent to help residents evacuate. A local official said the eruption, which occurred without warning, had forced about 100 people to take shelter at an evacuation centre. ‚ÄúThere was a really loud sound of an explosion, and then black smoke rose, darkening the sky,‚Äù Nobuaki Hayashi told the national broadcaster NHK. ‚ÄúIt smells of sulphur.‚Äù
Hayashi said several people were yet to be accounted for, and others had yet to reach the evacuation shelter because they were travelling by boat. ‚ÄúThe skies here are blue, but smoke is still rising to the west,‚Äù he said. Photographs by Twitter user @TAKUYAbluewhale, who was on the nearby island of Yakushima, show a huge plume of smoke rising nine kilometres into the sky. ‚ÄúThe eruption happened right before my eyes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe seismic force of the eruption was incredible.‚Äù The manager of a guesthouse on the island told Kyodo News the sound of the blast was ‚Äútremendous‚Äù and that she had immediately taken shelter. Kuchinoerabu island is located about 80km (50 miles) south-west of the main island of Kyushu, and can be reached only by a once-a-day ferry from Yakushima island, 19km (12 miles) to the east.
Residents live with the constant threat of a volcanic eruption; Mount Shindake, located about 650 metres above sea level, erupted in August 2014 for the first time since 1980. Friday‚Äôs eruption occurred just before 10am local time, the meteorological agency said, adding it had previously imposed restrictions on climbing in the area. Authorities in Japan, which is dotted with active volcanoes, are taking a more cautious approach following criticism that they had failed to warn hikers of increased volcanic activity before the Ontake tragedy last September. They recently closed part of a popular hot spring resort about 80 kilometers from Tokyo amid fears that nearby Mount Hakone could erupt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-29T06:00:02Z,world,World news,Is this the end for Belarus and Russia's 'brotherly love'?,"The speed with which the Kremlin has become hostile towards its neighbour Ukraine has left many in Belarus fearful of Russian aggression, or even an incursion across their own border. Throughout his 21-year rule president Alexander Lukashenko has traditionally held close political, economic and military ties with Russia. However he‚Äôs also maintained that although the two countries ‚Äúare like brothers‚Äù, Belarus is a separate and autonomous state. Clearly unsettled by the recent war between Russian-backed separatists and national army forces in eastern Ukraine, Lukashenko has now stepped up a campaign to strengthen his country‚Äôs ties to Europe, sending envoys to European capitals and welcoming embassies from the EU and US. He has also been cautious to address the subject of Russian influence: in April, the president raised concerns about the rise of pro-Russian NGOs in Belarus. He suggested that extremist Russian groups were active in his country and claimed he had ‚Äútaken measures against them‚Äù. The pro-government Centre for Strategic and Geopolitical studies has also launched a blog aimed at tracking what they say are attempts by some parts of the Russian elite to destabilise Belarus. Fault lines Fears have also been heightened by a number of articles in the Russian media. The online newspaper Sputnik i Pogrom recently ran an opinion piece claiming that three of Belarus‚Äôs six regions were in fact ‚Äúreceived as a gift from Soviet Russia‚Äù ‚Äì a notion that was popularised about Crimea too before its annexation. Leaked text message correspondence between a Russian high official has suggested that the website may have been under the Kremlin‚Äôs protection. A columnist for Russia‚Äôs Vzglyad website has also stoked the fire by arguing that Lukashenko should hold a referendum on Belarus‚Äôs accession into the Russian Federation this autumn, otherwise ‚Äú[the country] in its current form would be eliminated‚Äù.
Beyond the rhetoric, the Russian annexation of Crimea and its hand in the rebellions in eastern Ukraine has revealed significant cracks in the relationship between Belarus and its powerful neighbour. In the face of the pro-Russian separatist violence in eastern Ukraine, Lukashenko has been vocal in saying the country must not split, and has pledged his support for western-backed Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, offering him ‚Äúthe friendship of the Belarusian people‚Äù. The president has also voiced veiled criticism of Putin: though careful not to mention the Russian president directly, Lukashenko said in a March press conference that he is no longer ‚ÄúEurope‚Äôs last dictator‚Äù, seen as a hint at his eastern counterpart.
He also warned that wherever military aggression comes from, the country would defend its autonomy: ‚Äúone should be cautious with Russia‚Äù, he said. Alexander Milinkevich, the chairman for the opposition party, Movement for Freedom, claims the country‚Äôs sovereignty has been immensely endangered: ‚ÄúPutin has purposely tried to exhume the Soviet Union,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAt the moment there‚Äôs absolutely no ground for the Russians to intrude, but Russia, the expert in fabrications, can easily make up some‚Äù, he added. ‚ÄúA thought has matured in ruling circles that we have lost years without serious co-operation with the European Union,‚Äù says Milinkevich. ‚ÄúBut as soon as Belarus voices her wish to make friends with Europe, then Russia will start behaving aggressively ‚Äì as sure as a gun‚Äù. He suggests it‚Äôs Lukashenko‚Äôs distancing from Moscow that could provide a possible pretext for Russian aggression. ‚ÄòImperial hysteria‚Äô The former founder of the Tell the Truth campaign Vladimir Neklyaev ‚Äì who ran against Lukashenko in the 2010 elections ‚Äì believes it‚Äôs not Putin who is a menace to Belarus‚Äôs independence, but the nationalist forces that have been awoken by his actions in Ukraine. He says an increasingly powerful segment of Russian society don‚Äôt see Belarus or Ukraine as independent nations, and that their views are rapidly acquiring influence within the Russian political elite. Belarus could become an easy target for its neighbour‚Äôs ‚Äúimperial hysteria‚Äù, he said. Yuri Tsarik, a pro-Russian and pro-government Belarusian political scientist believes a more credible guess about Russia‚Äôs future plan would be an economic offensive on Minsk ‚Äì a tactic Moscow has used before.
In the early 2000s Russia suspended gas transportation to Belarus as a way of keeping Lukashenko‚Äôs government in line. In 2010 and 2011 the Kremlin cut its discounted oil supplies that fuel Belarus‚Äôs gasoline production, and threatened to do so again in 2013. Last year, it blocked much of Belarus‚Äôs $4.5bn foodstuff exports to Russia. Belarusians now fear they‚Äôre trapped in a no-win situation: if Lukashenko cows to Moscow, Belarus could return to its place as a Russian frontier land, as it was during Soviet rule. But if Lukashenko tries to diversify his foreign policy and makes new friends in Europe, it‚Äôs possible the Kremlin could respond with aggression ‚Äì both pose a threat to Belarus‚Äôs independence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-29T05:38:42Z,world,World news,Palestinian Football Association to push ahead for Israel's suspension from Fifa,"The Palestinian Football Association will push ahead Friday for a vote calling for the suspension of Israel from the world football organisation at Fifa‚Äôs scandal-riven congress in Zurich. Despite last-ditch attempts at mediation by world football officials, the Palestinian delegation insisted it would push for a vote unless Israel expels five teams based in illegal Israeli settlements from its football league. The five teams are Ma‚Äôaleh Adumim, Ariel, Kiryat Arba, Bik‚Äôat Hayarden and Givat Ze‚Äôev ‚Äì which play in Israel‚Äôs lower divisions. ‚ÄúCompromise is possible on issues like movement of [Palestinian] players and equipment, if a mechanism can be agreed,‚Äù a member of the Palestinian delegation told the Guardian. ‚ÄúBut no compromise is possible on the settlement teams continued playing in Israel‚Äôs league.‚Äù The comments came as it appeared that the Palestinian vote might require less than the widely reported 75% of the 209 member delegations to back Israel‚Äôs suspension. Palestinian officials believe that ‚Äì in the first instance ‚Äì they require only a straight majority under Fifa rules with 75% being required to ratify and renew a suspension. If the vote does takes place it will be in a secret ballot. There has been confusion over what precise numbers are required to suspend Israel, with Fifa officials previously insisting that a 75% majority was required. Both Palestinian and Israeli delegations in Zurich have been working around the clock since arriving in the midst of the biggest scandal to hit the world football organisation. Twin Swiss and US investigations focussing on a far-reaching culture of kickbacks in Fifa have thrown the congress in Zurich into chaos, including both the re-election bid of Fifa president Sepp Blatter and other business on the agenda including the Palestinian bid to have Israel suspended. Israel has sought the support of the European regional grouping UEFA of which it is a member to vote against the proposed suspension. Its efforts to avoid a vote ‚Äì which some see as damaging in itself as a vote for suspension ‚Äì have seen it enlist Israel‚Äôs ministry of foreign affairs as well as the lobbying of key Fifa officials. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, weighed in on Thursday, telling reporters that if Israel is suspended ‚Äúit would be a blatant politicisation of sport and the result will be Fifa‚Äôs collapse‚Äù. Mediation efforts led by Blatter, who visited Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories last week, has made progress on some issues. According to Blatter, he reached agreement with Netanyahu on several key areas, including providing laissez passer documents to Palestinian athletes, referees and sports officials; an exemption from customs on all sports equipment to the Palestinian Football Association and the establishment of a committee to hear disagreements. Israel is however refusing to budge on a final critical issue ‚Äì the Palestinian demand to suspend Israeli teams based in the occupied territories. At a meeting on Thursday, Blatter reportedly suggested to Israel that on the issue of the five settlement teams Fifa could approach the UN which would be asked to determine if they were on Israeli territory ‚Äì an offer declined by Ofer Eini, the Israeli Football Association chairman. Commenting on the continued push for a vote, the head of the Palestinian Football Association, Jibril Rajoub, said: ‚ÄúFor years, I talked to anyone I could so that Israel would change its policy and be fair in how it treated Palestinian athletes. It was in vain. ‚ÄúIn the end, there was no choice but to go to Fifa and ask it to protect the Palestinian athletes. And now, either there will be a solution that will make it possible for us to practice sports, or reach a situation that I don‚Äôt wish on anyone, and that is suspension. But who is responsible for this? I think it is the Israeli government.‚Äù Israeli analysts were torn over the impact the Fifa corruption scandal might have on an eventual vote, with some predicting that delegates might want to avoid further controversy in an already fraught congress. Speaking to the Israeli website Walla, Rotem Kamer, chief executive of the Israeli Football Association, said the combination of the corruption scandal and Blatter‚Äôs bid for re-election had complicated issues. ‚ÄúThere is no way of knowing which way the vote will go when Blatter is seeking re-election. There is no doubt that [Blatter] can be pressured, also because of the affair that has just exploded. He needs the Arab votes and it could be that to this end, Israel will have to be sacrificed.‚Äù In the runup to the vote both Palestinian and Israelis were trying to voice optimism about the outcome, with Israel suggesting it had assurances from some 70% of delegations. For its part Palestinian officials were equally confidant about the vote. ‚ÄúIt is not a question of how many vote for us,‚Äù said one, ‚Äúbut at this stage how many actually vote against the motion.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-29T01:00:07Z,world,World news,"Yemen: anti-aircraft fire cause of most civilian casualties in Sana'a, report says","Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have caused the majority of civilian casualties in the nation‚Äôs capital Sana‚Äôa by firing anti-aircraft munitions that explode after landing in populated areas, a leading human rights watchdog has said in a report published two months into a Saudi-led air war. Amnesty International said anti-aircraft weapons ‚Äúwere the leading cause of casualties in the capital‚Äù in a report released on Thursday, which also blamed the Saudi-led coalition for contributing to the number of civilian casualties by bombing weapons depots near residential areas.
The report‚Äôs findings, gleaned from a week-long visit to Sana‚Äôa and interviews with hospital staff, challenge the conventional wisdom that the air strikes are the direct cause of the high civilian toll of the conflict. But Amnesty urged both sides to take precautions to avoid civilian casualties and respect international humanitarian law. The World Health Organisation said that almost 2,000 people have been killed and nearly 8,000 wounded since 19 March. Wednesday was the deadliest day in the campaign, with 80 people killed. ‚ÄúSana‚Äôa‚Äôs residents are caught in a deadly crossfire between the Saudi Arabian-led coalition airstrikes and anti-aircraft fire from the Houthi armed group,‚Äù said Lama Fakih, senior crisis adviser at Amnesty. ‚ÄúBoth sides have failed to take the necessary precautions to protect civilian lives in violation of the laws of war. Instead they have carried out attacks that have had devastating consequences for the civilian population. For the civilians affected, it doesn‚Äôt matter which side is responsible. They pay the same price.‚Äù The Houthi rebels, members of the Zaydi sect of Shia Islam who hail from the northern province of Sa‚Äôada, took control of the capital in a surprise offensive last year and placed the president, Abed Rabbu Mansour Hadi, under house arrest. Hadi later escaped to his stronghold in Aden and fled to Saudi Arabia as the Houthis and their allies bore down on the southern port city. A coalition of mostly Arab Sunni states, led by Saudi Arabia, launched air strikes in response to the advance of the Houthis. The coalition sees the Houthis as proxies of Iran, and are unnerved by the Islamic Republic‚Äôs influence in Damascus, Baghdad, Beirut and Sana‚Äôa.
Doctors in the Yemeni capital told Amnesty that most of the wounded treated in their medical facilities arrived with injuries caused by anti-aircraft weapons, including fragmentation wounds. Saudi air strikes on weapons depots also caused secondary explosions that killed or maimed civilians, Amnesty said. Many military bases in the capital are located close to civilian homes, a deliberate strategy by former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was ousted in Arab Spring-style protests and has now allied with the Houthis. ‚ÄúSo far, both sides have displayed a chilling indifference to the deadly impact of their actions on civilians,‚Äù Fakih said. ‚ÄúAll parties to the conflict can and should take all feasible steps to minimise the risk to civilians.‚Äù Air strikes resumed last week in Yemen after a five-day ceasefire, further worsening humanitarian conditions in the Arab world‚Äôs poorest country. Poverty relief charity Oxfam said on Monday that 16 million Yemenis, or two-thirds of the population, are now without access to a clean water supply and sanitation. Unicef said that as many as 135 children have been killed and 260 injured since the conflict escalated in March.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-28T19:18:04Z,world,World news,Khorasan: are Syria's mysterious 'strangers with horses' a threat to the west?,"In Idlib province, they are known as ‚Äúthe strangers with the horses‚Äù. Among the senior ranks of Jabhat al-Nusra, they are referred to as ‚Äúour friends‚Äù. In Europe and the US, the small band of jihadis is known by the contentious name ‚ÄúKhorasan‚Äù and blamed for hatching plots to attack the west. All seem to agree on one thing: just what the highly secretive group is up to in northern Syria remains one of the civil war‚Äôs enduring mysteries. This week, the leader of Jabhat al-Nusra claimed there was no such group as Khorasan and said he had been directed by al-Qaida‚Äôs central leadership to concentrate his group‚Äôs energies on Syria. Abu Mohamed al-Jolani‚Äôs remarks, in an interview with al-Jazeera, were the first time that al-Nusra ‚Äì a jihadi organisation with links to al-Qaida and a formidable player in the Syrian war ‚Äì had addressed the issue of Khorasan, which the US accuses of collaborating with al-Nusra to target western interests outside of Syria. The remarks were immediately rejected by western officials and residents of Idlib. Two senior Islamists with close links to al-Nusra have also outlined to the Guardian in recent weeks their understanding of Khorasan‚Äôs intent and its close ties to homegrown jihadi groups. ‚ÄúUntil recently they wanted nothing to do with the Syrian war,‚Äù said one ranking official. ‚ÄúThey only wanted to use Syria as a stadium for whatever they were up to elsewhere. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs different now. In the attack on Idlib city they played a direct role. They co-ordinated most of the dangerous attacks. Without them, Idlib would not have fallen.‚Äù
The claim that Khorasan had played a direct role in helping jihadi and mainstream elements of the Syrian opposition seize a major city marks the first time that any official has been prepared to acknowledge working alongside the group. ‚ÄúThey are a very big secret, you know,‚Äù the official said. ‚ÄúThey work directly for [al-Qaida leader Ayman] al-Zawahiri.‚Äù Until recently, all residents and jihadis interviewed by the Guardian had painted a picture of a remote and impenetrable outfit that kept entirely to itself and whose members regularly moved to avoid US air strikes. On the first night of a US-led air campaign, ostensibly to attack the Islamic State group last September, three bases for Jabhat al-Nusra and a second jihadi group, Ahrar al-Sham, were bombed in the opening salvoes. The attacks killed more than 70 militants and Washington claimed to have struck cells of leaders who had been seconded to Khorasan and tasked with scoping for targets outside of Syria. Both groups quickly denied any connection to Khorasan, and vowed vengeance against the US. Al-Nusra officials claimed they had not heard of Khorasan, leading the US to claim it had been monitoring its growth for more than two years as the opposition landscape had splintered and radicalised in parts of Syria‚Äôs north. Two local residents say the people they referred to as ‚Äúthe strangers with horses‚Äù first moved into the Idlib countryside early in 2013. ‚ÄúThey were from all the places that end in ‚Äòstans‚Äô,‚Äù said one man. ‚ÄúUzbekistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, places like that. ‚ÄúThey dressed like Osama bin Laden‚Äôs mujahideen and they slept in the forests with their horses next to them. Big, beautiful stallions. They wanted nothing to do with us, or any of the opposition groups.‚Äù A second resident said that the group was known locally as Khorasan by the end of 2013. ‚ÄúAlthough it became difficult to know who was directly with them and who was with [al-Nusra]. They started to become similar. ‚ÄúBut until the Americans bombed them, we didn‚Äôt know what they were up to. And we still don‚Äôt.‚Äù One senior jihadi confirmed to the Guardian that the group‚Äôs leader was Muhsin al-Fadhli, a veteran of al-Qaida who had travelled to Syria at the beginning of 2013 along with a small number of other members of Ayman al-Zawahiri‚Äôs inner circle. The US government claims that al-Fadhli, a Kuwaiti, was one of the few Bin Laden confidantes who knew about the 9/11 attacks ahead of them being carried out. The Pentagon claimed to have killed al-Fadhli during an air strike on 22 September, but later said he had survived the strike. A French jihadi, David Drugeon, was believed to have been badly wounded. Critics of the US decision to fight Isis in Syria and Iraq point to Khorasan‚Äôs complete lack of profile before the air strikes and claim its emergence was a convenient pretext to justify intervention. Local officials, though, say the group was gathering strength throughout 2014. One official said Khorasan leaders now remained on the move to avoid air strikes. ‚ÄúEverywhere they go, the Americans are looking for them,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTheir houses get blown up all the time. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt doubt that they are planning something outside Syria. But it is impossible to know. There are no Syrians working directly for them. Only big men from al-Qaida. To be honest, when they worked with Nusra in Idlib, it was the first time.‚Äù In denying Khorasan‚Äôs existence, or being linked to any plan to attack targets outside of Syria, Jolani appeared to be positioning al-Nusra as a more palatable jihadi current, distinct from the unchecked savagery of Isis. However, western officials say Khorasan remain near the top of the list of potential threats to the US, the UK and Europe, with no sign that any order from Zawahiri had eased the threat. ‚ÄúThey are more prominent than before,‚Äù said the second Nusra-aligned leader. ‚ÄúThe one thing that hasn‚Äôt changed though is that no one wants to speak about them.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-28T17:12:45Z,world,World news,Vladimir Putin declares all Russian military deaths state secrets,"Vladimir Putin has declared that all military deaths will be classified as state secrets not just in times of war but also in peace ‚Äì a move that activists worry might further discourage the reporting of Russian soldiers‚Äô deaths in Ukraine. The Russian president has amended a decree to extend the list of state secrets to include information on casualties during special operations when war has not been declared, among other changes. Previously, the list had only forbidden (pdf) ‚Äúrevealing personnel losses in wartime‚Äù. He has repeatedly denied any involvement of Russian troops in a pro-Russian rebellion in Ukraine. Putin‚Äôs spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists that the changes were not connected to the conflict in Ukraine. Revealing state secrets is punishable by up to seven years in prison. Rights advocate Valentina Melnikova, secretary of the Union of Soldiers‚Äô Mothers Committees, said the decree simply legalised the common practice of withholding information on all military losses, which had been done since Soviet times. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what [the new decree] is connected with, but the bolsheviks and Russian authorities never revealed any casualty numbers, except after South Ossetia,‚Äù she said, referring to the 2008 conflict during which Russian troops established control of the Georgian breakaway region. ‚ÄúIt was always considered a state secret. Now Putin has just made this official.‚Äù Sergei Krivenko, a member of the presidential human rights council, said the decree ‚Äúraises many questions‚Äù and could serve to intimidate activists, journalists or relatives who report the deaths of Russian soldiers in eastern Ukraine. ‚ÄúIf we lived in a state governed by the rule of law, this decree would only affect officials. Those who have this information don‚Äôt have the right to publish it, that‚Äôs what this decree is about,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut in the situation we‚Äôre in now ‚Ä¶ almost any citizen can be punished for revealing information, so long as the authorities decide that this information hurts the country‚Äôs interests.‚Äù Earlier this month, one of two Russian men who were captured by Ukrainian forces during a clash with pro-Russian rebels said on camera that he was a member of the Russian special forces. Coverage of Russian soldiers‚Äô presence in Ukraine is virtually taboo on state-controlled television, which portrays Russians fighting there as volunteers. At least 276 Russian soldiers have been killed in Ukraine, according to a list of names compiled by Open Russia, an organisation started by Kremlin critic and former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Reuters witnessed Russian troops and hundreds of pieces of weaponry near the border with Ukraine this week, providing evidence of a large-scale military buildup. Also this month, colleagues of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, who was murdered near the Kremlin in February, presented a report with evidence of Russian military operations in eastern Ukraine. Relatives of dead servicemen and returned soldiers have been reluctant to speak out about the conflict. Activist Ilya Yashin told the Guardian that while working on the Nemtsov report he had met relatives of 17 soldiers from Ivanovo who were killed in Ukraine, but they had signed a pledge of secrecy and were afraid to go on record. This week, US congressman Mac Thornberry said the Russian armed forces were ‚Äútrying to hide their casualties‚Äù by deploying mobile crematoria to eastern Ukraine. Putin‚Äôs spokesman called the statement untrustworthy, and the US State Department reportedly declined to confirm the report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-28T16:34:11Z,world,World news,Photographer jailed for multi-billion euro Bettencourt exploitation,"A French celebrity photographer has been found guilty and sentenced to two and a half years in prison for exploiting the mental frailty of Liliane Bettencourt, the ageing L‚ÄôOr√©al shampoo heiress, who showered him with gifts including Picasso paintings, life insurance funds and millions of euros in cash. Fran√ßois-Marie Banier, who had befriended Bettencourt, 25 years his senior, arguing that he was the only person who made her laugh, was given a three-year sentence ‚Äì six months of which was suspended ‚Äì and ordered to pay a fine of ‚Ç¨250,000 and pay back over ‚Ç¨15m to the Bettencourt family. But judges cleared Eric Woerth, a former minister in Nicolas Sarkozy‚Äôs government and campaign treasurer for his 2007 presidential campaign. He was acquitted of charges of exploiting Bettencourt‚Äôs frailty by taking an envelope of cash from the weak and elderly billionaire who suffers from dementia. Woerth was also cleared of charges of influence-peddling. He had been accused of using his position of influence to secure favours from Bettencourt‚Äôs financial manager ‚Äì urging him to employ his wife in exchange for receiving the Legion of Honour, France‚Äôs highest decoration. The court acquitted him of all charges. The Bettencourt saga began in more than seven years ago as a family feud between mother and daughter in one of the richest families in France, but it sparked a political scandal as well a raft of judicial investigations including on tax evasion and illegal party funding. In 2007, Bettencourt‚Äôs daughter began legal action claiming that Banier, a Paris socialite and photographer, befriended her ageing mother and taken advantage of her frail state of mind to persuade her to give him more than ‚Ç¨1bn in artworks, insurance policies and cash. The long-running case gripped France and sent shockwaves through the political class, tarnishing Sarkozy, who was placed under formal investigation for illegal campaign financing and taking advantage of Bettencourt after being voted out as president in 2015. Those charges against Sarkozy were dropped in October 2013 due to lack of evidence. Banier, now 67, who first met Bettencourt, 92, when he photographed her for a magazine, presented himself in court as a rich and well-connected celebrity photographer, a charming eccentric who did not need the money. Bettencourt, who is estimated to be worth ‚Ç¨33bn (¬£24bn) by Forbes magazine, was alleged to have found a new best friend in the outrageous and eccentric Banier. She showered him with so many gifts that even his own lawyer admitted in court that he had been ‚Äúdrowning in gold‚Äù and briefly made him her sole heir. The court had heard how Bettencourt had been suffering from increasing dementia and, by 2011, was unable to tell what year it was. From 2006 to 2010, Banier received gifts from Bettencourt worth ‚Ç¨414m, including life insurance policies, paintings by Picasso, Matisse and Mondrian, manuscripts and cash. In court, Banier conceded that just hearing the figures sparked ‚Äúan enormous vertigo‚Äù. But he said Bettencourt chose to bestow the gifts, it ‚Äúgave her immense pleasure to do it‚Äù and she had been of sound mind. He said she got angry if he tried to turn down gifts. Most of the value of the gifts was paid back before the court case. Patrice de Mestre, Bettencourt‚Äôs wealth manager, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for exploiting her frailty, as was her former lawyer. Martin d‚ÄôOrgeval, Banier‚Äôs partner, was found guilty on the same charges and received a suspended sentence. Banier and de Mestre will appeal against the verdicts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-28T14:51:17Z,world,World news,Angolan journalist given suspended jail term over blood diamonds book,"A prominent Angolan journalist has been given a six-month suspended jail term for defaming army generals in a book that revealed killings and torture in the country‚Äôs diamond fields. Rafael Marques de Morais described the sentence as a blow to freedom of expression in the southern African country: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sending a message that ‚Äòwe can lock you up, including Rafael. We can send him to jail any time we want.‚Äô‚Äù
The anti-corruption activist accused the generals of lying to him when they appeared to drop the charges in an out-of-court settlement last week. He believes they were merely trying to avoid the embarrassment of being cross-examined and forced to sit through witness testimony. The case centred on Marques‚Äôs 2011 book, Blood Diamonds: Corruption and Torture in Angola, which detailed more than 100 killings and hundreds of cases of torture allegedly perpetrated by security guards and soldiers in the diamond fields of the Lundas region. It argued that seven generals who co-own a private security company involved in many of the abuses were criminally responsible, prompting them to sue. In court in the capital, Luanda, on Thursday, judge Adriano Cerveira said: ‚Äú[I have] decided, on behalf of the people, to give Rafael Marques de Morais, accused of the crime of slander ... a single sentence of [a suspended] six months in prison.‚Äù The court also ordered Marques to ‚Äúwithdraw the book from the market, including on the internet, and not to republish or translate it‚Äù. It is unclear how this could be applied to international publishers in Portugal and elsewhere which do not fall under Angola‚Äôs jurisdiction. When the trial began in March, Marques had faced 24 charges that could have resulted in a nine-year prison sentence and a fine of $1.2m (¬£800,000). But he then held a private meeting with the generals, which included one of president Jose Eduardo dos Santos‚Äôs closest allies, and believed he had struck a deal. Marques, 43, agreed to tell the court that he never made any direct contact with the generals prior to writing the book and accepted that they did not have direct knowledge of the human rights abuses. He never intended to offend the generals but was simply reporting on the suffering of the Lundas people, whose evidence has not been challenged, he added. But there was a fresh twist this week when, in spite of the agreement, prosecutors suddenly called for a suspended one-month sentence for Marques. The judge went further and imposed a six-month sentence suspended for two years. Marques believes this will be used as a threat left hanging over all his activism and investigative journalism. He said: ‚ÄúWithin two years I can go to prison any time. With this twist, they might say ‚Äòyou have not complied with this or that. The judge said you have an agreement with the generals and, if you infringe this agreement, the sentence can be imposed.‚Äô ‚ÄúThis is not going to end here. It‚Äôs a victory for treachery and ill-faith and it just proves the generals were aware of the abuses in the region. If they were unaware, they would not have resorted to such laws to clear their names in such a crude and manipulative manner.‚ÄúI think the judge was a pawn in this. The generals told me they had already talked to the judge and the attorney general of the republic to make the charges go away. Obviously they lied because they were fully aware of what was happening.‚Äù
Asked about the generals‚Äô motives, Marques said: ‚ÄúThey managed to avoid a court appearance. It was humiliating for them to be sitting there. With this manoeuvring they managed to extricate themselves from a court appearance and prevent my witnesses giving them all the evidence. I was convicted without any body of evidence.‚Äù Marques, who has run his investigative website Maka Angola for seven years, has been jailed before for branding Dos Santos a dictator. He spent 43 days locked up without charge in 1999, going for days at a time without food or water in solitary confinement. Watchdogs condemned Thursday‚Äôs sentencing of Marques. Jeffrey Smith, the Africa programme officer at the Robert F Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights, said: ‚ÄúThe way in which the Angolan judicial system manipulated this case, from the very outset, shows the brazen extent to which the Dos Santos government will go to criminalise freedom of expression. ‚ÄúThis is obviously part of a larger attempt to stifle human rights reporting in Angola, and they are using Rafael Marques to set an example. In doing so, Angola is violating the African charter on human and peoples‚Äô rights, as well as numerous other international human rights conventions which the country is legally bound to follow.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-28T14:47:08Z,world,World news,Garda officer prosecuted in Ireland for speaking to journalist,"A serving garda superintendent and former head of the Irish police‚Äôs press office has been arrested over claims he spoke to a journalist without authorisation. The officer is being prosecuted under Section 62 of the Garda S√≠och√°na Act 2000 which civil liberties groups have criticised as draconian and designed to gag the media in Ireland. The superintendent was arrested over claims he unlawfully briefed a journalist about the Garda S√≠och√°na‚Äôs controversial seizure of two Roma children in October 2013, which the force wrongly believed had been abducted from non-Roma families somewhere in Europe. The two Roma children‚Äôs families are currently suing the Irish state over the wrongful removal of each child. The children were taken from their families after a wholly incorrect rumour started on Facebook that because they had blonde hair they did not belong to their Roma parents. The rumour was started after a controversy in Greece over a blonde-haired child who was being looked after by a Roma family. The garda officer held a senior position in the force‚Äôs press office at the time of the controversy and his supporters have told the Guardian that he believed he had lawfully briefed a journalist about the errors made by officers to forcibly remove the Roma children. If convicted of breaching Section 62 of the Garda S√≠och√°na Act he could face up to seven years in jail and lose his pension. He was arrested after he arrived at a Co Dublin garda station by appointment at 7.30am this morning. He has been suspended from duty by the head of the force, garda commissioner N√≥ir√≠n O‚ÄôSullivan. The investigation is being led by a chief superintendent and a detective superintendent based in a Dublin city centre garda station. The garda press office in Dublin would neither confirm nor deny the officer‚Äôs arrest. Journalists working in the Irish Republic alongside civil liberties organisations have criticised Section 62 and have claimed it is designed to prevent whistleblowing within the force. Reporters have claimed there is now a climate of fear among garda rank and file, and officers to speak out to the media about any controversies or wrong-doings within the Irish police force. A number of investigative journalists told the Guardian last year that they believed senior command within the garda ordered searches of their phone records in order to track potential telephone or mobile traffic between reporters and members of the force. Several of these journalists have lodged complaints with the police watchdog body, the garda ombudsman.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-28T13:55:51Z,world,World news,Asian migrant crisis: calls for Asean joint action likely to be unanswered,"An emergency international summit called to tackle the migrant boat crisis in the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea, convening in Bangkok on Friday, may prove long on talk and short on answers if countries shy away from coordinated joint action to address the root causes in Burma and Bangladesh, diplomats and aid groups say. The summit‚Äôs Thai hosts ‚Äì who have invited 17 countries including Malaysia, Indonesia, other Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) members and Australia ‚Äì say they want immediate, collective steps to deal with the recent surge in Rohingya Muslim refugees fleeing Burma and economic migrants leaving Bangladesh.
‚ÄúIt is an urgent call for the region to comprehensively work together to address the unprecedented increase of irregular migration across the Bay of Bengal in recent years,‚Äù said Panote Preechyanud, of the Thai foreign ministry. But with little sign of agreement on what to do or who should do it, such calls look destined to go unanswered.
About 3,500 migrants have fled by sea in the past month, mostly coming ashore in Malaysia and Indonesia or being rescued at sea, often after initially being turned away. Unknown numbers have died, and the UN estimates that up to 2,600 are currently at sea on seven boats, the abandoned victims of people-smuggling gangs. After fierce international criticism, Malaysia reversed its policy of sending boats back to sea and now says it will accept migrants for up to 12 months. But it is unclear what will happen to them after that. Despite its economy‚Äôs reliance on foreign workers, Malaysia complains that it is home to 120,000 illegal migrants from Burma and is already doing its bit. Indonesia has adopted a similar stance toward the Rohingyas, but is insisting that all Bangladeshi migrants be repatriated. Thailand, whose crackdown on people-smuggling gangs precipitated the crisis last month, is now saying it will provide temporary ‚Äúhumanitarian help‚Äù but that it is hosting 100,000 refugees from Burma and does not want any more.
So great is its denial of the problem, the Burmese government agreed to attend the summit only if the word Rohingya was not mentioned in the invitation. Predominantly Buddhist Burma maintains that the much repressed and discriminated against 1.3 million-strong Muslim minority concentrated in Rakhine state are not Burmese at all, but rather Bangladeshi immigrants. Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese opposition leader, has declined to speak up for the Rohingya, an omission that brought criticism this week from the Dalai Lama, the Buddhist leader and a fellow Nobel peace prize winner. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very sad. In the Burmese case I hope Aung San Suu Kyi, as a Nobel laureate, can do something,‚Äù he told the Australian newspaper. ‚ÄúI met her two times ‚Ä¶ I mentioned this problem and she told me she found some difficulties, that things were not simple but very complicated. But in spite of that I feel she can do something.‚Äù Criticism of Burma‚Äôs actions provoked counter-protests in Rangoon this week. Banners carried through the streets by nationalists, including Buddhist monks, featured slogans calling the migrants ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù and ‚Äúbeasts‚Äù.
In Bangladesh, the official reaction has been similarly unsympathetic. Its prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, said migrants who risked their lives fleeing Bangladesh were ‚Äúmentally sick‚Äù and tainted the country‚Äôs image abroad, and she vowed to punish them. Meanwhile, plans were announced to forcibly relocate Rohingya camps. About one-third of Bangladesh‚Äôs 166 million people are under the age of 15. Youth unemployment is around 13%. The economy depends to a significant extent on remittances from more than seven million overseas workers. The US, which will be represented at the summit, has said it will consider admitting more Rohingyas. But others are unyielding. Asked whether Australia would help with resettlement, the prime minister Tony Abbott replied: ‚ÄúNope, nope, nope ‚Ä¶ We are not going to do anything that will encourage people to get on boats.‚Äù Asean countries have another reason for eschewing joint action to pressure Burma: the group‚Äôs long-established principle of non-interference in each other‚Äôs internal affairs. In an unusual step, Malaysia, Asean‚Äôs current chair, sent a delegation to Rangoon last week to discuss the issue. But diplomats say unless and until Asean acts tough, Burma‚Äôs regime will continue to try to ignore the problem. ‚ÄúIt is an Asean issue and has to be resolved by Asean,‚Äù a western diplomat said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-28T12:40:31Z,world,World news,"Grexit is a possibility, warns head of IMF","The head of the International Monetary Fund has warned that a Greek exit from the eurozone is a ‚Äúpossibility‚Äù as debt talks reach a critical stage. Christine Lagarde said a deal with Athens was unlikely to be reached over the next few days, as the indebted country strives to meet a 5 June deadline for a ‚Ç¨305m (¬£218m) payment to the IMF. In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the IMF managing director said: ‚ÄúA Greek exit is a possibility.‚Äù Lagarde added that such a step would ‚Äúnot be a walk in the park‚Äù, but would ‚Äúprobably not‚Äù mean the end of the euro. The IMF head is attending a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the G7 leading nations in Dresden, where the crisis in Greece was discussed, though it was not on the formal agenda. Her comments came as Athens‚Äô lead negotiator admitted Greece required intervention at the highest political level in Europe in order to seal an agreement after acknowledging that ongoing negotiations in Brussels would not achieve a final deal. Euclid Tsakalotos, the deputy foreign minister who is now leading Greece‚Äôs negotiating team, said both sides were drawing closer together but a final ‚Äútrade-off‚Äù would have to take place between senior political figures. Greek ministers have admitted next week‚Äôs ‚Ç¨305m payment cannot be met without securing a deal to release the ‚Ç¨7.2bn of loans outstanding on the country‚Äôs current bailout programme.
Tsakalotos, speaking from the Belgian capital, where the so-called Brussels Group of technical teams resumed talks on Thursday, said: ‚ÄúThe [two sides] will never converge completely but the general impression is that they are converging. ‚ÄúThere is now a reasonable chance that whatever convergence still needs to be done after the Brussels Group will be done at a higher level where politicians will be called in for the final trade-off and will bridge the gap.‚Äù Tsakalotos has been coordinating Athens‚Äô negotiating team since last month, when the combative finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, was sidelined after repeatedly riling Greece‚Äôs creditors with his controversial public statements. Of the two-and-a-half-hour talks Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, had with his French and German counterparts on the sidelines of the EU summit in Latvia last week, Tsakalotos added: ‚ÄúThe meeting with Hollande and Merkel in Riga went very well.‚Äù But the Oxford-educated economics professor suggested the negotiators could only go so far. ‚ÄúThe Brussels Group works in little boxes, ticking off [issues], there is no trade-off there,‚Äù he said, adding that talks on Thursday would focus on VAT. For Athens, he said, negotiations boiled down to ‚Äúwhat we are willing to give, what are our red lines and what we are going to get‚Äù. Tsakalotos, who has infused a more measured tone into the talks, blamed some of the lack of headway on the hardened stance of the IMF. On Wednesday, Tsipras accused lenders of holding back progress because of their different approaches. ‚ÄúThe IMF is being very, very tough on all the issues and not really engaging in proper discussion,‚Äù Tsakalotos said. The IMF is said to be insisting that Athens must be offered debt relief if its future repayments are to be manageable, but that would mean lenders, including the European Central Bank, writing off some of the Greek debts they own. That proposal is being resisted by other members of what was known as the creditors‚Äô ‚Äútroika‚Äù of the IMF, the EU and the ECB, before Syriza insisted that the hated term be dropped. Lagarde‚Äôs downbeat tone contrasted with suggestions from a government spokesman earlier in the day that a deal could be done as early as this Sunday. Depending on developments, the Greek side may well request a euro group meeting of finance ministers on either the 3 June or 4 June ‚Äì the eve of the first in a series of loan instalments it must make to the IMF next month. Any agreement could then be ratified by European leaders at an EU summit later in the month. Tsakalotos repeated that the leftist Greek government was not interested in drafting an agreement that would ensure liquidity only for June when it faced such a heavy debt repayment schedule throughout the summer, with repayments on ECB bonds worth ‚Ç¨6.7bn due in July and August alone. ‚ÄúThe two negotiations [long- and short-term] are de facto merging given that it is now 28 May,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are now looking at a medium-term deal, maybe a year, so that we are given some macro-economic space to carry out our programme.‚Äù Syriza‚Äôs coalition government was elected on a wave of popular support with a pledge to reject austerity and reverse some of the painful reforms imposed by the troika. But it looks increasingly likely that it will have to compromise. The consequences of the failure so far to secure a deal were underlined in the ECB‚Äôs twice-yearly financial stability review, published earlier on Thursday. ‚ÄúSovereign risks emanating from Greece, in particular, have increased sharply owing to heightened political uncertainty over the past six months, while the banking sector in Greece has witnessed substantial deposit outflows, a loss of access to the wholesale funding market and deteriorating asset quality,‚Äù the report warned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-28T12:26:01Z,world,World news,"India heatwave continues as death toll exceeds 1,000","The death toll in India‚Äôs heatwave has climbed towards 1,500 as the country sweltered in one of the worst bouts of hot weather for several years. Southern India has borne the brunt of the sudden spell of hot, dry weather. So far more than 1,000 people have died in the state of Andhra Pradesh, more than double the total number of heat-related deaths last summer, authorities said. ‚ÄúThis is the highest death toll due to heatwave ever in the state,‚Äù said Tulasi Rani, the special commissioner for disaster management in Andhra Pradesh. ‚ÄúLast year around 447 people died due to heat. This year the heatwave is continuing for a longer period than in previous years.‚Äù
Rani said temperatures were two to five degrees higher than the seasonal average. The death toll in neighbouring Telangana, where temperatures hit 48C (118F) over the weekend, stood at 340. Dr T Padmaja, the medical and health officer in Andhra Pradesh‚Äôs Guntur district, one of the worst affected areas, said leave had been cancelled for doctors. Local authorities across India have launched intensive awareness campaigns, asking people to stay indoors between 1pm and 4pm and advising them to wear broad-brimmed hats and light-coloured cotton clothes, use umbrellas and drink lots of fluid.
Among the most vulnerable are older people and poorer people, many of whom live in slums or farm huts with no access to air conditioners or sometimes even trees which could cast shade. Many victims were day labourers, who need to work to eat. ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt work due to the heat, how will my family survive?‚Äù said Mahalakshmi, who earns a 200 rupees (¬£2) a day as a construction labourer in the southern city of Nizamabad, Telangana state. The homeless were also badly hit. Near one shelter in Delhi, dozens of men tried to keep cool in the shade of nearby trees. Others begged from the drivers of vehicles waiting at nearby traffic lights. ‚ÄúIf they give me anything I spend it on water at the moment not food,‚Äù said Deepak Ram Lal, 42.
The capital‚Äôs air conditioned metro and shopping malls have become much-sought-after havens from the heat, while power cuts in residential areas were frequent as the grid struggled to cope with the demand from millions of air conditioners. Residents of Gurgaon ‚Äì a high-rise satellite city, home to many of the Delhi‚Äôs workers ‚Äì experienced power cuts of up to 10 hours a day. ‚ÄúNothing is working ‚Äì even after taking half a dozen baths a day, you can‚Äôt beat the heat,‚Äù shop owner Manish Singh said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs worse than previous years; we hardly get any electricity and the air conditioners become useless.‚Äù The heat has melted roads near the capital and caused problems with maintaining animal welfare at farms and the country‚Äôs zoos. Brahma Prakash Yadav, director of the Indian meteorological department, said though maximum temperatures would remain high until the weekend, rain would bring some relief early next week (PDF).
The highest temperature ever recorded in the capital was 47.2C, in May 1944. The record in India is thought to be 50.6C, recorded in 1956 in the northern town of Alwar. The death toll is worse than the severe heatwave in 2010, which started much earlier, registering the highest temperatures for decades and lasting for months. But experts say compiling casualty statistics for heatwaves is extremely difficult owing to difficulties in attributing cause of death and registering fatalities in remote areas. May and June are India‚Äôs hottest months, with temperatures regularly pushing above 40C. But meteorologists say the number of days when temperatures approach 45C has increased in the past 15 years. The monsoon, predicted to hit southern India‚Äôs coastline on 31 May, will bring relief from the high temperatures, but it will not reach the parched north of the country for several weeks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-28T11:00:08Z,world,World news,Paraguay march poised to draw record crowd after 10-year-old denied abortion,"Fury over Paraguayan authorities‚Äô refusal to allow an abortion for a 10-year-old rape victim is expected to bring unprecedented numbers of pro-choice protesters to the streets of the country‚Äôs capital, Asunci√≥n, this week. The case has prompted outcry around the world and prompted a national debate about the prevalence of child abuse and underage pregnancies. But that debate has focused more on adult violence than on child health. And while many have called for tougher penalties for adults who abuse minors, few expect any change in the Catholic country‚Äôs strict abortion laws.
Despite a plea from the girl‚Äôs mother, Paraguayan authorities have ruled that the 10-year-old who is now 25 weeks into the pregnancy must give birth, unless she develops complications that put her life in danger. A medical panel is monitoring her condition. Pedro Pablo Guanes, a gynaecologist based in Asunci√≥n, said the authorities are likely to release a tentative date for the birth soon. One option is for a cesarian section to be carried out in the next few weeks to avoid the biggest risk, which is that the girl‚Äôs body may not yet be developed enough to accommodate a fetus in its final stage. On average, two girls under the age of 16 give birth each day in this country of 6.8 million, according to local media reports which have reflected fears that the rape of minors has become ‚Äúnormalised‚Äù. Congressmen have proposed raising the maximum sentence for the rape of a minor to 30 years in prison, up from 10 years. But attempts to raise awareness over the issue of sexual abuse have been modest: the government has urged people to wear green ribbons on the National Day Against Child and Adolescent Sexual Abuse on 31 May. A day earlier, hundreds of demonstrators are expected to attend a march from the Plaza Uruguaya to El Pante√≥n in the capital with banners declaring ‚ÄúMy body, my territory, not for use or abuse‚Äù. Similar small rallies have been staged every year, but organisers expected double the usual number of marchers this year because of the commotion caused by the 10-year-old‚Äôs pregnancy.
‚ÄúHer case is emblematic and motivates many people,‚Äù said Rosana R√≠os of the Grupo Luna Nueva, which is one of the participating organisations in the protest. ‚ÄúWe are marching against the inaction of the state in the face of this problem.‚Äù
Petitions have been sent to the Ministry of Children demanding the government stop treating this problem as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and asking for the establishment of a medical board to evaluate the options for the girl‚Äôs well-being. The global online campaigning organisation Avaaz presented a petition to the Paraguayan congress with half a million signatures calling for the decriminalization of abortion for women under 15 years of age. This coincided with a public hearing in Asunci√≥n on whether to reform the nation‚Äôs abortion laws. Feminist and pro-choice groups argued that decriminalisation was long overdue because more than 50,000 illegal abortions are carried out each year for those who can afford them, while the poor have no choice but to bear the health and economic risks associated with an unwanted pregnancy.
The situation in Paraguay reflects that across Latin America, where abortion is illegal or severely restricted in most countries. Nicaragua, Chile and El Salvador ban abortion completely, even if the pregnancy threatens the life of both the mother and the foetus. The World Health Organization has said botched abortions are a leading cause of maternal death worldwide, and in 2008 accounted for 12% of all maternal deaths in Latin America and the Caribbean. But the strong influence of the Catholic church in the region makes reform unlikely. Earlier this week, Peru‚Äôs congress rejected a bill to decriminalise abortion in the case of rape. In Paraguay, a recent survey suggested that 87% of the population is opposed to abortion. Many local doctors say it is unnecessary. The hospital Clinicas recently reported almost 400 pregnancies of girls under 16 years old that went to term without complications. The gynaecologist in charge of the 10-year old‚Äôs case said in a press release that he was surprised at the latest fuss because last year a nine-year-old girl gave birth. ‚ÄúThis shows how the situation here has become normal, at least to those who work with these cases,‚Äù said Cecilia Caniza, a psychiatrist based in Asunci√≥n. ‚ÄúEveryone needs to understand that this is not normal. Just because there are lots of cases does not make the situation OK.‚Äù International research suggests the potential hazards for very young mothers are considerable: even though a 10-year-old may be able to conceive, her pelvis is not fully developed, raising the likelihood of complications during birth. ‚ÄúOne big study in Bangladesh showed a five-fold increase in risk of death among 10- to 14-year-olds compared to women aged 20 to 24,‚Äù said Dr Mickey Chopra, Unicef‚Äôs global chief of health. ‚ÄúEven if the mother doesn‚Äôt die, the physical complications of pregnancy can be quite severe, running from prolapses to being physically disabled,‚Äù said Chopra. Young girls who become pregnant also experience higher rates of pre-eclampsia ‚Äì dangerously high blood pressure ‚Äì which can be life-threatening for mother and baby. And even when rape is not an issue, adolescents can have difficulty adapting to motherhood when they are still growing up themselves, said Daghni Rajasingam, a consultant obstetrician and spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the UK. According to Unicef, the teen and adolescent birth rate in Paraguay is 63 per 1000 girls aged 15 to 19. In the UK, which has one of the highest rates in Europe, the rate is 25 per 1000 and in the US, which has the highest rates in the OECD, it is 39. Religion is not the only factor.

After viewing the video and hearing the arguments of prosecutors and the defence, Cook county Circuit Judge Robert Kuzas ruled that Bruce Blunt‚Äôs behaviour was ‚Äúuncalled for and immature‚Äù but did not amount to criminality. Blunt had posted a Facebook video of himself smoking marijuana with the chameleon, Binna. It prompted a complaint from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

2015-05-28T05:01:30Z,world,World news,China's lonely voice of dissent refuses to forget the victims of Tiananmen Square,"One week ago a letter, lengthy but beautifully written, was posted online calling for the Chinese government to end its long-standing secrecy over the Tiananmen Square massacre. In one part it boldly proclaimed: ‚ÄúThe butcher must stand trial.‚Äù It was signed by 11 Chinese students, mainly living in the US with one from Britain. The eleventh and final name belonged to Wu Lebao, a 31-year-old Chinese refugee living in Melbourne.
Wu describes the bloodshed of 4 June 1989, when the Chinese government opened fire on hundreds of students who had been calling for democracy, as the day authorities ‚Äúwant people to forget‚Äù. When he was a student in China his history textbook dedicated just one sentence to the incident, trivialising it as ‚Äúpolitical turmoil‚Äù. ‚ÄúThat was the closest we came to achieving democracy,‚Äù says Wu. ‚ÄúMany people died and lots of people lost their family, friends and classmates.‚Äù The letter‚Äôs public critique of the government is unusual, more so because it comes from a new generation of Chinese students who are too young to remember the massacre first-hand and have grown up in a ruthless media blackout, with government censors actively scrubbing the Chinese internet clean of any frank discussion about that fateful week in 1989. A fraction of China‚Äôs 600 million internet users, including Wu, use a VPN to ‚Äújump the firewall‚Äù and access censored content and global perspectives on blocked sites like Twitter. The letter triggered an angry editorial by China‚Äôs nationalist paper The Global Times, which accused the authors of trying to ‚Äútear society apart‚Äù, adding: ‚ÄúWhen China is moving forward, some are trying to drag up history in an attempt to tear apart society.‚Äù The lead signatory to the letter, Gu Yi, called the paper‚Äôs response ‚Äúthe best advertisement‚Äù the letter could have ever received. Last week the Chinese president Xi Jinping rallied overseas students to ‚Äúserve the country‚Äù and become a ‚Äúunited front‚Äù ‚Äì a term Wu says was ‚Äúfirst applied by Chairman Mao‚Äù. ‚ÄúEven in western countries most Chinese students are under the control of Chinese authorities,‚Äù he says. Not one of the Chinese student groups at any Australian university can be called autonomous and they are all funded by the Chinese embassy, he claims. Student leaders overseas are not elected but installed by the Chinese government, just as they are at home, he says. Political action is considered a taboo subject in China, one in which personal risks are high and the rewards low. ‚ÄúI was imprisoned for it ‚Äì so it is dangerous,‚Äù Wu says. He used to work as a lecturer at a training college in Bengbu, a town in the northern Chinese province of Anhui, and says some of his fellow teachers knew nothing of the massacre. Wu is in the habit of apologising for his heavy Chinese accent, yet he commands an impressive vocabulary, using words like ‚Äúapostate‚Äù and ‚Äújingoist‚Äù. He describes one of his tweets ‚Äì the one eventually used by authorities as evidence to detain him ‚Äì as doggerel, poetry that is irregular in rhythm and rhyme, often deliberately for burlesque or comic effect.
In 2011 whispers that the political uprising in Tunisia, known as the Jasmine Revolution, would come to China were blowing like seeds in the wind. While the talk bore no real fruit, the rumours alone were enough to rattle the authorities who came crashing down on anyone suspected of being involved. Wu had visited Chinese artist and famous pot-stirrer Ai Wei Wei in his Beijing studio earlier that year. Authorities would later use this fact and cherry pick a few of Wu‚Äôs tweets, including one that stated ‚Äúif you hold jasmine in your hand the police will arrest you‚Äù, as evidence he had plans to incite an overthrow of the government ‚Äì something Wu denies. After 107 days of detention, filled with endless hours of interrogation, Wu was released to house arrest. The following year he decided he could no longer live under such conditions and in early 2013 fled to Australia where he was eventually granted refugee status. Wu lives a lonely life in Melbourne. At times he is gripped by powerful feelings of homesickness. ‚ÄúSometimes in my dreams I‚Äôm in China,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAfter I wake up I must find something, like a flag, to make sure I am in Australia.‚Äù He is on medication to treat his depression; he does not know when he will see his family in China again and is concerned for their safety. In the south-west Melbourne suburb of Leveton, he keeps his refugee status hidden from his Chinese landlord and flatmate. A previous tenancy application had been rejected after the landlord searched his name and uncovered his history. Renting hasn‚Äôt been easy without steady work, but he has a part-time job managing a website and every afternoon takes English classes at a language centre for new migrants. Right now his goals are modest. ‚ÄúI want to improve my English,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThen I will apply to go to university and continue my study.‚Äù He has few Chinese friends. There is a kind of gap between him and other young Chinese people in Australia. ‚ÄúI know some Chinese students in Australia, for example,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúwho will tell their teachers and classmates, ‚ÄòIf you want to keep me in this classroom, you can‚Äôt criticise the Chinese political system‚Äô. ‚ÄúThey think if you criticise the party, you criticise China. And if you criticise China, you insult them. In my opinion, that‚Äôs very ridiculous.‚Äù Wu, on the other hand, is taking full advantage of Australia‚Äôs relative freedom of expression and has felt ‚Äúmore responsibility to say something about Chinese politics‚Äù since his exile. He says on the whole western countries are deluded in thinking the political situation in China is getting better. ‚ÄúOn the contrary,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúit‚Äôs becoming worse.‚Äù But he still hopes it will improve. ‚ÄúNot just the Communist regime being overthrown, but many deep-rooted aspects of Chinese culture need to be revolutionised,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúEvery culture has its pros and cons. Something wrong cannot be justified simply because it belongs to a culture.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-28T02:36:52Z,world,World news,Syria not a launching pad for attacks on west says al-Nusra chief in TV interview,"Al-Qaida‚Äôs Syria affiliate would not use Syria as a launching pad for attacks on the west, its chief said in a wide-ranging televised interview on Wednesday. Without showing his face, Abu Mohamed al-Jolani said his group, al-Nusra Front, would protect Syrian minorities that renounced the regime. The interview was Jolani‚Äôs second with Qatari-owned al-Jazeera TV since a similar appearance in 2013. The interviewer, Ahmad Mansur, said it was broadcast ‚Äúfrom liberated lands in Syria‚Äù. All that could be seen of Jolani was a black shawl, a check shirt and gesturing hands. ‚ÄúThe instructions that we have are not to use al-Sham as a base to launch attacks on the west or Europe, so as not to muddy the current war,‚Äù Jolani said. ‚ÄúOur mission in Syria is the downfall of the regime, its symbols, and its allies, like Hezbollah.‚Äù Hezbollah is the powerful Shia movement fighting alongside the Bashar al-Assad regime. But if the United States kept attacking them, he said, ‚Äúall options are open. Anyone has the right to self-defence.‚Äù Jolani also denied the existence of the Khorasan group, which the US had said was an offshoot of al-Qaida that was plotting attacks against the US. Nevertheless, he lambasted the US for its air raids against al-Nusra in Syria and accused it of coordinating with the Assad regime on the use of air space. ‚ÄúAmerica is propping up the regime,‚Äù he asserted, leaning forward in an ornate gold-encrusted chair. Al-Nusra and its extremist rival Islamic State have been designated as terrorist organisations by the US since the end of 2012. Since September, a US-led international coalition has been raiding jihadist positions in Syria, although most strikes have targeted IS. In recent months, al-Nusra has led a rebel coalition in a series of key victories in Syria‚Äôs north-west Idlib province, including the capital and a large military base. The gains have opened the road for a potential jihadist advance on Latakia and Tartus, coastal provinces that are home to Syrian minorities including Christians and Alawites, the offshoot of Shia Islam to which the Assad clan belongs. Extremist groups in Syria, including al-Nusra and IS, have been accused of targeting these minority communities. But al-Nusra‚Äôs chief seemed to try to play down those fears, saying his group ‚Äúonly fights those who fight us‚Äù. ‚ÄúIf the Alawites leave their religion and leave Bashar al-Assad, we will protect them,‚Äù he said. He said Christians living under the rule of al-Nusra were living in peace and that in a future state ruled by Islamic law, the financially capable would pay ‚Äújizya,‚Äù or tax reserved for non-Muslims. Jolani promised to defeat the Lebanese movement Hezbollah, which has significantly bolstered the Assad regime in the mountainous border region between Syria and Lebanon. ‚ÄúHezbollah knew the ugliness of the Syrian regime,‚Äù Jolani warned. ‚ÄúIt knew its fate was directly linked to Bashar‚Äôs fate. ‚ÄúQalamun will be an important gateway for Damascus when the battle for the capital begins. As soon as Bashar is defeated, it will be the end for Hezbollah.‚Äù As he did in his interview in 2013, the Nusra chief said the end of the Assad regime was near. ‚ÄúI assure you, the fall of Bashar is not far away,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI do not want to project much optimism, but there are very positive signs.‚Äù He rejected a political end to the conflict, saying that any political agreement ‚Äúreached in the halls of Washington ... would cost the blood of the Syrian people‚Äù. He also firmly denied receiving any state funding, saying that Nusra was financed by its own businesses activities and contributions from individual donors. Wednesday‚Äôs interview was the first in a two-part series, to be continued next week.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-28T00:50:51Z,world,World news,UK schoolgirls lured to Syria by Isis 'have made contact with their families',"Three London schoolgirls who travelled to Syria earlier this year have reportedly made contact with their families in the UK. Schoolfriends Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15, travelled from east London to Turkey in February and are believed to have then crossed into areas of Syria controlled by Islamic State (Isis). More than three months on, however, ITV News has reported that one of them has called relatives in the UK to say that she is healthy, safe and well but has insisted that she and the others do not intend to return home soon. Her friends were also reported to have contacted relatives over the internet.
The families of the girls have accused British police of failing to give them crucial information that they say could have stopped their daughters from joining Isis. They accuse officers of covering up their errors since the girls went missing. In interviews with the Guardian in March, the families spoke of the nightmare they have been living through since the girls disappeared and say they had no reason to suspect they had been radicalised. At that point, they said they still had no idea where the three girls found the money to buy their plane tickets to Turkey on their journey to join the terrorist group. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, commissioner of the Metropolitan police, has said that the three teenagers can return home without fear of being prosecuted for terrorism. Appearing in front of MPs on the home affairs committee earlier this year, Hogan-Howe said of the teenagers‚Äô departure: ‚ÄúThis is a huge propaganda coup for Isis and a big blow to the credibility of what is supposed to be ‚Ä¶ the best police service in the world.‚Äù He and his head of counter-terrorism, Mark Rowley, went into the session having had to admit that with hindsight, letters meant for the girls‚Äô parents saying a 15-year-old schoolfriend had fled to join Isis weeks earlier should have been handed directly to their parents. Instead the letters were given to the girls, who hid them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-27T22:26:44Z,world,World news,Human rights groups condemn Nauru's criminalisation of political protest,"International human rights groups have condemned the Nauruan government‚Äôs recent attempts to criminalise political protest and censor web access, and urged it to lift restrictions. Nauru recently introduced a new criminal offence that could see political opponents and asylum seekers who protest against their conditions jailed for up to seven years. It also blocked access to Facebook and a number of other websites on the island, in what it described as a plan to stop ‚Äúcriminals and sexual perverts‚Äù. A coalition of groups ‚Äì including Access, Electronic Frontiers Australia, Human Rights Watch, GetUp, the Pacific Freedom Forum, Pen International and the Refugee Council of Australia ‚Äì have signed an open letter urging the government to repeal the new offence and lift online restrictions. The letter said: ‚ÄúNauru is in danger of losing valuable opportunities for economic development. The internet fosters innovation and access to knowledge, facilitates the transfer of funds, goods, and services, and provides robust social, economic, and cultural opportunities. In censoring content and obstructing the free flow of information, the government will deprive its citizens of the benefits that the internet offers.‚Äù The letter also drew attention to the impact on asylum seekers in the Australian-run detention facility on the island, who rely heavily on internet access on the island to contact people on Nauru and in Australia. ‚ÄúInternet services, including Facebook and other social media, help them communicate with family in other locations, a critical issue for resettlement and for providing evidence to receive refugee status. Restrictions on access may prevent detained asylum seekers from communicating with advocates and legal representatives who are trying to help them.‚Äù The letter comes after the United Nations special rapporteur for freedom of expression, David Kaye, also singled out Nauru for the new criminal offence, which he said ‚Äúunduly restrict‚Äù freedom of expression on the island. ‚ÄúThese new laws could be used to muzzle dissenting opinions and deter human rights defenders, academics, journalists, students, politicians and civil society members,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNauru should allow free space for expression without fear of criminal prosecution,‚Äù Kaye said. ‚ÄúIt should lift all restrictions to access internet and social media, and facilitate access to the media in the country.‚Äù The Nauruan government has rejected what it says is ‚Äúunfounded criticism‚Äù of the island and its affairs, and said the government was elected on a ‚Äúplatform of reform‚Äù. Elaine Pearson, the director of Human Rights Watch Australia, said Australia needed to make it clear to Nauru that the restrictions were not acceptable. ‚ÄúIntroducing vague laws that criminalise peaceful acts of free expression will limit public discussion of sensitive topics, and prevent scrutiny of the conduct of Nauru institutions. Such scrutiny and criticism is a normal, healthy part of democracy,‚Äù Pearson said. ‚ÄúAustralia‚Äôs leaders like to talk about the importance of freedom of speech, now is their chance to make it very clear to Nauru that measures which chill free expression have no place in a democracy.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-27T21:30:51Z,world,World news,Colombia guerrilla peace negotiator killed in government air strike,"A government air strike on a Colombian rebel camp killed a member of the guerrillas‚Äô negotiation team who had participated in peace talks aimed at ending the country‚Äôs five-decade civil war, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, Farc, announced on Wednesday.
The rebel commander known as Jairo Mart√≠nez was among the 27 guerrillas killed in the 21 May attack in southwestern Cauca province, which has raised tensions between the government and the country‚Äôs largest rebel army. Forensic analysis confirmed the identity of the insurgent, whose real name was Pedro Nel Daza, according to media reports. Pastor Alape, a top Farc leader taking part in peace talks being held in Havana, said that Mart√≠nez was on an ‚Äúeducational peace mission‚Äù when the strike hit. Members of the rebels‚Äô negotiating team have often traveled back to Colombia to inform their comrades about talks in Havana which began in 2012. The attack by government forces prompted the Farc to end an indefinite unilateral ceasefire that it had declared in December. Violations of that ceasefire ‚Äì including a rebel attack that killed 11 soldiers in April ‚Äì have led the government to step up operations against the rebels. Another rebel commander, Rom√°n Ruiz, died Sunday in a separate strike by government forces in Choc√≥ province. Alape called for independent autopsies of the rebel fighters who died, alleging some had been shot while trying to surrender, but a coroner‚Äôs report denied that any of the bodies were shot at close range. Despite the rising tensions, negotiators resumed talks Monday. They are tackling the issues of transitional justice and demobilization for the guerrillas, which would end the western hemisphere‚Äôs longest running conflict. Wednesday marked the 51th anniversary of the Farc, who trace their roots as an insurgency to 27 May 1964, when US-backed troops attacked a leftist peasant enclave known as Marquetalia. Since then, more than 200,000 people have been killed in the drug-fueled conflict, and more than 5 million Colombians have been forced to flee their homes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-27T20:26:19Z,world,World news,Brazilian radio journalist known for anti-drug trafficking views killed by gunmen,"A radio journalist known for denouncing drug traffickers and organized crime groups has been murdered in north-eastern Brazil, in the second attack on the country‚Äôs press in less than a week. Three men armed with machine guns and pistols killed Djalma Santos da Concei√ß√£o on Saturday night in the small town of Conceicao da Feira in the state of Bahia, police inspector Gustavo Coutinho told the Associated Press. He said the gunmen barged into a party at a small bar and dragged Santos da Concei√ß√£o away. Officers found the journalist‚Äôs mutilated body the next morning, in Timb√≥, a rural community just outside Concei√ß√£o da Feir, according to local media reports. Santos da Concei√ß√£o, 53, who presented a daily morning programme on a community radio station, was well-known for his plain-spoken commentary on local crime and corruption. He was the second Brazilian journalist killed in less than one week. The decapitated body of Evany Jose Metzkera, a blogger known for denouncing corrupt politicians, was found 18 May in a rural area in south-eastern Minas Gerais state. ‚ÄúThe brutal murders of two Brazilian journalists in less than a week represents a troubling escalation of anti-press violence in Brazil, already one of the most dangerous countries in the world to be a journalist,‚Äù said Sara Rafsky, Americas Program research associate of the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists.

2015-05-27T17:56:04Z,world,World news,France president Francois Hollande adds resistance heroines to Panth√É¬©on,"In a symbolic gesture to acknowledge that women as well as men have made French history, Fran√ßois Hollande has interred two female heroes of the resistance in the Panth√©on, the resting place of the nation‚Äôs great. The French president honoured four wartime resistance figures in total on Wednesday: Genevi√®ve de Gaulle-Anthonioz and Germaine Tillion, who survived capture and deportation, and two men, Pierre Brossolette and Jean Zay, who died in terrible circumstances before the end of the war. The only other woman to have been honoured in the Panth√©on, over whose door is written ‚ÄúThe nation thanks its great men‚Äù, is the Nobel prize-winning scientist Marie Curie, whose ashes were moved there in 1995. Another woman was buried there, Sophie Berthelot, but only to be close to her husband, the chemist and politician Marcellin Berthelot. There are 72 men in the mausoleum in Paris‚Äôs Latin quarter.
Hollande lauded the spirit of the resistance and warned that indifference was ‚Äútoday‚Äôs enemy‚Äù. He used his speech to caution against a resurgence of antisemitism and of democracy, and to defend what he called thespirit of libertydisplayed in the street demonstrations that followed January‚Äôs terrorist attacks in Paris. Genevi√®ve de Gaulle-Anthonioz was the niece of Charles de Gaulle. Her engineer father made her read Mein Kampf when she was 14 so she could understand the horror of the Nazis. She was 20 when the Nazi occupation began and her uncle called from London for the French to keep fighting. She joined a resistance movement based around academics at Paris‚Äôs anthropology museum, the Mus√©e de l‚ÄôHomme. In 1943, she was captured in a Paris book shop and deported to the Ravensbruck, the largest concentration camp for women. She later described coming close to death in the filth of the camp, surrounded by women who were massacred at random, and attacked by dogs. She spent part of her time in isolation after Heinrich Himmler, aware of her name, decided to keep her alive as a possible exchange prisoner. She was finally released in April 1945 and received a letter from her uncle saying he was ‚Äúextremely proud‚Äù of her, and she should get back on her feet because ‚ÄúFrance needs girls like you‚Äù. After the war she dedicated her life to fighting poverty and campaigning for homeless people, shocked by shanty towns outside Paris. Despite seeing numerous women murdered in front of her in the camps, she always said she believed in ‚Äúthe greatness of humanity‚Äù because she had witnessed ‚Äúbeautiful things‚Äù such as a starving prisoner giving food to another. She died in 2002, aged 81.
Germaine Tillion, an ethnologist, met de Gaulle-Anthonioz in the same resistance movement at the Paris museum, and both worked to counter Nazi propaganda. She was denounced and arrested at Paris‚Äôs Gare de Lyon and also sent to Ravensbruck. There she found her mother, who had also joined the resistance, and who would die in the gas chambers in 1945.
Tillion described the camp as ‚Äúa world of horror that was a world of contradictions: more terrifying than the visions of Dante, more absurd than a game of snakes and ladders‚Äù. She said that while there, she lost the will to live. After the war she studied and wrote about Ravensbruck, as well as working in Algeria, saying her work as an ethnologist had saved her. She died in 2008 aged 100. Pierre Brossolette, similarly based at the Paris anthropology museum, led several missions as an intelligence agent for de Gaulle‚Äôs Free France, and became a resistance spokesman on the BBC. Arrested and tortured in 1944, he jumped to his death from a top-floor window to avoid disclosing information, shouting that he would never give up and would die free. Jean Zay was France‚Äôs education minister before the war. He went to Morocco in 1940, intending to form a resistance government in North Africa. He was arrested but continued his efforts from prison. He was killed by the French militia, a paramilitary force of the collaborationist Vichy regime, in 1944.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-27T17:19:43Z,world,World news,US to urge Greece to end brinkmanship with creditors at G7 meeting,"The US Treasury secretary has said he will use the G7 finance ministers‚Äô meeting on Thursday and Friday to press Greece and its European creditors to end their brinkmanship and forge a rescue deal. With the Syriza-led coalition scrambling to secure an agreement, which will release the final ‚Ç¨7.2bn (¬£5.1bn) tranche of bailout cash and prevent it defaulting on a looming payment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Jack Lew urged both sides in the ongoing Greek debt crisis to ‚Äútreat every deadline as the last‚Äù. Washington has looked on with varying degrees of frustration and alarm throughout the long-running saga, which has seen Greece bailed out twice by a total of ‚Ç¨240bn. On a day when share prices soared on rumours of a breakthrough in the debt talks, before German officials scotched talk of ‚Äúprogress‚Äù, Lew warned both sides against complacency. Speaking to students at the London School of Economics before flying to Dresden for the G7 summit, he said: ‚ÄúNo one should have a false sense of confidence that they know what the result of a crisis in Greece would be.‚Äù He stressed that he believed all parties were negotiating in good faith, with neither deliberately aiming at a Greek default. However, Lew said he feared an ‚Äúaccident‚Äù, with the high-stakes negotiations ending in crisis. ‚ÄúIt is profoundly in the interests of the US and European economies for the accident to be avoided,‚Äù Lew said. ‚ÄúBrinksmanship is a dangerous thing‚Äù. Greece-watchers have coined the phrase ‚ÄúGreccident‚Äù, for the risk that the country‚Äôs Syriza government ends up being forced out of the euro by mistake. Lew later spoke to Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras by phone. Tsipras, whose Syriza party was elected on a platform of rejecting austerity and throwing off the yoke of the reviled ‚Äútroika‚Äù ‚Äì the International Monetary Fund, the European cUnion and the European Central Bank ‚Äì insisted on Wednesday that an agreement was imminent, which, ‚Äúwill be positive for the Greek economy‚Äù, and ‚Äúcalm and decisiveness‚Äù were now needed. Markets across Europe jumped on the positive tone, as well as claims by an unnamed Greek official, reported by Bloomberg, that both sides were already working on a draft of a ‚Äústaff level accord‚Äù, which would pave the way for a formal deal. That was downplayed by the European commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis. He said: ‚ÄúWe are working very intensively to ensure a staff-level agreement. We are still not there yet.‚Äù An unnamed German official was later reported as being ‚Äúsurprised‚Äù, at any suggestion of progress. At the LSE, Lew stressed the difficulties Tsipras would face in selling any concessions to its creditors to the Greek public. ‚ÄúGreece is going to have to do some very tough things,‚Äù he said. Athens had hoped to ditch some of the previous government‚Äôs commitments on pension reform, privatisation and fresh public spending cuts; but its creditors, led by Germany, have taken a tough line. Greece is due to make a ‚Ç¨300m payment to the IMF on 5 June. A new analysis by consultancy Oxford Economics suggested there was a 48% chance of Greece being pushed out of the euro over the next two years. While the Greek public are strongly in favour of staying in the euro, they argue, there may be little stomach for renewed austerity. ‚ÄúWe think support for the euro is more flimsy than opinion polls suggest,‚Äù Oxford Economics said. ‚ÄúThe best way to characterise Greek popular opinion is ‚Äòangrily resigned‚Äô to seemingly endless economic misery. There is universal anger over creditor-treatment given previous fiscal effort; and an acceptance that the country is near-bankrupt‚Äù.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-27T17:11:17Z,world,World news,Syria: Isis releases footage of Palmyra ruins intact and 'will not destroy them',"Islamic State has released new footage depicting unscathed ruins in the Syrian city of Palmyra, and activists say the group has promised to spare much of the ancient site and only destroy statues deemed polytheistic ‚Äì raising hopes that some of the most magnificent surviving ruins of antiquity may remain intact. But the human toll of the conflict increased as president Bashar al-Assad‚Äôs air force responded to the loss of Palmyra with an unforgiving air campaign that killed more than a dozen civilians on Monday and appears to have triggered a fresh humanitarian crisis in the area. The air strikes came after the regime abandoned Palmyra and most of its civilians with Isis at the city gates, after initially saying it had evacuated non-combatants. Activists and a monitoring group said Isis had used the majestic Roman theatre in Palmyra to execute nearly two dozen pro-Assad foreign fighters on Wednesday. The group held nearly 600 prisoners that Isis said fought alongside the regime. More than 200 people have been killed since the Isis offensive in the area began in mid-May.
An 87-second video released by one of the militant group‚Äôs media arms on Wednesday shows parts of the ancient city‚Äôs ruins and colonnades ‚Äì the Temple of Bel and the Roman theatre ‚Äì apparently undamaged and empty. ‚ÄúThey haven‚Äôt been damaged and members of the organisation told residents that they will not damage the city‚Äôs antiquities, but will destroy the idols,‚Äù an activist with the anti-regime Local Coordination Committee for Tadmur, the modern name for Palmyra, said. ‚ÄúPerhaps it‚Äôs because the Palmyra antiquities are mostly columns and large buildings and not statues of people, which they consider idols that must be destroyed, and they have no problem with the other antiquities.‚Äù Alwan FM, an anti-regime Syrian radio station, published an audio interview purporting to be with Abu Laith al-Saoudy, the nom de guerre of the Isis military commander in Palmyra, who pledged not to damage the site but said the group would destroy statues. ‚ÄúConcerning the historic city, we will preserve it and it will not be harmed, God willing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhat we will do is break the idols that the infidels used to worship. ‚ÄúThe historic buildings will not be touched and we will not bring bulldozers to destroy them like some people think,‚Äù he added. There were fears for the magnificent ruins of the city, an ancient silk-road hub and one of the best-preserved sites from antiquity, after Isis routed the regime garrison last week following a seven-day siege. The regime air raids have forced many civilians to try to escape the city‚Äôs bombardment and increased the number of internal refugees in the area. The Assad regime had claimed that it evacuated civilians from the city as its forces withdrew, but rowed back over the weekend. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any point in discussing the regime‚Äôs credibility,‚Äù the activist said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-27T16:24:21Z,world,World news,France: no Iran nuclear deal if military site inspections are blocked,"The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, whose country has taken a tough stance in the ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran, has said that France will not sign off on a deal if Tehran rules out inspections of its military sites as part of the final agreement. ‚ÄúFrance will not accept a deal if it is not clear that inspections can be done at all Iranian installations, including military sites,‚Äù Fabius told the national assembly in Paris on Wednesday, urging other negotiating partners to adopt a similar position. His comments came a week after Iran‚Äôs supreme leader, ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made clear that he would not allow the Iranian negotiating team to accept inspections of military sites or questioning of the country‚Äôs nuclear scientists. The dispute over the inspection of military sites shows how much distance remains between the two sides before they can reach a comprehensive agreement, but whether it will jeopardise an overall deal depends on how much diplomats are prepared to compromise at the last minute. ‚ÄúWe have already said that we will not allow any inspections of military sites by foreigners,‚Äù the ayatollah said last week. ‚ÄúThey also say that we must allow interviews with nuclear scientists. This is interrogation. I will not allow foreigners to come and talk to scientists who have advanced the science to this level.‚Äù Fabius said: ‚ÄúYes to an agreement, but not to an agreement that will enable Iran to have the atomic bomb. That is the position of France, which is independent and peaceful.‚Äù Iran and world‚Äôs six major powers, which also include the US, China, Russia, Britain and Germany, reached a tentative agreement on the framework of a comprehensive deal in April. Under its terms, restrictions will be placed on Iran‚Äôs enrichment of uranium so that it is unable to use the material in nuclear weapons. In return, the US and EU will terminate all nuclear-related economic sanctions on Iran once the UN nuclear agency confirms that Iran has complied.
Talks resumed in the Austrian capital, Vienna, on Wednesday for resolving the remaining issues concerning the final agreement, which was initially expected to be reached by the end of June, but diplomats have since said that the self-imposed deadline could be extended. ‚ÄúWe are not bound by time, but we are committed to this issue that a good agreement with details that are favourable to us is hammered out, even if it may take a long time,‚Äù said Abbas Araqchi, a senior Iranian negotiator, according to the Iranian state-run Press TV. In Vienna, he was due to meet with the EU deputy secretary-general, Helga Schmid. The French ambassador to the US, G√©rard Araud, tweeted on Tuesday: ‚ÄúOur goal is to get an agreement by the deadline. Likely that Iran will wait for the last days for compromising, like in March.‚Äù According to Yukiya Amano, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty that Iran has agreed to implement would give the agency the right to request inspections of all nuclear facilities, including military sites. It is not clear from the ayatollah‚Äôs comments whether Tehran would accept conditional inspection of its military sites. Earlier this week, Araqchi was quoted as saying that his country was prepared to grant ‚Äúmanaged access‚Äù to military sites, but denied that statement later.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-27T16:08:41Z,world,World news,American prisoner's fate unknown after deadly air strikes on Yemen jail,"Fears are growing over the fate of an American citizen trapped in a Yemeni military prison after a Saudi air strike bombed the compound where his lawyers believe he is held.
At least 80 people are thought to have died on Wednesday in a string of air strikes targeting the Yemeni capital of Sana‚Äôa and other sites near the Saudi border. The death toll was the highest in a single day in Saudi Arabia‚Äôs US-backed war to oust Houthi rebels who overthrew Washington proxy Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi earlier this year. Since the Houthi takeover, Sharif Mobley, a 31-year-old US citizen who disappeared from his pre-trial detention in February 2014, has smuggled cellphone calls from what he described as a ‚Äúmilitary base on Hadda Street‚Äù to warn family and attorneys that his life is in extreme danger. The attack leveled at least three buildings, sending plumes of black smoke into the air, according to an Associated Press reporter, who said the attack also set fire to the base, and caused a series of secondary explosions in weapons depots at the site. Attorneys with the human-rights group Reprieve wrote to the US State Department urging the diplomats, who left Mobley and other US citizens to their fate after closing their embassy, to provide them with proof of life and to directly facilitate communication with Mobley. ‚ÄúWe are extremely concerned for the fate of Mr Mobley, and require the US government to take immediate and visible steps to provide us with proof that Mr Mobley is still alive, and that if he has been wounded, that he has been evacuated to receive appropriate emergency medical care,‚Äù wrote Reprieve‚Äôs legal director, Kat Craig, in a Wednesday letter obtained by the Guardian. US diplomats have met with Mobley at least once during his disappearance. They have refused to tell his lawyers or his family where their Yemeni partners held him and issued a blanket assurance that he was well ‚Äì one Mobley later contradicted by alleging physical and mental abuse in custody, including being forced to drink from water bottles that had contained urine. The State Department has declined to substantively comment on Mobley to the Guardian for over a year, citing his privacy. It has yet to fulfill a Freedom of Information Act request for documentation of US-Yemeni communication about Mobley‚Äôs capture and detention, with which there is evidence of US complicity. Armed men captured Mobley in Sana‚Äôa in January 2010, shooting him in the leg. Soon after, interrogators identifying themselves as agents of the FBI and Defense Department interviewed him about Anwar al-Awlaki, an al-Qaida propagandist. Mobley‚Äôs advocates categorically insist he was never involved in terrorism. While Yemen never charged him with a terrorism-related offense, Yemenis claim he killed a guard in an attempt to escape from his hospital. Smuggled phone calls from Mobley in recent months have warned that Saudi warplanes were taking anti-aircraft fire from the roof of the building where he is held. On 14 May, a frantic Mobley called his sister to say his jailers were beating him with sticks: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying to kill me here at the prison.‚Äù Reprieve‚Äôs Craig, in her letter to the State Department, reminded US diplomats of her request to share coordinate information on Mobley‚Äôs location with their Saudi allies in order to spare his life. ‚ÄúIt is a matter of deep concern to us that these steps have clearly not been taken, and we intend pursuing this matter vigorously,‚Äù Craig wrote.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-27T15:57:12Z,world,World news,Court dismisses claim of German complicity in Yemeni drone killings,"A court in Cologne has dismissed a claim brought by three Yemenis accusing the German government of complicity in the deaths of civilians for allowing the US to relay drone data via Ramstein airbase. In a groundbreaking case brought by Yemenis who lost relatives in a 2012 attack on their village, the claimants argued that it would not have been possible to fly drones over Yemen without the existence of Ramstein, a US military base in western Germany. It was the first time that a court in a country lending military or technical support for the US drone programme allowed such a case to be heard. But a judge at Cologne administrative court dismissed the case after listening to two hours of arguments from the claimants, their lawyer and lawyers for the German government. She acknowledged the ‚Äúplausibility‚Äù that the base had been used to carry out drone strikes ‚Äì despite the US and German governments‚Äô repeated claims to the contrary ‚Äì but said the German government had no legal grounds on which to forbid the US from using Ramstein to do so. ‚ÄúThe German government is not obliged to prohibit the USA from using Ramstein airbase for the execution of drone attacks in Yemen,‚Äù said judge Hildeund Caspari-Wierzoch, adding that neither was it ‚Äúpolitically realistic‚Äù to terminate the Ramstein contract with the US. In a somewhat unusual move, she allowed the claimants to appeal, meaning the case could appear before a German court again within months. In a written statement to the court, Faisal bin Ali Jaber, who brought the claim along with his relatives Ahmed Saeed bin Ali Jaber and Khaled Mohmed Naser bin Ali Jaber, argued that his brother-in-law and nephew would still be alive but for Germany, as the US ‚Äúwould not have been able to fly drones over Yemen‚Äù. The brother-in-law, Salim bin Ali Jaber, 43, and his son Walid Abdullah bin Ali Jaber, a 26-year-old policeman, were killed in a drone strike while meeting representatives of al-Qaida in the Arab Peninsula in the village of Khashamir on 29 August 2012. Faisal bin Ali Jaber, who received $100,000 (¬£65,000) in what he has described as ‚Äúblood money‚Äù from the US government following the attack, said he and his family still lived in constant fear of drone strikes. ‚ÄúWe never know when or whom they will attack, and why someone is considered to be a target. Therefore it‚Äôs impossible to know how to protect yourself or your family,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe kiss our loved ones goodnight every day, not knowing whether we will ever see them again. It‚Äôs as if we lived in a constant nightmare from which we cannot wake up.‚Äù Stefan Sohm, a lawyer for the German defence ministry, argued that Germany could not be expected to act as ‚Äúa global public prosecutor towards other sovereign states‚Äù and the German government was satisfied with the assurances it had received from the US government as recently as January that ‚Äúno drones are commanded or controlled from Germany‚Äù. S√∂nke Hilbrans, a lawyer for the claimants, argued that Ramstein ‚Äì the largest US military base outside of the US ‚Äì was the site of a satellite relay station that facilitated the connection of drone operators in the American southwest with drones in targeted countries such as Yemen, Afghanistan and Pakistan, a claim that is supported by experts and a former drone operator. The international human rights organisations that supported the case expressed disappointment at the ruling but welcomed the fact that it had been brought at all. Kat Craig, legal director of Reprieve, said: ‚ÄúThe door‚Äôs open only a crack, but that‚Äôs all we need. Our foot is firmly wedged to stop it from closing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very positive that the court recognised that our concerns around Ramstein were plausible, that the case was admissable and took the rather unusual step for them to immediately allow us to appeal,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis is an important issue that has real relevance for Germany, and this is just the first step in a bigger process to help innocent people like Faisal and his family to live without being in constant fear of death by drones.‚Äù Andreas Sch√ºller, a representative of the Berlin-based European Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights, said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very positive that the court acknowledged the role that Ramstein plays in the global drone war because that‚Äôs more than the official US position and that‚Äôs something that will have to be taken into account in future actions. Neither can it be denied by the German government in future that the relay station exists.‚Äù Faisal bin Ali Jaber said in a statement issued through his lawyer: ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs hearing was a momentous occasion for drone victims. Of course, it is disappointing that we did not win. But the fact that ‚Äì finally ‚Äì our opinions are being expressed in court is a victory in itself. I am very pleased that we have been given permission to appeal: I will continue to place my faith in the law and German justice to keep me and my family safe.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-27T15:48:29Z,world,World news,EU urged to match Britain's aid spending to tackle migrant crisis,"The international development secretary Justine Greening is urging the EU to match Britain‚Äôs commitment to higher aid spending, warning that the flow of migrants will only be stemmed once poverty is tackled at source. Greening said the long-term solution to the crisis was to give people hope that they could have a better life in their own countries, rather than trying to intercept boats crossing the Mediterranean. Speaking to the Guardian, Greening said: ‚ÄúPeople are not prepared to accept a life sentence of poverty just because of where they are born. We are seeing people driven by conflict or by the hope of getting a job. These people are on our doorstep. ‚ÄúThey see people in the world living better lives and say, why can‚Äôt I have a better life myself?‚Äù Britain has sent the flagship HMS Bulwark to the Mediterranean to help rescue migrants and Greening said she fully backed attempts to crack down on the criminal gangs based in Libya. But she said the EU needed to ‚Äútackle the root causes of why people are moving in the first place‚Äù. Greening added: ‚ÄúWe need the EU collectively to step up to the plate. The UK is doing a lot because we have got to 0.7% (of gross national income spent on overseas aid). Our leadership comes from the fact that we are backing our words with action. The EU needs to bring its development budget to bear and so do member states.‚Äù She said the response to the UK‚Äôs message had been positive. ‚ÄúThere is a growing realisation of the fact that the way you choke off the supply of people that the human traffickers rely on is through development.‚Äù Britain is one of only four EU countries that has met the UN target for spending 0.7% of national income on aid. None of the other major EU countries ‚Äì Germany, France, Italy and Spain ‚Äì were close to reaching the UN goal in 2014. At a meeting of EU development ministers in Brussels this week, Greening stressed the dangers of not using financial assistance to help create jobs and prosperity in poor countries. She said: ‚ÄúThere are consequences of not being prepared to to work with other countries to help them become more prosperous. I was urging other EU member states to work collectively to tackle the root causes of the migration problem.‚Äù Germany, which is hosting a meeting of the G7 group of industrial nations in Bavaria next month, has just announced an increase in its aid spending. Greening said: ‚ÄúThere are the beginnings of a realisation that the lack of development around the world has clear domestic ramifications. The world is shrinking. People see that we live better lives in Europe. They notice the remittances being sent home. They ask themselves why they should have a life sentence of poverty.‚Äù The government has spared aid from the spending cuts of the past five years and, despite heavy criticism from some Conservative MPs and parts of Fleet Street, George Osborne has continued to ringfence Greening‚Äôs budget. She said her department was shifting its focus to economic development, adding: ‚ÄúWe want to turbo charge growth.‚Äù Greening told the meeting of EU development ministers that of the 5,000 migrants who died at sea in 2014, 3,000 perished in the Mediterranean. Those making the perilous crossing, she said, were following the basic human instinct of searching for a better life. Britain‚Äôs response to the civil war in Syria, which has resulted in 4million refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries, has encouraged Greening to think that big migration flows can be halted if people feel they have the chance of a decent life. ‚ÄúWhen I meet Syrian refugees, the discussions I have are about their for the future. Overwhelmingly, they want to go home. They have moved across the border for safety and are making lives for themselves as best they can.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-27T15:46:40Z,world,World news,Danish PM out to prove pollsters wrong as rightwingers play up election chances,"Unsuspecting shoppers on Str√∏get, Copenhagen‚Äôs main pedestrian street, were inundated with free samples of pork scratchings on Wednesday as election fever suddenly gripped Denmark. Clad in white rugby shirts bearing the image of a guard dog on the back, MPs from the rightwing, Eurosceptic and anti-immigrant Danish People‚Äôs party were thrusting packets of the national delicacy in all directions, just an hour after the prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, dissolved parliament. S√∏ren Espersen, the DPP‚Äôs foreign affairs spokesman, quipped: ‚ÄúThank heavens she called the election. We‚Äôve got 800 kilos and the sell-by date is 27 July.‚Äù The latest opinion polls suggest that, like its spiritual British cousins Ukip, the DPP will be the third largest party on 18 June, election day. Thanks to Denmark‚Äôs proportional representation system, the DPP is likely to be a key pillar in a coalition led by the right-of-centre Liberal party, which could boost David Cameron‚Äôs campaign to renegotiate European Union membership terms.
Cameron was forced to cancel a planned breakfast meeting on Thursday with Thorning-Schmidt because of the election announcement. Taking a break from offloading pork scratchings, Espersen told the Guardian: ‚ÄúThe road Mr Cameron has taken is one we will follow with interest because that is exactly what we want. ‚ÄúWe want an EU where power is brought back to the member states and where the commission doesn‚Äôt rule. That is of the utmost importance to the future of Europe, we believe. We think David Cameron is speaking on behalf of many, many states that don‚Äôt want to see the continuation of this madness. What is going on in Britain is to the advantage of the whole community.‚Äù The confidence of Espersen and Denmark‚Äôs so-called blue block is justified, according to Rune Stubager, a professor of political science at Aarhus University. If Thorning-Schmidt wins, ‚Äúit will be the biggest comeback in Danish political history,‚Äù Stubager said. ‚ÄúNever has a government that has been so far behind succeeded in regaining power. That would be a historical achievement.‚Äù
The latest poll, published on Tuesday, suggests that 46% of the Danish electorate considers Thorning-Schmidt to be the most credible prime ministerial candidate. However, her party, the Social Democrats, who are similar in their stance to New Labour, are on 25% in the polls, and their coalition partners on the left are flagging. Thorning-Schmidt, who is married to Stephen Kinnock, the newly elected MP for Aberavon and son of the former Labour leader Neil, is trumpeting what she claims is her success in marshalling Denmark‚Äôs emergence from the financial crisis. In a televised announcement from the prime minister‚Äôs office ‚Äì flouting convention that elections are called from the floor of Christiansborg, the parliament ‚Äì she spoke of the progress since she took office in 2011. ‚ÄúMore than 100,000 Danes had lost their jobs. All over the country, businesses, were shutting down. We have now had growth for 18 months in a row. Our businesses are once again thriving. Our money is being managed properly, but most importantly, more than 30,000 people have got jobs,‚Äù she said. The man expected to replace Thorning-Schmidt as PM, Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen, can muster only 19% in the credibility stakes. His personal ratings are affected by lingering doubts about his suitability for the role after revelations that he used Liberal party funds to pay for his wardrobe.
The Liberals are running second in the polls on 21%. They are pledging tax cuts that would be paid for by cutting foreign aid and reducing Denmark‚Äôs generous welfare benefits. Speaking on a walkabout in downtown Copenhagen, Rasmussen said: ‚ÄúFar too many Danes gain far too little by working. There has to be freedom for those who can. And care for those who can‚Äôt.‚Äù Immigration is certain to be a big issue, much to the dismay of the United Nations committee on racial discrimination, which said it was ‚Äúconcerned about the increase in xenophobia and political propaganda targeting non-citizens‚Äù. Thorning-Schmidt is being talked up as a potential future UN secretary general, as the organisation is thought to favour replacing Ban Ki-moon with a woman when he steps down next year. In the meantime she is trying to prove the pollsters wrong. Before handing out roses in Copenhagen, Thorning-Schmidt said: ‚ÄúIf the Danes want me, I want to continue this course of ours.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-27T15:08:48Z,world,World news,Reunion with looted painting is 'second victory against the Nazis',"Most of David Toren‚Äôs family died in the Holocaust and he, then a teenager, only survived because his father got him to safety via the Kindertransport. Now Toren has spoken of the emotion of being reunited with a painting the Nazis seized more than 75 years ago. ‚ÄúI felt the sense of victory ‚Äì the second victory against the Nazis,‚Äù he told the Guardian. Toren, now 90, was 13 when he last saw Two Riders on a Beach, an early 20th-century masterpiece by the German painter Max Liebermann, at the home of his great-uncle, David Friedmann, a passionate art collector, patron and prominent society figure in Breslau.
The painting was returned to Friedmann‚Äôs heirs this month. Toren, a retired lawyer, is now blind and family members have decided to sell the painting. It is a painful decision, but ‚Äúthere is no other solution‚Äù, he said. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt cut up the painting [to share it].‚Äù An artist has created a braille version for him. Two Riders on a Beach will be the first painting to be sold from the secret hoard of Cornelius Gurlitt, the reclusive son of one of Adolf Hitler‚Äôs art dealers, Sotheby‚Äôs has announced. Painted in 1901, it was among more than 1,200 artworks found in Gurlitt‚Äôs dilapidated flat in Munich in 2012. They had been hidden from the world for decades and long ago assumed to have been destroyed in the war. The biggest single artistic find of the postwar era was made after tax authorities began investigating Gurlitt. Customs officials, in a routine search, found him carrying a large amount of cash, which led investigators to the treasure trove acquired by his father, Hildebrand Gurlitt.
Cornelius died last year, having left his estate to the Kunstmuseum Bern in Switzerland, acknowledging that any works with proven links to Jewish owners could be returned to their heirs. But a dispute over that estate has kept the collection in storage in Munich. Friedmann, who made part of his fortune in brick production, bought the Liebermann painting after its first exhibition in 1901. Toren remembers Friedmann as an imposing, cultured man who threw lavish parties attended by friends such as the composer Richard Strauss and Hjalmar Schacht, who was to become Hitler‚Äôs minister of economics. It was because of such friendships that Toren‚Äôs father, a lawyer and poet, found it so hard to understand the increasing persecution of the Jews in the 1930s. Toren said his father wrote to Schacht asking for his help: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he ever got an answer.‚Äù
The Nazis forced Friedmann to sell his possessions to them. In 1938, that included passing his country estate to a high-ranking Nazi official, who had also been a family friend. Toren was there, made to wait outside, in a room where the Liebermann hung, as his great uncle signed the legal papers. He found himself captivated by the painting, staring at it. Lucian Simmons, worldwide director of restitution at Sotheby‚Äôs, said: ‚ÄúThe Nazis were very keen on having a legal veneer over everything. When Friedmann sold off the estate to the Nazi general, it was like any conveyancing transaction. ‚ÄúThere were lawyers on both sides ‚Ä¶ His conveyancing lawyer had to be sprung out of the concentration camp.‚Äù
The memory is particularly painful for Toren. It was one of the last times he saw his father, who was arrested by the Gestapo the day after Kristallnacht. On discovering that, as Friedmann‚Äôs lawyer, Toren‚Äôs father was needed to complete the forced sale, the Nazis escorted him to Friedmann‚Äôs home before taking him on to Buchenwald concentration camp. Toren, who now lives in New York, and his brother were the only family members to survive the Holocaust. Their parents were later gassed at Auschwitz. Remembering the horror of Kristallnacht, when Jews and their properties were attacked, he said: ‚Äú[It] is one of [my] big memories. That was my first victory against the Nazis.‚Äù He was saved by his Korean karate teacher warning him to hide away that night because he knew that ‚Äúterrible things will happen to the Jews‚Äù. Sotheby‚Äôs will auction the painting in London on 24 June. It is estimated to fetch between ¬£350,000 and ¬£550,000.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-27T13:51:21Z,world,World news,"Legal battle over royal house of Mysore, and one of India's great fortunes","The fortune is one of the greatest on earth ‚Äì the legacy of one of India‚Äôs richest princes, which tens of thousands have died in battle to protect. Now however, it will be a battery of lawyers who will defend the palaces, fortresses, jewels, crowns, paintings and vast domains of the royal house of Mysore, once an independent kingdom that was founded more than 500 years ago, and quickly established itself as one of the most powerful in southern India. And it will be Indian judges, not force of arms, that will decide on their ownership. In June, a court in the southern city of Bangalore will hear the claim of Kanthraj Urs, the eldest nephew of the 28th maharaja of Mysore, the late Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wodeyar. Urs wants the entire estate and properties ‚Äì worth ¬£8bn by some estimates ‚Äì to be split equally among the family. Urs, 42, claims that his uncle divided his immense wealth between his five sisters almost 30 years before he died two years ago, childless and without naming an heir.
But, though he performed the last rites for the dead king, it was Wodeyar‚Äôs 61-year-old widow, maharani Pramodadevi, who took charge of the vast estate. ‚ÄúIt was expected that I would be named [as heir of the estate]. Who wouldn‚Äôt be upset?,‚Äù said Urs.At the centre of several key trade routes, and with its own gem and gold mines, the kingdom of Mysore swiftly became incredibly rich. It was only subdued in 1799 by the forces of the British East India Company after four bitterly fought wars. The final battle against Tipu Sultan, the legendary king of Mysore still revered in India for his opposition to the invaders, ended in the monarch‚Äôs death and is seen as one of the key military events in the British conquest of the subcontinent. Much of the modern nation of India was once made up of more than 500 independent princely states. Some, such as Mysore, were vast. Others comprised a few fields and an old fort. When India gained independence from the British in 1947, most joined the new Indian nation. Aristocrats were stripped of any remaining honours, privileges and revenue by the government of Indira Gandhi in 1971. There have been periodic attempts to reverse the measures. However the dynasties did not die, nor did their fortunes.
On Thursday, a new king will sit on the Mysore throne and place the gem-studded crown on his head. It is Urs‚Äôs 23-year-old nephew, picked by the maharani to be the new king and formally adopted in a glittering ceremony at the Mysore palace in February this year. Yaduveer Gopal Raj Urs‚Äô accession on Thursday was delayed due to the future monarch‚Äôs desire to complete his economics degree at the University of Massachusetts first. Maharani Pramodadevi said that, though she has been hurt by the family dispute, the selection of the next heir was done in line with 600-year-old customs and traditions and that no one was ‚Äùspurned‚Äù or ‚Äùbetrayed‚Äù. ‚ÄúIn the case of childless royal couples, there is no hard and fast rule that the next heir has to be the brother‚Äôs son or any specific relation,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe preference is given to the brother‚Äôs son. I know what my husband would have expected in an heir. I know what is expected of an heir to carry on customs and legacy. Based on these I have made the choice.‚Äù
Some however blame an ancient malediction for the family‚Äôs problems with bearing heirs. The ‚ÄúTalakad curse‚Äù was cast upon the dynasty in the 17th century by the queen of the neighbouring Srirangapatna kingdom, when it was invaded and annexed by Mysore‚Äôs kings. The queen fled with the temple jewels and hid near a village called Talakad. Discovered by her enemies, she cursed the royal house of Mysore for eternity and jumped to her death in the river Cauvery. ‚ÄúSince 1610, barring one king who had a deaf and mute son, no other king in the Wodeyar line has had children,‚Äù said Raja Chandra, the late Mysore king‚Äôs brother in law. ‚ÄúPeople can say it is because of the curse or not, but the history is true: that cannot be denied.‚Äù India‚Äôs courts system is notoriously slow, and the chances of a decision on the succession dispute any time soon appear slim. This does not discourage the royal claimant, however. ‚ÄúI am not a doormat, no one can ride roughshod over me. I will fight for my rights,‚Äù Urs said. Such disputes are not rare in India. In 2013, two sisters inherited more than ¬£2bn after a court found that the will of their father, the last maharaja of Faridkot, was void. The testament had left his estate to a trust run by servants and lawyers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-27T13:29:21Z,world,World news,"EU countries to take in 40,000 asylum seekers in migration quota proposal","European Union countries are to take in 40,000 asylum seekers who flee to Italy and Greece, under proposals from the EU executive in Brussels. It is seen as the first step in a plan to introduce new immigration quotas across the union. The European commission‚Äôs radical blueprint for quotas has run into a wall of resistance in national capitals since it was announced this month in response to the mass drownings of migrants in the Mediterranean.
The call on Wednesday for 24,000 refugees who arrive in Italy to be relocated to other countries and 16,000 from Greece will also face stiff opposition. In order to try to make the sharing of refugees more palatable for member states, the proposal is laced with caveats. The scheme would apply only to migrants who have arrived in Italy and Greece since last month; who have a chance of obtaining asylum, ruling out economic and other ‚Äúirregular‚Äù migrants; and who are of a nationality with at least a 75% success rate in asylum claims, meaning probably only Syrians and Eritreans. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clearly a beginning, a first step,‚Äù William Lacy Swing, the head of the International Organisation for Migration, told the Guardian. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of interest in a comprehensive policy.‚Äù He described immigration as a toxic issue in European politics. ‚ÄúOur migration policies have not kept pace with migration realities,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is not something that gets you elected or re-elected.‚Äù France, Spain and the countries of central and eastern Europe have been bitterly critical of the quota plans. In April interior ministers from the 28 countries agreed that any sharing of refugees should be voluntary, but the commission plans would make the redistribution mandatory. Germany, Sweden, and Austria, which together take in the lion‚Äôs share of refugees in Europe along with Italy and Greece, are in favour of the plan. According to EU figures, 220,000 irregular migrants reached Italy and Greece last year, and the numbers have surpassed that this year. Of the total, around 40% were Syrians and Eritreans fleeing war and oppression with very good chances of lodging successful asylum claims in the EU. Britain is not set to take any of the 40,000 as it is exempted from EU asylum policy unless it wants to take part. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs up to the United Kingdom to decide what to do,‚Äù said Dimitris Avramopoulos, the commissioner for migration issues who announced the scheme. ‚ÄúIt is up to Great Britain to decide and choose. Europe is here.‚Äù A British government spokesperson said: ‚ÄúWe do not oppose resettlement in principle, but we believe such schemes are best decided at national level and have no plans to contribute to an EU quota.‚Äù Denmark also has an opt-out and will not take part. On Wednesday the Danish prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, called a general election for next month. Immigration will play a prominent role in the campaign and the anti-immigrant Danish People‚Äôs party is riding high in the opinion polls. Ireland, which also does not need to take part in EU asylum policy, has said it will take some of the refugees. Avramopoulos announced that the EU would push ahead with plans to process asylum seekers extraterritorially before they can arrive in Europe and lodge a claim. Brussels is to establish an office for examining asylum applications in Niger, west Africa, as an experiment, he said. If the operation goes well, similar offices could be set up in several countries across north Africa and the Middle East. Under Wednesday‚Äôs proposals, the asylum seekers being relocated would need to lodge their claims in the countries they are sent to from Italy and Greece. The new host countries would be paid ‚Ç¨6,000 per refugee by Brussels. The 40,000 total covers a two-year period.
Avramopoulos conceded that the plan would run into opposition from national governments. The figure of 40,000 was decided as the minimum needed to help Italy and Greece but also because it was the maximum figure acceptable to EU governments. If the plan is implemented, it is not clear where the refugees would end up since once relocated to, say, France, an immigrant would be able to use Europe‚Äôs passport-free Schengen zone to move, for example, to Germany. In addition to the mooted 40,000, the commission is also proposing that the EU countries share a further 20,000 asylum seekers who have not yet come to Europe. It argues that Britain should take part in this latter project. Wednesday‚Äôs proposals are aimed at relieving the immediate pressure on Italy and Greece.

While the plans will enjoy much support in the European parliament, it will be an uphill battle to get the scheme endorsed by national governments in the European Council.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-27T13:26:23Z,world,World news,Warning to Camino de Santiago pilgrims after female walker disappears,"Pilgrims are being warned to avoid walking alone along a 15-mile stretch of Spain‚Äôs Camino de Santiago after police launched an investigation into an attempted abduction in the same area where an American pilgrim went missing in early April. Denise Thiem, from Arizona, was last seen in the town of Astorga, in the north-western province of Le√≥n on 5 April. The 41-year-old was walking along the Camino Franc√©s, one of the most popular of the pilgrimage routes to Santiago de Compostela, which between them attract hundreds of thousands of people each year. More than six weeks after her disappearance, Spanish police say the investigation remains open. Her family and friends, meanwhile, are recruiting volunteers for local searches of the area, with the next search planned in Astorga on Saturday. As alarm grew among residents of the small municipality of Astorga over Thiem‚Äôs disappearance, warning bells went off again last week when a local woman jogging near a popular resting spot for pilgrims was approached by two men in a car. ‚ÄúIt was a terrible experience,‚Äù the woman, who is in her 50s, told Atlas media. As the young men attempted to get her attention, she noticed that one of them had his face partially covered. One of them grabbed her by the arm, attempting to force her into the car. ‚ÄúHe left marks on my arm where he grabbed me.‚Äù She slipped out of his grip and took off running. ‚ÄúI headed into the bushes and he was behind me.‚Äù She found a place to hide, calling for help on her mobile. Police are investigating the incident.
With local media drawing parallels between the attempted abduction and Thiem‚Äôs disappearance, one of the pilgrimage‚Äôs largest English-speaking forums advised pilgrims not to walk alone on the section of the route, which stretches from Astorga to Rabanal del Camino. ‚ÄúIt seemed like it got to a point where there were so many things, and when you put them together it sounded like we should tell people about this,‚Äù said site administrator Ivar Rekve. Residents had told local daily El Diario de Le√≥n that this wasn‚Äôt the first they had heard of incidents like the attempted abduction, and complained about a lack of security in the area. In his 10 years of running the forum, Rekve said it was the first time he had ever sent out such a warning, in which he highlighted the credible reports about improper behaviour towards women along the route. ‚ÄúThe Camino has been a very safe place, and it still is, but it only takes a few to make the situation more uncertain,‚Äù he added.
Several other pilgrims have come forward, flagging inappropriate behaviours on the same section where the American pilgrim disappeared. One pilgrim, walking from Acebo to Molinaseca, detailed how she was accosted by a mountain biker who tried repeatedly to grab her breasts. The incident took place one day before and some 25 miles from where Thiem was last seen. ‚ÄúThere were very few people out there ‚Äì If I saw someone every half hour, I would be surprised,‚Äù said Maureen, a New Yorker who asked that her last name not be used. ‚ÄúHe was trying to touch my breasts ... He tried three different times and I tried to laugh it off because I didn‚Äôt want to anger him. It was very unexpected, very bizarre. It was a little ridiculous ‚Äì this guy was maybe 22; I‚Äôm 47.‚Äù She left hurriedly, checking to make sure that she wasn‚Äôt being followed. ‚ÄúThis guy was younger, fitter and could have easily overpowered me.‚Äù She told few people about what had happened to her, but after hearing about the disappearance of Thiem, she began speaking out. ‚ÄúMost pilgrims are having such an amazing time, you don‚Äôt want to darken their experience with such a scary story. But now I feel like I should have told more people.‚Äù It‚Äôs the same thought that has continually crossed the mind of Barbara Veronese since she heard of Thiem‚Äôs disappearance. As the 60-year-old German pilgrim was walking on her own near Astorga, she was passed very slowly four times by a white car. At one point the car stopped some 15 metres ahead of her and a man got out of the car. ‚ÄúIt was kind of strange. I was trying not to look at him. I think he was masturbating,‚Äù she said. Veronese picked up the pace, hoping to catch up to four Irish pilgrims ahead of her on the trail. The Irish group had noticed the car and stopped to wait for her. ‚ÄúI think the guy saw them and he disappeared and didn‚Äôt come back.‚Äù Worried for her safety, the Irish pilgrims had snapped a picture of the car, and Veronese sent it to Spanish police after she heard about Thiem‚Äôs disappearance. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on my mind every day,‚Äù she said. Some three weeks after Thiem‚Äôs disappearance, another pilgrim chimed in on the Camino de Santiago forum, posting her own experience in the area. Some eight months earlier, she had taken an alternative route listed in her guide, turning off the main route between Astorga and El Ganso and following what she called a ‚Äúfake‚Äù arrow marked on the trail. ‚ÄúOn the wrong path, a masked man attacked me with a stun gun. However, I was able to free myself and run away,‚Äù she wrote, identifying herself on the forum as Josie from Germany. Spanish police confirmed that someone had been arrested in connection with the case. Court authorities, citing privacy reasons, would not say whether the arrested person had been charged. The ongoing investigations have prompted the municipality of Astorga to also recommend that pilgrims avoid travelling alone along the most remote areas of the route. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs for precaution, we understand there isn‚Äôt any danger,‚Äù said the local mayor, Victorina Alonso, likening it to an advisory to watch over one‚Äôs luggage at the airport. ‚ÄúThe airport isn‚Äôt full of people who rob all the time, but there are a few people who will find a piece of luggage and take it.‚Äù She urged pilgrims to stay calm, noting that all of the incidents were being treated as isolated cases until the police found otherwise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-27T13:12:19Z,world,World news,Pakistan arrests owner of firm accused of mass-selling fake degrees,"Pakistani authorities have detained the owner of a software company accused of running a global network in selling fake degrees. Detectives held Shoaib Shaikh on Wednesday and seized hundreds of thousands of fake degrees during a raid on the Axact company offices in Karachi, Shahid Hayat, provincial director for Pakistan‚Äôs federal investigation agency, said.
Police are investigating the company and Shaikh on charges of marketing online degrees from non-existent schools and universities. Reuters reported that the interior ministry had written to the FBI seeking assistance. The developments follow a report in the New York Times alleging Axact makes millions of dollars from selling bogus degrees. It was supposedly going to launch a TV channel in Pakistan when a New York Times report exposed the alleged fraud this month. Shaikh and several others were detained on charges of fraud, forgery and cybercrime, Hayat said. It was not immediately known how many people were arrested. ‚ÄúWe have seized hundreds of thousands of fake degrees,‚Äù Hayat said. ‚ÄúWe have enough evidence to proceed ‚Äì we have forensic evidence.‚Äù The police also sealed the office building, where Hayat said machinery and gadgets were found that were used in the allegedly fraudulent business. A magistrate who supervised the operation said those detained would appear in court on Wednesday.
Local TV footage broadcast images said to be of a room at the company offices, showing what looked like diplomas stacked on shelves along the wall. Hayat also showed reporters what he said were fake university accreditations and student ID cards found at the premises. Axact has been accused of running hundreds of websites purporting to belong to colleges with names similar to prestigious institutions such as the universities of ‚ÄúBarkley‚Äù and ‚ÄúColumbiana‚Äù. According to the New York Times, actors were used to play the parts of academics and students in videos on some of the websites. Axact employees operating a boiler room-style operation also allegedly posed as US officials to bully potential customers into paying thousands of dollars for worthless accreditation, detectives said. The software company has described the case against it as a conspiracy by rival media groups, and insisted it was not involved in any illegal activity.
If Axact is found guilty, the scandal has the potential not only to bring down the high-profile company but also a new media conglomerate, Bol, which Axact‚Äôs owners had been preparing to launch after using its funds to hire some of Pakistan‚Äôs best-known journalists. Shaikh has a history of making flamboyant claims about the company and has previously expressed ambitions to become richer than Bill Gates. In a country with pressing social and economic problems, Axact has claimed it will make education and healthcare accessible to all by 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-27T12:23:14Z,world,World news,Russian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza in hospital after falling ill,"A Russian opposition activist has been taken to hospital in Moscow after a sudden illness. Vladimir Kara-Murza, who works for the Open Russia movement founded by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the oligarch and Putin critic who now lives in Zurich, was admitted after a sharp drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness. Doctors initially thought he could have been poisoned, Vadim Prokhorov, a lawyer for the RPR Parnas opposition party, told the newspaper Kommersant. Kara-Murza is a member of the political council of the party, which had been led by Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov until his death in February. Doctors later diagnosed Kara-Murza with kidney failure, his father told RBC newspaper. ‚ÄúThe deputy head doctor of the hospital came out and told us that everything was fine with his heart, his lungs, his stomach, etc. It all had to do with his kidneys,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt could have been spoiled yogurt or something else.‚Äù Although Kara-Murza‚Äôs father ruled out deliberate poisoning, colleagues had expressed doubts about the sudden illness, which comes after the killing of Nemtsov and reported pressure on opposition activists. Open Russia project coordinator Maria Baronova told the Guardian his illness was suspicious and said ‚Äúvarious activities surrounding public people from Open Russia look strange‚Äù, but declined to elaborate. Opposition journalist Alexander Ryklin wrote on Facebook on Wednesday that he had just spoken with Kara-Murza and that the doctors ‚Äúsuspect poisoning‚Äù. Kara-Murza‚Äôs father previously told Kommersant that his son‚Äôs condition could be explained by an allergy or a high-stress lifestyle ‚Äúwith irregular meals, little sleep‚Äù. Kara-Murza had been at the offices of the Russian Legal Information Agency, a state-owned legal news agency, on Tuesday when he fell ill and was taken away by ambulance, his father said.Anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, who was given two suspended sentences on what many see as politically motivated charges, said on Twitter that he had seen Kara-Murza a few days ago, adding: ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt complain about his health and was entirely energetic [like usual].‚Äù
Russian police raided the Open Russia offices in April. According to a copy of their search warrant later, police suspected the organisation of printing leaflets to be handed out at a planned opposition rally that called for ‚Äúextremist activities‚Äù. Two days ago there was a screening in Moscow of a 26-minute film Open Russia film, entitled Family. It alleges that Chechnya‚Äôs president Ramzan Kadyrov is guilty of widespread human rights abuses, presides over a personal army of 80,000 fighters and skims off money from the federal budget. Kara-Murza was also involved in writing a report into the war in Ukraine, conceived by Nemtsov, who was shot dead outside the Kremlin in February. At the time of his death, Nemtsov was planning a dossier exposing Vladimir Putin‚Äôs secret war in the east of Ukraine. The 65-page report entitled Putin and the War was completed by Nemtsov‚Äôs friends. It alleges that Russian troops have taken part in the conflict ‚Äì with at least 220 killed ‚Äì and that Russia has covertly supplied the rebels with military hardware, intelligence and training. Putin denies Russian forces have been involved in the war. Kara-Murza lives in Moscow and New York, where his three children are based. His previous projects have included a documentary likening Russia‚Äôs opposition to Putin with Soviet dissidents who protested in the 1960s. Kara-Murza took Vladimir Bukovsky, a prominent enemy of the KGB who spent 12 years in Soviet labour camps and psychiatric facilities, to New York last year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-27T07:52:45Z,world,World news,Fifa corruption arrests: key questions answered,"What has happened? Fifa, the world governing body of football, has been plunged into crisis after a number of its top officials were arrested at a hotel in Switzerland on suspicion of receiving bribes totalling $100m (¬£65m). The dawn arrests in Zurich, where the organisation is based, came hours before Swiss prosecutors announced a criminal investigation into the 2018 and 2022 football World Cup bids. Fifa - the International Federation of Association Football - is in charge of organising football‚Äôs major tournaments, including the World Cup, which takes place every four years. Who was arrested? Nine Fifa officials and four executives of sports management companies were arrested, according to the US Department of Justice. The suspects were named as: Jack Warner, the former Fifa vice-president Jeffrey Webb, current Fifa vice-president and president of the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (Concacaf) Eugenio Figueredo, current Fifa vice-president and executive committee member Eduardo Li, current Fifa executive committee member-elect Julio Rocha, current Fifa development officer Rafael Esquivel, president of the Venezuelan Football Federation Jos√© Maria Marin, ex-president of the Brazilian Football Confederation Costas Takkas, current attacheÃÅ to the Concacaf president Jeffrey Webb According to the US Department of Justice, the sports marketing executives arrested were: Alejandro Burzaco, the controlling pincipal of Argentinian sports marketing firm Torneos y Competencias S.A; Aaron Davidson, president of Traffic Sports USA; Hugo and Mariano Jinkis, controlling principals of Argentinian sports marketing firm Full Play Group S.A. Was Fifa president Sepp Blatter arrested? No. Fifa spokesman Walter de Gregorio told the Associated Press: ‚ÄúHe is not involved at all.‚Äù Blatter‚Äôs Twitter account, which recently celebrated Fifa‚Äôs 111th birthday, has remained silent on the arrests. What do the charges involve? The Fifa officials are accused of pocketing well over $150m in bribes in ‚Äúbrazen corruption‚Äù stretching back 24 years. US prosecutors said the football officials conspired with sports marketing executives to ‚Äúshut out competitors and keep highly lucrative contracts for themselves through the systematic payment of bribes and kickbacks‚Äù. Could Russia and Qatar be stripped of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups? No country has ever been stripped of a World Cup, so this is without precedent. Such a move would be mired in legal complexities, with both Qatar and Russia likely to aggressively challenge any decision to strip them of the tournament on which both countries have already spent vast sums. However, it is equally likely that members of the rival bids ‚Äì including Australia and the US for the 2022 World Cup, and Portugal and Spain for 2018 ‚Äì will be looking closely at the details of Wednesday‚Äôs extraordinary developments with a view to applying for the bidding process to be reopened. Both World Cups have been mired in controversy since they were awarded on 2 December 2010. Yet Sepp Blatter has been adamant that nothing would derail either tournament, declaring as recently as last week after meeting Russian president Vladimir Putin that ‚Äúnothing will get in the way of Russia hosting the best ever World Cup‚Äù. As he spoke, the FBI and Swiss police were preparing to make arrests that would throw the future of both World Cups into grave doubt. Why were the arrests made now? Swiss police appear to have timed the arrests to occur before Fifa‚Äôs annual general meeting on Friday, when they knew that a significant number of their suspects would be in the same city. Not just the same city, but the same hotel. The raid on the Baur au Lac, a luxury hotel with views overlooking the Alps, has long been favouredby Fifa officials visiting Zurich. Why are US authorities investigating Fifa? The US attorney general is due to hold a press conference on Wednesday when more details will become clear. However, the FBI has been investigating the process that led to the award of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup finals to Russia and Qatar respectively. News of the FBI investigation emerged in March 2013 with further details reported in November last year. It was reported that Chuck Blazer, a former Fifa executive committee member, was cooperating with the inquiry after he was approached over huge unpaid tax bills related to commissions he had received during his time as Concacaf general secretary. Who is Chuck Blazer? Chuck Blazer is a former Fifa executive committee member. Days before he was due to stand down in May 2013, he was suspended from football for 90 days by Fifa amid allegations that he fraudulently received more than $20m from Concacaf. The 70-year-old football chief has also held senior posts in America and is credited with turning the sport into a booming success in the US. And while US soccer‚Äôs fortunes flourished, so did Blazer‚Äôs. He earned the nickname Mr Ten Percent after reportedly negotiating an extraordinary contract with Concacaf that entitled him to 10% of just about every penny the body brought in. His colourful jet-set lifestyle matched his exuberance, and when he wasn‚Äôt living in his $18,000-a-month Manhattan apartment, he was probably relaxing at his luxury condo in the Bahamas. Last November it emerged that Blazer was cooperating with a US investigation into Fifa. Investigators were said to have approached Blazer in 2011 after allegedly discovering huge unpaid tax bills related to commissions he had received during his time as Concacaf general secretary. The New York Daily News, which broke the story in November 2014, reported that Blazer had secretly recorded Fifa executives for US investigators using a keychain fitted with a covert recording device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-27T06:46:28Z,world,World news,Woman accused of sorcery reportedly hacked to death in Papua New Guinea,"A woman accused of sorcery for the second time has been hacked to death just months after she was saved from ‚Äúdeath row‚Äù in a remote village in Papua New Guinea. The woman, known as Mifila, was killed last week, allegedly ‚Äúchopped‚Äù to death by a number of attackers from another village a week‚Äôs trek away through the highlands jungle.
‚ÄúThere was no evidence, literally nothing,‚Äù the deputy police commander of Enga province, Epenes Nili, said. Mifila was among a group of four women who had been accused of witchcraft following the death from measles of several villagers in January. Nili was part of a delegation which flew into the village, staging an intervention and rescue, which at the time was hailed as a resounding success. Nili told Guardian Australia he received a report of Mifila‚Äôs murder on Wednesday. ‚ÄúThe lady, she was accused of performing magic resulting in the death of several people in the village,‚Äù Nili told Guardian Australia. ‚ÄúWith this total lie, just because of the strong belief in [sorcery] there, she was murdered. Not by a relative but by another group of people.‚Äù Nili vowed to ‚Äúsend in the troops‚Äù to apprehend those who murdered Mifila. ‚ÄúI was so frustrated and so angry at what really happened, I am now compiling a full report. What I will be doing is asking everyone to make a submission and request to the parliamentarians and the leaders if they can fund my trip to fly in about 10-12 policemen including a medical doctor to exhume the body and conduct a post-mortem and immediately arrest the suspects, those who are aiding the suspects and those who took part in the murder of [Mifila].‚Äù He said his investigation would also establish if there was any involvement by a spiritual diviner ‚Äì known as a ‚Äúglass woman‚Äù ‚Äì who had stood before the village at the January intervention and admitted she lied about the ‚Äúguilt‚Äù of people accused of sorcery, in order to get money. Amnesty International said the case highlighted the ‚Äúpersistent failure‚Äù by the PNG government to address sorcery related acts of violence. The PNG government is slowly pushing sorcery-related legislation, but a law which provided a defence to violence if it was done to ‚Äústop witchcraft‚Äù was only repealed in 2013. ‚ÄúThe government must act immediately to ensure that the perpetrators of such attacks are brought to justice,‚Äù said Kate Schuetze, Amnesty International‚Äôs Pacific researcher, in a statement. She said two other women ‚Äúnarrowly escaped death‚Äù last week and remain at risk. Last month four people in the village of Kaiwe, near Mount Hagen, were accused of sorcery and allegedly tortured by other villagers. Two women were allegedly taken by drunken youths and tortured until they gave up the names of two men. The four were accused of witchcraft and tortured, before family and police intervened. One woman went back to her home community, but fears remained for the other three, particular the young woman. On Wednesday, Kamane Wauga, senior program officer in the PNG highlands for Oxfam, told Guardian Australia all four accused were now in their own communities and ‚Äúcurrently safe‚Äù but would not be able to return to the village where they were accused. He said a glass man ‚Äì who the community had agreed to wait for to judge the ‚Äúguilt‚Äù of the four accused ‚Äì had not arrived to perform his divining, and police had intervened to free the accused and allow them back to the village. Family members still hoped to have an investigation into the alleged torture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-27T05:38:48Z,world,World news,Indonesia sets date for final death row appeal of Frenchman Serge Atlaoui,"An Indonesian court said it would hear a last-ditch appeal by a French man on death row on 3 June, after a verdict expected this week was delayed by the absence of the presiding judge. Serge Atlaoui had been due to face the firing squad with other prisoners in April but won a last-minute reprieve for the completion of his legal appeals. France‚Äôs president, Fran√ßois Hollande, has warned Indonesia it would face ‚Äúconsequences‚Äù if it were to press ahead with his execution. Indonesia has harsh penalties for drug trafficking and resumed executions in 2013 after a five-year lull. The president, Joko Widodo, has rejected clemency pleas from foreign nationals who are among a group of about 60 drug convicts scheduled for execution. Fourteen have been executed this year, including Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran; Nigerians Raheem Salami, Silvester Obiekwe Nwolise, Okwudili Oyatanze and Martin Anderson; Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte and Indonesian Zainal Abidin, who were all shot dead in April. Mary Jane Veloso, from the Philippines, was given a last-minute reprieve from execution, but remains on death row.
Widodo has declared the death penalty ‚Äúpositive‚Äù for his country, adding: ‚ÄúMy duty as president of Indonesia is to carry out the law and I‚Äôm sure other countries will understand this. ‚ÄúEvery day 50 young Indonesians die [drug-related deaths]; in one year that is 18,000 dead. I hope they understand about that.‚Äù The Jakarta administrative court is reviewing Atlaoui‚Äôs challenge against the president‚Äôs refusal of clemency. ‚ÄúAs our presiding judge is in training, the court hearing could not take place and we postponed to next week,‚Äù Judge Indaryadi said in a court session on Tuesday. The hearing has been rescheduled for 3 June and a verdict is expected soon after. The attorney general‚Äôs office has said Atlaoui‚Äôs current legal challenge would be his last appeal. Atlaoui was sentenced to death for his involvement in an ecstasy factory in Jakarta that was capable of producing 100kg (220lb) of the illegal pills every week. He has always protested his innocence, saying he believed he was carrying out work installing industrial machines in an empty factory building. If Atlaoui were to be shot by Indonesian firing squad, he would be the first French person to be executed in 38 years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-27T05:00:28Z,world,World news,"Hamas executed  23 Palestinians under cover of Gaza conflict, says Amnesty","Hamas has been accused of using the cover of last summer‚Äôs war in Gaza to carry out summary executions, including to ‚Äúsettle scores‚Äù against opponents under the pretext they were ‚Äúcollaborators with Israel‚Äù. The claims that Hamas committed rights abuses amounting to war crimes are made in a damning report by Amnesty International highlighting abuses committed by Hamas during last summer‚Äôs 50-day war. It includes accusations that Hamas carried out the summary execution of at least 23 Palestinians and the arrest and torture of dozens of others, including members and supporters of Hamas‚Äôs political rivals, Fatah.
Although Hamas described many of the summary executions as retribution against collaborators, according to Amnesty‚Äôs research some 16 were already in prison either serving sentences or in the midst of ongoing legal processes at the time the conflict broke out. The group‚Äôs Middle East and North Africa director, Philip Luther, said: ‚ÄúIt is absolutely appalling that, while Israeli forces were inflicting massive death and destruction upon the people in Gaza, Hamas forces took the opportunity to ruthlessly settle scores, carrying out a series of unlawful killings and other grave abuses. ‚ÄúIn the chaos of the conflict, the de facto Hamas administration granted its security forces free rein to carry out horrific abuses, including against people in its custody. These spine-chilling actions, some of which amount to war crimes, were designed to exact revenge and spread fear across the Gaza Strip.‚Äù Barred by Israel from entering Gaza to carry out its research, Amnesty says it relied on a local field worker to conduct its interviews. Hamas has long been accused of pursuing and committing human rights abuses against its Fatah rivals, dating back to 2007 when the Islamist group asserted its authority over the coastal strip. For its part, security forces on the West Bank where Fatah is dominant, regularly arrest Hamas members or those supporting the group ‚Äì most recently four students. Although some of those executed had cases going through the courts for collaboration or were appealing against death sentences, the group claims that Hamas used the excuse of the conflict to carry out the killings without due process. In one of the most horrific and well publicised incidents during last summer‚Äôs war, six men were publicly executed by Hamas outside the al-Omari mosque on 22 August in front of hundreds of spectators, including children. At the time, the killings were condemned by human rights groups. One Cairo-based Hamas official, Moussa Abu Marzouk, admitted in an interview with Al Jazeera that not all legal recourses had been adhered to. Commenting on the Amnesty report, Salah Al-Bardaweel, Hamas‚Äô official spokesman, called it ‚Äúunjust and unfair‚Äù, adding that ‚Äúits release in this way reveals the truth about the work of this organisation, which includes in its administration Israeli employees‚Äù. Among those identified as killed during the spate of executions, according to Amnesty, was Atta Najjar ‚Äì described as a former police officer under the Palestinian Authority who had already been tried and sentenced on accusations of collaboration in 2009. Despite his conviction, and the fact he was already serving a 15-year jail sentence, Najjar was among those executed on 22 August. One of Najjar‚Äôs brothers told Amnesty: ‚ÄúThere were marks of torture and bullet shots on his body. His arms and legs were broken ‚Ä¶ his body was as if you‚Äôd put it in a bag and smashed it ... His body was riddled with about 30 bullets.‚Äù According to the report, eight other detainees were still on trial charged with ‚Äúcollaboration‚Äù with Israel at the time of their executions. Six others had been awaiting the outcome of appeals against death sentences from a military court in Gaza on the same charges, while two others had been convicted and were serving prison terms when they were executed. Many had been sentenced after trials before courts whose proceedings are grossly unfair. A number had said they had been tortured in order to extract ‚Äúconfessions‚Äù. Another of those killed on 22 August 2014 was Ibrahim Dabour, an insurance company employee who had been awaiting trial before a military court on a charge of ‚Äúcommunicating with hostile sides‚Äù when he was taken out and shot.
‚ÄúWe were told about the execution by people around us at 1pm,‚Äù his brother told Amnesty. ‚ÄúThere was no official notification. He was executed at 9.30am on Friday. My brother received a text message at 10.31pm that night saying: ‚ÄòThe judgment against Ibrahim Dabour has been carried out according to [sharia law] as per the ruling of the Revolutionary Court.‚Äô Even if he had been sentenced to death, there would have been an appeals process and other alternatives. What they have done is nothing to do with justice, it‚Äôs just criminal. These are the actions of militias.‚Äù As well as the unlawful killings, others abducted by Hamas were subjected to torture, including severe beatings with truncheons, gun butts, hoses and wire, or held in stress positions. Some were interrogated and tortured or otherwise ill-treated in a disused outpatients‚Äô clinic within the grounds of Gaza City‚Äôs main al-Shifa hospital. At least three people arrested during the conflict and accused of collaboration died in custody.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-27T04:00:27Z,world,World news,Rouhani clashes with Iranian clergy over women arrested for 'bad hijab',"President Hassan Rouhani, who came to office in 2013 partly on the votes of young, middle-class women, knows that in the summer, hundreds or even thousands will be arrested by the morality police for ‚Äúbad hijab‚Äù, a slack interpretation of the official dress code requiring women to cover their hair and figure even as temperatures push 40 degrees. In his remark last year that ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt send people to heaven by the whip‚Äù, the president expressed a belief that citizens should not be forced into ‚Äúgood‚Äù behaviour, and in two recent speeches he skirted the issue of hijab, provoking a critical response from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, and from senior members of the clergy. In late April, the president told an assembly of Iranian police officers the duty of the police was solely to enforce the law. ‚ÄúThe police‚Äôs job is not to enforce Islam, and furthermore, none among them can claim that their actions are sanctioned by God or the prophet [Mohammad].‚Äù Although Rouhani stopped short of mentioning the harassment of women with bad hijab, he made a break from the period of his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad when then police commander Morteza Ahmadi Moghaddam stressed that the ‚Äúphilosophy at the heart of the Islamic republic was the presence of religion in society‚Äù and so ‚Äúthe police must act to ensure that this goal is met‚Äù. Rouhani‚Äôs offered a different vision: ‚ÄúMany religious issues are merely matters of individual faith,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPolice come into the picture only when an actual law‚Ä¶clearly and explicitly applies. For example, during mid-day prayers, could the police enter a bank and tell the employees that they must halt all business to pray?‚Äù
Rouhani‚Äôs comments made a splash the next day on the front pages of many reformist papers, including Shargh, Etemad, Mardom Salari and Arman. But it wasn‚Äôt long before he received a response. Khamenei appeared just a day later before an assembly of police commanders, making it clear that enforcing Islam was the police‚Äôs first priority: ‚ÄúAll work can be done in the name of God, but in your work it is most easy to see how God‚Äôs will can be done. That is because your duty is to serve the society of the Islamic republic.‚Äù A member of the editorial board at Etemad told Tehran Bureau the leader had several motives in replying to Rouhani. ‚ÄúFirstly, he wanted to demonstrate his dominance over domestic affairs. Secondly, he wanted to show that in his view, Islam supersedes the law. And finally, he wanted to offer a kind of rebuke to Rouhani for getting out of line.‚Äù One analyst saw a connection with April‚Äôs interim nuclear agreement with world powers at Lausanne. ‚ÄúThis disappointed many of Khamenei‚Äôs most ardent supporters, and they imagined that his leniency toward the west might translate to leniency in the domestic arena, which would allow Rouhani to take up reform with little resistance,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúKhamenei‚Äôs immediate response is part of his efforts to assuage his anxious supporters and remind them that flexibility toward the western powers doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean moderation in domestic policies.‚Äù
But Khamenei‚Äôs intervention also opened the door for others to enter the fray. Ayatollah Makarem Shirazi, a senior Shia cleric, told another group of police commanders that Rouhani‚Äôs remarks not only weakened ‚Äúthe morale of the police‚Äù but gave ‚Äúthe green light for corrupt elements to introduce all manner of filth into society without any repercussion or response from the police‚Äù. Ayatollah Nouri Hamedani pointed out that Iran‚Äôs constitution came ‚Äústraight from Islamic criteria‚Äù and that the idea the police should not enforce Islam precluded the concept of ‚Äúenjoining the good and forbidding the evil‚Äù in society, a notion found in the Qur‚Äôan. Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, chairman of the Assembly of Experts, the clerical body that chooses the supreme leader, threatened the president with serious consequences: ‚ÄúThe executive branch cannot deny Islam; it must uphold it. If it denies Islam, Islam will deny it in turn.‚Äù Mohsen Kadivar, visiting professor in Islamic philosophy at Duke university, North Carolina, and an influential reformist thinker of the 1990s and 2000s, said that Rouhani had expressed basic principles that were fundamental to all modern states. ‚ÄúManaging the nation on the basis of law is the cornerstone of the contemporary nation-state system, so to negate that in any way is to invite chaos,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe announcement by the supreme leader and a few other marjas [leading clerics] that the police and everyone else should uphold Islam is a denial of the fundamentals of law, an agent of disorder, and a rejection of the rule of law.‚Äù Kadivar said the arguments of those criticising Rouhani were incompatible with the ‚Äúmultiple interpretation‚Äù of sacred texts in all religions. ‚ÄúFor example, different jurists and muftis will put forth various, sometimes conflicting fatwas. On which fatwa should the police or any other agents of the state rely when enforcing Islam?‚Äù
Neither did the problems end there. ‚ÄúIf judges and police forego the law and act on fatwas, we will find ourselves back to the days of 100 years ago, when Iranians went to the streets to demand a constitution. According to the constitution of the Islamic republic, the law is decided upon solely by the parliament. The Guardian Council [a constitutional watchdog], whose members are [partly] selected by the supreme leader, is tasked with making sure laws passed in parliament conform to the decrees of Islam. Therefore, laws in the Islamic republic are passed under the supervision of appointees of the supreme leader, so there is no conflict with the supposed need to uphold Islam.‚Äù Despite all criticism he faced, Rouhani returned to the issue of bad hijab and law enforcement in a speech on 4 May before a group of teachers, in which he said that ‚ÄúColt- and handcuff-toting agents of the regime‚Äù should not be expected to ‚Äúact as religious scholars.‚Äù
In the Tandis luxury shopping centre, north Tehran, a young woman named Maryam told Tehran Bureau that Rouhani‚Äôs campaign was important to her. ‚ÄúSir, madam, what right do you have to say whether my hijab is proper or improper?? Can you show me the hijab-o-meter they issued you when you took this job? Where in the Islamic texts does it say that in 21st century Tajrish [quarter of north Tehran] there‚Äôs a girl with bad hijab whose offences to Islam must be stopped?
‚ÄúRouhani must do the right thing and stand by his word. He has to stick up for our rights and not allow these brutes with guns and badges to insult us and have their way with us. Most of them haven‚Äôt even finished tenth grade? Where do they come off insulting and arresting someone with a master‚Äôs degree in front of everyone?‚Äù At this month‚Äôs recent Tehran International Book Fair, vans of morality police flanked the entrance to the book fair as had been promised by police spokesman Montazer Almahdi at a press conference. ‚ÄúEssentially the morality patrols are for protecting the dignity of men and women and act as a kind of hijab for the society of the Islamic Republic,‚Äù he insisted. Mahtab, a woman at the fair in conservative attire, said the situation was ridiculous. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a religious person myself - I prefer to wear the hijab - but who said you have to force everyone else to wear it? Some people don‚Äôt want to wear it. What does it have to do with you? Why don‚Äôt they respect the law? Who said it‚Äôs their duty to force everyone into heaven?‚Äù The conflict over whether or not people should be dragged into heaven is set to continue. ‚ÄúRouhani is testing the limits of his power to forbid the police from visiting violence upon our people,‚Äù a member of the banned reformist party Participation Front told Tehran Bureau. ‚ÄúRestricting morality patrols is the beginning of Rouhani‚Äôs project for gradually extracting Islamic ideology from the practice of law. Just what he is willing to sacrifice for this project remains to be seen.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-27T01:37:35Z,world,World news,Former Sri Lanka army chief says he would welcome war crime investigation,"Sri Lanka‚Äôs wartime army chief says his conscience is clear and he would welcome a war crimes investigation to prove his innocence. ‚ÄúThe allegations are there,‚Äù Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said in an interview with the Guardian. ‚ÄúWe have to clear our name.‚Äù In May 2009 the then General Fonseka was the head of the Sri Lankan army that defeated the Tamil Tigers, or Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, ending Sri Lanka‚Äôs brutal 26-year civil war. Nearly two years later, a UN secretary general‚Äôs panel of experts reported that both government forces and the Tamil Tigers had potentially committed serious human rights violations in the final stages of the war. Shocking footage of the war‚Äôs end emerged shortly after, suggesting widespread crimes had been committed by forces under Fonseka‚Äôs command. While accepting that some crimes occurred during the war, Fonseka insists that these were acts of individual offenders, and not systematic. ‚ÄúThe army as a whole, I can give the assurance that we never committed war crimes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere were no rapes, no torture during my command during the war. I know there have been a couple of allegations. But there should not be reason to try to declare war against the media or against the international community. We can clarify it.‚Äù To his supporters, Fonseka is a war hero. But to others he is a war criminal. He insists he has a clean conscience. ‚ÄúMy intentions are clear. I did everything in good faith. My job was to save the territorial integrity and the sovereignty of the country. I have done it. I did it as per the rules.‚Äù In 2010 Fonseka unsuccessfully contested presidential elections against his former boss, Mahinda Rajapaksa. Speaking to the Guardian in Sri Lanka‚Äôs capital, Colombo, Fonseka claimed the former president and his family had acted like dictators after their 2010 victory. ‚ÄúRajapaksa‚Äôs conduct was not acceptable to this country, especially after we finished the war,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe and his brother ‚Äì secretary of defence ‚Äì his whole family, his children, his wife, everybody was trying to behave like a king here; they were behaving like dictators.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I left him. I wanted to be away. Then he started harassing us. He thought that he could intimidate us, terrorise us and keep us silent.‚Äù In 2010 Rajapaksa stripped Fonseka of his military rank and decorations. The following year Fonseka was jailed for suggesting that the president‚Äôs brother, the defence secretary, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, had ordered Tamil Tiger leaders to be killed as they surrendered. The Rajapaksas have denied any wrongdoing during the conflict. In January 2015 Rajapaksa, who had won two consecutive terms as president, suffered a surprise defeat at the ballot box at the hand of a broad coalition of civil society and political powerbrokers. The winning candidate, Maithripala Sirisena, had been Rajapaksa‚Äôs health minister and the secretary general of his party, the Sri Lanka Freedom party. The main opposition party, the United National party, as well as former president Chandrika Kumaratunga (herself a Sri Lanka Freedom party member), influential Buddhist monks, and the leadership of the Tamil and Muslim minorities supported Sirisena‚Äôs candidacy. Votes from the island nation‚Äôs religious and ethnic minority groups were key to his victory. The new president vowed to implement widespread reforms within 100 days of his election, including transferring powers away from the president to the parliament. But he has had difficulty delivering his pledges. The UN human rights council delayed the release of its report on humanitarian crimes during the civil war to give more time to the new administration. There have long been calls for Sri Lanka to allow a full international investigation, but Sirisena promised only a domestic inquiry into wartime human rights violations. Last week the government announced the inquiry would begin in June. While observers say there have been some positive developments in public accountability, including a reform package passed last month by the Sri Lankan parliament, concerns about human rights remain. Sirisena‚Äôs appointment as army chief of Major General Jagath Dias, who led an army division linked to war crimes in the final months of the war, is worrying, according to Human Rights Watch. The new government, the result of a fragile cross-party political compromise, is negotiating a delicate path, seeking to fulfil the aspirations of the minorities whose support helped bring it to power while also retaining support among the majority Sinhalese community. Despite his electoral defeat, the arrest of one of his brothers, and ongoing corruption investigations into another, Rajapaksa remains a political force in the south where he is positioning to run for prime minister on a wave of Sinhalese nationalism in forthcoming parliamentary elections. Fonseka, who was exonerated by Sirisena and promoted to Field Marshal, said he no longer harboured ambitions to be president or prime minister. ‚ÄúI am ready to say goodbye to politics at any time. My ambition is not to become president or become prime minister, but to ensure that the country is taken on the right path.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-26T20:57:18Z,world,World news,Vatican says Ireland gay marriage vote is 'defeat for humanity',"A senior Vatican official has attacked the legalisation of gay marriage in Ireland. The referendum that overwhelmingly backed marriage equality last weekend was a ‚Äúdefeat for humanity‚Äù, he claimed. ‚ÄúI was deeply saddened by the result,‚Äù Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican‚Äôs secretary of state, said at a conference in Rome on Tuesday night. ‚ÄúThe church must take account of this reality, but in the sense that it must strengthen its commitment to evangelisation. I think that you cannot just talk of a defeat for Christian principles, but of a defeat for humanity.‚Äù
The remarks by the Vatican‚Äôs top diplomat, who is seen as second only to the pope in the church‚Äôs hierarchy, represent the most damning assessment of the Irish vote by a senior church official to date. It was a far more critical response than the circumspect reaction offered by archbishop Diarmuid Martin of Dublin, who said: ‚ÄúIt is very clear that if this referendum is an affirmation of the views of young people ‚Ä¶ [then the church needs] a reality check.‚Äù Ireland became the first country to legalise gay marriage by popular vote after a referendum found that 62% of voters were in favour of changing the constitution to allow gay and lesbian couples to marry. While the results were celebrated by advocates of gay rights in Ireland and around the world, it was also seen as a stark symbol of how wide the chasm has grown between young people in what has traditionally been a staunchly Catholic country and the church itself, which says that homosexual acts are a sin and vehemently opposes gay marriage. Parolin‚Äôs comments are sure to revive the debate about the church‚Äôs attitude to gay rights and equality under the papacy of Pope Francis, who once famously said ‚Äúwho am I to judge?‚Äù when asked about the existence of a ‚Äúgay lobby‚Äù within the Vatican. That remark spurred hope among progressive Catholics that the church was entering a new era of tolerance and acceptance of homosexuality. For some, that hope has been dashed by an ongoing controversy involving a French diplomat and practising Catholic named Laurent Stefanini, who is gay. The Vatican has refused to accept Stefanini‚Äôs nomination as France‚Äôs ambassador to the Holy See because of his sexual orientation, according to media reports in France and Italy. The Vatican has declined to comment on the matter, but there has been speculation in recent weeks that the pope could make an abrupt change and accept the nomination, after all. The Vatican recently told the Guardian that any news on the appointment would be made available on the Vatican‚Äôs bulletin, where such appointments are usually publicised. On Tuesday night, Parolin said the dialogue between the Vatican and France was continuing in regard to the controversial nomination, and that he hoped it would come to a conclusion in a ‚Äúpositive manner‚Äù. Parolin‚Äôs remarks on the Irish vote are significant given the broader role Parolin plays in crafting the church‚Äôs message on major diplomatic and social issues. At the time of his appointment in 2013, veteran Vatican reporter John Allen wrote in the National Catholic Reporter that Parolin had been ‚Äúon the frontlines of shaping the Vatican‚Äôs response to virtually every geopolitical challenge of the past two decades‚Äù. Among other issues, the Italian cardinal has been an outspoken advocate for action to combat global warming. In recent remarks, he denounced the ‚Äúglobalisation of indifference and the economy of exclusion‚Äù that has put the planet in peril. He has also been the public face of Francis‚Äôs diplomatic efforts, including the church‚Äôs role in helping Cuba and the US restore diplomatic ties. But on Tuesday, with his choice of words, Parolin differed from the pope in one respect: the Argentinian pontiff has also used the phrase ‚Äúdefeat for humanity‚Äù, but he was talking about war, not the legalisation of gay marriage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-26T19:11:51Z,world,World news,Mafia boss Pasquale Scotti arrested in Brazil after 31 years on the run,"After 31 years on the run, one of Italy‚Äôs most feared mafiosos has been arrested on a quiet street in north-eastern Brazil.
Pasquale Scotti, a leader of the Camorra syndicate who is wanted for more than two dozen murders, was detained by police while taking his children to school in Recife. Police believe his Brazilian family were unaware of his identity, which was exposed by Interpol through fingerprint examination. He had been living under the false name Francisco de Castro Visconti. Reinventing himself as a businessman, he had local identity papers, registered as a voter and partly owned a nightclub and food import business. Photographs of the 56-year-old suspect in handcuffs show a man very different from the figure seen on Italian wanted posters. The gangster in his twenties with thick hair and dark bushy brows is now a balding middle-aged man with a beard, glasses and a slight paunch. Scotti is said to have arrived in Brazil in 1986, a couple years after being placed on Italy‚Äôs most wanted list. The following year he moved to Recife, a city of 1.5 million people on the north-east coast that is far less in the international spotlight than S√£o Paulo or Rio de Janeiro. In 1995, he married a Brazilian woman with whom he has two children. They live in the city‚Äôs Sancho district. ‚ÄúHe told us in a statement that his family was not aware of anything,‚Äù said Giovani Santoro, the communications officer of the Pernambuco federal police force. The arrest by four officers was carried out with the minimum of fuss. ‚ÄúHe was approached in the morning when he left home and the arrest was communicated. The officers allowed him to take his kids to school first, followed him, and then arrested him. There was no resistance, it was very discreet,‚Äù he said. Police said he had no reason to believe the detainee was involved in criminal activity in Brazil. ‚ÄúHe has a clean slate here,‚Äù a spokesman said. But Italian law enforcement officials will now begin extradition proceedings against a man who has been one of their country‚Äôs most wanted since 1984. The alleged crime boss is accused of extortion, firearm offences and murder. In January 2005, he received a life sentence in abstentia for 26 killings. He is believed to be very close to Raffaele Cutolo, the head of the Nuova Camorra Organizzata ‚Äì the ‚Äúnew‚Äù Camorra ‚Äì who is serving multiple life sentences for murder, according to Federico Varese, a mafia expert and criminologist at Oxford University.
Scotti was involved with Cutolo in the 1980s, Varese says, but after being nabbed by Italian authorities he escaped a local Neapolitan hospital, where a relative allegedly worked. Scotti has been the subject of intense speculation, with rumours circulating for years that he was either dead or working for the ‚ÄòNdrangheta mafia, which is based in Calabria. Roberto Saviano, the journalist who exposed the Camorra‚Äôs crimes in his bestselling book, Gomorrah: Italy‚Äôs Other Mafia, and who has faced numerous death threats, told the Guardian in an email: ‚ÄúI know well the story of Scotti. We all grew up with the myth of Pasquale Scotti!‚Äù Renato Natale, the anti-mafia mayor of Casal di Principe, which was once considered prime Camorra territory, told the Guardian: ‚ÄúI thought he had completely disappeared from circulation, so this news surprised me ‚Äì pleasantly. Justice runs its course and in the end they catch you‚Äù ‚ÄúIn the early 1980s [Scotti] was a big fish, but after that, when he became a fugitive, no one heard of him anymore,‚Äù added Natale. Scotti may have gone to Brazil because it was a country that was notoriously reluctant to approve extradition requests from Europe. In the 1980s, the UK train robber Ronnie Biggs lived openly in Rio de Janeiro despite being wanted by British police. However, procedures have subsequently been eased so it is likely Scotti will be returned to Italy to face justice.

2015-05-26T19:04:14Z,world,World news,"Islamist fighters drawn from half the world's countries, says UN","More than half the countries in the world are currently generating Islamist extremist fighters for groups such as al-Qaida and Islamic State, the UN has said. A report by the UN security council says there are more than 25,000 ‚Äúforeign terrorist fighters‚Äù currently involved in jihadi conflicts and they are ‚Äútravelling from more than 100 member states‚Äù. The number of fighters may have increased by more than 70% worldwide in the past nine months or so, the report says, adding that they ‚Äúpose an ‚Äúimmediate and long-term [terrorist] threat‚Äù. The sudden rise, though possibly explained by better data, will raise concern about the apparently growing appeal of extremism. The geographic spread of states touched by the phenomenon has expanded, too. The report notes continuing problems with understanding the processes of radicalisation, but says, despite a concentration on the internet, social networks in conflict zones and western cities play a key role. ‚ÄúThose who eat together and bond together can bomb together,‚Äù the report says. The report is the first from the UN to take a global view of the problem of ‚Äúforeign terrorist fighters‚Äù, and includes those in Afghanistan, Africa and other theatres as well as Syria and Iraq. Officials described the estimate of numbers as conservative and said the true total may be more than 30,000. ‚ÄúThe rate of flow is higher than ever and mainly focused on movement into the Syrian Arab Republic and Iraq, with a growing problem also evident in Libya,‚Äù the report says. The security council is meeting on Friday to discuss the problem of foreign terrorist fighters and potential measures to combat the threat. The report comes amid a fierce debate over western strategies to counter Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.
In recent days, Isis has made significant advances in both countries despite months of air strikes, leading to criticism of the US president, Barack Obama, and decision-makers in the region. The US senator John McCain attacked the president on Sunday for citing climate change as a threat to national security, suggesting that the Obama administration‚Äôs focus on environmental issues was detracting from the fight against Isis. Last week, the militant group seized the city of Ramadi, the capital of the predominantly Sunni Anbar province, its greatest victory in Iraq since its conquest of Mosul last summer and its declaration of a caliphate spanning swaths of Iraq and Syria. The group also took control of the historic Syrian city of Palmyra and strategic gas fields nearby after a week-long siege that routed forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. The victory has triggered a humanitarian crisis, due to the flight of thousands of residents. A series of public statements by senior officials in Washington and the Middle East have highlighted disagreements between the US, Iraq and Iran. Earlier this year, General James Clapper, the director of US national intelligence, told Congress that officials now believed that 3,400 citizens from western nations, including 150 from the US, had travelled to Iraq and Syria to join violent militant groups. More than 700 British extremists are thought to have travelled to Syria ‚Äì with about half returning to the UK. The new report describes Iraq, Syria and Libya as a ‚Äúveritable finishing school‚Äù for terrorists and mentions Tunisia, Morocco, France and the Russian federation as particularly vulnerable to future attacks due to the number of fighters from there. ‚ÄúThose that have returned or will return to their states of origin or to third countries may pose a continuing threat to national and international security,‚Äù the report said. ‚ÄúMany may reintegrate, abandoning violence. Some have already gone on to organise further terrorist attacks and others will do so in the future.‚Äù In May 2014, a French veteran of the conflict in Syria launched an attack on a Jewish museum in Belgium. The killer of four people in a Jewish supermarket in Paris in January claimed to be from Islamic State though he was not a veteran of the conflict there. His wife had fled to Syria days before the attack. Isis has repeatedly called on Muslims living in the west to mount ‚Äúfreelance‚Äù or ‚Äúlone wolf‚Äù operations. Alexander Evans, lead UN expert on al-Qaida and Isis, said there was a danger that the international community was becoming too focused on Syria, Iraq and Libya. ‚ÄúThe risk of people going and people returning is wider,‚Äù Evans said. Afghan security forces estimated in March 2015 that about 6,500 foreign terrorist fighters were active in Afghanistan, the report notes. Most were from groups based in neighbouring Pakistan, though 200 were with the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and 150 with the Eastern Turkestan Islamic Movement which operates in south-west China. There are fears of an upsurge in violence in Afghanistan as the US reduces its presence in the unstable state. Volunteers have travelled to conflict zones where Islamic militants are active from countries including Chile, Finland and the Maldives. ‚ÄúWe have spent a lot of time worrying about the countries which have generated hundreds or even thousands of fighters but [there are] countries which may have never faced a terrorist threat of this nature and which have law enforcement and security authorities which are grappling with what is a new problem for them,‚Äù Evans said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-26T18:28:22Z,world,World news,South China Sea tensions escalate as China unveils plans for lighthouses,"China unveiled a military strategy on Tuesday to project naval power further from its own shores and announced plans for two lighthouses on reefs in the South China Sea, moves likely to increase tensions with Washington and regional powers over the disputed waters. A white paper issued by China‚Äôs state council, or cabinet, said the navy will shift from a policy of defending offshore waters to a combined goal of ‚Äúoffshore waters defence and open seas protection‚Äù.
Several regional powers including the Philippines and Vietnam have overlapping claims in the South China Sea, one of the world‚Äôs busiest shipping routes. The high seas were one of four ‚Äúcritical security domains‚Äù highlighted in the paper, the others being outer space, cyberspace and nuclear force, although the white paper underlined that China wants to avoid a nuclear arms race or the weaponisation of space. In the more immediate naval sphere, however, Beijing appears more assertive. The paper also warned distant powers against ‚Äúprovocative‚Äù actions and interference in South China Sea affairs, an apparent reference to Washington‚Äôs very publicly-aired concerns about a large-scale Chinese land reclamation project around mostly uninhabited reefs and atolls in the disputed waters. The Chinese works are turning submerged reefs into airstrips, and creating thousands of hectares of dry land on artificial islands, with the pace of construction speeding up in recent months.
One of the biggest US concerns is land reclamation on reef formations that would not otherwise allow China to claim territorial waters because they are submerged at high tide and not capable of supporting independent life. Xinhua on Tuesday published pictures of lighthouse construction on two coral reefs, Chigua and Huayang, showing a groundbreaking ceremony that was perhaps more likely to involve ground creation. ‚ÄúThe ministry of transport plans to construct two multi-functional lighthouses, which will provide efficient navigation service to the passing vessels and immensely improve the navigation safety in the South China Sea,‚Äù Xinhua said in a report. Plans to ramp up the US military presence in the area would probably involve flying over and sailing close to artificial islands that were only reefs before the latest building project, and China last week issued multiple warnings to a US plane flying above Fiery Cross reef, where China has built an early-warning radar station and airstrip. Defence ministry spokesman Yang Yujun said that the country‚Äôs reclamation activities were comparable with development of homes, roads and other infrastructure on the mainland.
‚ÄúFrom the perspective of sovereignty, there is absolutely no difference,‚Äù Yan told a news conference to launch the new military white paper. Some countries with ‚Äúulterior motives‚Äù had unfairly characterized China‚Äôs military presence and sensationalised the issue, Reuters reported. The dispute has pushed together regional powers who a few years ago might have been as wary of neighbours with claims on the islands as they were of Beijing. The Philippines have backed the US, and President Benigno Aquinosaid this week that they will continue to fly over the disputed areas despite Chinese warnings. ‚ÄúWe will still fly the routes that we fly based on the international law from the various conventions we entered into,‚Äù the AFP news agency quoted him saying. The country‚Äôs defence minister also said he would ask for more defence equipment from Tokyo, the same day that Japan also agreed to bolster security and maritime safety ties with Malaysia and start talks on transfers of defence equipment and technology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-26T18:21:09Z,world,World news,Jacob Zuma: Marikana mine massacre report to be released by end of June,"An official investigation into the Marikana mine massacre will be released by the end of next month, South Africa‚Äôs president, Jacob Zuma, has announced. The shootings by police in August 2012 left 34 mineworkers dead and more than 78 injured on what has been described as South Africa‚Äôs darkest day since the end of apartheid. Zuma immediately announced a judicial commission of inquiry which sat for 293 days and heard evidence including claims police planted weapons on some of the dead bodies to fit a false narrative. The commission submitted its report to Zuma at the end of March and pressure for it to be made public has grown ever since. Zuma told parliament on Tuesday: ‚ÄúI know and appreciate the anxiety of those who are affected. However, it would be inappropriate for me to just release the report without applying my mind sufficiently. The report will be released before the end of next month.‚Äù Members of the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters staged a silent protest in parliament by holding up pieces of paper that said ‚ÄúRelease Marikana report‚Äù in bold red type.
Zuma‚Äôs governing African National Congress welcomed the announcement. It said: ‚ÄúThe ANC in parliament appreciates and shares the anxiety of the families and others affected by the tragic events at Marikana regarding the public release of the report. However, it would be inappropriate and a dereliction of duty on the part of the president to unduly act hastily in his consideration of the report. ‚ÄúWe believe that the work that the commission conducted during the course of almost three years, which culminated in this report, was thorough, careful and meticulous. It is therefore important that the president does not unnecessarily rush in his engagement with it, but considers it comprehensively and carefully to ensure appropriate measures are taken to ensure that the tragic events at Marikana do not recur.‚Äù Despite Zuma‚Äôs pledge, a lawyer representing the injured and arrested victims of the police crackdown said some of them want to press ahead with a planned court action in a bid to force his hand. Andries Nkome, who is also representing the Association of Mineworkers and Construction union, said: ‚ÄúOur clients are taking credit that they were able to get the president to commit to release the report but he is still treating them with contempt, having ignored their request for a commitment by 2pm on Sunday and waiting to address parliament instead.‚Äù His clients remain concerned that they will not have time to prepare for civil claims due to the expiry on 16 August of the three-year period in which they can be lodged. He said: ‚ÄúSome are saying we ought to proceed with the case ... some are saying we must push through and get a date.‚Äù Earlier, Nkome told South Africa‚Äôs Star newspaper his clients were also concerned by reports that lieutenant-general Zukiswa Mbombo, the North West province police commissioner, intends to retire at the end of the month. He said Mbombo was among those his clients held directly responsible ‚Äúfor their physical and emotional scars‚Äù. He added: ‚ÄúOur clients are of the firm view that her imminent departure is largely motivated, in whole or in part, by a deliberate desire to escape the obvious consequences of her criminal and or otherwise unlawful conduct in connection with the Marikana massacre ‚Ä¶ the failure to release the report is also calculated to let her off the hook.‚Äù Sabata Mokgwabone, a spokesman for North West police, rejected the claims. He said: ‚ÄúThe retirement of Zukiswa Mbombo has got nothing at all to do with the Marikana commission. She‚Äôs reached 60 years and is going on retirement.‚Äù He said he could not comment on the allegation that her conduct was criminal or unlawful and added: ‚ÄúWe will wait for the Marikana report to be released.‚Äù
During her testimony, Mbombo conceded that police intervention at the mine in 2012 was a failure. She said there were mistakes in the police communication systems used on the day of the shooting. Nkome said his clients noted that the national police commissioner, Riah Phiyega, had been offered a different posting by Zuma. He said: ‚ÄúThe feeling that my clients have [is that they] will not be able to hold them accountable because they will not be holding that office any more.‚Äù However, Zuma‚Äôs office has rejected Nkome‚Äôs statements about Mbombo and Phiyega as ‚Äúfalse‚Äù. Spokesperson Harold Maloka said: ‚ÄúThe president does not manage the careers of provincial police commissioners and as such has nothing to do with the reported retirement. Linking the president to this matter and insinuating that it could be linked to the processing of the Marikana report by the president is malicious and mischievous.‚ÄúMr Nkome also repeated the already refuted allegations that President Jacob Zuma has met the national police commissioner, Riah Phiyega, and discussed an alternative deployment for her. Reports of the said meeting and alleged discussions are a complete fabrication and have been refuted by the presidency. Anyone who repeats these allegations is perpetuating a lie.‚Äù Among the questions raised by Marikana was the role of Zuma‚Äôs deputy, Cyril Ramaphosa, a director and shareholder of the mine owner Lonmin at the time, and whether he encouraged the police to go on the offensive. The Marikana Support campaign, Right2Know campaign and the SA History Archive have also stepped up pressure for the immediate release of judge Ian Farlam‚Äôs report. They submitted a request under the Promotion of Access to Information Act, which gives the presidency 30 days to respond. The groups said: ‚ÄúIt has been more than two and a half years since the Marikana massacre on 16 August 2012, and there have been no arrests made for the murder of the 34 miners who were killed while striking ‚Ä¶ the commission report and findings are crucial to determining the truth about what happened at Marikana, to hold those responsible for the massacre to account and ensure justice is served.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-26T18:04:03Z,world,World news,Qatar emir's mother speaks out over treatment of Muslims by the west,"Muslims face dehumanisation when western countries apply double standards, the wife of the former emir of Qatar has warned in an unusual and critical public intervention from a senior royal in a wealthy Gulf state. Sheikha Moza bint Nasser al-Missned, one of the most influential and high-profile women in the Arab world, also questioned distinctions between ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù or ‚Äúliberal‚Äù and ‚Äúconservative‚Äù Muslims and insisted that it was wrong to say that Islam was ‚Äústuck in medieval times‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhy is it that world leaders gathered to march in defence of Charlie Hebdo, while the Chapel Hill murders were shrugged off as a parking dispute?‚Äù she asked, in a reference to the killing of three Muslim students in North Carolina in February. She was speaking at St Antony‚Äôs College, Oxford, on Tuesday. ‚ÄúAt the same time we are confronted with double standards. Why is it that apologies are offered when Europeans are mistakenly killed by drones but only silence follows when innocent Yemeni and Pakistani children and civilians are killed by the same drones? Why do Muslim lives seem to matter less than the lives of others? If they matter at all. I believe this dehumanisation is cultivated through a process of Muslim-phobia.‚Äù Moza is the second of the three wives of the former emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the mother of the current emir, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad, and the head of the Qatar Foundation. Alongside a genuine interest in Islamic civilisation, there existed a fear of real, living Muslims, Moza said: ‚ÄúFor example, a Muslim is first and foremost identified as a Muslim, rather than simply a human being. Whether they are Pakistani, Malaysian, Senegalese, or even British-born, their multiple identities are levelled under a constructed monolith of Islam. ‚ÄúLet me remind you, however, that Islam has never been monolithical, but has from the start been a vast container for diverse cultures and ethnicities. The homogenisation of Muslims into a fearful and unknowable ‚Äòother‚Äô, separate from the beauty and nobility of Islam and its civilisation, is at the root of Muslim-phobia.‚Äù Islam had been used from all sides, she said. ‚ÄúThe radical militants put forth a version of Islam devoid of its spiritual content and subtlety of interpretation, nothing more than a violent political slogan,‚Äù she said. But neo-orientalists and libertarians ‚Äúdefame Islam, and the prophet, in particular‚Äù. It was wrong to use the word ‚Äúmedieval‚Äù to describe the actions of radicals, she said. ‚ÄúBut why do we insinuate that somehow those who are perpetuating certain acts of violence do not belong to our age? That somehow they are not modern? It is a na√Øve refusal to accept our collective responsibility. Isis is as modern as Guant√°namo and Abu Ghraib. They are all products of our age.‚Äù And she issued a stark warning about how ‚Äúactivism can quickly change to militancy‚Äù in the wake of failure to replace autocratic leaders in the Arab spring ‚Äì an object of the Gulf state‚Äôs policy of supporting Islamist groups during her husband‚Äôs reign. ‚ÄúDebate is needed,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúViolent repression is not.‚Äù Qatar, the world‚Äôs wealthiest country in per capita terms, has huge investments in Britain. It has also endowed two chairs at Oxford University: the chair of contemporary Islamic studies and the chair of Islamic art.

2015-05-26T17:56:33Z,world,World news,France: judges clear way for Sarkozy to rename UMP party Les R√©publicains,"Judges in Paris have cleared the way for Nicolas Sarkozy to rename his rightwing UMP party Les R√©publicains (the Republicans) as he prepares a bid to win back the French presidency in 2017.
The choice of name had sparked furious criticism from the French left which accused Sarkozy of staging a hostile takeover of national heritage. Socialists argued that French people of all political persuasions call themselves republicans and support the values of liberty and freedom of the French republic. They said it wasn‚Äôt fair for the right to take the monopoly of the term. The leftwing daily Lib√©ration called the proposed name-change a ‚Äúsemantic hold-up‚Äù. But an urgent court challenge brought by leftwing associations under the banner ‚ÄúWe are the Republicans‚Äù, as well 140 individuals ‚Äì including a family who have the surname R√©publicain ‚Äì has been thrown out by a Paris court. Christophe L√®guevaques, one of the lawyers who defended the legal challenge, said: ‚ÄúWe are all Republicans according to the first article of the French constitution ... which states that France is an indivisible republic. And here, two thirds of the population are being excluded.‚Äù The groups may consider launching an appeal. But Sarkozy, who returned from retirement last autumn to head the rightwing opposition after losing the presidency to Fran√ßois Hollande in 2012, will now plough ahead with his sweeping rebranding operation. The massive marketing exercise is key to Sarkozy‚Äôs drive to turn the party into his personal war machine for a bid to reconquer the Elys√©e in 2017. The name Les R√©publicains will be put to an electronic vote of party members this week before a party congress on 30 May. But Sarkozy, 59, faces several hurdles in his quest for the presidency, including opposition from Alain Jupp√©, a former prime minister and seasoned politician, who will run against him in the party‚Äôs primary race to choose its candidate next year. More potentially damaging is the latest corruption investigation hanging over Sarkozy‚Äôs head. He is accused of conspiring with his lawyer to give a magistrate a lucrative job in Monaco in exchange for inside information on another corruption inquiry related to his campaign financing. In July, Sarkozy was charged with corruption, influence peddling and violation of legal secrecy in the case ‚Äì and became the first former head of state to be taken into police custody for questioning. A French court recently confirmed that wiretapped recordings of Sarkozy talking to his lawyer could be used as evidence in the ongoing investigation. If the case were to come to criminal trial before the presidential vote, it could be seriously damaging. Sarkozy, who denies all allegations, faces a theoretical maximum of 10 years in prison if found guilty, but legal experts say a custodial sentence is unlikely even in the event of a conviction. Sarkozy, bolstered by an excellent showing for his party in recent local elections, mocked the left for challenging his party‚Äôs new name and criticised Hollande, who despite low approval ratings is predicted to stand for re-election in 2017. ‚ÄúFran√ßois Hollande and the left have lost. They don‚Äôt know where they‚Äôre going, they‚Äôre discredited, they have no line,‚Äù Sarkozy said Sarkozy‚Äôs recent policy proposals include banning the Muslim headscarf from universities and he has insisted people who receive certain social welfare benefits should have to work for them. The party faithful is expected to vote in favour of the Les R√©publicains name change. But some commentators have complained the name sounds too American and similar to the US Republican party. Sarkozy, a fan of George W Bush, reportedly did not choose the name to copy the US, but rather because his pollsters advised him that acronyms had fallen from favour among voters who are increasingly distrustful of the political class. His team reportedly felt voters preferred bold words such as Spain‚Äôs Podemos (we can), and Les R√©publicains could be presented as a kind of citizens‚Äô movement rather than a plain political party. It is also marks an attempt to counter the rise of Marine Le Pen‚Äôs far-right Front National and attack her as anti-republican. However, a poll last week found that 68% of French people and 40% of UMP sympathisers thought a political party should not have the right to take ownership of the word R√©publicain. The name change is also designed to draw a line under years of internal disputes in the UMP and ongoing funding scandals surrounding the party.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-26T16:43:58Z,world,World news,"At least 108 people shot over three days in Chicago, Baltimore and New York","At least 108 people were shot across three of America‚Äôs most crime-plagued cities during the holiday weekend, as violent new highs from a nationwide gun epidemic intersected with outcries over police violence in Chicago, Baltimore and New York. Chicago, which tends to see a dramatic annual increase in firearm-related homicides beginning with warm weather at the Memorial Day holiday, experienced the worst violence. At least 56 people, including a four-year-old girl and three teenagers, were shot between Friday afternoon and early Tuesday morning, according to the Chicago Tribune. Twelve people were killed over the three-day weekend, twice as many as during the same period last year. In Baltimore, a city still reeling from the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray, who suffered a spinal injury while in police custody just six weeks ago, Baltimore police said 28 people were shot, nine fatally, over the weekend. The latest spate of shootings makes May the city‚Äôs deadliest month since 1999, according to the Baltimore Sun. Since late Sunday, two people were killed and eight injured in shootings across the city. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs deplorable,‚Äù city councilman William ‚ÄúPete‚Äù Welch was quoted as saying in the Sun. ‚ÄúThe shootings and killings are all over the city. I don‚Äôt think any part of the city is immune to this. I‚Äôve never seen anything like it.‚Äù The city erupted in protests over Gray‚Äôs death, which was the latest in a spate of shootings involving the death of a black resident at the hand of police. Six police officers have been indicted in the incident.
In New York City, 23 people were killed or injured in 16 separate shooting incidents across the city over the long weekend, according to the New York police department. There were five reported homicides over the holiday, including one stabbing. The number of shootings had mostly stayed the same year over year, dipping slightly from 17 incidents reported over the weekend in 2014. Last year, Memorial Day weekend in the US was marred by a mass killing in Isla Vista, California, when 22-year-old Elliot Rodger stabbed his two roommates and one of their friends to death; shot and killed three people on the University of California, Santa Barbara campus; and injured 14 more before killing himself. According to the Gun Violence Archive, 9,366 people have been injured by gun violence in America since 1 January 2015, up from 7,145 last year. A total of 4,868 people have been killed since the first of the year, up from 4,123 last year. That number includes 1,155 children and teens injured or killed and 486 instances of defensive gun use. In total, there have been 18,935 incidents of gun violence reported in 2015; among them, according to the gun-violence site, 1,705 were officer-involved shootings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-26T16:02:09Z,world,World news,G4S guard accused of smuggling refugees on to UK-bound flights,"A G4S guard has been accused of smuggling refugees through security checks and on to flights to the United States and Britain. Austrian prosecutors said the employee was one of 13 private security staff working at Vienna airport who were being investigated over suspicions they used their security access to allow refugees to board flights. G4S, which claims to be the world‚Äôs biggest security company and runs security at several UK airports, said one of those arrested had been an employee and he had been sacked in line with Austrian law. Graham Levinsohn, G4S regional CEO for Europe, said: ‚ÄúI can confirm that in compliance with Austrian labour law, an employee responsible for checking visa documentation at Vienna airport on a contract with Austrian Airlines was dismissed in March following his arrest. A trial is ongoing and we are unable to comment further.‚Äù It is understood that the G4S employee accused in this case was employed by one of the airlines to check the size of passengers‚Äô bags and their visas. G4S said it did not employ any of the others accused of involvement. A spokesman for Austrian prosecutors said the authorities knew of 10 ‚Äútrafficking trips‚Äù between last autumn and February. He declined to name any companies involved and said it was not yet clear how many people had been smuggled through security checks. The traffickers collected between ‚Ç¨7,000 to ‚Ç¨9,000 (¬£5,000-6,500) per person, he added. According to the Austrian authorities, the trafficking scheme came to light after the suspects tried to recruit a new accomplice, who then contacted the police. One person who allegedly paid the suspects was subsequently refused entry into the US. The Austrian spokesman said one man from Poland and another from Sri Lanka had been placed in custody pending an investigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-26T15:17:57Z,world,World news,Chinese students in the west call for transparency over Tiananmen Square,"A group of Chinese students living in western countries have issued a rare public appeal for their government to end its secrecy over the Tiananmen Square massacre and hold those responsible to account. The open letter from 11 students enrolled at universities in the US, UK and Australia is politically risky at a time of tightening government controls on activists and rights groups, from small charities and feminists to human rights lawyers who take on politically controversial cases. It prompted an angry attack from the hardline nationalist paper The Global Times, which accused the authors of serving ‚Äúoverseas hostile forces‚Äù and trying to ‚Äútear society apart‚Äù. The lead signatory to the letter, Gu Yi, said the group felt they had a moral duty to share the information they had stumbled upon after leaving their home country, about the extent of the Tiananmen protests in Beijing and the bloody government crackdown on 4 June 1989. Gu, a chemistry student at the University of Georgia, said: ‚ÄúI feel strongly as a Chinese citizen with full access to information outside China that I have a responsibility to tell my fellow citizens about this. We have been living in fear for a lot of years and what we are trying to do is fight this fear so we can live in freedom.‚Äù
The lengthy discussion of what happened in May and June 1989 was mostly addressed to fellow students at home in China, trapped behind what the letter called the ‚Äúever higher internet firewall‚Äù, but pointedly criticised the government. The letter said: ‚ÄúSome say the Communist party of China has taken lessens from 4 June and we should not pursue it anymore, and yet the repression lingers on: the truth is still being covered up; the victims are still being humiliated.‚Äù It goes on to subvert the so-called China dream, a favourite slogan of the president, Xi Jinping, used by the government with a strict focus on economic progress. ‚ÄúWe have a dream in our hearts, that in the near future, on the basis of accurate history and the implementation of justice, everyone could live in a world free of fear. As a group of Chinese students overseas, this is our China dream.‚Äù The letter has already drawn more than 50 new signatures since it was posted online, Gu said, including one from a high-school student in China whom he described as very brave. He had not told his own parents about the letter to prevent them worrying. Its publication marked an unusual protest by students not connected to activist circles in China, and a generation below the activists who went into exile after 1989. The group are abroad for now, but choosing to post their open letter online so the message can reach China means its impact could follow them home as well. Zhang Lifan, an independent historian and political commentator, said: ‚ÄúThey could face difficulties when they get back to China and when they try to find jobs back home. Even their families could get into trouble.‚Äù The events of 1989 are one of the biggest taboos in contemporary China, with the day‚Äôs bloodshed usually referred to simply as an ‚Äúincident‚Äù in official media and government reports, and censors banning even indirect references. ‚ÄúHow risky is this letter? Given the shifting sands of political sensitivity, answering such a question is difficult, but the climate for discussing the events of 1989 has become much worse since the run-up to the 25th anniversary last year,‚Äù said Louisa Lim, the author of The People‚Äôs Republic of Amnesia, an account of the protests, the crackdown and the aftermath. ‚ÄúIn the past, private commemorations held behind closed doors had been tolerated; last year, these too were targeted ... The Chinese authorities seem determined to try to tamp down any discussion or commemoration of 4 June whatsoever using any means necessary.‚Äù The Global Times insisted that the events at Tiananmen Square have been largely excised from public debate by common agreement rather than a government coverup. It said Chinese citizens who want to can easily bypass controls to access ‚Äúsensitive information from overseas websites‚Äù. ‚ÄúChinese society has reached a consensus on not debating the 1989 incident,‚Äù said the broadside, originally published in Chinese and English. ‚ÄúWhen China is moving forward, some are trying to drag up history in an attempt to tear apart society. It‚Äôs a meaningless attempt.‚Äù The Chinese government has been been extremely successful in controlling the awareness of events a quarter of a century ago, according to Lim. China‚Äôs sophisticated, complex internet censorship system deploys a range of tools to manage the information its citizens see, from a firewall that cuts off access to undesirable foreign websites to groups of paid online commentators who bolster the government line and censorship of sensitive terms on domestic search engines. Lim said: ‚ÄúThe students who wrote this letter are correct to state that many of their contemporaries know very little about what happened on 4 June 1989.‚Äù She pointed out that even the iconic picture of a row of tanks halted by an unarmed man, referred to as tank man, is virtually unknown in China. She said: ‚ÄúWhen I was writing my book, I asked 100 university students in Beijing to identify the picture of tank man. The vast majority, 85%, had no idea what it signified or where it was taken, asking questions like ‚ÄòIs it from South Korea?‚Äô and ‚ÄòIs it in Kosovo?‚Äô‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is the demographic who are most likely to be able to ... bypass internet censorship, so I believe that outside Beijing and outside university campuses, the level of ignorance surrounding the Tiananmen crackdown is even higher.‚Äù Despite the ferocity of the Global Times attack, Gu said he was grateful to the newspaper for drawing attention to a letter by 11 unknown students that might otherwise have languished in relative obscurity. Originally posted online across a variety of state media, the Tuesday editorial drew attention to a petition that had previously gone unnoticed. The Chinese version was later stripped from all websites, but not before circulating widely enough that many stored versions can still be found. Gu said: ‚ÄúThe Global Times attacking our letter was the best advertisement. We think the fast removal of the letter shows they were confused in their response and that we had some impact in mainland China.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-26T13:54:59Z,world,World news,Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian goes on trial in Iran for spying,"Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post reporter imprisoned in Iran for nearly 10 months, is standing trial behind closed doors in Tehran on charges of espionage and at least three other major crimes. The Iranian-American appeared before a revolutionary court presided over by Abolghassem Salavati, a hardline judge notorious for handing down heavy sentences to opposition activists and dissidents, local media reported. Rezaian‚Äôs lawyer, Leila Ahsan, told the semi-official Tasnim news agency: ‚ÄúHe has been charged with espionage for collecting information about the country‚Äôs domestic and foreign policy issues.‚Äù She is not Rezaian‚Äôs lawyer of choice. ‚ÄúAccording to the indictment, he is also facing the charges of collecting confidential information, collaborating with hostile governments, spreading propaganda against the Islamic republic and writing a letter to the US president [Barack] Obama,‚Äù she added. Rezaian, 39, who holds dual Iranian and American citizenship, was arrested at his home in Tehran in July 2014 along with his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, also a journalist, and two friends, an Iranian-American couple. Salehi was released on bail in October and is facing a separate trial.
After a 90-minute meeting between Rezaian and his lawyer in April, the first such meeting between the two, it emerged that he has been charged with espionage. His family say the charges are baseless and unfounded. The Washington Post‚Äôs executive editor, Martin Baron, issued a statement before the start of Rezaian‚Äôs trial, condemning ‚Äúthe shameful acts of injustice‚Äù facing his Tehran correspondent. ‚ÄúNo evidence has ever been produced by prosecutors or the court to support these absurd charges. The trial date was only disclosed to Jason‚Äôs lawyer last week. And now, unsurprisingly but unforgivably, it turns out the trial will be closed,‚Äù read the statement published on the Post‚Äôs website. Baron said efforts by his paper to secure a visa for a senior editor to travel to Iran had been blocked. Rezaian‚Äôs mother, Mary, however, has been in Tehran for the past two weeks, though she has not been allowed to attend the trial, and nor has Salehi. Baron added: ‚ÄúThere is no justice in this system, not an ounce of it, and yet the fate of a good, innocent man hangs in the balance. Iran is making a statement about its values in its disgraceful treatment of our colleague, and it can only horrify the world community.‚Äù In April, Obama met Rezaian‚Äôs brother, Ali, at the White House correspondents‚Äô dinner, reassuring him that the American government would do all it could to bring him home. The president said during a speech at the event: ‚ÄúFor nine months, Jason has been in prison for nothing more than writing about the hopes and fears of the Iranian people. I have told [Rezaian‚Äôs brother] personally that we will not rest until we bring him home to his family, safe and sound.‚Äù
Before the trial opened, Ali Rezaian criticised the decision by the Iranian judiciary to hold it behind closed doors and said his brother had lost 18kg (40lb) while in jail. ‚ÄúI think the only reason you could possibly imagine that the trial would be closed would be to prevent people from seeing the lack of evidence,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unlike the Iranian court system, Iranian government, to keep things private when they can go out and use propaganda up against people.‚Äù
It is not still clear why Iran is accusing Rezaian of espionage. Ali Rezaian said two pieces of evidence against him were a visa application he had lodged for his Iranian wife in order to be able to travel to the US and a letter he sent to Obama‚Äôs 2008 White House transition team offering help to improve bilateral relations between Iran and the US. Iran‚Äôs foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who has described Rezaian as a fair reporter, said in April that Rezaian was accused of ‚Äúa very serious offence‚Äù but he hoped he would be cleared of the charges against him. Zarif said at the time: ‚ÄúHe is an Iranian citizen. It is unfortunate that some over-zealous, low-level operative tried to take advantage of him. And I don‚Äôt go into further detail because it‚Äôs a pending case before the court. And I hope that he will be cleared of that charge.‚Äù In the past few months, a number of hardline Iranian media outlets have tried to build a cause against him. Unattributed accusations printed in the Iranian press allege that Rezaian worked undercover as a spy while reporting in the country for the Post. A Fars news agency report alleged that Rezaian provided economic and industrial data to the US government. Ahsan said at the time in response to the accusations: ‚ÄúJason is a journalist, and it is in the nature of his profession to gain access to information and publish them. My client, however, has never had any direct or indirect access to classified information to share with anyone.‚Äù Iran does not recognise dual citizenship and treats Rezaian as solely Iranian. Iranian intelligence authorities have a deep suspicion of dual citizens and have arrested a number in recent years. The country has a history of jailing journalists working for the foreign press. Those previously jailed in Iran include Maziar Bahari, whose ordeal in prison was the subject of Rosewater, a film by the US comedian Jon Stewart recently released in the UK. Rezaian‚Äôs trial was adjourned after two hours. It was not clear when the next session would take place and what details were discussed in the court.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-26T12:53:24Z,world,World news,National Gallery hints that disputed art collection belongs to Ireland,"The National Gallery in London has given its clearest indication that Ireland has a moral, if not legal, right to a priceless collection of impressionist paintings that have been a cause c√©l√®bre of Irish nationalism since the 1920s. The 39 paintings, including some of the most celebrated works of the French artists Renoir, Monet and Manet, were left to the gallery by the art collector Sir Hugh Lane, who was killed on the Lusitania when it was hit by a German torpedo 100 years ago this month. In a codicil to his will, Lane made it clear that he wanted the paintings to go to Dublin, but because the amendment was unwitnessed the collection stayed in London. Since then, the works have been regarded by many in Ireland, including the poet WB Yeats, as a symbol of British colonial plunder. Now the National Gallery has expressed some sympathy for that view, in a concession welcomed by Dublin.
After years of campaigning the National Gallery has agreed to a series of compromise deals involving sharing the paintings, while ownership of the best of them, including Renoir‚Äôs Les Parapluies, Manet‚Äôs Music in the Tuileries Gardens and Monet‚Äôs Lavacourt Under Snow, remained vested in London. But now the gallery has admitted this may not go far enough, a concession that could open the way for Ireland gaining a greater stake in the paintings when the sharing arrangement ends in 2019. In a lecture to mark the centenary of Lane‚Äôs death delivered at both the National Gallery and Dublin City Gallery the Hugh Lane, Roy Foster, professor of Irish history at Oxford University, called for ownership of the paintings to be transferred to Dublin as a way of righting a ‚Äúlong-standing historical injustice‚Äù. Introducing the lecture, Nicholas Penny, the National Gallery director, publicly acknowledged Dublin‚Äôs moral claim to the pictures. ‚ÄúThe National Gallery claims legal ownership of the paintings bequeathed by Sir Hugh Lane, but has long conceded that Dublin has some moral claim to them,‚Äù he said. Penny added that it was a difficult but important topic because ‚Äúthere are so many cultural institutions which should, even if they don‚Äôt, acknowledge that some other institution or some other country, has some sort of moral claim on the works of art in their possession.‚Äù He went on: ‚ÄúTo have reached a compromise of the kind we have is something that I‚Äôm very pleased that we can advertise. We must always welcome people who feel we haven‚Äôt gone far enough in the type of acknowledgement we have made.‚Äù
Penny has refused requests by the Guardian to elaborate on his remarks, but they are being seen as an acknowledgement of the gallery‚Äôs tenuous ownership of the paintings. Barbara Dawson, director of Dublin City Gallery the Hugh Lane, said: ‚ÄúNicholas Penny‚Äôs remarks are the clearest public acknowledgement of Dublin‚Äôs right to these paintings and are very welcome.‚Äù
She added: ‚ÄúThey build on the legal agreement between the two institutions which allows the paintings to be shared between the two institutions and which acknowledges Dublin‚Äôs right to these works. However, as Hugh Lane bought these works with the specific purpose of building a gallery of modern art for Dublin, the Hugh Lane gallery continues to seek return of ownership. ‚ÄúAs Dr Penny is aware, prestigious works such as those in the Sir Hugh Lane Bequest greatly benefit the institution which holds the ownership and assist in numerous ways in building and sustaining the profile of that public institution. It would be very desirable for the Hugh Lane gallery to have ownership returned so as to benefit the Hugh Lane gallery and Dublin as Hugh Lane intended.‚Äù Foster said Penny‚Äôs comments were a ‚Äúwelcome admission‚Äù and said he thought he was implicitly admitting that Dublin had a moral right to the paintings. The historian said no one from the gallery had previously gone as far as Penny in expressing such an ‚Äúunderstanding line‚Äù. In his lecture, Foster described his ‚Äúrighteous rage‚Äù at seeing that the pictures continue to be labelled as the property of the National Gallery, London.
He said returning all of the works to Dublin would be an opportunity to right a historical wrong. The lecture concluded with a plea from Foster: ‚ÄúBy acknowledging true ownership of the Hugh Lane pictures, however belated, a long-standing injustice might actually be righted ‚Äì which is a very rare thing to be able to do, and thus in time forgotten, which is surely the best way to commemorate history.‚Äù Dawson echoed these sentiments. ‚ÄúAs Prof Foster has pointed out not many historical injustices can be righted but this injustice can,‚Äù she said. Lucy McDiarmid, author of the Irish Art of Controversy and professor of English at Montclair State University, New Jersey, said Penny‚Äôs remarks would be significant if they led to a change of ownership. ‚ÄúThe lending agreements are evidence of the National Gallery‚Äôs acceptance of [Ireland‚Äôs] ‚Äòmoral claim‚Äô. All that‚Äôs new is Penny‚Äôs wording. The situation ‚Äì the division of the collection and trading paintings back and forth ‚Äì remains the same. What would be new and without precedent in the post-1961 history of the paintings would be their actual return [to Ireland].‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-26T12:08:01Z,world,World news,Danish radio station kills rabbit live on air,"A Danish radio station has killed a nine-week old rabbit live on air, saying it intended to stimulate a debate around the ‚Äúwidespread hypocrisy in our relationship to animals‚Äù. Presenters brought the rabbit, which they called Alan, into the studio on Sunday morning, where he was clubbed with a bicycle pump.Asger Juhl, one of the presenters, later took the rabbit‚Äôs body home and skinned it, saying he planned a dinner of rabbit rago√ªt for his children. Radio24syv said Denmark has some of the world‚Äôs most industrialised agriculture. Its stunt provoked a strong backlash and calls for a boycott. In a response to Radio24syv‚Äôs Facebook post, Stan Kosjaks wrote: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt try and justify it you heartless bastards, the only reason you killed a small, defenceless animal on air is to boost your ratings. ‚ÄúMaybe, somebody should hit you on the head with a fucking pump, see if that provokes a debate.‚Äù Julie Schmidt wrote: ‚ÄúYou could probably easily have had the debate on air without having to kill an animal.‚Äù The station invited an outspoken advocate for animal rights, Linse Kessler, into the studio for the debate. When she realised the plan, Kessler chased Juhl around the studio in an attempt to rescue the rabbit. Kessler later posted a video to Facebook in which she said she understood the point Radio24syv was trying to make, but thought killing the rabbit went too far. ‚ÄúI could see that the message is actually for the best of animals but I think it is wrong,‚Äù she said, according to a translation by The Local.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prime minister and the Russian president spoke on the phone for half an hour on Monday afternoon, with Putin congratulating Cameron on his election win. A Downing Street spokesperson said the two leaders agreed their national security advisers should meet to restart talks on the Syrian conflict, which has raged for more years four years and killed an estimated 310,000 people. ‚ÄúOn Syria, both leaders agreed that it is in the interest of both the UK and Russia to help find a solution to the civil war in Syria and particularly to stop the rise of [Isis],‚Äù the spokesperson said. Previous talks between Britain and Russia seeking to find a solution to the conflict broke down due to Putin‚Äôs continued support of the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad.

2015-05-26T11:37:13Z,world,World news,Shinzo Abe urged to confront Japan's colonial aggression and use of sex slaves,"Japanese historians have urged prime minister Shinzo Abe to offer an honest account of the country‚Äôs wartime use of sex slaves in the runup to the 70th anniversary of the end of the Pacific war. In a statement released this week that echoes a demand recently issued by overseas experts, 16 groups of academics, including the Japanese Society for Historical Studies, said the government must ‚Äúsquarely‚Äù confront Japan‚Äôs wartime conduct. Despite signs of an improvement in Sino-Japanese ties, speculation is building that Abe‚Äôs conservative administration will not repeat an official apology to the ‚Äúcomfort women‚Äù ‚Äì a euphemism for as many as 200,000 women, mostly from the Korean peninsula, who were forced to work in military brothels. Early indications are that Abe will also make no reference to Japan‚Äôs colonial rule and aggression on mainland Asia in the first half of the 20th century, when it invaded the Korean peninsula and parts of China. The omissions would mark a clean break with apologies issued by his predecessors on previous war anniversaries, and risk raising tensions with South Korea and China. The Japanese academics said in their statement that comfort women had been the victims of ‚Äúunspeakable violence as sex slaves‚Äù. They added: ‚ÄúAs recent historical studies have shown, victims were subjected not only to forced recruitment, but also to conditions of sexual slavery which violated their basic human rights. By continuing to take the irresponsible stance of denying the facts of wartime sexual slavery in the Japanese military, certain politicians and sections of the media are essentially conveying to the rest of the world that Japan does not respect human rights. ‚ÄúThis kind of attitude tramples further upon the dignity of the victims, who have already borne terrible hardships.‚Äù
While Abe has said he will not alter the wording of an apology to survivors of military sexual enslavement issued in 1993 by the then chief cabinet secretary, Yohei Kono, he has resisted pressure to repeat the apology, most recently during his address to a joint session of the US congress. The Japanese historians urged ‚Äúall concerned politicians and media outlets to squarely face up to the damage that Japan inflicted in the past, as well as to the victims‚Äù. The demand comes soon after several hundred academics, mainly from the US and Europe, voiced alarm at attempts to rewrite Japan‚Äôs wartime history, and urged Abe to ‚Äúact boldly‚Äù in addressing sensitive issues from the past.
In an open letter, more than 180 scholars called for ‚Äúas full and unbiased an accounting of past wrongs as possible‚Äù. The number of academics who wish to add their names to the protest has since more than doubled to more than 450. Rightwing revisionists associated with Abe have been emboldened by misreporting of the sex slave issue by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. Last summer, the liberal daily admitted that it had run a series of articles stretching back to the 1980s that were based on testimony given by Seiji Yoshida, a former Japanese soldier, whose claims were later found to be false. Abe was one of several conservative politicians who claimed the Asahi‚Äôs erroneous coverage had sullied Japan‚Äôs reputation abroad. However, the academics said previous government apologies were not based on the Asahi‚Äôs reporting or Yoshida‚Äôs testimony, adding: ‚ÄúThe existence of forcibly recruited ‚Äòcomfort women‚Äô has been verified by many historical records and extensive research.‚Äù Abe has previously questioned the widely held belief that Japanese military authorities coerced the women. He has also said that Japan has apologised enough for its actions during the war.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-26T10:10:15Z,world,World news,"Chechen leader to star in two films ‚Äì one Hollywood, one human rights expos√©","Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov is starring in two films √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú one a Hollywood thriller featuring the camouflage-clad hero firing a machine gun into the sky and the other a sombre documentary accusing him of human rights abuses. The upcoming feature, which Kadyrov announced on his personal Instagram page today, is to be called Whoever Doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t Understand Will Get It. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a hard-hitting piece in which, after lengthy negotiations, I have agreed to play the role of the main hero. √¢‚Ç¨¬¶ The director is the author of famous Hollywood films,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Kadyrov wrote on Instagram. The trailer announces that the movie will be shown in cinemas across Russia.
A series of scandals in recent months have propelled Kadyrov to the forefront of Russian politics. The Chechen strongman appears to answer only to Vladimir Putin, to whom he frequently and publicly expresses his adoration. He is being portrayed less flatteringly in a short documentary financed by former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, which alleges widespread human rights violations in Chechnya and accuses Kadyrov of having a personal army of up to 80,000 fighters and skimming off huge quantities of federal funds. The film, which Khodorkovsky said was the reason behind police raids on the offices of his Open Russia Foundation last month, catalogued abuses in Chechnya and featured interviews with prominent Russian journalists, NGO workers and political analysts.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThis is a person that has made Chechnya into his own feudal domain,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Khodorkovsky said in the film, entitled Family. The 26-minute documentary also catalogues beatings and murders reportedly linked to Chechen security forces and alleges that every Chechen is forced to make a contribution to a personal fund from which Kadyrov buys expensive presents and pays foreign celebrity visitors. The movie shows old television interviews where Putin describes Kadyrov as a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìson√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ and Kadyrov, with tears in his eyes, pledges his allegiance to the Russian president.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-26T07:09:31Z,world,World news,Marikana survivors sue Zuma to force release of official report into massacre,"Survivors of the Marikana mine massacre are taking the South African president, Jacob Zuma, to court in an attempt to force the release of an official investigation into the killings. The shootings by police in August 2012 left 34 mineworkers dead and more than 78 injured on what has been described as South Africa‚Äôs darkest day since the end of apartheid. Zuma immediately announced a judicial commission of inquiry which duly sat for 293 days, hearing evidence including that police planted weapons on some of the dead bodies to fit a false narrative. The commission submitted its report to Zuma at the end of March. But nearly two months later, after stating that he ‚Äúis still processing the report and will release it publicly in due course‚Äù, the president has offered no clue as to when the potentially explosive contents will be made public.
In an attempt to force Zuma‚Äôs hand, injured and arrested victims of the police crackdown are turning to the courts. Last week a letter was sent to the presidency giving Zuma a deadline of 2pm on Sunday to announce when he would release Judge Ian Farlam‚Äôs report. Andries Nkome, a lawyer representing the injured miners and Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union, told South Africa‚Äôs Star newspaper: ‚ÄúWe have not received a response. We will now proceed with court papers. We are finalising them on Monday morning and by this afternoon we will have a case number and date.‚Äù The application is expected to be made in the high court in Johannesburg. Nkome said he feared that should the report‚Äôs publication be delayed any further, his clients would not have time to prepare for civil claims which lapse on 16 August. He wrote to Zuma: ‚ÄúSuch civil claims will be extinguished on August ‚Ä¶ due to the expiry of the three-year period within which such claims have to be instituted.‚Äù Nkome said his clients were also concerned by reports that Lieutenant-general Zukiswa Mbombo, the north-west province police commissioner, intends to retire at the end of the month. Mbombo was among those his clients held directly responsible ‚Äúfor their physical and emotional scars‚Äù. He added: ‚ÄúOur clients are of the firm view that her imminent departure is largely motivated, in whole or in part, by a deliberate desire to escape the obvious consequences of her criminal and/or otherwise unlawful conduct in connection with the Marikana massacre ‚Ä¶ The failure to release the report is also calculated to let her off the hook.‚Äù During her testimony, Mbombo conceded that police intervention at the mine in 2012 was a failure. She said there were mistakes in the police communication systems used on the day of the shooting. Nkome said his clients noted that the national police commissioner, Gen Riah Phiyega, had been offered a different posting by Zuma. ‚ÄúThe feeling that my clients have [is that they] will not be able to hold them accountable because they will not be holding that office any more.‚Äù
But on Monday Zuma‚Äôs office rejected Nkome‚Äôs statements about Mbombo and Phiyega as ‚Äúfalse‚Äù. Spokesperson Harold Maloka said: ‚ÄúThe president does not manage the careers of provincial police commissioners and as such has nothing to do with the reported retirement. Linking the president to this matter and insinuating that it could be linked to the processing of the Marikana report by the president is malicious and mischievous.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúMr Nkome also repeated the already refuted allegations that President Jacob Zuma has met the national police commissioner, Riah Phiyega, and discussed an alternative deployment for her. Reports of the said meeting and alleged discussions are a complete fabrication and have been refuted by the presidency. Anyone who repeats these allegations is perpetuating a lie.‚Äù Among the questions raised by Marikana was the role of Zuma‚Äôs deputy, Cyril Ramaphosa, a director and shareholder of mine owner Lonmin at the time, and whether he encouraged the police to go on the offensive. The Marikana Support Campaign, Right2Know Campaign and the SA History Archive are also stepping up pressure for the immediate release of the report. They have submitted a request under the Promotion of Access to Information Act, which gives the presidency 30 days to respond. The groups said: ‚ÄúIt has been more than two and a half years since the Marikana massacre on 16 August 2012, and there have been no arrests made for the murder of the 34 miners who were killed while striking ‚Ä¶ The commission report and findings are crucial to determining the truth about what happened at Marikana, to hold those responsible for the massacre to account and to ensure that justice is served.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-26T06:37:02Z,world,World news,Biden calls Iraqi PM to calm outcry over Carter remarks on fight against Isis,"US vice-president Joe Biden on Monday spoke to the Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, to reassure him of US support, a day after controversial remarks by the defense secretary, Ash Carter, sparked an argument over the recent military successes of Islamic State.
Carter told CNN on Saturday Iraqi forces had shown ‚Äúno will to fight‚Äù Isis and had fled in Ramadi despite outnumbering the militants. Isis also captured Palmyra, in Syria, last week. A spokesman for Abadi subsequently told the Associated Press Carter had been given ‚Äúincorrect information‚Äù, and said: ‚ÄúWe should not judge the whole army based on one incident.‚Äù A White House statement on Monday said Biden recognised ‚Äúthe enormous sacrifice and bravery‚Äù that Iraqi forces had displayed over the past 18 months in Ramadi and elsewhere, and welcomed an Iraqi decision to mobilise additional troops and prepare for counterattack operations. Nonetheless, rival powers and allies traded barbs and accusations over the recent successes of Isis, amid warnings that it may execute hundreds of hostages captured in its latest battles. In Iran, Qassem Suleimani, the commander of the Quds Force, the external operations arm of the Revolutionary Guards, said the US had ‚Äúno will‚Äù to fight Isis. ‚ÄúToday, there is nobody in confrontation with [Isis] except the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as nations who are next to Iran or supported by Iran,‚Äù Suleimani told a daily newspaper, Javan, on Monday. Suleimani said US fighter jets had done nothing to halt the Isis advance on Ramadi, and said the US was complicit in the group‚Äôs expansion. On Monday, the most senior British military officer to be involved in postwar planning in Iraq, Major General Tim Cross, said the Iraqi army lacked the necessary ‚Äúmoral cohesion‚Äù to fight against Isis. In Washington, Republican attacks on the Obama administration over its policy against Isis have grown louder. On Sunday John McCain, the chair of the Senate armed services committee, mocked President Obama for saying climate change was a threat to US national security when advances by Isis had not been checked. The international war of words highlighted disagreements between the US, Iraq and Iran over how to combat Isis. Months of air strikes have failed to check its advances. Last week, the militant group seized the capital of the predominantly Sunni Anbar province, its greatest victory in Iraq since its conquest of Mosul last summer and its declaration of a caliphate spanning swaths of Iraq and Syria. Isis advances have not been limited to Iraq. Last week, the group took control of the historic Syrian city of Palmyra and strategic gas fields nearby after a week-long siege that routed forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. The victory has triggered a humanitarian crisis, due to the flight of thousands of residents.
Isis has so far executed more than 200 people in the city and nearby villages, including civilians as well as pro-Assad fighters, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group with wide contacts in Syria. The group also holds some 600 captives from its battles in the east of the city of Homs and Palmyra, including pro-government fighters and civilians it accuses of aiding Assad. They are likely to face the same fate. The Assad regime said Isis had killed 400 civilians in Palmyra over the weekend, a claim both unsupported and contradictory to the regime‚Äôs own declaration when it withdrew from Palmyra that it had evacuated most of the civilians in the city. Assad‚Äôs air force launched more than a dozen air strikes on Palmyra on Monday, including raids near the ancient ruins of the city, which many fear Isis might damage or destroy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-26T06:31:00Z,world,World news,"Texas storms: flooding had 'tsunami-type power', says governor","Texas governor Greg Abbott has expanded the emergency disaster zone in his state, adding 24 counties to a list of 13 affected by storms and flooding. Three people were reported dead and 12 missing as Oklahoma was also hit hard, while a tornado left 13 dead in a Mexican town just beyond the border.
Abbott said the damage caused by flash floods in central Texas was ‚Äúabsolutely devastating‚Äù and had been caused by ‚Äúrelentless, tsunami-type power‚Äù. The 12 people missing were from two families staying together in one house in Wimberley Valley, in Texas. Bert Cobb, a Hays County judge, said witnesses reported seeing the house pushed off its foundations by rushing water. He said only pieces of the house had been found, and that one person rescued from the home told workers about the other people inside. At least 2,000 Texas residents were forced out of their homes. The central part of the state was particularly hard hit, especially San Marcos and Wimberley, near the Blanco river ‚Äì which was measured at 40ft, the highest it had reached since 2010. Hays County‚Äôs emergency management coordinator, Kharley Smith, estimated that 350 to 400 homes in Wimberley had been destroyed. Severe storms brought heavy rain to the Houston area. Harris County Flood control advised residents waking up for work and school on Tuesday morning not to leave their homes.
In Mexico, 13 people died when a tornado hit the border city of Ciudad Acu√±a at around 6.40am on Monday. Photos from the scene showed cars with their hoods ripped off, resting upended against single-storey houses. One car‚Äôs frame was bent around the gate of a house. A bus was flipped and crumpled on a roadway. In the US, storms covered land from the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes over Memorial Day weekend. Oklahoma and Texas bore the brunt of the damage. Forecasters predicted more moderate storms, but already overwhelmed waterways and saturated grounds were more vulnerable to lighter weather conditions. The weather could also affect recovery and rescue missions. At least three American residents died in the storms. In Oklahoma, firefighter Jason Farley died after being swept into a storm drain while attempting to evacuate residents. A Tulsa woman died in a weather-related traffic accident. Texas officials confirmed that one person died in San Marcos, though it was not clear how. May is now the rainiest month on record in Oklahoma. Albert Ashwood, the state‚Äôs emergency management department director, warned about damage to roadways and cautioned against using the streets during a popular weekend for travel.
‚ÄúThis is a holiday weekend, and Oklahomans want to get out and observe their Memorial Day traditions, but we are asking everyone to please exercise extreme caution in doing so,‚Äù Ashwood told the Oklahoman newspaper. In Johnson County, just outside Dallas, residents grappled with the third large flood in four weeks that have also included the region‚Äôs largest earthquake and a mile-wide tornado. Jamie Moore, the county‚Äôs emergency management coordinator, said the weather events were unprecedented in the area‚Äôs history. ‚ÄúPeople who lived here their entire lives can‚Äôt remember a spring like this,‚Äù the Dallas Morning News.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-26T04:00:11Z,world,World news,The forgotten land of colours: a trip through Iran's Persian Gulf,"‚ÄúThis rock is a dragon, left here before the last great war.‚Äù ‚ÄúLook at the top of the cliff. We call that rock Ferdowsi, as it looks from afar like the great poet.‚Äù Locals have stories for the rocks and cliffs that resemble birds, animals or mythical creatures. ‚ÄúWe grew up with our grandparents taking us on long walks and telling us about the rocks,‚Äù says Ali Hormuzi, a 44-year-old resident. Colourful mountains in shades of pink, red, purple and yellow overlook shorelines where turtles and flamingos roam or sunbathe. This is Hormuz island in the Persian Gulf, the mostly forgotten land of colours in the Strait of Hormuz, 5km from the mainland, and southeast of Bandar Abbas, major port and capital of the province of Hormuzgan. The island was visited among others by Marco Polo. Ibn Battuta who came twice between 1330 and 1340, wrote that the island‚Äôs city was ‚Äúfine‚Äù and ‚Äúlarge...with magnificent bazaars.‚Äù
The island was once settled by tens of thousands but its population has fallen below 10,000. Many have been unemployed since relations with Oman, an important trading partner, soured during the presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (2005-2013). ‚ÄúBefore, most men on the island were involved in trade with Khasab, a coastal city in Oman,‚Äù says Ali. ‚ÄúWe would go in the morning and come back at night, never leaving the special reserved area for Iranians. I never saw the rest of Khasab despite going there for years. We just weren‚Äôt allowed in.‚Äù
Locals would bring goods back to Hormuz, and then sell to traders in Bandar Abbas and Qeshm, a neighbouring Iranian island. ‚ÄúTechnically, it was smuggling, since it was all done under the rug,‚Äù Ali explains. Ali has worked hard to make ends meet since trading with Oman declined. Smuggling, qhachagh, is a word you hear all over the Persian Gulf islands, including Qeshm, from where I have travelled the 60km to Hormuz. In some ways the islands are distinct from the rest of Iran. The wind-catchers ‚Äì long, rectangular structures that cause airflow from the cooler undergrounds to the main rooms ‚Äì in old homes are even more intricate than those found in Yazd, in the central desert. The cats resemble Siamese cats more than any feline you will find in Tehran, Isfahan or other mainland cities: one can only imagine they arrived on trade ships. Unlike many parts of the country where women have shed traditional regional attire, the women of Qeshm and Hormuz mostly wear the colourful bandari pants, loose at the top and tight at the bottom with vibrant embroidery. A loose cotton chador with rich, bright flower patterns covers their heads.
But despite deep trade and cultural ties to India and Pakistan, locals know themselves to be Iranian first and foremost. Rice is cooked the particular Iranian way, steamed and then crisped at the bottom and along the edges - tahdig. Local cuisine, especially on Qeshm, which sees most tourists, is plentiful and delicious, with seafood offered once the sun sets and residents get out by the water. Octopus, fish and shrimps are saut√©ed with onions, tomatoes and local spices, and put into a sandwich with pickled cucumbers and cabbage. A local mix of ten spices and herbs including turmeric, cloves, dried rose petals and cinnamon makes meals exemplary. In recent years, with the absence of hotels across the islands, people have begun turning their homes into restaurants and hostels. The most famous is nakhoda (captain) Amini, a sailor turned restaurateur in Tabl village, on Qeshm island. He has a dozen rooms, and theirs is a family business: his wife cooks, he manages, the children and grandchildren take care of affairs. Guests are given a notebook to sign, and captain Amini says he now has a sack full of them, and plans to publish a book on his 20 years in the business. There are notes by people from as far away as Australia and Germany, and there is a family from Spain staying in the room next to me. Traditionally, homes on the islands were all built with wind-catchers. But today, on Qeshm, Loft village is the only place where they can be found. Following an earthquake in 2005, the houses were rebuilt with cement and air-conditioning. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an archaeological artefact,‚Äù a woman tells me, pointing to her wind-catcher. Lotf village is also known for its view of the Persian Gulf, and as we walk the village in the late afternoon, at least a dozen European tourists are waiting on a hill to watch the sunset. ‚ÄúWhere are the Iranians?‚Äù I ask a resident. ‚ÄúIn the shopping malls,‚Äù he answers. With sanctions against Iran, smuggling has supplied the Dubai-style malls sprouting up. Most of the merchandise came that way, a storeowner in Qeshm city centre tells me. Qeshm was declared a free trade zone under the presidency of Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (1989-1997), following a boom in Kish, another island in the province. The quest to create a business-friendly environment around glitzy island resorts in the Persian Gulf began under the Shah. After he built a villa on Kish, his regular trips were well publicised and led to the establishment of the Development Organisation of Kish. Whole villages were razed to make way for large-scale projects. Following the 1979 Revolution and end of the Iran-Iraq War in 1988, the vision was carried forward despite tight economic sanctions. There are now many Iranian free trade zones including not just Kish and Qeshm but Chabahar in Sistan-Baluchistan province and most recently Arvand in Khuzestan. What makes Qeshm different from Kish, known throughout Iran as a shoppers‚Äô haven, is that many locals own stores and malls. But while locals that are savvy enough to jump ship can prosper, those wedded to the traditional pastoral life are pushed into deep poverty. In Kish, locals live in almost slum-like conditions beyond the high rises and shopping malls. Naeem, an acquaintance in Qeshm, has been smuggling fuels like petrol to Dubai since he was 14. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been lucrative,‚Äù he tells me. ‚ÄúI have a house, a car, and will be fully paying for my own wedding next week.‚Äù Weddings on the island are seven-day affairs where the entire village is fed many times, so paying for one‚Äôs own at 25 years of age is an achievement. From 2014 to 2015, the number of petrol smugglers has dwindled. ‚ÄúThe profit used to be threefold,‚Äù says Naeem, who is trying to get into tourism, while still transporting cargoes of clothing and foodstuffs from time to time. In summer of 2014, Naeem counted more than 100 petrol smugglers in one day. In 2015, ‚ÄúI see less than half a dozen on the same road. ‚ÄúThe guards have cracked down hard,‚Äù he says. Toyota Hilux pickup trucks are invariably used, and as we drive along the coast, Naeem points out one after another: ‚Äúsmuggling clothes‚Äù, ‚Äúgas.‚Äù On Naz island, off the coast of Qeshm, he takes a child‚Äôs shirt from the water and puts it in the back of his pickup. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs brand new, that‚Äôs alarming. Sometimes smuggling ships have to dump their load if they notice guards coming close. I‚Äôll take it to show the rest of the boys in the village, they have to be careful these days.‚Äù
The ‚Äúboys‚Äù stick together, and inform one another of things they‚Äôve seen. As soon as we see guards stopping three Toyotas with gasoline in the back, he calls several friends and warns them to keep watch. As we hear the call to prayer from a mosque, he asks to stop: ‚ÄúI try to never miss Friday prayers, especially the sermon.‚Äù In Qeshm, the population is predominantly Sunni Muslim.
Fishing is a main source of income across the Persian Gulf islands, but one that has always been associated with a more humble lifestyle. Driving around Qeshm, the fishing villages are always more simple than where smugglers, merchants, dhow constructors or mall-owners live. Regardless of occupation, the flow of outside investments disrupts quiet lives. Within Qeshm city, a long man-made beach was built in front of homes by the water, and turned into a road, despite objections from residents. ‚ÄúWe used to sit by the coast every afternoon and drink tea,‚Äù says a resident. ‚ÄúNow we can‚Äôt even let our kids outside for fear of the cars.‚Äù Arang Keshavarzian, professor of Middle Eastern and Islamic studies at New York University, writes: ‚ÄúIran‚Äôs free trade zones in the southern Gulf currently rest on a tacit alliance between state officials, members of the military, and cross-border traders, a coalition that is not conducive to economic growth, egalitarian re-distribution of resources, or democratisation.‚Äù Corruption is a word one hears everywhere on the islands. In 2013, the newly appointed head of Qeshm free trade zone spoke of ‚Äúa vast loose financial mafia‚Äù that had been ‚Äúlooting the island‚Äôs riches en masse.‚Äù A large incomplete building that was to be the headquarters of the Heritage Organisation sits in ruins near Holor village, half built because the head of the project disappeared with the budget, neighbours allege.
Qeshm airport was bulldozed in a plan for a multimillion dollar development project with hotels, theme parks and a vast shopping mall called Golden City. While a new airport has opened 60km from the city, Golden City remains unbuilt with long walls surrounding the land. Two cab drivers and two shop owners and a local resident all echo one another. ‚ÄúIt was bought off by Ahmadinejad cronies for less than 30,000 tomans [¬£6.70, $10.50] a square metre,‚Äù says one. ‚ÄúThey tore down an airport, just like that.‚Äù The far smaller island of Hormuz is facing tough economic times. While Oman and Iran again harbour closer diplomatically, Khasab remains shut tight to Iranians. Unemployment is rampant on Hormuz and I notice drug addicts in the street, a rare sight in Qeshm. There are also almost no cars. ‚ÄúOnly a few dozen people own them here,‚Äù says Ali. The island has only one small medical clinic, where a general practitioner works a few hours each day. The sick and pregnant must travel by boat to Bandar Abbas to see specialists. ‚ÄúMost people these days get by through fishing, but there‚Äôs less of that than there used to be, or driving around tourists but that‚Äôs only in the winter and early spring - then it gets too hot,‚Äù Ali tells me. ‚ÄúIn the summer, we just hang out indoors all day and spend from our pockets [what has been made in busier times]. If you haven‚Äôt earned enough, you‚Äôre in trouble.‚Äù Hormuz has been trying to get in on the riches of the free trade zone, Ali says, but each time the plan has gone awry. Most recently, in February 2015 Ali Larijani, speaker of the Iranian parliament, announced that adding Hormuz island to the free trade zone was under consideration in parliament. The promise alone made real estate prices skyrocket. ‚ÄúI bought 100 square metres of land by the Persian Gulf ten years ago,‚Äù says Ali. ‚ÄúBack then, it was 30,000 tomans a metre ($10.50 or ¬£6.70 at today‚Äôs exchange rate). Now, it‚Äôs more than 400,000. I wish I‚Äôd bought more.‚Äù Each time there is news of Hormuz joining the zone, says Ali, businessmen from Tehran and Isfahan come and buy land. Still, 400,000 tomans (¬£ 90, $140) is cheap compared to prices in Tehran, where a typical house or apartment in downtown sells for at 9m tomans (¬£2,014; $2,700) a sq m, or the northern regions by the sea, where development land costs 1 to 3m tomans. The house Ali has built by the water is humble, made of cement with no facade. But it is located by luscious beaches. There are no guarantees that such scenic landscapes will remain unscathed if business starts to thrive on the island.
Hormuz is best known for its ochre, a red-coloured earth pigment that has made miles of this land look majestic. Traditionally, the ochre was used in everything from decorative arts to wedding ceremonies and even as a spice for fish and torshi (pickled vegetables). Now the ochre is transported by the truckload and exported. Out in the countryside among the multicoloured mountains, the dirt of tractors and trucks belonging to the mining facility can be seen from miles, razing the land, and emptying dirt into the nearby water. The ochre is mined by a company whose primary shareholder and owner is best known as an outspoken government critic following the June 2009 protests. But residents here care little for such things, or for his denial that he owns the bulk of the company. They call him the ‚Äúearth thief.‚Äù Unlike those on Qeshm, Hormuz island inhabitants are in no way wealthy, and so it will be capital brought from outside the island that will dictate the rules. As I walk on the island‚Äôs beaches ‚Äì possibly the most serene and untouched in the world ‚Äì I cannot help but wonder what this place will look like once the townspeople get their wish and resorts are built nearby.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-05-26T01:22:52Z,world,World news,Cambodia's new bomb divers aim to make its rivers safe,"It was on an unrelentingly hot day last week when Sok Chenda dived into the Mekong river and helped change how Cambodia deals with a deadly chapter from its history. He slipped into the warm water, adjusted his mask and scuba gear, steadied his breathing and slowly began his descent several meters below, where the river water gradually turns from pale to thick, acidic yellow. Down there, in a lonely world of swirling sediment and the sound of one‚Äôs own breathing, Chenda was feeling for something in the cloudiness. And then he saw it: a live, 500lb (225kg) Mark 82 aircraft bomb that had wedged itself in the riverbed, still in the same position 40 years after it had fallen. Working meticulously and methodically Chenda carefully fixed a cable to the metal carcass connecting the bomb to an inflatable lift bag. The bomb was pulled free and towed to land where it was then driven to a desolate field and sawed into three parts by a remote-controlled machine. The explosive matter was then set alight. The Mark 82 was a relic from the 1960s and 70s, when Cambodia was pounded by an estimated 2.7m tonnes of ordnance dropped mostly from American planes as the war in Vietnam spilled over the border. Had it met its target all those years ago it would have probably blown a vast hole in Cambodian soil where at least 2000sq km of land remain contaminated and possibly several thousand tonnes of munitions are still under water.
Even today unexploded mines and bombs kill hundreds across the country ‚Äì indeed before now, this bomb‚Äôs extraction would have been near impossible: Cambodia‚Äôs de-mining operations are focused primarily on land clearance and have simply lacked the technical skills to handle such salvage. However, Chenda and his colleagues from the Cambodian mine action centre (CMAC), endured two years of gruelling army-style training to get to this turning point in the country‚Äôs efforts in UXO clearance, becoming part of the first team to safely salvage a deadly remnant from one of the country‚Äôs main waterways. The feat was nothing short of remarkable, not least because it came just two years after they learned how to swim, then scuba dive, then hone the composure to clear bombs in such an unusual environment using only their sense of touch. ‚ÄúWe looked at people who were learning fast,‚Äù said Allen Tan, country director of the Golden West Humanitarian Foundation, which works on mine and UXO clearance and provided training for the team with funds from the US State Department. ‚ÄúForty candidates had to learn how to swim and scuba dive safely in 30 days,‚Äù said Tan. ‚ÄúThat is quite a learning curve and it was intense ... But the number one thing was: did they have heart? ‚ÄúTo make it in this you have to have very good resolve. You have to want it so bad to be able to make it through and be willing to really push yourself.‚Äù Some failed, some simply dropped out. Two candidates were failed just two days before graduation, ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs that serious‚Äù, Tan said. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be their friend, because they could die. You have to take people on merit solely. We assign them numbers; we didn‚Äôt know their names and we didn‚Äôt want to know.‚Äù In the end, he said the 10 graduates ‚Äì one has since left the team ‚Äì spent the next two years in further training and developed the skills and modesty needed to work in such a ‚Äúmentally tough environment‚Äù. Chenda, who spent 16 years clearing explosive ordnance on land, said he was happy to have changed direction, despite the intensity of the training.
‚ÄúIt was difficult to see ‚Äì we could not see,‚Äù he told the Guardian of his dive. ‚ÄúBut I was not scared. I was focused.‚Äù Mike Nisi, Golden West‚Äôs chief of underwater operations, said the procedure was ‚Äútextbook‚Äù in its execution. As well as the vast number of bombs dropped aerially, it is estimated that up to 300 weapons supply boats from South Vietnam were sunk by Khmer Rouge forces to stop them from reaching the US-backed Lon Nol army in Phnom Penh. Like so many other remnants of conflict, the bomb that Chenda brought to the surface may well have stayed unnoticed in the thick river mud, its fins protruding at a sideways angle, had it not caught on the net of a 42-year-old fisherman, Yor Dieb, last month. Dieb, who has fished these waters in a tranquil part of Kandal province for the past 20 years, knew the significance of his snagged net only when he dived in to liberate it by hand. ‚ÄúI was scared,‚Äù he said, not least because it is the second bomb he has caught his net on in 10 years in this stretch of water, across which boats also ferry people. According to the most recent report issued by the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority, 64,496 casualties have been recorded since 1979 and February 2015. Of these, 19,708 people were killed, 35,822 people injured and 8,965 people had to undergo amputations. CMAC is now able to turn its attention to remnants found underwater, as well as to the approximately 20,000 calls it receives every year from the public who come across suspicious-looking devices. ‚ÄúWe have found a number of cases where people have been wounded or killed by munitions under the water, even mines, when people use the traditional bamboo tools to catch catfish ‚Ä¶ and when they come to pick up those tools, they blow up,‚Äù CMAC‚Äôs director-general, Heng Ratana, said. For Dieb, the fisherman, the need for more focus on making riverbank communities safe from ordnance is important. ‚ÄúFishermen are so scared about finding more bombs,‚Äù he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
