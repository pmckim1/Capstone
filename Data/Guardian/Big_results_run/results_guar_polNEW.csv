2021-03-03T20:05:46Z,politics,Politics,What impact is the Salmond saga having on the drive for independence?,"With the Scottish parliament elections only eight weeks away, the immediate political cost of the Salmond saga to the party he led for over two decades may be evident soon enough. There has been much commentary about whether this crisis is cutting through to voters. Nicola Sturgeon enjoys a high approval rating, largely because of her perceived competence in handling coronavirus, and the public are understandably focused on more pressing concerns related to the pandemic. But party insiders accept it is inevitable that these high-profile evidence sessions will have a greater impact on the public consciousness than earlier, more technical, committee sessions.
The SNP hopes to win a majority on 6 May so it can argue it has a clear mandate to pursue a second independence referendum with Westminster. But recent polling shows that – while an SNP victory is still highly likely – there has been a dip in support for the party and for independence. Last Sunday, a Survation poll for the Sunday Mail recorded a 50-50 split – excluding don’t knows – on independence, the first time in 22 consecutive polls that the yes side has not had a lead. A week before that, research conducted by Ipsos Mori for STV found the SNP three points down compared with November, but still with 52% are likely to vote for the Nationalists in the constituency vote in May’s election, while 23% indicated they will vote for the Scottish Conservatives and 15% for Scottish Labour. Both Labour and the Tories have gained a single point over the last three months. Asking about the impact of the Salmond inquiry on voters’ perceptions of the SNP, the Ipsos Mori study found that more than one-third (36%) said the inquiry had made them less favourable towards the party, but most (58%) said the episode had not altered their view. Some observers suggest it is the advent of the vaccine – which voters may perceive as concrete evidence of the benefits of remaining in the union - that has had more impact on support for independence. Polling undertaken last month by YouGov of SNP voters found that they strongly take Sturgeon’s side, with 49% believing she has generally been telling the truth, and only 13% believing she has not. These numbers are reversed for Salmond: only 14% think the former first minister has generally told the truth, while 42% disagree."
2021-03-03T19:41:44Z,politics,Politics,Dishi Rishi the influencer falls flat in his big budget moment,"Not so much a chancellor, more a lifestyle coach. When Rishi Sunak gave his first budget just a year ago, he was the ingenue stand-in for Sajid Javid who had had a major strop. Now he is a brand – complete with his own range of merchandise. The ath-leisure hoody. The fragrance “Dishi par Rishi”. The conscious coupling to produce his own scented candle with Gwyneth’s Goop. But what works well on social media doesn’t translate quite so well to the House of Commons. Because, having spent much of the previous week leaking his entire budget to the media and making six-minute Twitter videos, Sunak’s second budget – if you don’t count the eight emergency ones in between – felt rather flat. The best part of an hour in which the chancellor told us almost nothing we didn’t already know. Lights, camera, action. Sunak had tried to lift himself for his speech after he was called to the dispatch box. But whether it was the absence of the mournful solo piano during the sad bits that had moved him to tears in his video, or just that it all now felt a bit stale, he couldn’t quite land his budget with the panache he had hoped. The words came out as planned but his eyes were curiously detached. As if, for a moment he had seen through his constructed persona of the leader in waiting and found himself wanting. The worry that, deep down, he might just be another fake. A huckster who had kidded himself he could do a near impossible job. “That which we are, we are,” as he would later randomly quote Tennyson. Sunak had started by saying he was going to be honest with the country. Unlike some prime ministers he could think of. Though not honest enough to ever slip in the fact that the Office for Budget Responsibility had predicted that Brexit would lower productivity by 4%. In fact he didn’t get round to mentioning Brexit at all. Maybe it just slipped his mind. Nor was he entirely honest with announcement of the locations of the eight supposedly game-changing tax havens, aka freeports, because he had rather forgotten that we had previously had seven freeports up until 2012 while we were still in the EU. No one could have done more to support the country during the pandemic than him, he said. There was a lot of use of the word “I” in his budget statement and very little “we” . It’s amazing how quickly a politician can morph from a team player into a diva. And Rishi was going to carry on showing how much he loved the country by extending the furlough scheme and the rise in universal credit until September. But once the pandemic was over and the UK was on the road to recovery, then there would be some hard decisions to take. Though not immediately. Rather the cost of the bailout would have to be paid for in delayed tax rises. A freeze on income tax thresholds and a postponed rise in corporation tax to 25%. There were no gags, small mercies. The chancellor has enough nous to realise his main attraction is as “the thinking person’s nerd”. He concluded with some words about super-deductions – everyone nodded along, though they didn’t have a clue what he was on about – investment in some red-wall seats, and the green economy making Britain great again, before sitting down to a few half-hearted cheers from Tory backbenchers. It would take some of them a while to work out that they had just been applauding a budget that had trashed the past 10 years of Conservative economic policy and was closer to something that John McDonnell might have given the previous year than anything in the Tory manifesto. Replying to a budget speech is generally a thankless task, but Keir Starmer had an easier time of it than most as almost all of it had been in the public domain for several days. His critique focused mainly on public sector pay freezes, the failure to act more swiftly to lockdown earlier in the pandemic, the absence of anything on social care and Brexit and the temporary nature of the uplift to universal credit. Sunak pretended not to hear and spent most of the time checking his texts – “You were fab, Gwynnie xxx” – and social media feed on his phone. When you’re as big an influencer as Rishi, it’s one of the few ways you can be sure you’re alive. That, along with a can of Mexican cola and a Star Wars lightsaber. The fix proved short-lived. If Rishi had hoped that by being the first chancellor to give a press conference on the evening of his budget speech, he was going reinforce his credibility as the on-trend new-age economics guru, then he was in for a big disappointment. Because it was as if he couldn’t quite believe his budget wasn’t getting the endorsements he craved. Whereas in the Commons he had at least managed to sound like a grown-up as he delivered his speech, in his Downing Street briefing he sounded like a narked and patronising senior school prefect. As if the reason people were unreceptive to what he had to say was because they were too stupid to understand it, rather than there being any holes in his thinking. “I want to be honest with you,” he said, sounding tetchy and deflated, before going on to tell some of the same untruths as before. Nothing on Brexit, nothing on any future costs of the pandemic, cagey on tax and pretending to be amazed that the vast majority of new money was going to Tory-held seats in the Midlands and the north. This was Rishi laid bare. The man-child who didn’t have all the answers and couldn’t bear to be openly cross examined. To think that Matt Hancock aspires to this level of fame. Sunak wrapped up the presser as fast as decently possible. A day that had promised so much – in his own imagination at least – had turned to dust in a matter of hours. The Peloton exercise bike was in for one hell of a pounding when he got home."
2021-03-03T19:12:21Z,politics,Politics,Nicola Sturgeon: government made ‘catastrophic’ error in Salmond inquiry,"Nicola Sturgeon has rejected the “absurd” allegation the Scottish government plotted to destroy Alex Salmond’s reputation but admitted it made serious mistakes in its investigation into complaints against him. The first minister said her government made a “dreadful, catastrophic mistake” during its inquiry into two sexual harassment complaints against Salmond by appointing an official who had previously spoken to the complainers as its investigation officer. That decision led to the government losing a judicial review taken by Salmond, costing taxpayers more than £600,000. “Two women were failed and taxpayers’ money was lost,” she said. “I deeply regret that.” Closely questioned by MSPs during a marathon eight-hour evidence session at the Scottish parliament, Sturgeon insisted her former mentor was wrong to accuse her, the Scottish National party or her officials of a vendetta or conspiracy against him. “I must rebut the absurd suggestion that anyone acted with malice or as part of a plot against Alex Salmond,” she said in her opening statement to nine MSPs investigating the government’s botched inquiry into the harassment allegations against Salmond, which he had denied. She later went further: “Alex Salmond has been for most of my political life, since I was 20, 21 years of age, my closest colleague. He was someone I looked up to, someone I revered. I would never have wanted to ‘get’ Alex Salmond.” Sturgeon came under pressure from MSPs to explain why there had been repeated delays in the release of the government’s legal advice, and key internal documents, as she offered new explanations about why she had met Salmond while the harassment inquiry was under way. Jackie Baillie, of Labour, alleged Sturgeon and Salmond had breached the confidentiality of complainers when he discussed their allegations against him in a meeting at her home on 2 April 2018, yet Sturgeon waited until early July before telling Leslie Evans, the permanent secretary, they had met. Sturgeon acknowledged she discussed Salmond’s criticisms of the inquiry with him five times partly because she felt loyalty towards him, but delayed telling Evans because she feared that would be seen as her interfering in the process. Labour and Conservative MSPs accused Sturgeon’s deputy first minister, John Swinney, of breaking the government’s promises to publish all its legal advice, despite his last-minute decision to release previously secret legal papers late on Tuesday afternoon. Several weeks of legal meetings were missing from the records Swinney released; Sturgeon promised more papers would be supplied. Those papers contained the explosive revelation that Roddy Dunlop QC, one of Scotland’s leading lawyers, who was the government’s external counsel, had been furious that government officials failed to disclose critical evidence about the prior contact of the investigating officer with the two complainants. Sturgeon told the committee she only learned of this apparent conflict of interest and its legal significance in November 2018. In a parallel development, the Tories said they were reconsidering their votes of no confidence against Swinney and Sturgeon, due to be heard on Thursday, after Swinney offered to release more legal information. The party said the motions were still live, but indicated they might be withdrawn. Sturgeon was pressed on whether she had investigated allegations that a senior government official had leaked the name of a complainer to Geoff Aberdein, Salmond’s former chief of staff, before Sturgeon met Aberdein in her office at Holyrood in late March 2018. Aberdein’s account was supported by Salmond’s lawyer Duncan Hamilton and his former spokesman Kevin Pringle, who told the committee on Tuesday Aberdein had made that claim in a conference call with him soon after he met that official. The Tory MSP Murdo Fraser said that was “an incredibly serious issue” and potentially unlawful. Sturgeon said Aberdein’s account had been denied by the official concerned but she said the allegation was included in an investigation by James Hamilton, Ireland’s former director of public prosecutions, into whether Sturgeon had broken the ministerial code. “That was not the way, as I understand it, that happened, in the way that is being set out,” she said. During a series of tense exchanges, Sturgeon said she had no idea who leaked news that the internal inquiry had upheld the complaints against Salmond to the Record newspaper in August 2018, despite his allegations a government figure must be to blame. “There was no part of me that wanted for this proactively to get into the public domain,” she said. The idea she would ever need to discuss this publicly made her feel “physically sick”. She also admitted that before she met Salmond at her home in April 2018, she “had a lingering fear, suspicion, concern” that allegations about his conduct might emerge. She knew Sky News had contacted the government in early November 2017 about alleged incidents involving Salmond at Edinburgh airport a decade earlier – claims Salmond denied – and had discussed them with him that month. Answering Salmond’s charges that she offered to intervene on his behalf in the government inquiry, Sturgeon said Salmond might have misunderstood what she said to him. Her written evidence said she had made clear to him she would not intervene, but Duncan Hamilton, who was present when Sturgeon met Salmond in her house on 2 April, told the committee in written evidence on Tuesday that he had heard her offer to do so “if it comes to it”.
Sturgeon said Salmond may have misunderstood. “I believe I made it clear I wouldn’t intervene. [I] was perhaps trying to let a longstanding friend and colleague down gently, and maybe I did it too gently, and maybe he left with an impression I didn’t mean to give him.” The first minister said once Salmond had set out the allegations he was facing “my head was spinning. I was experiencing a maelstrom of emotions.” Sturgeon said the government had to investigate the allegations against Salmond, regardless of how powerful or famous he might be. She said many people, including her, had been let down by her former friend and mentor but he had not yet apologised. “When I saw him lashing out on Friday, I don’t know whether he ever reflects on the fact that many of us feel let down by him,” she said. “That is a matter of deep personal regret.”"
2021-03-03T19:07:19Z,politics,Politics,Budget: Rishi Sunak finds inspiration in Tennyson’s Ulysses poem,"Rishi Sunak’s budget speech was unusually short on quips but sought inspiration from Tennyson’s Ulysses as he attempted to sum up the UK’s determination to face the future. “That which we are, we are,” the chancellor said as he reached the end of a statement which promised tax rises and continued emergency spending during the coronavirus pandemic. The quote was taken from the acclaimed last lines of the 19th-century poem which has been used by many to summon communal strength during times of adversity: “… that which we are, we are / One equal temper of heroic hearts, / Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will / To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.”
The lines are often associated with one of Britain’s heroic failures: they are inscribed on a cross in Antarctica to commemorate the explorer Robert Scott and his party, who died on their return trek from the south pole in 1912. Last year’s statement, before the horrors of the pandemic were fully appreciated, established Sunak’s reputation as a fluent orator before a crammed House of Commons. He had been in the post for a matter of weeks after Sajid Javid’s unexpected resignation. Following in the footsteps of many chancellors, he delivered jokes at the expense of his then Labour shadow. “There will be no VAT on historical fiction by Hilary Mantel, manuals or textbooks like Gray’s Anatomy or, indeed, works of fantasy … like John McDonnell’s Economics for the Many,” he said to backbench laughter. Wednesday’s statement, also delivered with élan and control, was to a socially distanced and masked parliament. It followed a year that saw more than 120,000 deaths from Covid-19 and with the UK facing a deeper recession than many similar economies. Under these circumstances, Sunak reached for steely resolve and what he described as an attempt to level with the public. He repeated the word “honest” six times. “The fundamentals of our character as a people have not changed. Still determined. Still generous. Still fair. That’s what got us through the last year; it’s what will guide us through the next decade and beyond,” he told MPs. More serious than the absence of jokes, critics said, was the lack of extra money for social care, childcare or public sector workers, or even a passing mention of Brexit."
2021-03-03T18:41:53Z,politics,Politics,Budget 2021: Sunak holds briefing after flagging tax rises to pay for Covid recovery - as it happened,"Rishi Sunak has outlined tax rises on companies and workers to pay for an additional Â£65bn of financial support to see Britain through the coronavirus pandemic, taking total government spending on the crisis to more than Â£400bn. Keir Starmer has signalled that Labour will back plans to increase corporation tax from 2023, reiterating the partyâ€™s opposition to immediate tax rises, which has caused a backlash from the left. Labour has claimed that Rishi Sunak is prioritising Tory areas for money from the levelling up fund. In a news release the party says: The governmentâ€™s new flagship levelling up fund will prioritise the chancellorâ€™s own local authority, where houses are currently on sale for Â£2.5m, for regeneration funding ahead of more deprived areas, according to Labour Research. The chancellorâ€™s own local authority of Richmondshire, as well as the constituencies of four other members of the cabinet, are prioritised to bid for levelling up funding. Newark and Sherwood, Pembrokeshire, Dumfries and Galloway and Great Yarmouth local authorities, which include the constituencies of the chancellor, the communities secretary Robert Jenrick, Welsh secretary Simon Hart, Scottish secretary Allister Jack and Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis respectively, were all included in the first tier of eligibility for priority funding, under plans announced by the chancellor at the budget. Their areas were selected for funding ahead of authorities such as Barnsley, Flintshire, Coventry, Plymouth, Salford and the Wirral, all of which were included in the second tier for priority funding. At his press conference Sunak was asked about this by the FTâ€™s George Parker, who suggested the chancellor was engaged in â€œnaked pork barrel politicsâ€�. Sunak said any area could bid for money from the levelling up fund. He said the areas getting priority funding were getting â€œcapacity fundingâ€� to help them put together a bid. He said this list was based on an index of economic need that had been published. A lack of support for care homes, the NHS and people on benefits led to claims that Rishi Sunakâ€™s budget had left the countryâ€™s most vulnerable people â€œbetrayedâ€�. The chancellor promised a â€œreal commitment to green growthâ€� in his budget, though environmentalists expressed concern about a lack of detail over how that might be achieved. The chancellorâ€™s budget was cautiously welcomed by the culture sector but industry figures said it lacks detail in key areas and does not do enough to support those who have missed out on government support, such as freelancers. Thalidomide campaigners have reacted with relief and joy after the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, pledged a â€œlifetime commitmentâ€� of funding to support survivors of the scandal."
2021-03-03T17:46:18Z,politics,Politics,Nicola Sturgeon: difference between Salmond and me is I never claimed to be infallible - as it happened ,"Well that was around seven hours of evidence. I’ve done my best to summarise it here. Thanks for following the blog today: Sturgeon said that the legal advice published last night shows that the government did have a stateable case and so it was right to continue with the judicial review. Critics have said it proves the opposite but this was rejected by the first minister who said lawyers are always cautious and they were not advocating abandoning the government’s defence. Sturgeon denied that one of her officials gave the name of one of the complainers against Alex Salmond to one of his aides. Confronted by statements which claimed this happened, she told the committee that that was not what the official had told her; “It did not happen in the way that has been described.” The first minister said one of the names was known by Salmond because he had previously apologised to her and he had identified another by looking through the Scottish government’s Flickr account. She defended telling parliament that she first became aware of the allegations against Salmond at a meeting with her predecessor on 2 April 2018. Sturgeon has been accused of misleading parliament because she had a discussion with Salmond’s former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein, on 29 March, and knew Sky News had made inquiries in November 2017 about alleged incidents involving Salmond. Sturgeon said the 2 April meeting was the first time she knew about the specific allegations having been shown a letter by Salmond and this may have “obliterated” her memory of the meeting a few days earlier with Aberdein. Sturgeon told the committee she met Salmond initially because she was told he was distressed and thought he was thinking of resigning and continued to do so out of a sense of “loyalty”. She said she did have doubts as to whether she should have had her final meeting with him on 14 July 2018. The first minister said she never had any intention to intervene in the matter because it would be seen as using her power on Salmond’s behalf and “deeply inappropriate”. She said, because of their past relationship and the nature of the meeting, she may have let Salmond down “too gently” when he wanted her to intervene, giving the false impression to him that she had agreed to do so. Sturgeon claimed she delayed telling civil servants about her meetings with Salmond because she feared it would compromise the independence and confidentiality of the investigation into him. She said she only reported the meetings when it became apparent he was seriously considering legal action against the government. Sturgeon said it was up to James Hamilton, the independent adviser investigating whether she breached the ministerial code, to decided whether she should have reported the meetings earlier. The first minister said there was “zero evidence” of a plot against Salmond. She claimed that messages used to support this allegation had been taken out of context and the allegation was “a million miles” from what was actually happening."
2021-03-03T15:39:46Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak to create new economic hubs in Darlington and Leeds,"Rishi Sunak has announced two new economic hubs will open in northern England – a move that will be seen as an attempt by the Conservatives to strengthen support outside their traditional heartlands. A Treasury campus will be set up in Darlington and a national infrastructure bank will be situated in Leeds, the chancellor confirmed in his budget speech. Several other locations including Bradford and Newcastle upon Tyne were said to have been under consideration in the plan to move Westminster-based civil servants north. Sunak announced plans for another Treasury headquarters in last year’s budget but after an extensive scoping exercise, revealed on Wednesday that Darlington in Tees Valley would be the location. In a video message to all staff seen by the Guardian, the chancellor said he was “really excited for what this” would mean for “all of you and us”, adding that the decision followed “a lot of thought and energy”.
In Leeds, Sunak promised the infrastructure bank would be up and running “in an interim form” by spring. Its role will be to dole out £13bn of equity and debt capital, and issuing up to £10bn of guarantees, as well as offering loans to local authorities from the summer. “Redrawing our economic map means rebalancing our economic investment,” said Sunak, who is also MP for Richmond in Yorkshire. Details about how many civil servants could be relocated to Darlington and how many jobs could be created in the region have yet to be clarified, but the government already plans to move 22,000 civil servants out of London by 2030. The policy mirrors a pledge in Labour’s 2019 manifesto when the then shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, pledged to “break up No 11” and move it “to the north”. Sunak is likely to use the announcement to underline the government’s commitment to “levelling up” – a key plank of the Conservatives’ manifesto. Ministers have been trying to find ways to hold on to the raft of so-called “red wall” seats in northern England won from Labour by the 2019 intake of Tory MPs who are keener on higher levels of public spending.
Sunak has said previously: “We are absolutely committed to levelling up opportunities so those living in all corners of the UK get their fair share of our future prosperity.” In autumn the Northern Policy Foundation, a Manchester-based thinktank founded by Conservative MPs, recommended Leeds for the new Treasury northern headquarters. Tom Lees, director of the foundation said, said on Wednesday that while Darlington was not their top choice, “it did come in the top 20% of possible locations in the north”. He added that the move should “help tackle groupthink, boost local growth and create opportunities in areas that have sometimes been overlooked and forgotten”. Darlington is close to some former red wall seats including Tony Blair’s former constituency of Sedgefield, as well as Bishop Auckland and North West Durham. Sarah Nickson, a senior researcher at the Institute for Government thinktank working on civil service changes, said when the Office for National Statistics shifted its headquarters from London to Newport in south Wales, 90% of London-based staff decided to stay in the capital and find other jobs. This, she said, resulted in disruption that continued to hamper the organisation’s work for a decade. Nickson said putting the Treasury HQ and infrastructure bank in different locations was a missed opportunity because “generalist” in the civil service liked to move between roles and departments, so “providing these opportunities in a single place” would have helped “persuade ambitious civil servants that shifting to Darlington is a bet worth taking”."
2021-03-03T14:35:43Z,politics,Politics,Sturgeon: claimed leak to Salmond has ‘alternative explanation’,"Nicola Sturgeon has said there is an “alternative explanation” to claims that her officials gave the name of a woman who had lodged a sexual harassment complaint about Alex Salmond to his former chief of staff in a significant breach of confidence. As she gave evidence to the inquiry into her government’s handling of the complaints on Wednesday morning, the former first minister’s office confirmed he has lodged a formal complaint with the Scottish government’s most senior civil servant, Leslie Evans, about the official who has been accused of – and has denied – disclosing the name of the complainer. Sturgeon is under intense pressure to answer multiple allegations that she misled parliament, after previously secret legal advice and new witness evidence released on Tuesday evening led to calls for her resignation as first minister. During four hours of evidence on Wednesday morning, Sturgeon was asked about a letter from Salmond’s lawyer, Duncan Hamilton, which stated that Salmond’s former aide Geoff Aberdein had told him in early March 2018 that the name of a complainer against Salmond had been leaked to him by one of her senior officials. This account of events was reiterated by Kevin Pringle, formerly a special adviser when Salmond was first minister. Sturgeon told MSPs: “It did not happen in the way that has been described.” Asked by the Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser who could corroborate the different version of events suggested by her senior official, Sturgeon replied: “It would be serious if the identity of a complainer was revealed, but that is not what I understand happened in the way it is being set out.” In an earlier response, she said she did not accept as fact that it had happened, and that she believed there was an “alternative explanation”. She added that, when she met Salmond at her home on 2 April 2018 – when she said she first became aware of the substance of the allegations – he knew the identity of one complainer because he had previously apologised to her for his behaviour towards her, and he had done his own investigations to find out the name of the other woman. She added that she did not recall Salmond “giving the impression he knew the identity because someone in the Scottish government told him”. Describing Salmond as “one of the closest people to me in my entire life”, she continued to deny that there was any plot against him. Salmond has alleged that there was a “malicious plan” by government and party officials close to Sturgeon, including her husband, Peter Murrell, who is the chief executive of the SNP, to destroy his reputation. She was later questioned by the Scottish Liberal Democrat committee member Alex Cole-Hamilton about when she knew about the allegations against Salmond. This is one of the key charges levelled against her by her former mentor. Salmond, supported by two other witnesses, claims she was told about them by Aberdein in her office on 29 March 2018. Sturgeon previously told Holyrood and the media she first learned of them from Salmond himself, at their meeting at her home on 2 April. She told Cole-Hamilton that she had had a “lingering suspicion” about Salmond since Sky News inquiry in November 2017 relating to his alleged behaviour at Edinburgh airport. “Ahead of 2 April I had an awareness there was a complaint, no doubt I had suspicions about what the nature of that might be, but that is what it was, a general awareness, a suspicion, that no doubt I had all sorts of theories for in my head.” At that meeting, she said, Salmond asked her to read a letter he had been sent by Evans, which detailed the accusations. “But it was reading the permanent secretary’s letter, that he showed me on 2 April, that gave me the knowledge and the detail behind that knowledge.” She was then asked by the independent MSP Andy Wightman about further evidence from Hamilton that Sturgeon had assured Salmond at that meeting that she would intervene in the inquiry on his behalf, telling him: “If it comes to it, I will.” Sturgeon told MSPs: “I believe I did make it clear that I would not intervene. I also know I was trying to let a longstanding friend and colleague down gently and maybe I did it too gently and he left with an impression I did not mean to give.” She insisted: “I had no intention of intervening and crucially I did not intervene.”"
2021-03-03T06:00:10Z,politics,Politics,Sturgeon to give evidence to Holyrood on Salmond inquiry amid calls to resign,"Nicola Sturgeon is under intense pressure to answer multiple allegations that she misled parliament, levelled by her former mentor Alex Salmond, after previously secret legal advice and new witness evidence led to calls for her resignation as first minister. Sturgeon will give evidence on Wednesday morning to a cross-party committee set up to investigate the Scottish government’s internal inquiry in 2018 into sexual harassment complaints against Salmond. Scotland’s first minister will face scrutiny about why her government continued its defence in the judicial review that Salmond launched in August 2018 to investigate its handling of the harassment claims, despite its own lawyers advising that it was likely to lose.
The confidential legal advice was finally released to the inquiry committee on Tuesday night, after repeated refusals by the Scottish government to publish it. In a letter to a Holyrood committee, also put out on Tuesday evening, one of Salmond’s lawyers, Duncan Hamilton, backed up the former first minister’s claim that Sturgeon had offered to intervene in the initial investigation on Salmond’s behalf in a private meeting at her home on 2 April 2018. Hamilton also stated that one of Salmond’s former aides, Geoff Aberdein, had told him in early March 2018 that the name of a complainer against Salmond had been leaked to him. This account of events was reiterated by Kevin Pringle, formerly a special adviser when Salmond was first minister. Both Hamilton and Pringle also endorsed Salmond’s claim to the committee last Friday that a meeting had been arranged between Sturgeon and Aberdein for 29 March 2018 in her Holyrood office, with the express purpose of setting up the meeting at her home four days later. Sturgeon, who is expected to testify on oath from 9am, has repeatedly said she will relish the chance to address in detail the allegations made by her former mentor. The first minister has denied breaching the ministerial code and has also dismissed Salmond’s claims that people close to her - including her husband Peter Murrell, the chief executive of the SNP - had plotted against him as untrue. Last week she accused Salmond of “creating an alternative reality in which the organs of the state [were] all part of some wild conspiracy against him” in order to deflect questions about his own past conduct. During her coronavirus briefing last Wednesday, Sturgeon referred to Salmond’s trial in March 2020, which ended in his acquittal of 14 charges of sexual assault, including one attempted rape, involving 10 women. The motives of those women who accused him were now being “maligned [and] have been accused of being liars and conspiracists”, she said."
2021-03-02T23:58:55Z,politics,Politics,Tory London mayor hopeful says basic income would be used for 'lots of drugs',"The Conservative candidate for London mayor, Shaun Bailey, has been criticised for arguing people paid a universal basic income (UBI) would blow the money on “lots of drugs”. Liberal Democrats and Green party on the London Assembly have been pushing for a trial of the UBI scheme, in which the state would grant all citizens a set sum of money on a regular basis, regardless of economic status. However, speaking to the Assembly’s economy committee on Tuesday, Bailey said the idea needed to take “human condition” into account. He said: “I’ve been a youth worker for over 20 years. I know some people would absolutely fly if you gave them a lump sum to deal with every week. I know some people who would buy lots of drugs. So where is the care in this, where is the care for the person? How do you get past just universally giving people money?” Bailey also questioned whether it could “drive prices up for basic goods when we know people could just buy them because the money’s there”. He added he was “concerned about work incentive” and a UBI was not clearly defined. Also in the hearing was Simon Duffy, the founder of the Centre for Welfare Reform thinktank, who told Bailey it was an “extraordinary claim”. He said: “I’m sure the people spending most of the money are not the poor – they’re the well-off. It’s your City traders and their cocaine habits. Where’s the love for them?” The Labour MP Wes Streeting said Bailey’s comments had “shown his utter contempt for hard-pressed families”. He said: “He has proven once again that he does not share London’s values.” The comments are the latest in a series of controversial remarks by the Tory candidate that have made headlines during the campaign. Last week, he was criticised for an interview with the Sun in which he said teenage mothers pushed people who “do the right thing” down the housing ladder. He has also suggested that homeless Londoners could save up a £5,000 deposit for a mortgage. Labour has called for the Crown Prosecution Service to investigate his publication of leaflets headed with fake City Hall insignia, accusing them of employing a “fraudulent device” to gain undue influence, as described by the 1983 Representation of the People Act. Bailey, trailing in the polls, is preparing to face the incumbent London mayor, Sadiq Khan, in leadership elections on 6 May. Khan has previously expressed that the UK should explore ideas like UBI, saying last year that it “is gaining support around the world and would ensure everybody can at least survive.” A spokesperson for Bailey’s campaign said: “Shaun Bailey has over twenty years of experience as a youth worker. He’s been homeless and he’s been out of work. So Shaun won’t take any lectures from career politicians on what life is like for those struggling to get on. “Instead of scoring political points, Shaun Bailey is focused on building a city where every resident in every community can thrive – and he’s using his two decades of experience as a youth worker to deliver a fresh start for London.”"
2021-03-02T22:00:04Z,politics,Politics,The UK economyâ€™s coronavirus crisis in five charts,"The UK economy is at a pivotal moment, as the chancellor gives his budget speech with businesses and workers under the most pressure since the pandemic struck a year ago. Here are five key charts that will underpin Rishi Sunak’s statement on Wednesday afternoon. The UK economy
After gross domestic product (GDP) shrank by 9.9% in 2020 – the worst performance since 1709 – the economy remains under pressure at the start of 2021 as the toughest lockdown since the start of the pandemic bites. However, official forecasts due on Wednesday from the Office for Budget Responsibility could paint a rosier picture, as progress administering the vaccine paves the way for a swift recovery later this year. The economy performed better than forecast in November as businesses learned to adapt, with GDP 7.8% below its pre-virus level at the end of 2020 compared with an estimate of 12%. The key remaining question is how long the economy will take to recover its pre-crisis peak, and the extent of any permanent damage. The OBR had previously pencilled in a 3% permanent hit from Covid by 2025. UK public finances
Official figures put the budget deficit – the gap between spending and income – at £271bn for the first 10 months of the financial year. With just two months of the 2020-21 financial year left to tally, the final sum is expected to be below the £394bn OBR estimate made last November. The national debt – the combined total of every deficit – has risen above £2tn, equivalent to more than 100% of GDP, and is expected to remain at about that level over the next five years. Sunak has said he wants to use the budget to “level with people” about the strain the public finances are under, widely seen as paving the way for tax rises or a renewed austerity drive. In November, the OBR said £27bn worth of tax rises or spending cuts would be necessary for day-to-day spending and receipts to be brought back into balance, but given the vast uncertainty over the economic outlook this remains unclear. Some economists say there may be no need for tax rises at all, while others warn efforts to cut the deficit too soon would worsen the situation by choking off growth. UK unemployment
Redundancies have risen at the fastest rate on record, driving up unemployment to 5.1% in the three months to the end of December – representing 1.74 million people. However, the impact on jobs has been cushioned by furlough and business support schemes, preventing a sharper increase to the 1980s levels forecast last spring. On its last estimates, the OBR pencilled in a peak of 7.5% in the middle of 2021 – 2.6 million people – up from about 4% before the pandemic struck. However, the forecast was made before tougher coronavirus restrictions were introduced. Furlough has also been pushed back to the end of April, and further extensions could delay worse job losses. Furlough
During the latest lockdown the number of furloughed workers in the UK has risen by 700,000 to reach 4.7 million, with young adults, women and those in hospitality the most likely to be away from their jobs. The figures suggest this lockdown is less severe than the first, when almost 9 million jobs were furloughed. More than 11 million jobs have been furloughed in total over the past year, at a cost of £54bn so far. Sunak is expected to announce an extension to the scheme until the end of September. Inequality
British households saved record amounts during the pandemic, due to the collapse in spending on travel, retail and leisure. The chief economist of the Bank of England, Andy Haldane, said this meant families were poised “like a coiled spring” to fuel a rapid return to economic growth with a multibillion-pound spending spree. The UK’s households savings ratio – a snapshot of savings as a proportion of disposable income – hit a record high of 27% in June last year. Between March and November, excess savings were estimated at £125bn, according to the Bank. Sunak has also expressed optimism that encouraging consumers to spend could drive the recovery. But this rise in average saving masks severe financial pain for lower-income households who are bearing the brunt of Covid job losses. It is mostly those in the top 40% saving money and it is unclear how much of that will be spent."
2021-03-02T21:49:56Z,politics,Politics,Timeline: what we know so far about Sturgeon and the Salmond inquiry,"Following a dramatic flurry of publications on Tuesday evening, more detail has emerged about when the Scottish government knew that its legal battle with Alex Salmond was likely to fail, when Nicola Sturgeon first learned of the original sexual harassment allegations against her predecessor as first minister, and whether she initially offered to intervene in the inquiry on his behalf. Here’s what we now know: 29 March 2018 Nicola Sturgeon meets Geoff Aberdein, Salmond’s former chief of staff, in her Holyrood office. She has since described the meeting as “fleeting”, saying she had forgotten about it. Salmond, Aberdein and now two other witnesses say the Scottish government’s inquiry into sexual harassment allegations against Salmond was discussed, four days earlier than Sturgeon said she knew about them, and that the name of one of the complainers was revealed to Aberdein. 2 April Sturgeon meets Salmond at her home. She originally told Holyrood and the media that this was when she first learned that he faced allegations of sexual misconduct. Salmond has alleged that Sturgeon left him “in no doubt” at that meeting that she was going to intervene in the complaints process, while Sturgeon had denied this. Salmond’s lawyer Duncan Hamilton has now repeated Salmond’s version of events to a Holyrood committee. 6 June Sturgeon has said that this is when she first told Leslie Evans, the permanent secretary, that she knew about the internal inquiry into the harassment claims and had been discussing it with Salmond. 29 August Salmond formally begins his judicial review of the Scottish government’s handling of sexual misconduct complaints against him. 31 October Roddy Dunlop QC, then senior counsel for the Scottish government, warns them that the revelation that a senior official had previously met and briefed the two complainers was “extremely concerning”. 6 December Evans is warned by Dunlop that Salmond’s legal challenge would “more likely than not succeed”, because of this conflict of interest involving the investigating officer. 31 December Evans decides to concede the judicial review. 8 January 2019 The court of session declares the inquiry unlawful on procedural grounds and “tainted with apparent bias”. Salmond is awarded £512,000 in legal costs. 24 January 2019 Salmond is charged with 14 sexual assault offences, including one of attempted rape. 23 March 2020 He is acquitted on all charges at the high court in Edinburgh."
2021-03-02T21:06:59Z,politics,Politics,Creating a charity to pay for PM's flat refurb would be 'an outrage',"Plans to set up a charity to cover the costs of the refurbishment of Boris Johnson’s flat which he shares with his fiancee Carrie Symonds have been challenged by a former chair of the standards watchdog and a former charity commissioner. Their comments have been made as lawyers within Downing Street try to establish whether the government can legitimately fund the prime minister’s flat through a charitable vehicle using cash from Tory donors. The scheme is thought to be based on one used by the White House to raise money for interior design and restyling the building, which is bankrolled by private donors. It comes amid reported concerns over the spiralling costs of the refurbishment of the flat over No 11 overseen by Johnson’s fiancee, Carrie Symonds. Sir Alistair Graham, a former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, questioned whether establishing a charity to fund the prime minister’s flat would be legal. “I’d be surprised if it was within the law to set up a charity and get tax benefits for the home of a public servant. “To do so there has to be wider public benefits for a group who are in charitable need. I am really not sure if the prime minister and his fiancee would qualify,” he told the Guardian. Any such arrangement would also raise questions over possible conflicts of interest, offering a potential backdoor way of providing a financial benefit to Johnson, Graham said. “It would be an outrage, if it was allowed,” he said. It is understood that the plan to establish a charity has been widely discussed across Downing Street and with senior civil servants, but is yet to be signed off by government lawyers or seen by the Charity Commission.
The official purpose of a future charity would be to raise funds to preserve No 10 and No 11 Downing Street for the nation on heritage grounds. But insiders say the proposal, first reported by the Daily Mail, stemmed from the soaring cost of a makeover of the No 11 flat, which is preferred by prime ministers with families because it is bigger than the No 10 flat. An article in Tatler magazine claims that Symonds has been overhauling the flat to remove all vestiges of Theresa May’s “John Lewis furniture nightmare”. A former charity commissioner has also questioned how any arrangement could be justified as being “for the public benefit”. Andrew Purkis, a board member of the Charity Commission for four years until 2010, said: “For something to be for the public benefit, you would assume there would have to be some sort of public access to whatever the place is that’s being decorated, or sufficient access for it to be seen as something that is of benefit to the public, rather than some narrow section or a particular family.” Downing Street insiders said that allowing the public access to the building has been ruled out on security grounds. Caroline Slocock, Margaret Thatcher’s former private secretary, also questioned if any flat refurbishment would be for the public’s benefit, describing it as a “strange move” to set the fund up as a charity. “It’s for the Charity Commission to decide if it qualifies but it does seem to be for personal benefit rather than public benefit,” she said. The commission has a standard “test of charity status” which would decide if it is legitimate an organisation with “exclusively charitable purposes for the public benefit”. “It’s hard for the general public to see the prime minister as an object of charity,” Slocock said, adding that Johnson and Symonds “have the free use of Chequers, which is a very grand house, so they’re already living quite well”. Commenting on reports the prime minister has privately been complaining he is cash-strapped, she said: “If this becomes a way of increasing his pay through the back door through benefits, that is a concern.” According to the Mail, Johnson is reported to have complained the cost of refurbishment – which is now said to be complete – was “totally out of control” and had run to “over a hundred grand”. Johnson has asked multimillionaire financier and Tory peer Lord Brownlow to run the charity, the Mail reported. One major Conservative donor said he would support funding Downing Street changes through a charity. John Griffin, the taxi tycoon who has given more than £4m to the Tories, defended any future attempt to set up a charity scheme and said he would be willing to make a nominal contribution. “Boris Johnson has done very well over Covid-19. The public are happy with his performance and would be willing to back him. “I’d also give him a few quid – buy a raffle ticket, at the very least,” he said. On Tuesday, Johnson’s press secretary Allegra Stratton described the reports about plans to fund the refurbishment through a charity as “speculation”. “Downing Street is maintained to appropriate standards for the Grade I and II listed building that it is. “The Cabinet Office sits in oversight of that. As things stand there is already a process in place for maintaining it to the right standard,” she said. The prime minister’s official spokesperson referred journalists to the Cabinet Office annual report and accounts which have yet to be published for the relevant period. Brownlow did not respond to the Guardian’s queries."
2021-03-02T21:00:12Z,politics,Politics,Sturgeon faces calls to resign over actions in Salmond crisis,"Nicola Sturgeon faces calls to resign after previously secret legal advice and new witness evidence raised fresh questions over whether Scotland’s first minister misled parliament about the Alex Salmond crisis. On Tuesday evening the Scottish government released confidential legal advice that showed its lawyers had warned Sturgeon and her most senior officials that evidence of a potentially unlawful conflict of interest inside the government was “extremely concerning” and a “very real problem indeed”. The alleged conflict of interest related to a government inquiry into harassment allegations made by junior female members of staff about Salmond, which he has denied. In a separate development, one of Salmond’s lawyers, Duncan Hamilton, told the Scottish parliament that Sturgeon had offered to intervene on Salmond’s behalf in a private meeting at her home on 2 April 2018. Hamilton told a Holyrood committee: “I can confirm that the first minister did offer to assist. We discussed mediation. My clear recollection is that her words were: ‘If it comes to it, I will intervene.’” Hamilton added that Sturgeon later withdrew that offer of help. The claims were released hours before Sturgeon testifies on oath to a Holyrood committee investigating the controversy in what is expected to be a marathon evidence session before MSPs from 9am on Wednesday. Sturgeon has repeatedly denied ever offering to help Salmond, and also insisted she did not know exactly why Salmond wanted to meet her on 2 April but thought he was considering resigning from the Scottish National party in protest at the government investigation. Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader, said the latest revelations made Sturgeon’s position untenable. “There is no longer any doubt that Nicola Sturgeon lied to the Scottish parliament and broke the ministerial code on numerous counts,” he said. Ross said the Scottish government’s legal advice showed the government and Sturgeon were also responsible for wasting public money by continuing the fight against Salmond’s legal action despite clear warnings from their lawyers they were likely to lose. “No first minister can be allowed to mislead the Scottish people and continue in office. [The] weight of the evidence is overwhelming. Nicola Sturgeon must resign.” Sturgeon’s chief spokesman said she had no intention of quitting. “To call a vote of no confidence in the middle of a pandemic, before hearing a single word of the first minister’s evidence, is utterly irresponsible. “It is for the public to decide who they want to govern Scotland and – while we continue to fight the Covid pandemic – with the election campaign starting in just 20 days, that is precisely what they will be able to do.” Other opposition parties did not immediately support Ross’s demands but kept the prospect of supporting them open. Jackie Baillie, the deputy leader of Scottish Labour and a member of the Holyrood committee, said the first minster “has serious questions to answer. She comes before the committee tomorrow and it is only fair to hear from her before coming to a conclusion” about whether she should quit. The government’s legal advice, from Roddy Dunlop QC, now dean of the Faculty of Advocates, was given to Scotland’s chief civil servant, Leslie Evans, on 31 October and 6 December 2018. It is thought that was then shared with Sturgeon, but the government did not decide to concede Salmond’s legal action until 31 December. In another set of potentially damaging disclosures, two allies of Salmond stated in writing that one of his former aides, Geoff Aberdein, had told them in early March 2018 the name of a complainer against Salmond had been leaked to him. Hamilton, a respected advocate and one of Salmond’s lawyers, told the committee that Aberdein gave him the name of a complainer against Salmond in early March 2018 after it had been given to him by a “senior government official”. Kevin Pringle, formerly a special adviser when Salmond was first minister and an SNP official, who took part in that conference call with Hamilton and Aberdein, told MSPs investigating the crisis that Aberdein “is in no doubt that a complainant’s name was shared with him”. Hamilton also supported Salmond’s evidence under oath last Friday that Sturgeon had wrongly told the Scottish parliament in 2019 that she had no advance knowledge of why she was meeting Salmond at her home on 2 April. Salmond told the committee a meeting had been arranged between Sturgeon and Aberdein for 29 March 2018 in her Holyrood office, with the express purpose of setting up that meeting between Salmond and Sturgeon at her home four days later. Hamilton and Aberdein were invited to that meeting on 2 April, Salmond said. Hamilton told the committee: “I can confirm that statement is correct.” He said neither he nor Salmond would ever have turned up at Sturgeon’s home without an invitation from her. The meeting was to discuss the Scottish government’s internal investigation into allegations of sexual assault against Salmond. “Everyone in the room knew exactly why we were there,” Hamilton said. “No introduction to the subject was needed and no one was in any doubt what we were there to discuss.” John Swinney, the deputy first minister, who is the minister in charge of handling the Salmond controversy, had previously refused to release this legal advice despite losing two votes in the Scottish parliament last year. But all four opposition parties said on Monday they would back a Tory no confidence motion tabled against Swinney if he failed a third time to release the legal advice in full. The Tories said on Tuesday they were pressing ahead with that vote. The documents show that Dunlop and his junior, Christine O’Neill, warned Evans on 6 December that the disclosure that a government official had spoken to both complainers before they made complaints and before that official was made investigating officer, meant Salmond’s legal challenge would “more likely than not succeed”. They stated: “This is, we regret to advise, a substantial problem.” They warned the investigating officer’s appointment was likely to be unlawful. The Scottish government’s harassment policy had stated any investigating officer “will have had no prior involvement with any aspect of the matter being raised”. The documents also reveal that on 31 October 2018, two months before the Scottish government’s chief civil servant decided to concede the case on 31 December, Dunlop warned them the disclosure the investigating officer had previously spoken to the complainers presents “a very real problem indeed”. He added: “It would be wrong for me to suggest that this revelation is anything other than an extremely concerning one.”"
2021-03-02T19:45:47Z,politics,Politics,Does charity begin at Boris Johnson's chintzed-up home?,"“My tastes are simple: I am easily satisfied with the best,” wrote Winston Churchill. But what is best to one prime minister can easily be the worst to their successor – or, more often, their spouse. According to reports, Carrie Symonds has apparently decided to ring the changes in No 11 Downing Street – planning a makeover for the four-bedroom flat so expensive that the government might have to set up a charity to pay for it. In America, the White House routinely asks private donors for millions of dollars to pay for interior design, antiques and art. But in Britain, taxpayers have traditionally stumped up £30,000 a year towards the prime minister’s living accommodation. This, it seems, is nowhere near enough. Johnson is said to have balked at the cost of the redesign, allegedly asking if the wallpaper was made out of gold. Which begs two important questions: what on earth do they want to do? And who on earth would be prepared to pay for it? His fiancee’s taste is apparently inspired by an interior designer called Lulu Lytle, whose chintzy aesthetic is the polar opposite of the pared-back Scandi chic favoured by Samatha Cameron, the last prime ministerial consort to have a proper go at making over 11 Downing Street (Philip May scarcely touched a thing during his three-year sojourn). Whereas the Camerons liked things to look shiny and new, Lytle specialises in making new things look old. She runs a company called Soane Britain, which designs and makes antique-inspired furniture, upholstery, lighting, fabrics, wallpapers and “interior necessities”. According to her website, Soane products “can be seen all over the world in many fine hotels and restaurants, private members’ clubs, boardrooms, retail showrooms, yachts and private houses”. Think four-poster beds and hand-painted wall coverings and chesterfield sofas upholstered in British-dyed leather. Expect a lot of rattan in the new No 11 too. Lytle bought the last rattan-weaving workshop left in England in 2011 and now sells rattan mirrors, lampshades and tables at prices too high to advertise on the internet. According to a Tatler profile of Symonds, her goal is to get rid of the “John Lewis furniture nightmare”, which will not go down well with the Conservative mayor for the West Midlands.
Andy Street was the managing director of John Lewis before he went into politics five years ago. So which Conservative donors will pay to make this vision a reality? Last year a Scottish firm called Peak Scientific donated £250,000 to the Tories. It designs and manufactures gas generators for analytical laboratories, so could surely at least sponsor a hob ring or two for the new kitchen. JCB is another big donor, stumping up more than £2.4m after Johnson became prime minister. If he and Symonds really hate their new home, they can surely rely on a cut-price demolition excavator to do the job."
2021-03-02T19:09:22Z,politics,Politics,"Use tariffs to protect food safety and animal welfare in post-Brexit deals, ministers told","Ministers have been advised to consider tariffs on imports of lower-standard food and farm produce from overseas, in order to protect the UK’s high standards of food safety and animal welfare. The recommendation, by an independent commission advising the government, was greeted with dismay by some farmers and food campaigners, who wanted an outright ban and regulations to prevent lower-standard imports in trade deals after Brexit. George Dunn, the chief executive of the Tenant Farmers Association, said: “Seeking to protect environmental and animal welfare considerations by using tariff policy alone will not provide the long-term guarantees we need. Tariffs can be easily renegotiated, reduced or removed altogether, unlike clear, statutory standards.” Kath Dalmeny, the chair of the Future British Standards Coalition, also said tariffs were inferior to an outright ban on lower-standard imports. “We have been clear that tariffs are no substitute for clear blanket bans and that tariffs could be easily reduced or phased out over time, thus breaking the government’s promise of ‘no compromise’ on food standards,” she said. The recommendations of the trade and agriculture commission were published on Tuesday, and will be considered by ministers for possible incorporation into guidelines for future trade deals. The commission was set up to reassure farmers and the public after ministers rejected calls for parliament to be allowed to scrutinise trade deals before they are signed, despite widespread fears that UK food and farming standards could be at risk in trade deals. Dalmeny also warned that the recommendations by the trade and agricultural commission would allow imports without tariffs on products that were judged “equivalent” to the UK in terms of standards, or aligned with “core global standards”. “In many cases global standards are lower than the UK’s. Big questions remain over who would decide what was equivalent, and how,” she said. However, the government’s food tsar, Henry Dimbleby, said the recommendations would protect British consumers. “This report far exceeds my expectations and is very ambitious,” he said. “It sets clear intent for the UK about what we see as the future global trading system, which should be not just about GDP but about governments working together to protect the environment and animal welfare, and reduce carbon emissions.” He rejected the idea that tariffs alone were not enough to protect the UK’s consumers and farmers from lower-standard food produced abroad. “Tariffs are effective bans,” he said, as importers would be priced out of the market by tariffs. The guidelines from the trade and agriculture commission call for liberalised trade in food and agriculture with other countries, but say this should be balanced with a commitment to “international leadership by the UK on climate, environment, animal welfare and ethical trade”. Tim Smith, the former chief executive of the Food Standards Agency and Tesco group quality director, who chaired the commission, said its recommendations should reassure the public. “We will not see a backsliding on standards. We are recommending very solidly that our standards remain,” he said before the publication of the report. “We need to balance the need to be open to liberalised trade with the importance of long-established UK standards.” The question of food standards has been one of the most controversial issues raised by Brexit. Many of the countries with which the government wants to do trade deals have much lower food safety and farming standards than the EU, and many products from these countries were previously banned from the UK under EU rules. The government will be under pressure in trade deal negotiations to allow such imports. That has raised fears among farmers that a flood of lower-standard imports could undercut British produce, while they must maintain high standards to be able to export to the EU. Food campaigners have warned that consumers could be subjected to unsafe or lower-standard products that would promote intensive farming, damage animal welfare and boost diseases such as superbugs that are associated with the overuse of antibiotics in farming. Sue Davies, the head of consumer protection and food policy at Which?, said the government must not allow any weakening of UK food and farming standards. “The government must hold firm to its commitments to uphold food standards and listen to the voices of consumers,” she said. “They have told us clearly they are not prepared to sacrifice high food standards and do not want a two-tier system where only those who are wealthier can be assured that the food on their table meets the standards that consumers currently expect.”"
2021-03-02T18:23:47Z,politics,Politics,Lawyers complain to Labour over hiring of ex-Israeli intelligence officer,"Lawyers acting for a Palestinian activist and Labour member have complained to the party over its decision to hire an alleged former Israeli intelligence officer to help run its social media strategy. Assaf Kaplan was hired by Labour as a social listening and organising manager, a new post described as “a crucial new role at the heart of Labour’s new approach to digital campaigning”. The complaint from Bindmans solicitors alleges that Kaplan worked for Unit 8200, the cyber branch of the Israeli Defence Force, from 2009 to 2013. It adds that the unit has been mired in controversy over its surveillance practices against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank and Gaza. In 2014, 43 veterans of Unit 8200 signed a public letter refusing to serve in operations involving the occupied Palestinian territories because of the widespread surveillance of residents, which could be used for blackmail. Hundreds of reservists then signed a counter-protest letter. It is not clear what Kaplan did within the unit or whether he had any knowledge of the monitoring of citizens. The job description for his Labour role says: “You will help to move the social media listening framework of the party to be laser focused on those we need to win over to form the next government.” Bindmans, acting for Adnan Hmidan, say the party’s stance on illegal occupation of Palestinian territories should have precluded Kaplan’s employment, and they urged Labour to explain the decision. His appointment has also drawn a complaint from the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell. The episode underlines how raw the issue of Israel remains in the Labour party. Both Jeremy Corbyn and Keir Starmer’s leaderships have been marked by controversies over antisemitism. Hmidan’s parents were born in Palestine and forcibly removed to Jordan. His lawyers’ letter points out that successive Labour conferences have criticised Israeli annexation plans as a breach of international law, adding that the occupation has led to mass violations of Palestinian rights. His lawyers’ letter argues that either the party did know about Kaplan’s background, in which case it has shown a failure to consider the views of its Palestinian members, or it did not know and has failed to show due diligence. Hmidan asked whether the party undertook any risk assessment and what personal data of party members Kaplan will be able to access in his role. He said unless he receives satisfactory assurances from the party, he intends to refer the issue to the information commissioner and consider whether he will take legal action on the basis of unfair and unlawful recruitment. The Labour party said: “We do not comment on staffing matters.” Kaplan did not respond to attempts to contact him."
2021-03-02T17:41:04Z,politics,Politics,Even inaptly named Cleverly sees fault lines in Yemen aid argument | John Crace,"Yemen remained among the worst humanitarian crises in the world, said James Cleverly, junior Foreign Office minister responsible for the Middle East, in answer to an urgent question from fellow Tory Andrew Mitchell. Two-thirds of the population were in need of assistance. 47,000 people were living in famine conditions and a further 16.2 million were at risk of starvation. After an opening like this, you rather expected Cleverly to explain why the UK government was increasing its overseas aid budget to the country. Instead he chose to justify cutting it by over 50% during the next financial year. Yemen would be getting “at least” £87m of the £214m it was currently receiving. Indeed if it played its cards right, the minister might even bung in an extra £100,000 as a goodwill gesture. The truth was that the UK had already been doing too much to help Yemen and it was time to step back and let the country fend for itself. Cleverly may be one of the most inappropriately named MPs, but even he could see the fault lines in his argument and he spent much of the next 45 minutes fending off hits from both his own and the opposition benches. First in was Mitchell, who questioned the morality of the fifth-wealthiest country in the world cutting aid to one of the poorest in the middle of a pandemic. “This is not who we are,” he said. Unfortunately, it is. That was only the start. The shadow international development secretary, Preet Kaur Gill, wondered if it was any coincidence that we were cutting aid while selling arms to the Saudis who were using them on the Yemenis. What goes around comes around, I suppose. David Davis and Damian Green reminded the government that it had been elected on a manifesto of donating 0.7% of GDP in overseas aid and that any cuts to the budget could only be passed by a vote in the Commons. This wasn’t just a matter of trust; it was also a moral duty. By now Cleverly was cutting a thoroughly broken figure at the dispatch box and could only repeat in a dull monotone the feeble lines his advisers had prepared for him. Labour had never donated more than 0.51% of GDP in foreign aid, so they could shut up for a start. It didn’t seem to have occurred to him that having previously done the right thing by donating 0.7% was no excuse for doing the wrong thing now. Time and again he repeated that the £87m to Yemen was “a floor not a ceiling” but no one really believed him. Once the money had been cut, there wasn’t a cat in hell’s chance of it being revised upwards when the economic situation improved. Rather, MPs from all sides reckoned the government was taking a calculated risk in assuming that most Tories would be more interested in money spent at home than aid to help hundreds of thousands of Yemenis stay alive. And if all it took was for Cleverly to be made to look a bit hopeless and untrustworthy for just under an hour, then it was a price worth paying. Next up in the chamber was Matt Hancock, who had come to give an entirely unnecessary update on coronavirus, given that almost everything he had to say was already in the public domain. But the health secretary is now living his best life and is determined to milk it for all its worth. Not so long ago, every Commons statement was fraught with danger for Door Matt. An opportunity for his opponents to raise awkward questions about the UK death toll and the failures of test and trace. But the success of the vaccination programme has changed everything. While the Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines are providing unexpectedly high levels of immunity to the virus in older members of the population, they are granting the health secretary near-total immunity from all awkward questions. No one wants to focus on negative stuff, such as the death rate, when there is finally some hope on the horizon. Even the missing person with the Brazilian variant is merely a nuisance rather than a serious cause for concern. It may still all go tits up, of course, with a mutant strain that is resistant to the vaccine, but for now Matt is just happy to ride the wave. More disturbingly, the change in fortunes has released his inner bumptious child. He displays little graciousness in being bailed out by the scientists: rather, he increasingly acts as if he alone has saved the UK and is irked when MPs aren’t sufficiently grateful to him. Still, if that’s what it takes to beat the pandemic, I guess most of us can live with it. For a while at least."
2021-03-02T17:37:48Z,politics,Politics,"Search for missing Brazilian variant case narrows to 379 homes in south-east England, says Hancock","Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has told MPs that the search for the missing sixth person who has tested positive in the UK with the P1 Brazilian variant of coronavirus has narrowed down and is now focused on 379 households in the south-east of England. (See 1.27pm, 1.37pm and 2.18pm.) Hancock has told MPs that there are “some bumper weeks ahead” for the vaccine rollout programme. In his statement to MPs he said: Although the day-to-day figures for supply are lumpy, we have some bumper weeks ahead later this month. Given that our vaccination programme began 12 weeks ago today, from now we begin in earnest our programme of second vaccinations, which ramps up over the month of March. I can assure the house that we have factored these second jabs into our supply projections, and we are on track to meet our target of offering a vaccine to all priority groups 1 to 9 by 15 April and to all adults by the end of July. The ONS has said around one person in four in England would test positive for the antibodies that should give them some protection against coronavirus. (See 11.57am). The coronavirus variant originally found in Manaus in Brazil and detected in six cases in the UK was able to infect 25% to 61% of the people in the Amazonian city who might have expected to be immune after a first bout of Covid, researchers say. Nicola Sturgeon has said it may be possible to accelerate Scotland’s exit from the coronavirus lockdown, as she confirmed that all school pupils would return to the classroom after the Easter break. The government has intervened to stop councils requiring children in primary schools in England to wear face masks when they return to school next week. Coronavirus deaths in England and Wales are falling fastest among those aged 80 and over, ONS data shows, suggesting the vaccination programme has had an impact on mortality. John Swinney, Scotland’s deputy first minister, has agreed to release his government’s legal advice on Alex Salmond’s court action after facing cross-party censure in Holyrood.

2021-03-02T17:35:44Z,politics,Politics,Grantham council won’t pay for Thatcher statue unveiling,"Plans to use £100,000 of taxpayers’ money to underwrite an unveiling ceremony for a statue of Margaret Thatcher in her home town have been scrapped. Councillors in Grantham, Lincolnshire were heavily criticised when they voted in December to set aside £100,000 to cover the costs of an event to reveal the statue, hoping donations would recoup the money. The decision reignited divisions in the town over the statue and Thatcher’s legacy, and when the matter was put before a scrutiny committee on Monday it was decided delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic would provide enough time to raise the money through private donations. Councillor Lee Steptoe, the chair of Grantham Labour, called the U-turn a “victory for common sense”. In December he said it was “absolutely perverse” for the council to have made the decision in the middle of a pandemic when funds were scarce. The bronze 10ft (3m) statue of Thatcher, created by sculptor Douglas Jennings, was offered to South Kesteven district council after proposals for it to be placed in Parliament Square were rejected over fears it would attract protests. Rows over the sculpture have raged for years, and when it is eventually unveiled in Grantham in May it will be placed on a 10ft plinth to prevent vandalism. At a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the Conservative-led council confirmed the decision to remove the £100,000 underwriting from budget plans. The leader of the council, Kelham Cooke, said the unveiling event and preparations for it would now be “privately funded through donations without the need for any underwriting or forward funding for this event, and the funding for this will be removed from the council’s budget”. Opposition councillors forced the leadership into revealing a breakdown of costs for the unveiling ceremony, which included an estimated £50,200 on an external events organisation, including audio and media, staging, seating and an unveiling mechanism, and £24,250 on public safety. Last month a local artist, Mark Robla, placed a carved plaster head of Thatcher on a pike on top of the empty plinth, saying he was saving the council money. Thatcher was born and raised in Grantham and her father, Alfred Roberts, who owned a grocery shop in the town, was mayor from 1945 to 46."
2021-03-02T12:20:17Z,politics,Politics,Zoom legend Jackie Weaver cuts first dance track,"Jackie Weaver might have no authority, but she’s got the grooves. The 62-year-old parish council clerk who became an internet sensation after a car crash Zoom meeting has now cut her first dance track, to help raise awareness of the lack of diversity and representation at local government level.
Weaver, a full-time clerk for the Cheshire Association of Local Councils, shot to fame after the December meeting of Handforth parish council descended into farcical chaos. Footage of the meeting went viral and birthed a meme when one councillor furiously declared: “You have no authority here, Jackie Weaver!”
Among those whose imaginations the incident captured was Helen Meissner, who for the past few years has run her own folk and acoustic independent record label, Folkstock, from her Hertfordshire home. Last summer, at the age of 54, Meissner started to make her own electronic music tracks.
After a Twitter conversation Weaver agreed to collaborate with Meissner on the track Jackie Weaver’s Kicked Him Out, which is being released under the name Helefonix ft Jackie Weaver and Joe Rose. The track, which is being released on streaming platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music, aims to raise awareness of the issue at the heart of the Handforth debacle. The single will be used to promote the Make a Change campaign, which sets out to improve diversity and representation at local government level, breaking what is often seen as a stranglehold on local politics – especially in rural and suburban parishes – by middle aged white males.
“When Helen got in touch I just thought, why not?” Weaver said. “It’s not necessarily the sort of music I’m into but I just said I want it to be catchy, and it’s certainly that. “It’s really important to all of us that we get the message out that there needs to be more diversity on all levels in local government. “We in the sector have been trying to do this for a long time and something like this gets the point across as well as being a lot of fun.” Meissner said: “I think what that video did was throw a light on the kind of negative behaviour that pervades public life. Shouting and misogyny like that is rife — you see it in the House of Commons and people think it’s all right and copy it, so in a way we’re calling it out here. “I think the fact I’m over 50 appealed to Jackie, which is why she agreed to do it. I know that ageism in the music industry and the media is a problem. It’s very important that we harness the wisdom and experience of our older generations and not pigeonhole anybody.” Meissner started putting the track together at the beginning of last week after asking Weaver her musical preferences – she likes the Rolling Stones – then recruited her husband John Froggett, 62, an accountant who sings as Joe Rose, to voice some of the quotes from the meeting. Finally, she sent it to Weaver for approval who then recorded her own vocal contributions on her phone. It’s not the first time Weaver has been immortalised in song – Andrew Lloyd Webber released his own ode to her last month."
2021-03-02T09:30:44Z,politics,Politics,"Post-Brexit deals must not compromise UK food standards, says trade body","Post-Brexit trade deals will not allow the UK’s high standards of food and animal welfare to be reduced, if the government follows new guidelines published on Tuesday, the chief of the independent advisory trade and agriculture commission has said. The guidelines will call for liberalised trade in food and agriculture with other countries, but will require that this should be balanced with a commitment to “international leadership by the UK on climate, environment, animal welfare and ethical trade”. Tim Smith, the former chief executive of the Food Standards Agency and Tesco Group quality director, chaired the commission, an independent board set up to advise the government on future trade. He said its recommendations should reassure the public. “We will not see a backsliding on standards. We are recommending very solidly that our standards remain,” he told the Guardian before the publication of the report. “We need to balance the need to be open to liberalised trade with the importance of long-established UK standards.” He added: “I’ve been 40 years in the food industry and I know how much food matters to people. People want good food from a system that is fair for all. People should be confident that we have correctly captured their various concerns. Farmers need fear no part of our recommendations. Farmers will have export opportunities that were not previously available.” Ministers will decide whether to accept all or some of the recommendations. The question of how the UK’s food and agriculture standards, strictly regulated by Brussels when the UK was an EU member, could change after Brexit has been one of the most controversial aspects of the transition. Farmers are concerned that a flood of lower-standard imports could undercut British produce, while they must maintain high standards to be able to export to the EU. Food campaigners have warned that consumers could be subjected to unsafe or lower standard products that would promote intensive farming, damage animal welfare and boost diseases such as superbugs that are associated with the overuse of antibiotics in farming. The US government made it clear last year that it expected the UK to accept US standards as part of any trade deal, insisting they were as good as UK standards despite the concerns of many campaigners. Numerous American products are subject to bans from the EU because of food safety and animal welfare concerns. In response, ministers explicitly ruled out imports of chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef last year, but campaigners pointed out that continuing to ban these specific products would still allow vast numbers of similarly treated products to be imported. Smith repeated that bans on chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef would remain in place. However, he said, there could be cases of other products where alternative treatments to those stipulated in the UK could be allowed in. “We should not settle for less stringent standards than we currently have, unless they are equivalent and will clearly demonstrate the same level of protection for consumers,” he said. Smith said he did not know of any such cases and they were likely to be few. He also called for tighter labelling of the country of origin of foods in supermarkets, but said consumers were not calling for more complex labels that could describe in further detail how food was produced. He also urged the government to ensure transparency in drawing up trade deals, and a strong role for parliamentary scrutiny. Trade deals should be “about long-term ambition, not short-term expediency”, he added. Ministers have repeatedly rejected calls for parliament to be able to scrutinise and vote on trade deals before they are signed, but agreed to set up a revamped trade and agriculture commission that would have limited powers to scrutinise and advise ministers on deals. That statutory commission will take over from the current advisory body later this year, but full details of how that will work and who will staff the new version of the commission have not yet been set out. Vicki Hird, the head of the farming campaign at Sustain, a coalition of NGOs, said: “We welcome the news that the trade and agriculture commission says the UK needs to protect food standards, and work to drive up standards globally. However, they seem to prioritise trade liberalisation over other considerations.” She said the guidelines did not appear to guarantee that current bans, for instance on certain pesticides, would be maintained in full. “We will need to see whether the government accepts the commission’s recommendations, as well as learning much more detail about how the new statutory trade and agriculture commission will operate in the long term.” Previous research by Sustain and other civil society groups has found that under the post-Brexit regime ministers enjoy wide-ranging powers to change food and agriculture standards at the stroke of a pen. These could include altering rules on what medication is permitted on livestock, or adjustments to the use of some pesticides, for instance. Under EU rules, these were strictly regulated. Hird warned that the strength of public feeling, with 2.6 million people signing petitions last year to keep high standards in UK agriculture, would not diminish. “If [the government does not follow the recommendations] further public opposition to low standard imports is likely, and UK farmers will soon be undermine by more low-standard imports,” she said."
2021-03-02T09:16:51Z,politics,Politics,Scottish government to release legal advice on Salmond court action,"John Swinney, Scotland’s deputy first minister, has agreed to release his government’s legal advice on Alex Salmond’s court action after facing cross-party censure in Holyrood. Swinney told the Holyrood committee investigating the Salmond controversy on Monday night it would get the advice on Tuesday afternoon, after it emerged all four opposition parties would back a Conservative no-confidence motion in him tabled for later on Tuesday. It remains unclear whether the advice will be released publicly once it has been given to the committee. Swinney told MSPs he had agreed, because of the “exceptional circumstances”, he would release the papers “to the committee and for publication” but the Tories accused him of prevarication. The Tories said the advice should be published for everyone to see, and would not lift the threat of a no-confidence vote until they had seen what Swinney did and how extensive the disclosures were. “The deputy first minister is not in the clear yet,” said Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader. “He must go further and fully publish the legal advice or we will not hesitate to force him out.” The legal advice, written in October 2018 by one of Scotland’s most senior lawyers, Roddy Dunlop QC, is said to have warned the government it was likely to lose Salmond’s legal challenge over its flawed internal inquiry into sexual harassment complaints against him. It had emerged the civil servant who led that inquiry had spoken to both women before they made their complaints official, briefing them on the new anti-harassment policy before it was complete and approved. That apparent conflict of interest led to Salmond winning his court challenge in early January 2019, when the government conceded its inquiry was flawed, unlawful and had the appearance of bias. Dunlop, now dean of the Faculty of Advocates, the ruling body for advocates, Scotland’s equivalent to a barrister, and his junior, are said to have threatened resignation later in 2018 because Leslie Evans, the government’s permanent secretary, was refusing to concede. After rejecting two previous demands by Holyrood to do so, Swinney said he would release that advice to the committee in part to counter inaccurate allegations about what it said. “The very integrity of the legal system is being questioned,” he said. “Serious allegations have been made. This material allows people to confirm that these allegations are false.” With Nicola Sturgeon due to give evidence on oath to the committee on Wednesday morning, the relevance of that advice intensified sharply when Salmond testified last week that Sturgeon was involved in discussions about what to do with it. Salmond told the committee: “Everything about that legal advice,even how it has been described in terms, suggests that, on the balance of probabilities, it indicated that the government was about to lose. “[If] the legal advice says that and the case was continued in the knowledge of the first minister against that legal advice, that would be a breach of the ministerial code. If we could just see the document, we would all be better informed.” Salmond suggested Sturgeon could be guilty of a breach of the ministerial code if that advice was ignored, because it increased the legal costs and delay. Salmond was eventually awarded £512,000 in legal costs, a substantial figure calculated partly to reflect the fact the government had unnecessarily prolonged the court action. The committee is again questioning the lord advocate, James Wolffe QC, on Tuesday morning, along with crown agent David Harvie. Wolffe began his evidence by robustly rejecting cover-up claims, including assertions from Salmond last week, allegations from some opposition MSPs and on social media, or that the Crown Office had been politically influenced or biased in its decisions. Salmond is furious the Crown Office refuses to release evidence he says proves collusion by senior figures in the Scottish National party to get him prosecuted, and also that it asked Holyrood to heavily edit one of his submissions. Wolffe said all Crown Office decisions were based on the law, and independent of any outside influence. He said David Harvie, the crown agent who is the Crown Office’s head of prosecutions, was an “exceptional public servant” and a man of utmost integrity. “Any suggestion from any quarter that the Crown’s decision making has at any time been influenced by political considerations or improper motivations would be wholly without foundation. Insinuations and assertions to the contrary are baseless,” he said."
2021-03-02T00:20:07Z,politics,Politics,Johnson trying to set up charity that could fund No 11 flat revamp,"Downing Street is trying to set up a charity that could cover the costs of the refurbishment of Boris Johnson’s flat, which he shares with his fiancee, Carrie Symonds. A No 10 spokesman would not deny reports in the Daily Mail that the prime minister is attempting to set up a charity where benefactors can contribute to the upkeep of Downing Street. Symonds is understood to have undertaken a substantial redecoration of the flat above No 11 that she shares with Johnson and their baby son, Wilfred. Johnson is known to have joked with Conservative MPs about the cost of the refurbishment. According to the Mail, the purpose of the charitable fund would be to maintain not just the No 11 flat, but also other parts of Downing Street, including the state rooms, and could therefore be presented as having a wider heritage purpose. It was reported to be modelled on a similar scheme used by the White House to raise money for interior design and restyling the building, which is bankrolled by private donors. By tradition, incoming US presidents and their families are allowed to spend $100,000 on redecorating the White House, and the first lady takes an active part in the White House Endowment Trust, which maintains the fabric of the building. Symonds, who used to be the Conservative party’s head of communications, but no longer holds an official role, has proved a controversial figure in Johnson’s administration. She is said to have clashed with two of the prime minister’s most senior aides Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain, who both resigned last year. Cain was offered the role of chief of staff, but turned it down citing family reasons and a desire to avoid internal unrest. Symonds’ allies accused the pair of briefing against her in the aftermath of their departure, which they deny. There has also been speculation in the media as to how much influence Symonds has over the prime minister’s policymaking on a range of issues she cares about deeply, such as the environment and ending the premature release of rapists and murderers. Last month, the conservative thinktank the Bow Group called for an independent inquiry into her “possible influence” in government. Downing Street said it was “incorrect” to say Symonds plays a central role. The Mail said work on the No 11 flat is believed to have been completed in recent months, after going on for more than a year and facing disruption due to the pandemic. A No 10 spokesman said: “The Downing Street complex is a working building, as well as containing two ministerial residences. As has been the case under successive administrations, refurbishments and maintenance are made periodically. “Matters concerning works on the Downing Street estate, including the residences, are covered in the Cabinet Office annual report and accounts.”"
2021-03-01T20:15:40Z,politics,Politics,Cameron takes time out to settle some old scores at parliamentary love-in,"Sliding doors. In another life, Brexit would never have happened and David Cameron would still be prime minister. Though who knows whether the 2020 general election would have taken place because of coronavirus or if Dave would have called it a year early in 2019? Boris Johnson just an ex-London mayor with a moribund, niche political career as the failed leader of Vote Leave. And certainly no sign of Boris, Matt Hancock, Gavin Williamson, Priti Patel or any of the other cabinet lightweights at the Downing Street press conferences. It was almost enough to make you nostalgic. He may have fucked up the country but at least he was a grown up about it. Instead we find Cameron holed up in his Cotswold home doing … not very much and looking quite chipper on it. Quite the shiny-faced, chillaxed Boden catalogue Dad. The £800k advance for his deadly dull memoir has not yet been all spent and there is always the odd after-dinner speech to top up the bank balance if necessary. And then there’s the occasional hour of pro bono work. Like giving evidence to the cross-party national security strategy committee about his decision to set up the National Security Council in 2010. It all had the feel of a self-congratulatory love-in, compered by Labour’s Margaret Beckett. No one had any difficult questions because everyone was in agreement both that the NSC had improved government immeasurably and that life would be a lot better if Dave was still in office. Just about the only tricky moment came when Cameron was asked if he fancied a return to frontline politics. Because though he knew he was meant to say “yes” the reality is that he doesn’t really. Sure he missed some of the status that went with being prime minister – sharing jokes with Barack Obama, riding Rebekah Brooks’s old police nag and that sort of thing – but he didn’t miss the hard work that came with the job. “I’m very busy, you know,” he said at one point. Though he seemed to struggle to remember what he was busy doing. Ah yes, that was it. He was doing some charity work and helping fragile states. It didn’t sound much like a full-time job. Then maybe that’s all Dave can fit in these days. Though the sense of pathos was unavoidable: to be washed up at 50 is no age for any career to end. Especially one from which the only way is down. There was time for Cameron to settle a few old scores with his successors. He called out Boris Johnson for his decision to cut the aid budget by merging the Department for International Development with the Foreign Office, and criticised Theresa May for combining the role of national security adviser with the post of cabinet secretary. But he did so more in passing than in anger. Now was not the time or place for such behaviour. Dave was rather more guarded when Labour’s Darren Jones asked him about Brexit. The decision to hold a referendum hadn’t been taken lightly, he observed tartly. Rather it was one that had been taken back in 2013 and had been written into the Tory election manifesto of 2015. Jones looked as if he was eager to follow up with the obvious question: if so much thought had gone in to holding a referendum, why was it that the remain campaign that had been led by himself and George Osborne had been so hopeless? Didn’t he regret having taken winning for granted until it was too late? This might have got close to the heart of “Being Dave”, so Beckett stepped in to move things along. The one thing that no one – Cameron especially – could bear to face was that the chaos of a May government and the shambles of a Johnson government were the inevitable consequences of a Dave government. Cameron may have looked the part by setting up governmental structures, such as the NSC, but on the big issues like Brexit he made all the wrong calls. From time to time, one of Dave’s sons would appear behind him as if to remind him that his screen time was up for the day. “Can you spare us an extra 10 minutes?” Beckett enquired. Sure thing. This was Dave in his element. Power without responsibility. A chance to tilt history a little in his favour by focusing on the things he had got right. Besides, it wasn’t as if he had anything else much on. And there was still a while before Pointless started on TV."
2021-03-01T19:26:10Z,politics,Politics,Cameron criticises Johnson and May over aid cuts and security oversight,"David Cameron has criticised Boris Johnson’s aid cuts and abolition of the Department for International Development, and accused Theresa May of making a “very bad mistake” in merging key cabinet and security roles. The former prime minister’s criticism of his successors came as he made a rare (virtual) return to parliament, where he told the joint committee on national security strategy (JCNSS) on Monday that he was “sure there will be a big inquiry” into the handling of the Covid pandemic. Cameron also eagerly mounted a defence of his own much-criticised decision to call the referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU, and appeared keen to reject suggestions that he had rushed into it, after he was asked whether the move had been part of an overall national strategy. “It is not as if this was something that was thought up and popped in a manifesto,” he said by video link from his home. “It was properly thought through, discussed, argued, debated, voted on in parliament, put in a manifesto, a government was formed on the basis of that manifesto … I sometimes read about it as if people think it was a sort of afterthought. “I think it was January 2013, the announcement of holding a referendum before the halfway point of the next parliament was made.” Appearing as part of the JCNSS inquiry into Britain’s national security machinery, Cameron was particularly critical of May’s decision to merge the role of cabinet secretary and national security adviser. Sir Mark Sedwill held what Cameron described as “two jobs” during May’s tenure. “For one person, even if you were a cross of Einstein, Wittgenstein and Mother Teresa, you couldn’t possibly do both jobs, and I think that temporarily weakened the national security council,” Cameron told the committee. On Johnson’s decision to scrap the international development department, Cameron said: “I think abolishing DfID is a mistake too for all sorts of reasons, but one of which is actually having the Foreign Office voice around the [national security council] table and the DfID voice around the table I think is important – they are not necessarily the same thing. “Can you really expect the foreign secretary to do all of the diplomatic stuff and be able to speak to the development brief as well? That’s quite a task, so I think it is good to have both. He also repeated his criticism of the government’s announcement last year that it would renege on a commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income on official development assistance. Earlier, Cameron said he believed “a big mistake” had been made by British governments in terms of focusing preparedness for future pandemics on influenza rather than a virus like Covid-19. “I am sure there will be a big inquiry. There was a pretty big flu pandemic plan but it was a flu plan,” said Cameron, who added that there had also been a “global virus surveillance unit” but he wasn’t sure what had happened to it after he left office. He recalled what he described as the slow response of the World Health Organization (WHO) to the outbreak of Ebola in west Africa in 2014, when the national infrastructures of states such as the UK, US and France had then “steamed in”. He agreed that more should have been learned from outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome, caused by the Sars coronavirus. The SNP MP Angus MacNeil asked Cameron if he ever thought about a comeback, noting that Donald Trump had been talking about standing again for US president. Cameron ruled the idea out. “Thinking about Donald Trump making a comeback is enough to keep us all spinning over,” he said, adding that he was busy enough working on initiatives in the fields of dementia and Alzheimer’s."

(See 5.34pm.) He announced the findings at a No 10 press conference. Describing it in more detail, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, also said that data on individuals aged over 70 showed that for both Pfizer and the AstraZeneca jabs there was vaccine effectiveness against illness of approximately 60% after one dose. Van-Tam went on: [This data] shows us how, if we are patient and we give this vaccine programme time to have its full effect, it is going to hopefully take us into a very different world in the next few months. Hancock ended the press conference by saying the link between Covid infections and deaths had now been broken. He said. The effectiveness of the vaccine on protecting people, and on reducing transmission, is critical to the roadmap [for lifting lockdown restrictions] ... The data that weâ€™ve published today shows that the roadmap is achievable, because it shows that we will be able to break the link from cases through to hospitalisations and to deaths, and until now in the pandemic that link from cases through to hospitalisations and deaths has been unbreakable. And we have demonstrated with the data today that the vaccines can break that link, and that is down to the power of science. So itâ€™s good news for everybody. Boris Johnson has denied hotel quarantine was brought in too slowly, as a nationwide search to track down a person infected with a coronavirus â€œvariant of concernâ€� that originated in Brazil gets under way.
Boris Johnson has said the recovery might be â€œmuch strongerâ€� than pessimists expect. His economic forecast ahead of the budget was noticeably more upbeat than Rishi Sunakâ€™s, because the chancellor has been instead stressing the need for the government to take measures to bring the deficit under control. (See 2.45pm.) Downing Street has dismissed suggestions that Boris Johnson has raised unrealistic hopes for people hoping to be able to go on holiday abroad this summer. (See 1.38pm.) Britainâ€™s manufacturers suffered from mounting supply chain disruption in February as Brexit and the third Covid lockdown weighed down growth in factory production, according to a survey. The alleged leakers of a controversial Labour party report into its handling of antisemitism should not be named because it would risk harm to potentially innocent individuals, the high court has ruled. Ministers will make non-fatal strangulation a specific criminal offence punishable by five yearsâ€™ imprisonment following pressure from campaigners. Thatâ€™s all from me for today.

2021-03-01T18:15:26Z,politics,Politics,Labour indicates it would back gradual rise in corporation tax,"Labour would back a gradual increase in corporation tax across this parliament, the shadow chancellor has indicated after a week of criticism over the party’s assertion that tax rises should be off the table. Writing for the Guardian, Anneliese Dodds says Labour would not back an immediate hike in taxes on company profits in Wednesday’s budget but was open-minded about future increases. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, is believed to be preparing to increase corporation tax from 19% to up to 25% by the end of the parliament in 2024. Dodds also said the party would back reforms to tighten corporation tax loopholes. But she accused the chancellor of playing politics with early tax hikes, which he reportedly bragged he would cut later in the parliament as a pre-election sweetener. The Guardian also understands that Labour would not automatically oppose the freezing of the income tax threshold, which Sunak is said to be planning to freeze at £12,500 for basic rate taxpayers and £50,000 for the higher rate for at least three years. “When the Conservatives have raised the personal allowance in the past, it has helped the best-off more than others,” a Labour source said. Last week Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, faced a backlash after saying he would oppose any new tax on business in this week’s budget, including privately from some shadow cabinet ministers, who urged a more nuanced position. On Monday night, Richard Burgon, the former shadow cabinet minister who has become one of Starmer’s key critics on the party’s left, said Labour must step up its attacks on the Tories, calling the party’s position on corporation tax a “debacle”. At the rally organised by the Labour Assembly Against Austerity, with Labour MPs and trade union general secretaries, Burgon said: “We can’t just sidestep big debates when they happen. The tax debacle of the past few days shows that if we continue to do so, then our party will be outflanked by the Tories with their phoney rhetoric of levelling up. We can win the argument for a progressive tax system – but only if we make the case.” Since Starmer told the Commons that “now is not the time for tax rises on families and businesses”, a shadow cabinet source said there had been representations to the party leader to soften the approach. The more nuanced proposition was a relief, they said. “The approach never seemed final and I think more inexperienced people went in hard briefing about it,” the source said. Dodds had been more hesitant about endorsing any future tax rises at a video speech hosted by Bloomberg on Monday. “Now is not the time for immediate tax rises,” she said. “We’ve been very clear that right now the chancellor should be focused on promoting jobs, on ensuring that business can keep going, on getting people who are unemployed speedily back into work.” Sources close to Dodds defended her opposition to immediate tax rises, with one saying it was the general Keynesian proscription against increases when the economy is heading into a recession. “We have never been against rises in corporation tax – this is about what is the right timing in the teeth of a recession,” a senior Labour source said. In her article, Dodds said it was “hard to find a serious economist who believes that immediate tax rises would achieve anything other than damaging Britain’s recovery”. However, she conceded there was an argument in favour of raising corporation tax. “There is a clear long-term case for rises in the rate of corporation tax – as well as action against loopholes – where the Conservatives have made us an international outlier for a decade,” she wrote. “If there were a sensible plan to raise the rate across this parliament, of course Labour would look at that carefully – but now is not the time for immediate tax rises.” However, she said the party was suspicious of Sunak’s motivations. “He has reportedly been going round telling Conservative MPs that if he puts taxes up now, he can cut them again in time for the next election. Instead of doing what is best for the country, he is doing what he thinks will benefit his party in 2024,” she said. Dodds will argue that key measures expected in Sunak’s budget, like the extension of the furlough scheme, business rates holidays and VAT cuts, are “fiddling round the edges” and could have been announced weeks ago. She also hopes to drive home the narrative that the economic downturn is down to mismanagement by the past decade of Tory rule, with the foundations of the economy “fundamentally weakened over the last decade … exposed by this crisis”. Dodds said the budget would still leave many people out in the cold – particularly those excluded from pandemic support – while social care residents were exposed in the early months of the crisis. “Millions of people have fallen through the gaping holes they tore in the social security net,” she said. “After a decade of negligence and broken promises on social care, a generation of older people were left exposed to the virus in a system that has become a national disgrace. The tragic consequences were entirely avoidable.” Dodds also said the chancellor must offer succour to businesses that are “deeply concerned about the amount of debt they have had to take on over the last year”. She said the fear of loan repayments would mean businesses failing to invest or take on new staff. Much of Sunak’s budget is expected to form a rescue package to steady the economy through what the government hopes will be the last few months of the worst period of the pandemic. The Treasury will announce a series of tax consultations on 23 March, which some have described as a ploy to allow the chancellor to announce the “good news” about extensions of support on budget day while delaying decisions on tax rises until later in the year.

To a soundtrack of stirring string music, a bejumpered Sunak settles himself on a stool in front of a tasteful grey backdrop. An off-screen voice asks him to describe the day just over a year ago when he was made chancellor. â€œOh gosh!â€� comes the reply, 50% young Hugh Grant, 50% Diana, Princess of Wales. The glossy Treasury-produced mini-film, billed as â€œThe 12 months to budget 2021â€�, presents the dramatic events of the last year almost entirely through Sunakâ€™s perspective. After he explains the chaos of becoming chancellor just before the 2020 budget, he recounts first being briefed about coronavirus. Later he talks about the moment he was told a vaccine had been approved. This is all accompanied by a montage of shots of the chancellor â€“ 134 of them, by one count.
It is the latest enterprise from a politician who some of his Tory colleagues privately grumble is overly obsessed by his personal brand, as previously evidenced by his fondness for embossing a stylised personal signature on social media content. What is clear is how closely Sunak wants to keep any credit for tackling the economic impact of coronavirus, and how extraordinarily carefully his team are seeking to craft his image. In yet another innovation, Sunak will be the first chancellor to hold a press conference after his budget speech in the Commons, hosting the semi-regular Downing Street briefing at 5pm on Wednesday. The Treasury has confirmed that the 5m 40s video is an official government production, saying it was â€œmade by the Treasuryâ€™s in-house communications team at no additional costâ€�. While Sunak is centre stage, Boris Johnson barely features, and a newcomer to British politics would be forgiven for assuming Sunak was in charge. Sunak says â€œIâ€�, â€œmeâ€�, or â€œmyâ€� 26 times, praises his â€œheroicâ€� team, and mentions Brexit not once. Chancellors are traditionally coy about openly previewing what will be in their budget, and the video gives gives little away, beyond confirming that the furlough scheme will be extended beyond April. There is a brief focus on the â€œoverriding priorityâ€� of jobs, with Sunak unveiling yet another PR phrase by saying he wants to create a â€œkickstart generationâ€� of young people, a reference to a job creation scheme of that name. It remains to be seen how well all this goes down with fellow Conservatives. One Tory MP noted the high production values but added that many colleagues â€œprivately think itâ€™s too self-promotional ahead of a budgetâ€�."
2021-03-01T13:08:03Z,politics,Politics,Woking council accused of discouraging vulnerable voters,"A Conservative-run council has been accused of potentially shutting vulnerable people out of May’s elections by asking people to show photo ID if they want a postal or proxy vote, even though it is not required by law. Woking borough council in Surrey says that because voters are only “requested” to provide ID and proof of address, it is not breaching electoral rules. But rights groups say the tactic could discourage groups of voters who are less likely to have the relevant documents, including older people, people who are homeless, those with disabilities, or people from black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. They say this is particularly vital in the 6 May election as many more people are expected to seek postal or proxy votes because of coronavirus, particularly older voters. The government plans to introduce mandatory ID for all in-person voting from 2023, a plan criticised separately as likely to suppress voter numbers from some communities. In England, Scotland and Wales, for a postal or proxy vote, people only need to provide a signature and date of birth in advance, which is then checked against the same data on the vote itself. But on its website, Woking council says that to apply for a postal or proxy vote, “you are requested to provide” copies of photo ID such as a passport or driving licence, and proof of residence, for example a utility bill or bank statement. This page does not tell people that this is not mandatory. If voters then click on the link to apply for a postal or proxy vote, they are told, the subsequent document says: “If you do not provide such evidence, your application will still be processed, but your registration at the property will be examined further. This could result in your name being removed from the electoral register.” Toby James, a professor of politics at the University of East Anglia and an expert on voting practices, said he had never previously seen an English council act in this way. “Generally speaking, postal vote fraud is not really a big issue now,” he said. “The biggest issue at this election is going to be turnout, and people worrying about casting their votes. The wording of this certainly would seem to put people off. Voting really should be made as easy as possible for people.” Grey Collier, an advocacy director at the civil rights group Liberty, said the Woking tactic was part of a “worrying trend to normalise the idea that showing ID to vote safeguards democracy, when it in fact does the opposite.” Collier said: “If you’re young, if you’re a person of colour, if you’re disabled, trans or you don’t have a fixed address, you’re much less likely to have valid photo ID and could therefore be shut out of voting.”
It is understood that the Electoral Commission will not intervene, as the council is only requesting details, and local returning officers are given some discretion over how they run elections locally. Woking says it wanted to have extra safeguards because of previous local cases of postal voting fraud. A council spokesperson said: “We request the additional information to ensure that the person seeking a postal vote both lives at the address and is the person they claim to be. Through this process, the electoral registration officer seeks to ensure the integrity of the election by minimising the risk of electoral fraud.”"
2021-03-01T12:34:00Z,politics,Politics,"Alleged leakers of Labour antisemitism report should not be named, rules judge ","The alleged leakers of a controversial Labour party report into its handling of antisemitism should not be named because it would risk harm to potentially innocent individuals, the high court has ruled. The case was brought by the former senior Labour staffer Emilie Oldknow, who had taken the party to court in an attempt to force it to disclose the identity of the leaker of the report, which contained hundreds of private WhatsApp messages. Oldknow has been ordered to pay the Labour party’s costs and has been refused permission to appeal. Five anonymous individuals, represented by the trade union Unite, who deny any responsibility for the leak, were also represented at the hearing. The report included details of staffers’ private conversations expressing hostility towards the former leader Jeremy Corbyn or his close allies and bemoaning Labour’s better-than-expected performance at the 2017 general election. The report, which was originally prepared for the equalities watchdog but never submitted, concluded that factional hostility towards Corbyn hampered the party’s efforts to tackle antisemitism. Mrs Justice Tipples said that Oldknow’s claim “smacks of a fishing expedition, so that the claimant can cast around to identify potential defendants” to sue. Noting the public interest in the case, the judge said there was “a real risk that the order sought by the claimant … will release the names of innocent persons”. Oldknow’s barrister said the party had kept her “unjustly in the dark” about its conclusions from its investigation into the leak of the report. It is now possible that up to 27 former members of staff named in the report could take action against the party, rather than the individual who leaked the report, who remains anonymous. However, the judge said it was clear that despite the Labour party’s internal investigation, which had identified probable suspects, there were two other ongoing investigations – including the information commissioner’s and the independent review ordered by Keir Starmer by Martin Forde QC. The Forde inquiry has been delayed until the ICO’s investigations are concluded.
Tipples said there was a risk the outcome of other investigations could unearth new information about the order and that Labour’s own investigation did not conclude categorically who was responsible. “In my view, if the Labour party is required to identify individuals … It will be doing no more than identifying a list of who it reasonably believes are to be the culprits,” the judge said. “There is therefore no certainty that the information sought will lead to the identification of the wrongdoer or wrongdoers.” She said there would be “a very real potential to cause harm to any innocent persons as they will then find themselves threatened with legal proceedings, which they will then have to defend”. • This article was amended on 2 March 2021. Mrs Justice Tipples’ formal title uses the honorific “Mrs” rather than “Ms”."
2021-03-01T11:19:30Z,politics,Politics,Lawyers to argue for mother and baby's right to Healthy Start in UK,"An 11-month-old baby and her mother are bringing a case in the high court to try to secure the baby’s right to free vitamins, formula milk and nutritious food. In the first case of its kind, lawyers for the mother and baby are arguing the baby should not be excluded from the UK government’s Healthy Start scheme, which aims to reduce child poverty and health inequalities. The programme provides vitamins, nutritional advice and weekly vouchers to buy healthy food such as fresh fruit and vegetables or infant formula to low-income families with pregnant women and children up to the age of four. It is intended to benefit those with the “greatest need”. However, under current Home Office rules, the eligibility criteria excludes some of the UK’s poorest children from migrant backgrounds. As part of the hostile environment, some migrant families, even if they have the right to live and work in the UK and have British children, are unable to claim mainstream benefits, which is the trigger for eligibility for Healthy Start. Changes to the immigration rules and to the eligibility criteria for welfare in 2012 means many parents who are lawfully in the UK cannot claim any benefits. Studies have shown that children in this group often suffer extreme poverty and deprivation. Thousands of migrant families, often headed by a single mother, are barred from accessing benefits, leaving them in dire “working poverty”. Many have part-time jobs as carers and other kinds of low-paid work to fit around childcare. As a result of these immigration rules, babies and toddlers from the most financially deprived households are going without the nutritious food and vitamins needed for a healthy start in life. In December 2020, judicial review proceedings were launched, challenging the eligibility criteria for the scheme on various grounds, including that it is indirectly discriminatory against children and mothers from black and minority ethnic backgrounds, breaches their human rights and is inconsistent with the intended purpose of the scheme to alleviate poverty among the most economically disadvantaged children. The high court has granted permission for the challenge to proceed to an expedited trial. The income of the mother of the 11-month-old baby is almost 40% less than that received by families claiming welfare benefits, who are eligible for the Healthy Start scheme. On this very low income, the mother is struggling to afford a healthy and nutritious diet for her baby. Olivia Halse, associate solicitor at Matthew Gold & Co, who is bringing the legal challenge, said she welcomed the high court giving the case the green light.
She said: “It is an unfortunate fact that children from low-income families and those of BAME backgrounds are more likely to develop poor nutritional outcomes due to the lack of nutrition they receive at a young age. This can impact their health, development and wellbeing throughout childhood and later in life. This scheme was intended to address these issues and help eliminate food poverty and health inequalities. But the eligibility criteria adopted excludes the very poorest children. “We hope that these legal proceedings will result in a change to the eligibility criteria so that thousands of disadvantaged families, most of whom will be from BAME backgrounds, will be able to benefit from the scheme and these children will have a chance of a healthy start in life.” A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said they could not comment on ongoing legal proceedings."
2021-03-01T07:00:16Z,politics,Politics,Does Boris Johnson stir up team conflict to help make up his mind?,"Downing Street’s union unit disintegrated last week into an all-out factional war among those closest to Boris Johnson. For those who have taken a close interest in his management style, there was a whiff of familiarity about the way the psychodrama played out. Oliver Lewis, a key aide who was appointed to head the No 10 body, quit after just two weeks in the role. His predecessor, Luke Graham, was let go earlier in February, with just weeks to go until the Holyrood elections that some senior Tories fear will result in Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP securing a convincing victory. From a drip of anonymous briefings, Johnson’s partner, Carrie Symonds, has been assigned the role of Lady Macbeth, blamed for being the scheming power behind a put-upon and befuddled prime minister. Lewis has been portrayed as Symonds’ latest victim as she ousts those seen as allies of Johnson’s former chief aide Dominic Cummings. Allegra Stratton, Johnson’s influential new press secretary and a former Guardian journalist, has denied claims this weekend that she has also fallen out with the prime minister’s fiancee. “We are all a nest of singing birds,” she told the Mail on Sunday. Turn back 13 years to when Johnson was elected mayor of London, and he was similarly portrayed as being hit by a slew of rows and walkouts as aides jostled for position over their jobs. Those who worked closely with him say Johnson encourages rows and tensions over policies as he considers all sides of the argument and figures out what he will do next. Some argue that it generates a creative energy in which he thrives and is the process by which he arrives at a final decision. Ask others, and they say he cannot make up his mind until options have been whittled down by time and after those he relies on walk out in exasperation. Andrew Gimson, Johnson’s biographer, who has maintained close relations with those around him, said there is an intellectual restlessness in Johnson that demands that arguments are thoroughly thrashed out before he comes to a conclusion. “Boris would get very, very bored if he was part of some perfectly constructed machine that is humming along calmly. That would drive him mad. The very thing that many of us aspire to and see as a great achievement with him would to him be a positive failure. “He does have a problem making decisions, because he has to have time to argue against the question. He doesn’t accept the premise that you can either have your cake or eat it. He wants to see if there is a way of doing both,” he said. Within weeks of taking up his new role, the mayor had been forced to fire his director of strategy, James McGrath, over recorded remarks suggesting that black people could return to the Caribbean if they were unhappy living in a Tory-controlled London. Then one of his deputy mayors, Ray Lewis, was forced to leave over alleged financial improprieties, which he denied, and an embellished CV. Two weeks later, Tim Parker, a businessman who had been appointed as first deputy mayor in charge of Transport for London and the police, had also departed. One former colleague said the team around Johnson were often rowing and unable to work together. Many hardly knew each other or the new mayor, or had conflicting views on policy. “It was a mess. Boris did not offer any leadership and was telling everyone that their views were his priority. And so everyone was at each other’s throats believing they had the boss’s support.” Guto Harri, the mayor of London’s director of external affairs between 2008 and 2012, said Johnson plucked a disparate group of people including Munira Mirza, his race adviser who has followed him to No 10, with the aim of generating ideas. “What some see as a chaos is often a reflection of the fact that Boris Johnson tends to assemble teams that are genuinely diverse – in intellectual outlook and preoccupations as well as in background. “He’s never had a clique like Jeremy Corbyn’s or David Cameron’s Notting Hill set, standing ready to take power. Some of the people who have worked most successfully with Boris barely knew him a few months before joining his team, so some tensions and misalignment are inevitable. But it also brings more voices to the mix, encouraging a less tribal and broader perspective,” he said. Further evidence of Johnson’s “creative chaos” emerged from his six-year tenure as editor of the Spectator from 1999 – a period that is usually remembered for the colourful “Sextator” bed-hopping exploits of Johnson and other employees. He had engaged in an affair with columnist Petronella Wyatt while married to his second wife, Marina Wheeler – an affair he denied to both the media and his party leader Michael Howard, ending in his sacking as a shadow minister. Gimson, who was the Spectator’s foreign editor under him, said Johnson could be relied upon to eventually bring out a magazine every week. But on the way there, his idiosyncratic methods sought bright ideas and sparky arguments between his staff, as he chewed over future policies. “The thing that many remainers thought was thoroughly unscrupulous – writing two articles for and against leaving the EU before deciding his own position – was because Boris really does generally think there are arguments on both sides, whether that is the European issue or any other issue. “He does want the ferment and wants to know that they have gone into the arguments. Other people might think that is too risky, but it suits him,” Gimson said."
2021-03-01T07:00:16Z,politics,Politics,Scottish Labour leader calls for UK to move closer to single market,"Anas Sarwar has said Labour should shift its policy on the European Union by moving the UK much closer to the single market, distancing himself from Keir Starmer’s refusal to renegotiate Brexit. The newly elected Scottish Labour leader said he would urge Starmer to agree to much closer links with the EU nearer to the next general election in an effort to rebuild Labour’s appeal to Scottish voters. “I support the EU; I want us to have as close a relationship with the European Union as possible. I have been advocating for us to have greater alignment around the single market and customs union ever since the UK voted to leave the union,” Sarwar told the Guardian. Sarwar, who won the leadership contest on Saturday with 57.6% of the overall vote, said his party faced a huge battle to rebuild support in Scotland. Although support for independence has ebbed in the last three polls, they still show Labour in third behind the Scottish National party and Tories, with 10 weeks until May’s election. Sturgeon is expected to make rejoining the EU and independence central to the SNP’s election campaign. Numerous polls show that Labour voters switched support to the Scottish National party before Brexit was completed because of Nicola Sturgeon’s explicit support for the European Union; backing for independence also surged after Boris Johnson became prime minister.
Referring to Starmer’s decision to accept Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal in order to woo back “red wall”, pro-Brexit voters in northern England, Sarwar said Scotland would be better off if the country had much closer links to the EU. In a clear warning to Starmer, Sarwar said Scotland was “the original red wall”. It was where Labour’s vote first collapsed and without a significant recovery for the party in Scotland Starmer would be unable to win the next general election. That did not mean independence was the answer, he said. “I still want Scotland to have as close alignment as possible with the EU but the idea that Scottish independence is a light-switch moment, that is not going to be chaotic, that it isn’t going to take time, and it isn’t going to create more division, is just not credible. “Brexit was bad for Scotland, but independence would be an amplifier, a multiplier of the negatives of Brexit.” Sarwar acknowledged Labour risked alienating Jewish voters after he was described on Saturday as the first ethnic minority leader in a major UK party. There were complaints that excluded Jewish politicians such as Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, Michael Howard, once the Tory leader, and Benjamin Disraeli, the 19th century prime minister. “I do not want us for a moment to downplay the significant achievements of the Jewish community in Scotland and across the UK,” he said. “I was of course meaning in terms of colour, in terms of Asian background and Muslim heritage. I’m very pleased to clarify that.” Sarwar said the party’s main priority after the May election should be tackling the Covid crisis and prioritising economic recovery, alongside rebuilding public services, education and hospitals. He proposed an “education recovery plan” to offer children catch-up classes over the summer. He said that recovery included a concerted attack on rising rates of child poverty, and agreed with the SNP that an increase in universal credit payments introduced temporarily due to the pandemic should be made permanent. The SNP accused Labour’s shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds of failing to accept the case for that during her BBC interview on Sunday with Andrew Marr. Sarwar said the SNP-run Scottish government should also immediately double the £10 a week Scottish child payment, given to families getting Best Start early years grants. “We should increase the rate of universal credit. We have got more and more families being pushed into poverty and that is not acceptable. I would love us to do that across the UK,” he said. “Child poverty is increasing under the SNP and the Tories. It’s all very well political parties in government giving pledges on ending child poverty but they’re in power right now, and child poverty is on the rise. And that’s not acceptable.” He added, however, that the Brexit and Covid crises had exposed serious problems with the UK’s governance and democratic accountability. “I think the UK does need major reform and major surgery. I think the UK is in many ways broken and not working for people,” he said. “I think people in Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester and Cardiff feel that disconnect. I think people in Scotland feel that disconnect too. So I think we do need to prioritise reforming the UK, and the Covid recovery. “The next UK election is still quite a while away and as we head into that election I will be having lots of conversations with Keir and with other colleagues, and arguing for what I believe is in the best interests of Scotland.”"
2021-03-01T07:00:16Z,politics,Politics,Watchdog criticises how UK government appointed Covid ‘tsars’  ,"Criticism of how four Covid-19 “tsars” were put in place has been voiced by an independent watchdog, as a new spotlight also fell on appointments of as many as 19 Tory-linked figures over the past 12 months. “Greater clarity” about the terms on which the four were appointed in areas such as PPE and vaccine procurement “might have helped”, said the head of the public appointments watchdog, who recently expressed concern that the government was presiding over a new wave of political cronyism. The comments by Peter Riddell, an apolitical figure, came as Labour challenged Britain’s most senior civil servant to provide assurances that proper procedures were being followed in appointments. Nineteen roles have been singled out, including the handing of a Home Office job to a close friend of the prime minister without it being advertised, and controversy over the appointment of the Tory peer James Wharton as chair of the Office for Students (OfS). The public are being “left to draw their own conclusions from what appears to be a growing network of senior positions appointed because of links to the Conservative party”, according to a letter from Labour sent to the Cabinet Office secretary on Friday. The challenge by Rachel Reeves, Labour’s frontbench spokesperson on Cabinet Office matters, to “put concerns to bed” comes after alarm bells about political patronage were sounded by the standards watchdog, Jonathan Evans, and Riddell, commissioner for public appointments. Asked if he felt public perceptions of governance had been dented by the recent controversies, Riddell told the Guardian he had seen no polling, but added: “There has certainly been more social media discussion about alleged ‘cronyism’ – usually from the affected sectors – as well as media queries, and I’m in no way complacent about the risks.” While recognising the need to respond quickly to the Covid-19 pandemic in appointing a number of tsars in areas such as PPE and vaccine procurement, with normal competitions impractical, he added: “What might have helped is greater clarity about the terms on which people were being appointed.” He said concerns had been raised over those selected by the government to sit on the panels that appointed people to public roles. “This normally involves an informal discussion between a department and my office, and this presented hardly any problems until last summer when we had a number of cases where names were suggested which were in breach of the code. In each case, I pointed out the clash and an alternative acceptable name was put forward.” Riddell said he was reassured that “efforts are being made within Whitehall to ensure that such problems do not happen again” and stressed there were 1,000 public appointments each year and the vast majority were made properly. The success of Kate Bingham – whose involvement initially raised eyebrows on the basis that she was the wife of a Tory MP – in overseeing the UK’s vaccine taskforce has counteracted some criticism. But allegations of political patronage have been fuelled by recent appointments. They include former Conservative MPs such Wharton and George Hollingbery, whose appointment as ambassador to Cuba raised the ire of civil servant unions. In others, a link to Johnson has been explicit, such as in the appointment this month of his former aide Edward Lister as Middle East envoy. Nimco Ali, a close friend of the prime minister and his fiancee, was meanwhile given an official position at the Home Office without the role being publicly advertised. Other appointees who have faced questions include the new children’s commissioner, Rachel de Souza, who was director of a campaign group with connections to Conservative figures including those close to Johnson. Accusations of cronyism had been prompted last May when two former Conservative MPs, Sir Patrick McLoughlin and Nick de Bois, were appointed to senior tourism jobs despite an apparent lack of direct experience in the sector. Criticism was also levelled at the appointment of the former Tory minister Sarah Newton as chair of the Health and Safety Executive, a move that unions said broke with a practice of having the regulator’s chair come from either a trade union or employer background. All of the above, and others, are listed in Labour’s letter to Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, which called for the civil service to investigate the appointment of Wharton, a former campaign manager for Johnson, as head of the OfS despite him having no experience of the sector. Reeves also asked in the letter to Case for clarification on which roles were advertised, where they were advertised, which codes of conduct the roles must abide by, and which of them are required to follow the “Nolan principles” for public life. Alex Thomas, who was principal private secretary to the late Sir Jeremy Heywood when he was cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, told the Guardian: “Open and fair competition is an important principle when making public appointments. There have been signs that for some appointments the government is trying to subvert the process by stacking panels or briefing out their preferred candidates to dissuade others from applying.” “That’s not the way to get the best people to do these jobs, which, after all, is what ministers should want,” added Thomas, who now leads work on policymaking and the civil service at the Institute for Government thinktank. The issue has blown up again ahead of the looming appointment of the former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre as chair of Ofcom, a move that has been likened to a continuation of a perceived Conservative culture wars “power grab”, after the Tory donor Richard Sharp was named as the new BBC chair and its director generalship went to Tim Davie, a former deputy chair of the Hammersmith and Fulham Conservative party. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “Public appointments are made in accordance with the governance code for public appointments and are regulated by the commissioner for public appointments. “Political affiliation is not a bar to holding a public appointment so long as the individual acts in the national interest – of the 9% appointed which declare significant political activity in recent years, 36% stated this was on behalf of the Conservative party and 46% on behalf of the Labour party. “Other appointments are made in accordance with established procedures.”"
2021-02-28T16:03:24Z,politics,Politics,The union unit: the No 10 team tasked with keeping UK together,"Boris Johnson’s four-person union unit, dedicated to averting Scottish independence, had become used to operating quietly behind the scenes. That is until what one MP termed a “Whitehall psychodrama” exploded and propelled the team into the headlines. Two of its leaders have departed in a matter of weeks, raising awkward questions about how well equipped the Tories really are to stop a separatist surge from Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP at the Holyrood elections in May.
Figures in the UK government are frustrated at what they see as “court politics” causing such a “massive distraction”, especially since Michael Gove has for months led a much larger team of about two dozen Whitehall workers at the union directorate in the Cabinet Office. Ministers and MPs have told the Guardian the government is determined to put the union at the heart of everything it does once the coronavirus crisis has subsided, with plans for a ramping up of visits to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Luke Graham was brought in to steer the No 10 union unit fresh from losing his Ochil and South Perthshire seat in the last election. Though associates regarded him as likeable, he was also deemed to be inexperienced and too much of a “party man” focused on beating the SNP in May’s Scottish parliament elections – a goal some Conservative figures saw as unrealistic and shortsighted. He was let go earlier in February and, in a flurry, the prime minister’s de facto deputy Brexit negotiator, Oliver Lewis – nicknamed “Sonic” – was brought in, credited with being more of a heavyweight in government who would have greater political “buy-in”. Two weeks later, on 19 February, Lewis also resigned – the latest in what has been seen as a clearout of Vote Leave campaigners. “Former disgruntled advisers were influencing him and trying to get him to resign,” an insider claimed, pointing also to the departures of Dominic Cummings and the former director of communications Lee Cain.
Government figures say it is still unknown whether a new special adviser will be picked to take on the “poisoned chalice” of heading the unit, with one noting: “I’m not sure it will continue in the form that it was.” The mantle will instead be taken up by Johnson’s new union strategy committee, which will sit above the union operations committee Gove has been chairing since last summer, which has so far met about 15 times. The idea is the two groups will replicate the apparent success of the Brexit strategy and operations committees – nicknamed “XO” and “XS” – created in the run-up to the UK leaving the EU, to improve inter-government harmony and ultimately lead to a boost in support for the union in the longer term. One minister laid bare the challenge still ahead. “The extent to which this is a priority for the centre to make sure all government departments are baking the union into every single announcement cannot be exaggerated,” they said. “If you have to tell people the union exists, it shows they’ve forgotten.” The former Welsh secretary Stephen Crabb said the new committee was a sign of Johnson’s “serious intent” to step up efforts to protect the union, but conceded the challenge to embed that emphasis in Whitehall was not a new one. He said during his time in government the then cabinet secretary, Jeremy Heywood, talked about his desire for civil servants to consider devolution as part of their day-to-day work. “It’s slightly frustrating that some of these same issues remain,” said Crabb. But another Tory MP speculated the only way to quell calls for another independence vote and satisfy the SNP could be to give in to its demands. “It could be we end up like Quebec and effectively a second referendum has to happen to settle the conversation once and for all,” they said. “The nationalists won’t go away until they’ve been told multiple times.” One Tory MP dismissed the threat posed by the SNP even if it did win a majority in May. “It’s going to take more than an election in May to unpick 300 years of interconnectivity and partnership,” they said. But Peter Cardwell, a former special adviser to two Northern Ireland secretaries, said: “The battle must be fought as if indyref2 is already happening. A positive case for the union must come from the very top, and post-coronavirus I think we can expect to see a lot more cabinet ministers in Scotland especially, selling the benefits of the union, hopefully on a weekly basis.” Another Tory insider confirmed plans were afoot for senior ministers to step up visits to Scotland, Wales and North Ireland and make them as regular as trips to south-west and northern England after the pandemic. A minister said the 2016 Brexit vote showed the public was “up for some life-changing decisions” and that the way to draw people wavering on supporting Scottish independence back to supporting the union was to make a more emotional argument that the UK government “hasn’t cracked yet”. “You’ve got to convince people who they are is not currently who they think they are – and in an age of identity politics, that’s really tough,” they said. “Covid has told people about the value of the military, the NHS and other UK-wide institutions. There’s a story to be told that says: ‘We got through this pandemic together because of who we are and it’s more fundamental to your identity than you might think.’”"
2021-02-28T14:44:05Z,politics,Politics,Budget 2021: the reckoning is coming for Rishi Sunak,"Wednesday 11 March 2020 was a momentous day not only for Rishi Sunak, but for the UK and the world. It was the day Sunak delivered his first budget as chancellor of the exchequer. But it was also when the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic as cases of Covid-19 soared. In his budget, Sunak threw the huge sum of £30bn at Covid-related support. He told the Commons: “There is likely to be a temporary disruption to our economy. For a period, it’s going to be tough.” Much of the rightwing press was still in joyous Brexit mood and, perhaps understandably, failed to see the enormity of the moment and extent of the disaster to come. “Rishi’s marvellous medicine” was how the Daily Mail greeted his spending spree to combat Covid on 12 March, as if it were a challenge the omni-competent new star of the Conservative party could tackle with ease. “Rishi: the teetotal chancellor who is the toast of post-Brexit Britain”, said a light-hearted headline in the Daily Telegraph. This Wednesday, after 12 months in which 122,000 people in the UK have lost their lives to Covid, the total cost of measures announced by Sunak on virus-related spending will – in all probability – exceed £300bn, fully 10 times the massive sum pledged a year ago. That will not be the end of it. Tens if not hundreds of thousands of businesses are close to bankruptcy. On high streets, shops, restaurants, pubs and hairdressers remain closed in a third lengthy lockdown. The costs stretch far into the future as ever more financial life support is needed and the threat of mass, long-term unemployment grows, hovering over a generation of young people. As we report today, Sunak will pledge a further £5bn to help businesses on the high streets. The pain is real and the money needed. This is easily evident in the east London borough of Redbridge, where the manager of a local pawnbroker is frank about the difficulties. “We’re just winging it, trying to get through,” said 51-year-old Dave, wincing as he contemplated the future of his business. After a year of planning, Cash Concepts arrived in Redbridge on 5 December, shortly before Redbridge was placed into tier 4 restrictions. It was a tough start and it has been downhill ever since. “People can’t even come in to browse,” he said motioning to the desk blocking the store entrance. Across Barkingside High Street is its competitor, H&T Pawnbrokers. Staff were sitting behind a Perspex shield and though customers are allowed to enter, none was present yesterday. Manager Ranjit described it as “quiet” with knowing understatement. He said: “We’re here for the customers, people need money. A lot of people are getting laid off and people are on furlough.” At Papa John’s Pizza, staff said business was roughly the same as 12 months ago despite a number of factors changing the customer profile. A staff member said: “The stay at home message helped us: people are afraid, they order takeaway food and there is less competition, no restaurants are open and this has been good. But there is less money around, people are starting to get scared as jobs go and they might not buy as many pizzas in the future.” So, in the words of one Tory MP, there is a sense that Wednesday will be a sobering day: “I think this is the moment when we really will confront the hard financial realities of all of this. So far, it has been about handling a public health disaster. This budget will be a fork in the road, when we see financial consequences and painful choices we have to make as politicians.” A senior Treasury official emphasised that Sunak’s themes would be “support” for the economy through the remainder of the pandemic, “recovery” after it, and “honesty” about the bills that will inevitably be in the post for some time to come. In an interview published in the Financial Times yesterday, Sunak said: “When I got the job, I had three weeks to prepare a budget. I thought it would be the hardest thing professionally I would have to do in my life. It turned out, probably, to be the easiest thing I did in my first year in the job. It has been a tough year. There was no playbook. We had to move at speed and scale.”
The sheer scale of that unforeseen spending, and the way it has propelled government borrowing to the highest levels seen in the UK in peacetime, will be an unavoidable, underlying and, for some, scary theme of the budget speech. For Tories brought up on Thatcherite economics and more recently on George Osborne’s pledges to run a budget surplus –he wanted to balance the books by 2015 and then move into the black – it will be a different economic reality altogether. The most recent figures show the deficit – the difference between what the government spends and what it receives in taxes – stood at £8.8bn in January. It is the first January deficit in 10 years and the worst since modern records began, as January is usually a key revenue-raising month because it is when taxpayers submit their self-assessment returns. This means the deficit will hit between 13% and 14% of the gross domestic product (GDP) measure of the size and health of the economy, which far outstrips the huge 9.8% following the recession of 2009. The City bank ING said it expected the deficit in the next financial year to remain in high single digit figures. Its chief economist, James Smith, said an extension of the furlough scheme, which currently covers 4.7 million workers, subsidies for industries still affected by restrictions, and the impact of rising unemployment will all eat bigger holes in Whitehall budgets. In the hospitality sector and among other consumer services, where restrictions will remain well beyond the summer, alarm bells are ringing louder than ever. More than half of these firms are now reporting they have less than four months’ cash in reserve, according to the Office for National Statistics. Smith said: “While it’s hard to know how these figures compare with pre-pandemic norms, the fact that a third of hospitality firms say they have little or no confidence they can survive the next three months is striking.” Ian Stewart, chief economist at the accountancy firm Deloitte, said the UK had a particular problem when the government was forced to shut face-to-face activities, adding: “As a consumption-heavy economy, the UK has been especially badly hit by lockdowns. More than that, an unusually high proportion of UK consumer spending – 21%, more than in any other G7 nation – goes on so-called socially consumed services such as meals out, leisure activities and holidays. Lockdowns have put paid to such spending, reinforcing the UK downturn.” Last week, 388 business leaders supporting the Fighting Back for Business campaign led by Simon Dolan, the founder of Jota Aviation, wrote to the chancellor calling for debts accrued through government-backed loans to be written off for small and medium-sized firms. Niall Douglas, managing director of Full Circle Travel, a travel consultancy, said: “The travel industry is facing an existential crisis with the prospect of recovery potentially stretching for years and Brexit difficulties continuing to blight the hopes of many operators.” Given that Sunak needs to maintain support for businesses trapped in lockdown, continue to fund 4.7 million people on furlough, pay the mounting benefits bill (he will extend the £20 a week uplift for those receiving universal credit) – not to mention fund the NHS – what could his strategy be to prevent spending surging even beyond what has historically been seen as acceptable in his own party?
If it were simply a question of economics, the task would be hard enough for a Tory chancellor. But after a general election that Boris Johnson won after turning dozens of seats blue in “red wall” Labour areas of the north and Midlands, the challenge is even more daunting. David Gauke, a former treasury minister, said: “At the last general election, the Conservative party was able to unite a coalition of voters – those from more affluent seats and those in ‘red wall’ seats – around Brexit. But it is much more difficult to do so around issues of economics and how we pay the bills for the pandemic. I think that is a large part of the problem that Rishi Sunak will face on Wednesday.” The last thing Tories in deprived “red wall” areas want is for their government, which promised to “level up”, to now impose cuts and tax rises, particularly on the small businesses that keep their towns and cities alive. With Sunak said to be considering rises in corporation tax, the Tory MP for Carlisle, John Stevenson, is one of many who says such increases must be avoided if they would hurt areas like his. He insisted yesterday it was too early to push up taxes and emphasised that generous support would be needed for months to come. In a move that also highlighted the issues for Sunak, a predecessor in the job, Kenneth Clarke, yesterday floated the idea of increasing taxes on older, wealthier people still in work – which will not please many other Conservative MPs and their constituents. Clarke said the pandemic had been unfair financially on “the poor, the young, the low-paid, the vulnerable”. He suggested making people who continue in full-time work after state pension age – who do not currently have to pay national insurance contributions – pay the same as younger people. Sunak has made it clear he plans to begin reining in spending and bringing down the deficit before the year is out. But will he be able to do that and would doing so make economic sense? This same debate preoccupies economists and governments across the world. Here in the UK the centre-left thinktank, the IPPR, said Sunak should stick to an expansionary outlook, deny oxygen to any backbenchers who worry about debt, and spend big over the rest of the parliament, mimicking the Biden administration’s plans for a $1.9tn spending spree. It suggested that £190bn of public investment and anti-poverty measures would give the lift needed to overcome the inevitable shake-out from the disease that will see many businesses go to the wall. Sunak is not, however, a natural spender and will fear the inflationary effect of any spending spree that could lead to sudden growth spurts and the threat of interest rate rises. In the budget, his anxiety about rising inflation, and the possibility that central banks would need to increase interest rates to calm rising prices, will be central. Other economic and political balances have to be struck. No 10 is wary of allowing a lopsided recovery that sees the well-off jetting from one restaurant to another while others see reductions in their disposable incomes as a result of rises in taxation, including council tax. That is why signals have gone out from the Treasury-No 10 joint policy unit that taxes on wealth – capital gains tax and inheritance tax – and a hefty hike in corporation tax, will target those households and businesses that have profited from the pandemic. But again such moves will run into opposition not only from Tories concerned about hitting the rich but also the Labour party, whose leader, Keir Starmer, has said it is too early in the recovery to consider tax rises of any kind. As a former Tory cabinet minister put it: “It is not just the economics of this budget that are seriously daunting because of the pandemic. It is the politics of it that are equally nightmarish.” Keep an eye out First-time buyers A revamped “Help to Buy” scheme that provides cash-strapped first-time buyers with a Treasury-backed loan guarantee on properties worth up to £600,000.

2021-02-28T11:15:04Z,politics,Politics,"Using photo ID in British elections will harm democracy, say US civil rights groups","Plans to force people to show photo ID to take part in UK elections amount to Republican-style voter suppression and are likely to erode faith in the democratic process rather than reinforce it, three leading US civil rights groups have warned. In an intervention that could prove embarrassing to ministers, US groups that were at the frontline of efforts to combat vote-blocking efforts by Donald Trump and his allies, said ID laws disproportionately affected people from poorer and more marginalised communities. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), and Commons Cause said that while they did not campaign directly in the UK it was a common principle that such laws, without evidence of widespread election fraud, had a harmful impact. Boris Johnson’s government is due to introduce a bill in the spring to make photo ID mandatory from 2023 for all UK-wide and English elections following two years of small-scale trials, despite repeated warnings from charities and others about its impact on groups less likely to possess the necessary documents. “The real reason these laws are passed is to suppress the vote, and that is in fact what happens,” Caren Short, senior staff attorney with the SPLC, told the Guardian. “There are certain communities that do not possess the required ID, or the underlying documents required to get the ID, and so it makes it harder for those folks to vote. That is what these laws are designed to do, and that is in fact what they do.” Molly McGrath, a voting rights campaign strategist for the ACLU, said voter ID is “not about proving who you are – it’s about excluding the people who are least likely to have that ID”. She said: “I can go to almost any place and find somebody who’s been disenfranchised. I’ve never gone to a food bank and not found somebody who needs an ID so they can vote.” UK ministers insist a law is needed to combat what is officially termed voter personation – someone going to a polling station to physically cast a vote while pretending to be someone else. But critics point out that the offence is virtually unknown in the UK. Following the 2019 general election, there was one conviction for voter personation. Between 2010 and 2016, spanning two general elections and the EU referendum, there were 146 allegations with seven convictions, including five in one single incident. UK charities representing groups including older people, those from minority ethnic backgrounds and the homeless have urged the government to reconsider the law. Sylvia Albert, the director of voting and elections at Common Cause, a Washington DC-based civil rights group, said introducing voter ID when there was negligible evidence of a problem tended to have the paradoxical effect of making voters trust elections less. “They try to say that they want to protect the integrity of the election, but the reality that our elections have strong integrity,” she said. “By doing this you’re actually undermining their integrity. “Instituting aspects of voter suppression, including voter ID, is allowing the politicians to choose their voters, and that is not the strength of a democracy.” Whereas the UK trials of voter ID at English council elections in 2018 and 2019 permitted different areas to show a variety of documents, the law is expected to mandate photo ID such as a passport or driving licence. Those who do not have such ID will need to apply to their local council in advance of elections. Cat Smith, Labour’s shadow Cabinet Office minister, said the government “should heed the warnings of these respected civil rights groups, who have seen first-hand the undemocratic and discriminatory impact of mandating voter ID at elections”. The ID law is also opposed by the Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru and Greens. A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said mandatory ID was “a reasonable way to combat the inexcusable potential for voter fraud in our current system and strengthen its integrity”, and that the “overwhelming majority” of people were able to vote successfully in the pilots. She added: “We will make sure this policy works for everyone. There will be free electoral ID available locally and we continue to work with a broad range of charities and civil society organisations.”"
2021-02-28T10:34:39Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak indicates furlough scheme could remain beyond April,"Rishi Sunak has indicated that emergency support measures such as the furlough scheme will be extended beyond the end of April in the budget on Wednesday. In an interview on Sunday, the chancellor also ruled out speeding up the easing of lockdown even if the data improved and defended his “eat out to help out” scheme. The number of furloughed workers in the UK rose by 700,000 to 4.7 million in January, during the third Covid lockdown, according to official figures. The scheme pays up to 80% of salaries to those who cannot work because of Covid-19 restrictions. Asked by Sophy Ridge on Sky News if there would be an extension of the furlough scheme, Sunak said he would “do whatever it took” to support workers. “I said at the beginning of this crisis that I would do whatever it took to protect people, families and businesses through this crisis and I remain completely committed to that. The PM in the roadmap set out a path for us to recover and reopen and I want to support people and businesses along that path. “I’m not going to comment on specific policies but I want to make sure people realise that we are going to be there to support them and if you look at our track record we went big, we went early and there’s more to come next week,” he said.
In the interview, Sunak ruled out speeding up the easing of lockdown even if data showed an improvement in the situation. “What we want is a cautious but irreversible approach. That’s why we’ve taken the approach that we have and those will be the earliest dates that we think we can do the various things we’ve laid out. But we’re doing everything we can to make sure that it is hopefully irreversible, that’s what we want to see.” “What businesses don’t want is a stop-start approach to this, we want to know that it’s a one-way road and that’s why it’s cautious. We’ve given the earliest of dates to give a sense of timing and a sense of direction and then obviously we might have to adjust those if things are not going exactly as we would like, but look the early signs are promising.” He also defended the “eat out to help out” scheme from claims that it helped increase coronavirus infection rates amid reports that it could be reintroduced. “Areas where ‘eat out to help out’ was used the most, for example in the south-west, were the slowest to see any rise and in fact had very low infection rates. And almost all other major countries have had rises over the autumn and winter and they didn’t have ‘eat out to help out’ so I think it’s a bit odd to ascribe causality in that way,” he said. Sunak on Sunday refused to confirm whether he planned to reintroduce the contentious scheme but defended the decision to subsidise trips to pubs and restaurants last summer amid criticism that it contributed to the second wave of the virus in the UK. “Lots of things we do cause transmission. We have to balance all of these things and those are difficult decisions we all have to make,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. The Treasury counts the scheme, which cost £522m, as a success, with more than 100m meals claimed in August 2020. Amid reports that he will announce a “stealth tax” on income on Wednesday, Sunak did not deny that he plans to increase taxes soon before slashing them in a pre-election budget. Asked as reported last month if he told Conservative MPs that he would seek to raise taxes now and then cut them before the election, he told Ridge: “I would like to be able to keep taxes low for people in general, I’m a Conservative and I believe in that. “But I want to deliver our promises that we made to the British people that we would be responsible with their money, that we would look after the nation’s finances and we would deliver strong public services.
“I think in the short-term what we need to do is protect the economy and keep supporting the economy through the roadmap, and over time what we need to do is make sure our public finances are sustainable. “That isn’t going to happen overnight, that’s going to be work that takes time given the scale of the shock that we’ve experienced but if you’re asking do I want to deliver low taxes for people, of course I do.” Former cabinet ministers Jeremy Hunt and Damian Green have urged Boris Johnson to use the budget to produce a long-awaited plan to pay for social care’. “We have a 10-year plan for the NHS. But two years after it was published there is still nothing similar for the social care system, even though the NHS plan will fail without one because the two systems are totally inter-dependent,” they wrote on the Telegraph’s website. “This budget is the time to announce that such a plan for social care will be developed and published ahead of the Spending Review in the autumn.”"
2021-02-28T09:22:01Z,politics,Politics,Budget 2021: Sunak’s £5bn plan to rescue high streets from collapse,"The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is to offer 700,000 shops, pubs, restaurants, hotels and other businesses, grants of up to £18,000 each as part of a £5bn rescue scheme to prevent mass bankruptcies. News of the plan – to be announced in Wednesday’s budget – comes as Sunak faces increasing pressure to avoid or postpone significant corporation tax rises, as companies struggle to weather the latest Covid-19 lockdown in a strong enough state to reopen. While there were questions last night over the extent to which the grants were extensions to schemes due to finish at the end of March or new beefed-up initiatives, the move reflects growing panic in government that many small firms on the high streets and elsewhere are now on the brink of extinction.
Last week almost 400 leaders of small and medium-sized firms from the “Fighting Back for Business” campaign wrote to the chancellor calling for debts accrued through government-backed loans to be entirely written off to avoid many tens of thousands of companies crashing into insolvency. Under the budget plans, non-essential retail businesses will be eligible for direct cash grants of up to £6,000 a site to help them start trading again when allowed to do so. Hospitality, accommodation, leisure, personal care and gym businesses in England – which will remain closed for longer under the government’s roadmap out of lockdown – will be able to apply for grants of £18,000 per site. Sunak said last night: “Our local businesses have been hit hard by the pandemic – which is why we went big and went early with a multibillion pound package of support. There’s now light at the end of the tunnel and this £5bn of extra cash grants will ensure our high streets can open their doors with optimism.” Local authorities in England will also get an extra £425m to distribute to businesses not eligible for the restart grants but nonetheless experiencing a severe impact on their business due to public health restrictions. As business grants are a devolved issue, the administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will receive £794m of extra funding to distribute to businesses. Sunak’s budget is expected to see the total cost of Covid-related business, employment and other support measures rise to more than £300bn. While rumours have been circulating that the chancellor has been looking to order a sharp rise in corporation tax to try to claw back money spent during the pandemic, there has been heavy lobbying from Tory MPs, particularly in red wall seats, to spare businesses any more pain. The chancellor is also expected to announce measures to support house buying, including a time-limited extension to the stamp duty holiday on sales, and help for people hoping to get on the property ladder. But as he faces a series of painful choices, he is expected to ignore calls from NHS leaders for another £10bn for the health service to help it cope with the huge backlog of operations, the growing impact of “long Covid” and a surge in people needing mental health support. According to senior NHS sources, Sunak plans to ignore the demands and give the service no more than a few hundred million. “We’re expecting to be disappointed on Wednesday,” said one. Another NHS insider said he expected the chancellor to give the service no extra cash at all and to postpone any decision about increasing its budget from this Wednesday until this year’s autumn statement. As the budget approaches there are more signs that the government may be winning back some public support for its handling of Covid-19. In the latest Opinium poll for the Observer, the Tories have stretched their lead to 7 points over Labour, the highest since July last year. The Tories are also still seen as more trusted on the economy after a year of the pandemic, with 39% saying they trust Sunak and Boris Johnson most on economic issues, against 25% who would trust Labour leader Keir Starmer and shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds. Last night business leaders said the £5bn in grants to help small firms would be vital for helping those businesses that have suffered as a result of circumstances beyond their control. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, said: “Closure costs are still racking up. This money will go a long way to covering those costs and setting businesses up for a successful restart.”
Craig Beaumont, chief of external affairs at the Federation of Small Businesses, heralded the “significant cash injection”, which he said would “help thousands of businesses survive through these final restrictions, and then help drive the vaccine-enabled recovery”. With Sunak struggling to identify ways to claw back funds into the exchequer, the independent Resolution Foundation said on Sunday that freezing tax thresholds would raise £6bn a year by 2024-25, a significant contribution to the post-crisis fiscal consolidation that will be required. It added that a staggered rise in corporation tax, from 19% to 22% by the end of the parliament, would raise £10bn a year by 2024-25. Even delaying the start of the freeze until next year would raise similar revenues, as low inflation means tax thresholds are not due to rise by much this year anyway."
2021-02-28T09:15:09Z,politics,Politics,Government seeks to retain lockdown limits on protests,"Concern over the government’s limitation of the right to protest during lockdown continues to mount after it emerged that the home secretary, Priti Patel, is eager to grant police greater powers to control demonstrations once the Covid restrictions are lifted. In a letter to HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) Patel wrote that although she appreciates protest is “a cornerstone of our democracy” she wanted to know how the Home Office could help police ensure protests in the future do not impact on “the rights of others to go about their daily business”.
In a letter to Sir Thomas Winsor, the head of HMICFRS, dated last September but just released under freedom of information laws, Patel wrote: “I would like to know ... what steps the government could take to ensure the police have the right powers and capabilities to respond to protests.” Campaign groups such as Liberty argue that police already have extensive powers to control or ban protests and arrest individuals who stray from police-imposed conditions. Patel recently described last year’s Black Lives Matter protests as “dreadful” after previously calling them illegal. BLM demonstrators have claimed they were subjected to intimidating police tactics such as kettling, and a report from the monitoring coalition Netpol alleged the policing of the protests was “institutionally racist”. Patel’s letter to Winsor has prompted a review by the inspectorate into how effectively the police manage protests. Its findings will help Patel prepare a new law to curb protests that it is understood will target those that block parliament or affect judicial hearings, among other criteria. There is growing concern that the government has used the pandemic to suffocate protest. Gracie Bradley, the interim director of Liberty, said Covid regulations passed as emergency laws appear to create a blanket ban on organising and attending protests, which was a disproportionate restriction of human rights. “It’s a failure to prioritise what is the exercise of a fundamental democratic right and one that is all the more important given the government’s propensity to sideline parliament in the course of dealing with this pandemic,” she said. “The government is clearly intent on shielding itself from scrutiny, whether it’s parliament, freedom of information, or protest.” Policing minister Kit Malthouse said any claim that planned reforms were linked to the temporary ban on protests during the lockdown was “inaccurate.” In a statement, Malthouse added: “Peaceful protest is a cornerstone of our democracy and the government will be in the vanguard of protecting our inalienable right to express our views by nonviolent means. “But this must be carefully balanced with the rights of others to go about their business, and not seek to prevent the operation of our democracy. That is why we undertook some time ago to review the 30 year old public order legislation, to make sure we have that delicate and important balance right.”"
2021-02-28T08:45:08Z,politics,Politics,Theatre designer warns of obstacles for arts workers in Europe post-Brexit,"A British opera and theatre designer has told of an “intimidating” post Brexit experience in Schiphol airport in Amsterdam which nearly cost him his first paid job since the pandemic started a year ago. Andrew Edwards says the “roadblock” he experienced is a foretaste of the “humiliation” to come once Europe reopens its borders with musicians, crews, and crafts people working in the arts now required to have paperwork to ply their trade in each country. In an open letter to Boris Johnson and the Brexit minister Lord Frost, he urges the government to reopen talks to negotiate an EU-wide visa system for touring arts workers and to launch a one-stop portal “providing clear information about the paperwork and access requirements for freelancers to travel and work within Europe”. His open letter has been signed by 114 signatories including choreographers, lighting directors, actors, and designers. Edwards, who works everywhere from the Globe to France’s national theatre, the Comédie-Francaise, says he was “embarrassed” to be British and fears for his future livelihood which up to now has relied 80% on EU clients for work. He was in transit to Austria where he was due to fulfil a contract for a production of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert due to open in April. But he ended up missing his connecting flight after border officials kept him waiting for 45 minutes before approving him for onward travel. He then had to wait two days in Amsterdam, at his own expense, to get the earliest next flight to Austria. He said he had all the paperwork now needed for artists, musicians and theatre production staff to work in the EU, but claimed he was singled out with other British passport holders for questioning about his right to travel after his flight touched down. “It is really embarrassing being British and I didn’t used to think that. I used to be really proud of my country but I’m not proud of what we do,” he said. From 1 January the Dutch government imposed an entry ban on all non-EU and non-Schengen state nationals who were travelling with “non-essential purposes due to EU-wide Covid-19 restrictions”. He says he was fully aware of the current travel restrictions apply to those trying to enter the Schengen area, but he had all his paperwork in order including negative Covid tests, and a letter from the Austrian authorities permitting him entry to the country for “essential” business.
“When I got off the flight in Amsterdam, all passenger Covid tests where checked before we were allowed in the terminal. “However, when we got to border control an official was shouting out ‘EU passports’ please use the electronic gates, British passports and other nationalities you have to queue. “I asked the official if ‘my passport is still the old EU type [with burgundy cover] can I use the gates?’ She laughed and said ‘I am afraid not, you have to have your papers checked’,” he said. “It was completely humiliating”. The culture secretary Oliver Dowden has said his department is working to resolve the issues but Edwards says he feels self-employed workers like him will get left behind.
Even if freedom of movement is not restored for touring and visiting artists, crews and crafts people, the government must move swiftly to enable freelancers to continue to ply their trade post Brexit, said Edwards in his letter. “We cannot wait four years for a solution to this crisis, we must get back to the table with Europe,” he said. He and his fellow signatories want the government to immediately set up a portal “that provides clear information about the paperwork and access requirements for freelancers to travel and work within Europe”. And they want Johnson and Frost to return to the negotiating table and reopen talks with Brussels on “creating a clear and functional system providing visas and work permits within Europe, allowing entry to Europe as a whole, not country by country.” The issue of work permits for musicians and others in the culture sector has, along with the restrictions on fishers, become emblematic of the government’s sovereignty-first Brexit policy with work permits and carnets for equipment now needed across the EU. “The arts freelancer culture workforce is a hidden backbone of the British economy with £7.7bn contributed annually,” said Edwards. “The truth is freelancers are falling into unemployment” and may not be able to deliver on “work and commitments” that “can be scheduled years in advance”. A government spokesman said “Due to the ongoing pandemic, many countries including some EU member states are applying restrictions on entry for British nationals. We advise everyone to check FCDO travel advice for the country they are travelling to before leaving.” The culture minister Nigel Huddleston said that the “door always remains open” for further talks. “A working group has been set up by the secretary of state to look at any obstacles which might face British performers seeking to tour,” he said."
2021-02-28T06:30:06Z,politics,Politics,Labour unveils plan for young people sacked after Covid furlough ,"Young people who have been furloughed before being made redundant, or out of work for six months, would be guaranteed training, education or work placements geared to the needs of the post-pandemic economy, under ambitious plans unveiled on Sunday by Labour. The pledge to youngsters, whose progress in the jobs market has been blighted by Covid-19, comes as party analysis of House of Commons library figures suggests that more than one million people will become “long-term unemployed” (out of work for more than a year) during 2021 and 2022. The data also suggests that 660,000 16- to 24-year-olds will reach a point where they have spent six months out of work, education or training during the same period, at what they hoped would be the start of their working lives. Announcing Labour’s new plan before this week’s budget, the shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Reynolds said that “without immediate action” the UK would find it had created “a lost generation that will put Britain’s recovery at risk”.
He said government schemes, such as Kickstart and Restart, which are aimed at helping young people into work and preventing long-term unemployment, were too complex and not geared to providing jobs in sectors relevant to the specific challenges of society in the 2020s. As the well as offering guarantees to those aged 16 to 24, under the Labour plan no one above the age of 24 would have to be involuntarily away from work or training for more than 12 months, at which point they, too, would be assured a place in training, education or a job placement, whether this were an apprenticeship or other position. Again, any period an individual had spent on furlough prior to losing their job would be counted towards the 12-month qualification period. Reynolds told the Observer that the plans could be delivered and paid for by simplifying and bringing forward £4.5bn of spending on government job schemes that he said had failed to deliver on their objectives. Labour has already demanded that the government put unspent funds from its apprenticeship levy towards a wage subsidy that could create 85,000 new apprenticeships. Anyone who had been made redundant from furlough would be guaranteed instant access to job-finding support through a work coach without the need to claim social security. A government spokesperson said: “This Conservative government will take no lessons from the Labour party on getting people back into work. “The Kickstart scheme has created more than 120,000 jobs for young people in less than six months.” Recent Institute for Employment Studies analysis showed there will be 175,000 Restart places created by the end of December 2021 yet 275,000 people will have reached twelve months of unemployment on Universal Credit by that time."

The vaccination figures are shocking. Nearly 20 million first doses administered. A forward-thinking procurement plan. The leading large nation, far ahead of the US and, more gallingly for us frothing Remoaners, miles ahead of Europe. Nothing could be more depressing for the honest self-loathing liberal Brit. You know the type. Recycle assiduously but fly once a fortnight. We can’t say we haven’t had a good run. The past few years have been wonderful. Any positive stories could be written off as a fluke or a statistical aberration. There has been abundant bad news to confirm what we already knew: Britain is a sad, grey little Plague Island in the Atlantic, incapable of relinquishing its past glories and heading full tilt towards irrelevance. Brexit has been Gloomster Glastonbury.
The early days of the pandemic were promising, too. We had the dithering over lockdown, the PPE fiasco and the Barnard Castle drive-by. All reinforced our narrative of total incompetence. A simple eye-roll was usually enough to convey your membership of the told-you-so club. What do you expect from 10 years of Tory rule? The turkeys voted for Christmas. It’s our children and grandchildren I’m worried about. The self-loathers hadn’t had it so good since Suez. But this year life is increasingly bewildering. The test-and-trace fiasco was comforting. It proved that when the Tories combine public money with private businesses, an orgy of cronyism ensues. Yet the vaccine programme has turned out to be a slick collaboration between hard-nosed businesspeople, big pharma and the academic establishment. It’s almost as confusing as Gillian Anderson playing Margaret Thatcher. Even Private Eye conceded that they’d been “harsh” on vaccine tsar Kate Bingham. It turns out it might not only be vaccinations that Britain is excelling at. An article in the Economist, not normally given to jingoism, pointed out the UK’s success in cutting carbon emissions. For several months last year the UK burned no coal. It looks likely that soon it won’t burn any at all. You might argue we’ve outsourced emissions to China, but so has everyone else. The bitterest pill is that we’re beating Germany. Germany, the nation self-loathing Brits revere more than any other. Germany, which welcomes every immigrant, has sensible governments, and has only ever craved peaceful European integration. It transpires that several of the dozen or so vaccines Germany thought to order have been ensnared in red tape. Surely the pandemic can’t have exposed shortcomings in having a pan-continental uber-bureaucracy?
Wasn’t all that technik meant to lead to a bit of vorsprung? The front page of Bild, one of Germany’s main tabloids, last Wednesday read “Britain, We Envy You”. While Eeyorish Mrs Merkel warns of yet another lockdown, with less than 10% of her population vaccinated, our flaxen-haired prime minister leads his nation towards a summer of Weimar excess. Mutti, how could you forsake your fans in Islington like this? The American economics professor Tyler Cowen, in a blog about the Economist piece, said Britain was “grossly underrated”, also pointing out our performance in AI and London’s enduring appeal as a global city. Our bond yields are substantially higher than Germany’s, indicating that hopes of recovery are better advanced. At the time of writing it looks as though the European Football Championships, originally to be played across the continent, will be held solely in England, a neat metaphor for this confusing year. There are glimmers of light for gloomsters. Amsterdam has taken over as Europe’s share-trading capital? Tell me more. Lorry delays and export nightmares? Give it to me neat. But everywhere we look there are questions without easy answers. Does Ed Davey deserve some credit? Is Matt Hancock not the literal devil? Is the UK actually… good? We must be thankful for the cricketers. Presumably reading about the vaccination rates from their bubble in Gujarat, they took the trouble to engineer one of their most craven defeats in memory. When everything else is looking up, it’s nice to have failures you can rely on."
2021-02-27T20:00:33Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson’s poll lead over Labour boosted by Covid vaccine rollout ,"The Conservatives have secured their biggest lead over Labour since last summer amid signs Boris Johnson is benefiting from a “vaccine bounce”, the latest Opinium poll for the Observer has revealed. A year into the pandemic, the poll gives the Tories a 7-point lead over Labour, up from 5 points a fortnight ago. It is the biggest lead since July, with the Conservatives on 43% of the vote and Labour down 1 point on 36%. It also suggests greater public support for the government’s handling of the latest phase of the pandemic and the roadmap out of lockdown measures.
In the week of the budget, the poll revealed that the Tories maintain a clear lead over Labour in terms of economic trust. Almost two-fifths (39%) said they most trusted Johnson and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to handle the economy, while 25% backed Keir Starmer and the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds. The findings represent a reality check for Labour and Starmer, who managed to eliminate a huge Tory lead after taking over from Jeremy Corbyn last April. He used a major speech this month to give details of his plans for the economy, pledging to build a “strong partnership with businesses” in the post-Covid recovery. The latest Opinium poll suggests that public opinion is beginning to shift. Approval of the government’s handling of Covid has risen, with 36% now approving, up 3 points, and 45% disapproving – unchanged from a fortnight ago. About 47% think the government’s roadmap for easing lockdown restrictions in England is set at the right pace. However, 31% believe it is too quick and 12% believe it is too slow.
Approval of Johnson as prime minister, which has been low for some time, is recovering. About 39% approve of the job he is doing and 41% disapprove, giving him a net score of -2. Starmer’s approval rating is also up slightly, with 33% approving of the job he is doing and 28% disapproving, giving a net score of +5. Johnson holds a lead when it comes to who would make the best prime minister, with 33% backing him and 25% Starmer, down 2 points on a fortnight ago. Adam Drummond, associate director of Opinium, said: “After spending much of 2020 on the backfoot regarding its handling of coronavirus, the ongoing success of the vaccine rollout has rejuvenated the government’s poll ratings with a now clear Conservative lead over Labour, as well as improvements in Boris Johnson’s job approval figures.
“Unlike the 2020 summer or Christmas ‘unlocking’ (both of which voters were sceptical of), this time the government’s planned roadmap is seen as about right by most voters.” Drummond added: “With the budget this week, the discussion moving on to economics also favours the Conservatives, where Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson have a substantial lead over Keir Starmer and Anneliese Dodds. The question is whether the chancellor’s announcements will maintain that advantage, given the public appetite for increased spending and taxes on corporations and high earners.” Opinium polled 2,003 people online on 25-26 February."
2021-02-27T17:00:30Z,politics,Politics,"Austerity is alive and well, and giving public services a kicking | Phillip Inman","There are plenty of ways to measure austerity. Before, during and after the budget this week, voters will hear Rishi Sunak herald the end of tight spending as the government builds a bridge from the pandemic to a glorious recovery. What economists do when they want to kick the tyres on such claims is look at the Treasury’s books. They want to see whether public spending is contracting or expanding. And if there is a squeeze, we can be said to be living in a period of austerity. In the period when George Osborne was chancellor, his supporters would claim that after the first two years of his reign, the spending taps were turned on again and austerity was no more. Many were unhappy that the state was playing a significant role – believing more austerity was justified – while becoming incandescent with rage that those on the left were perpetuating the “austerity myth”. Most economists continued to tag the Treasury as “austere” because inflation meant that public sector budgets were underwater in real terms. An increase in cash is still a cut when the rate of inflation is higher, and especially when the rising prices are affecting the government and its agencies. This macro view of government spending is what lies behind Sunak’s shock and disbelief when he is accused of sticking with austerity.
The message from the Treasury is that a chancellor who is on the cusp of borrowing around £400bn to rescue the economy, and who has kickstarted the largest public works programme for 20 years, cannot be bracketed as an austerity-monger with Osborne, and certainly not with Philip Hammond, who doubled down on Osborne’s approach during his years in No 11. A more nuanced assessment by the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that the trends set in the Osborne years – when spending went up in just a few areas of government, while others were left to starve – will continue next year and probably for the rest of the parliament. Sunak, like his predecessors, will protect health, schools and the state pension. To this short list he will add the police and border control, giving large parts of the Home Office a break from decades of grinding cuts. Local government, cultural organisations and unloved departments such as Justice have received bailouts that make up some of the shortfall in pandemic spending, but nothing like enough. If the effect is therefore waiting months to appear at a crown court – if it is finding a library open only on Thursdays, a children’s centre sold or an appointment for a mental health issue delayed by a year – then austerity remains with us. When the Environment Agency, the Crown Prosecution Service and the Health & Safety Executive have to go on operating with a skeleton workforce, while the Victoria & Albert museum and Tate galleries need to cut staff to pull back from the brink of insolvency, then austerity is a way of life. And away from Whitehall, the sign on every town hall reads “welcome to austerity” ahead of the sixth year of inflation-busting council tax rises planned for April, which will hit low- and middle-income earners the hardest. The 5% jump sanctioned by the Treasury is supposed to be a generous loosening of the purse strings when inflation is only 0.7%. That would be true if the £1.9bn of “spending power” that counties, boroughs and districts will gain were to be drawn from borrowed funds along with the rest of the chancellor’s £400bn. But trapped by Whitehall rules that force them to balance the books each year, councils must either hit communities with a tax rise up to the 5% cap, or reduce services. One element of the tax increase is a maximum 3% rise in the “social care precept” to cover rising care costs. This is married to a maximum 1.99% increase to cover general running costs. To increase the tax by more than 4.99%, councils must ask taxpayers in a local referendum. In Hartlepool, the coalition of independents and Tories that runs the council will freeze the tax and largely pay for it by dipping into reserves. But officers says the fund is not big enough to prevent services being cut in subsequent years. Tory-run Surrey county council covers one of the most affluent areas of the UK, but has still had to cut the number of children’s centres it funds from 58 to 21 over the past two years to balance the books. Next year it must find savings of nearly £12m in its adult social care department after limiting the precept rise to 0.5% and the council tax rise to 3.49% overall. Surely marrying cuts to social care with tax rises in the wake of a pandemic is the definition of austerity. And a form of austerity that hurts the very people the government seeks to protect."
2021-02-27T11:56:37Z,politics,Politics,Anas Sarwar wins Scottish Labour leadership election,"Anas Sarwar has won the Scottish Labour leadership contest after a snap election triggered by the surprise resignation of Richard Leonard six weeks ago. Sarwar, a former deputy leader of Scottish Labour backed by a majority of the partyâ€™s parliamentarians, defeated the other candidate Monica Lennon, a less experienced MSP backed on the partyâ€™s left, winning 57.6% of the vote. Sarwar, MSP for Glasgow, is the first minority ethnic leader of a major political party in the UK. He said the party under his leadership would â€œfocus on what unites our country â€“ not what divides itâ€�. In his acceptance speech, he also promised to be â€œbrutally honestâ€� with the people of Scotland.
He said: â€œYou havenâ€™t had the Scottish Labour party you deserve â€“ with rising injustice, inequality and division, Iâ€™m sorry we havenâ€™t been good enough. â€œI want to say directly to the people of Scotland, I know Labour has a lot of work to do to win back your trust. Because if weâ€™re brutally honest, you havenâ€™t had the Scottish Labour party you deserve.â€� He added: â€œToday we have elected the first ever ethnic minority leader of a political party in the UK. â€œThat doesnâ€™t say something about me. That says something great about Scotland and its people. But the fight for equality is far from over. â€œAnd Iâ€™ll work with all our diverse communities in Scotland to rebuild the country we love.â€� The UK Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said: â€œHuge congratulations to Anas on his election as leader of the Scottish Labour party. I look forward to working with him to secure our economy, protect our NHS and rebuild our country. â€œWe will fight the Scottish parliamentary elections by making the case for a socially just Scotland in a modern United Kingdom. Under his leadership, Scottish Labour will focus on what unites us â€“ not what divides us. â€œI know Anas will do the hard work that is necessary to win back the trust of the Scottish people and build for the future as we emerge from this pandemic.â€� Humza Yousaf, the SNP justice secretary and Scotlandâ€™s first Muslim cabinet minister, tweeted:
Leonard tweeted: â€œCongratulations to @AnasSarwar on his victory. He has a clear mandate from the membership to lead the SLP. We must all get behind him. Solidarity.â€� Sarwar, 37, faces an uphill battle to save Labour from what the polls suggest could be another humiliating Holyrood election in May. After losing every Scottish and UK election since 2007 to the SNP, including losing all its MEPs in the 2016 European elections, Labour has since gone through seven Scottish leaders. Sarwar will be its eighth. Leonard had been one of the longest serving since devolution but resigned suddenly after deciding he was unable to lead the party successfully into another election. The polls put Labour third behind the Scottish National party, which is on course for a comfortable victory and possibly a majority of seats in Holyrood, and the Scottish Conservatives. The latest poll by Ipsos Mori, produced for STV last week, put Labour on 15% in the constituency vote, with the SNP on 52% and the Tories on 23%. Although Sarwar has been an MP and MSP for 10 of the last 11 years, and is the son of the UKâ€™s first Muslim MP Mohammad Sarwar, the survey found a majority of voters were ambivalent about him. It showed 44% of all those polled had no opinion about whether he or Lennon would be the best Scottish Labour leader, while 28% thought he would be and 25% preferred Lennon. AmongLabour voters, 40% thought he would be best and 35% opted for Lennon. Lennon, a former council planning officer, won plaudits and international recognition last year after steering a private members bill through Holyrood that made Scotland the first country in the world to provide free period products. That led Vogue magazine to make her one of 12 women who changed the world in 2020, alongside Kamala Harris, the US vice-president, and Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand."
2021-02-27T08:00:19Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak: Instagram chancellor and prime minister in waiting,"Boris Johnson isn’t the most popular Conservative. That accolade goes to Rishi Sunak, who is the bookies’ favourite to become the next prime minister. Sunak – a virtual unknown outside the Westminster bubble until he was appointed chancellor just over a year ago – has built his popularity through social media, catchy soundbites and always looking on-point whether he is wearing a tailored suit or a WFH grey hoodie. Next week he will deliver potentially the most important budget since the second world war. Most politicians probably think a meme is a misspelt memo. Not Sunak. The 40-year-old’s use of social media has become a trademark – though it does not always go according to plan. His use of the How it started … How it’s going meme to celebrated his first anniversary as chancellor is a case in point. “Growing up I never thought I would be in this job (mainly because I wanted to be a Jedi),” he wrote on Twitter and Instagram. “It’s been incredibly tough but thank you to everyone who has supported me along the way.” Using a #NotRagsToRiches hashtag, opponents pointed out Sunak had missed out a few key biographical details. Zarah Sultana, the Labour MP for Coventry South, tweeted:
Educated at Winchester College and then Oxford, Sunak has admitted he was “very lucky to have been at these places. It does put me in an elite in society.” But it is not something he tends to dwell on either. Recently, he has also been promoting YouTube videos of himself helping teach primary school kids maths on Zoom from this office in No 11 with “MR SUNAK” written on a whiteboard behind him.
After he had finished explaining fractions to year 6 at St Paul’s primary school in Swanley, Kent, last week he took some questions from the pupils. When one asked him what his favourite subject was at school he answered that maths, English literature and economics were his three favourite subjects. He neglected to point out that his experiences of school were probably rather different to theirs. Sunak owes a lot to his past. It was at Winchester that he struck up a firm friendship with James Forsyth, now the political editor of the Spectator. In 2011, he was bestman at Forsyth wedding to Allegra Stratton, a former Guardian, Newsnight and ITV News journalist, who went on to become Sunak’s director of strategic communications and is now the prime ministers press secretary. The Sunaks and the Forsyth-Strattons are godparents to each other’s children. It was Stratton who introduced Sunak to the man credited with building “brand Rishi” – Cass Horowitz a young social media guru. Horowitz, a son of the hugely successful Alex Rider series author Anthony Horowitz, is now Sunak’s special adviser.
It was Horowitz who helped the chancellor dream up eat out to help out, the scheme that briefly helped struggling restaurants last summer but cost taxpayers £500m and caused, according to a University of Warwick study, a significant rise in coronavirus infections. Horowitz is also said to behind his other catchy acronym policies: sector-based work academies (Swap) and the job entry targeted support scheme (Jets). Horowitz sought to widen Sunak’s appeal by offering the chancellor for interview to media outlets as varied as Glamour magazine and LadBible – in which he refused to be drawn on whether or not he liked being referred to as “Dishi Rishi”. Time Magazine has included Sunak in its list of the top 100 “young emerging leaders”, alongside the singer Dua Lipa and the actor Florence Pugh. Sunak, who married Akshata Murthy, the daughter of the Indian billionaire co-founder of Infosys NR Narayana Murthy, in 2009, is also friendly with a host of celebrities in the UK and India. And now he is starting to call on them to appear in his own YouTube series called In Conversation. In the first episode, which was released last week, Sunak heaped praise on the celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, who in return describes the support the chancellor provided for the shutdown hospitality industry as “the best in the world”.
The critics were not so kind. Jay Rayner, the Observer restaurant critic and host of BBC Radio 4’s the Kitchen Cabinet, said the video was “that killer combination of tone deaf and chronically self-important”. Lisa Markwell, the food editor of the Sunday Times, said: “Neither a leader nor an expert. Could the chancellor not have found someone other than a merciless self-publicist in an industry that employs millions?” Nevertheless, the self-marketing has given Sunak 450,000 followers on Twitter, and 145,000 onInstagram, a popularity that is not universally shared by fellow Conservatives. Johnny Mercer, the MP for Plymouth Moor View, was asked in a Tory WhatsApp group: “Is it possible to have these graphics with a Conservative party logo on, instead of Rishi’s signature?”. The Tories’ “tree” logo was later added to some of the posts. The brand and marketing expert Mark Borkowski said Sunak had Johnson and the rest of the cabinet worried. “It is his sharp image that is so striking against dishevelled Boris that really cuts through,” Borkowski said. “Sunak is always beautifully turned out, he has that George Clooney glamour. His social media is supremely successful, you could call him the nation’s first Instagram chancellor.”"
2021-02-26T19:35:27Z,politics,Politics,What we learned from Alex Salmond's evidence to Scottish parliament's inquiry,"What questions does Alex Salmond’s evidence raise for Nicola Sturgeon? The former first minister said that he could provide witnesses to confirm his version of two key points in the saga, and which Sturgeon has given competing accounts of, to bolster his assertion that there is “no doubt” she broke the ministerial code. During a lengthy and detailed evidence session, Salmond claimed that the head of the civil service, Leslie Evans, met a complainer and spoke to the second one on the phone while they were taking the allegations forward, in what he described as a “spectacular” breach of process and which the Scottish government failed to disclose to the police despite a warrant. Under questioning by the acting leader of the Scottish Labour party, Jackie Baillie, Salmond agreed that if Sturgeon had continued to defend the judicial review brought by him into the handling of the original complaints, despite knowing about these prior contacts, she would have broken the ministerial code.
She will also probably be questioned on when she knew about the allegations: Sturgeon previously told the Holyrood chamber she first heard about the allegations at a meeting with Salmond at her home on 2 April 2018. It has since emerged that she was told about them by his former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein, in her office a few days before on 29 March, a meeting Sturgeon has said she had forgotten about, describing it as “fleeting”. But in his evidence, Salmond insisted that the meeting was not “impromptu”, but pre-arranged, stating: “The purpose of the meeting was to brief Nicola on what was happening. I know that Nicola Sturgeon knew about the complaints process on 29 March.”
Salmond also alleged that Sturgeon left him “in no doubt” that she was going to intervene in the complaints process, and that this was “perfectly proper” as it related to the potential for mediation between parties. Sturgeon has previously denied this, but Salmond said that his lawyer Duncan Hamilton was in the room at the time and heard the offer. Sturgeon may also be pressed on why, as she has previously stated, she met Salmond because she thought he was about to resign from the party: he told the committee on Friday that resignation from the SNP “never entered my head”. He also raised the question of whether the meeting was party or government business, another potential breach of the ministerial code. Was Salmond’s team told the name of a woman who made one of the initial sexual harassment complaints against him? Under questioning from Baillie, Salmond said the name of a complainer was shared with his former chief of staff while he was setting up the meeting between Salmond and Sturgeon, and that “three other people know that to be true”. Bailie said that the committee had already written to them to establish this. Asked about this allegation at first minister’s questions on Thursday, Sturgeon said: “To the very best of my knowledge I do not think that happened.” What evidence did Salmond offer to support his claims of a “malicious plan” to destroy his reputation? Replying to a question from the independent MSP Andy Wightman, Salmond offered a number of key points to back this up. These included the timing of the decision to extend the new harassment policy to include former ministers and switching the key decision maker in the policy from the current first minister to the permanent secretary. They also included “shocking” text messages between senior party and government officials, which Salmond claims indicate that witnesses and the police were pressurised to pursue his criminal charges in order to overtake the judicial review, which the government had been warned it would lose. But he also confirmed that he had no documentary evidence that suggests Sturgeon was involved. Did Salmond address his own behaviour in his evidence? From the outset of his long-awaited evidence, Salmond underlined that the committee’s remit was to investigate the Scottish government’s handling of sexual harassment allegations made against him, rather than his own conduct: “This is not about me.” Earlier this week, Nicola Sturgeon accused Salmond of making “wild, untrue and baseless claims” about a conspiracy against him, to divert attention from questions about his past conduct.
Salmond described the past three years as a “nightmare”. Since the verdicts, the female complainants have themselves been subject to relentless abuse and exposure online. On Thursday, a man was jailed for six months for breaking the court order protecting their anonymity by tweeting their names. Inquiry member Alex Cole Hamilton, who was rebuked for his questioning by the committee chair, noted that Salmond had not mentioned the women involved in bringing the complaints in his opening statement and asked Salmond directly: “Of the behaviours that you have admitted to, some of which are appalling, are you sorry?” Salmond said in his own evidence at trial that he should have been “more careful with people’s personal space”, while civil servants told the court they tried to reinforce the practice of not allowing female officials to work alone with him. Salmond responded: “In my statement I pointed out the government’s illegality has had huge consequences for a number of people, and specifically mentioned the complainants” but refused to address them directly: “I’ve had three years of two court cases, two judges and one jury and I’m not going to be drawn further on that.”"
2021-02-26T19:04:28Z,politics,Politics,UK Covid: Van-Tam tells public 'do not wreck' progress - as it happened,"Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, said there were some worrying signs that people are taking their foot off the brake at exactly the wrong time, imploring people during the press briefing not to “wreck this” (See 5.18pm). The government said a further 345 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Friday, recording 8,523 more cases (See 4.19pm). Unions representing police, prison officers and teachers have expressed dismay at the decision to base the next stage of the coronavirus vaccination programme purely on age (See 3.19pm). The UK R number has not changed since last week and is still between 0.6 and 0.9, according to the latest government figures (See 1.38pm). New Covid-19 cases continued to fall across the UK in the week ending 19 February, ONS figures indicate (See 1.27pm). That’s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It’s here:"
2021-02-26T18:54:06Z,politics,Politics,'Do not wreck this now': Van-Tam warns against giving up on Covid rules,"Ministers and scientific advisers have urged the public not to give up on strict lockdown rules, amid worries that the very obvious success of the UK vaccination programme and the arrival of spring are causing people to take more risks. “Do not wreck this, we are so close,” said Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, after Downing Street confirmed plans for the second stage of the vaccination programme, due to offer at least a first dose to all adults by the summer.
Van-Tam said he had been “besieged with people writing in saying ‘I have had the vaccine and essentially can I start breaking the rules’.” The answer to that was no, he said, as the country was not yet “in the right place … it is too early to relax”. The second stage of the vaccination programme will be based on age rather than occupation or clinical vulnerability, prompting a backlash from unions representing frontline workers, as well as patients’ groups. Van-Tam said an age-based rollout would be quick and straightforward, and people should worry less about their place in the queue than “making sure that queue moves really fast”. He and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, used a Downing Street press conference unveiling the vaccination plans to urge caution, even as official statistics indicated that the number of people in England contracting Covid had halved in the past fortnight.
Rates of hospital admissions and deaths were still “far too high”, Hancock said. Van-Tam called up what he termed “quite sobering” slides showing a rise in coronavirus cases in some parts of the country, including the Midlands and parts of the west coast of England. “Although it is generally good news, I’m afraid it is better news in some places than it is in others and this is not a battle that we have won yet,” he said. Van-Tam, who has gained a reputation during the pandemic as the government’s most effective and evocative communicator, said there were “some worry signs that people are relaxing, taking their foot off the brake at exactly the wrong time”, likening it to a football match in which one side had taken a 3-0 lead. He said: “But how many times have you seen the other side take it 4-3? It is too early to relax. Just continue to maintain discipline and hang on. Just a few more months. Do not wreck this now, we are so close.” Hancock and Van-Tam defended the next stage of the vaccine plan, unveiled by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on Friday and endorsed by Downing Street. Phase 2 will begin with people aged 40-49, progressing to those aged 30-39, then everyone aged 18-29, with a target date for first doses by the end of July. With public health experts saying it would be logistically difficult to target people by job, potentially slowing the rollout, Hancock said: “Our moral duty is saving lives first, and that’s what we’ve done.”
Van-Tam said professions with the highest Covid death rates included restaurant workers, food processing staff and cab drivers, who would need to be prioritised in any jobs-based rollout. “You can see that is going to be very difficult because of the multiplicity of occupations that would need to be called forwards,” Van-Tam said. “And doing that is going to damage the pace of the vaccine rollout so much. And the big win, actually, is in speed.” But the plans prompted fury from some unions, with the Police Federation of England and Wales calling it “an utter betrayal of police officers”. John Apter, the chair of the federation, said ministers had abdicated responsibility to “hide behind the science of the JCVI”. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said the logistical difficulties of a job-based rollout was “not a good enough reason not to prioritise the needs of committed professionals”. Mick Pimblett, the assistant general secretary of the Prison Officers Association, said that even on Friday morning he had been led to believe members would be prioritised, given their role in a closed, confined environment.
Blood Cancer UK said people living with the disease, who have been vaccinated but are hugely vulnerable, would be “devastated” that fellow household members had not been prioritised. “The JCVI have made a bad decision that will needlessly put the lives of people with blood cancer at risk,” said Gemma Peters, the charity’s chief executive. Sarah Woolnough, the chief executive of Asthma UK, said the decision to not prioritise all people with the condition – people with particularly severe asthma were included in phase 1 – would leave some feeling “anxious, angry and ignored by government”. But Prof Wei Shen Lim, the Covid-19 chair for JCVI, said an occupation-based vaccine programme had never been tested before on a large scale in the UK, and there were difficulties associated with it, such as people’s occupations not necessarily being recorded in their health records. He said: “The evidence is clear that the risk of hospitalisation and death increases with age. The vaccination programme is a huge success and continuing the age-based rollout will provide the greatest benefit in the shortest time, including to those in occupations at a higher risk of exposure.”"
2021-02-26T18:48:18Z,politics,Politics,Salmond accuses Sturgeon of using Covid briefing to 'effectively question jury result' – as it happened,"Here are the key points from a mammoth six-hour session: Alex Salmond has claimed there is “no doubt” Nicola Sturgeon broke the ministerial code, but stopped short of saying she should resign. He said Scotland’s “leadership has failed”. He added: “I have no doubt that Nicola broke the ministerial code, but it’s not for me to suggest what the consequence should be.” Salmond called for the lord advocate, James Wolffe, and the head of Scotland’s civil service, Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans, to resign over the handling of the complaints against him. He alleged a “malicious scheme” among senior SNP figures to damage his reputation, but said he had no evidence the current first minister was part of this. “The government acted illegally but somehow nobody is to blame,” he said. Salmond said he did not believe Sturgeon was involved in covering up complaints against him, but criticised her for using a Covid press conference to “effectively question the result of a jury”. Salmond refused to apologise for his own behaviour, but pointed out that a jury had cleared him of allegations of harassment. He said: “This inquiry is not about me. I have been acquitted of all criminal charges by a jury in the highest court in the land.” Salmond was highly critical of the Crown Office and urged the committee to get round its injunctions against the release of information on the handling of complaints against him. The committee had been “systematically deprived of the evidence it has legitimately sought” after “deliberate suppression of information inconvenient to the government”. Salmond claimed a leak to the Daily Record newspaper, which broke news of the allegations against him, was “politically inspired”. He said: “I think it does require further police investigation – I do believe I know the identity but I’m not here to speculate on individuals that I cannot substantiate.” Salmond claimed Sturgeon knew on 29 March 2018 that he was under investigation for sexual harassment by her government, four days earlier than the date she first gave to parliament, because she had agreed to meet Geoff Aberdein, his former chief of staff, to discuss it in her Holyrood office. Three witnesses could confirm that Aberdein was told the name of one of the complainers and that one had sworn a statement to that effect. Sturgeon and he mentioned that complainer by name when they met at her home four days later, on 2 April 2018, contradicting Sturgeon’s statement in Holyrood on Thursday she did not believe the name had been passed to Aberdein."
2021-02-26T18:41:59Z,politics,Politics,Doorstep campaigning for local elections to resume in England,"Door-to-door political campaigning will be allowed to resume in England from 8 March in the run-up to local elections in May, the government has announced. Activists will be permitted to stand on people’s doorsteps and canvass as long as they abide by the 2-metre social distancing rule. They will not be able to enter people’s homes and should only access shared hallways in blocks of flats where “absolutely necessary”. The new advice also urges organisers to keep the number of campaigners to a minimum. Campaign literature should be collected or dropped off without people meeting inside, and planning meetings should take place virtually. From 29 March, when people will be allowed to gather in groups of six or two households outdoors, the same rules will apply to political campaigning. When it comes to polling day on 6 May, the government said people must not share a car with anyone from outside their household or support bubble to be driven to vote. Chloe Smith, the minister for the constitution, said: “Democracy should not be cancelled because of Covid. Voters appreciate being well-informed and campaigning is an important part of effective elections.” She said the easing of restrictions would ensure free and fair elections that were also “Covid-secure”. “I urge political campaigners to continue to show social responsibility, and for parties, agents and candidates to ensure that their campaigners understand the clear rules,” she said. Public Health England advises campaigners to wash their hands or use hand sanitiser for at least 20 seconds on a regular basis and wear a face covering when meeting anyone they do not live with. Given that the government expects many people to vote by post, it also encourages those who want a postal ballot to apply as early as possible to avoid a rush closer to polling day. Elections will take place at the county, district and parish level, and mayors and police and crime commissioner will also be elected, including any polls pushed back from last spring because of the coronavirus pandemic. Parliamentary elections will also take place in Wales and Scotland on 6 May, but the devolved administrations will make their own decisions about whether restrictions should be eased to allow for political campaigning."
2021-02-26T15:00:59Z,politics,Politics,Experts criticise Boris Johnson for putting dates in Covid roadmap,"Boris Johnson’s decision to include dates in his proposed roadmap out of the third lockdown in England is a “dangerous strategy” that risks undermining adherence to Covid-19 rules, behavioural scientists have said. The prime minister’s message that government policy around reopening would be guided by “data, not dates” could be overshadowed by the use of dates in the roadmap, said Stephen Reicher, a professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews and a member of SPI-B, the behavioural science subgroup of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). “Data not dates has turned into dates not data,” said Reicher, who added that the choice of Midsummer Day for a possible return to normality was “incredibly powerful symbolic messaging”. “Because, whatever you say, once you announce clear dates you create facts on the ground which alter the reality, and create a situation [where] it’s very difficult to shift from those dates,” he said.
Proof that people were already using the dates to plan was seen in the huge surge in holidaybookings and the announcement of events such as the Reading and Leeds festival going ahead, he said. Using dates created psychological, economic and political “counter-pressures” that would make changing dates increasingly difficult, he said. Once expectation had been established it was damaging to remove it, he said. “It gives hope if you can stick to those dates; if you don’t it brings despair. And it’s a dangerous strategy.” Relying solely on the vaccine deployment to curb transmission was a very serious mistake, added Reicher. “When you have high levels of transmission, the virus is more able to replicate,” he said. “The more the virus replicates, the higher chance of getting mutations; the more mutations, the higher the chance of a variant which evades the vaccine – and then they’ve undermined the vaccine.” Prof Susan Michie, who also sits on SPI-B, said that while the first two mooted dates were “in a timescale that could be predicted”, the reopening of all schools against some scientific advice and the emergence of new variants meant there was too much uncertainty to predict beyond March. “Yet again [Johnson] is raising expectations that may be dashed,” she said. “And yes, again, he calls it a roadmap but it’s still not a coherent strategy.” She welcomed the five-week gap between the reopening stages, but said the four tests that had to be met to allow each stage to happen were “vague” and involved no quantitative criteria. “This mixed messaging is deeply unhelpful,” she said. “People want clear, consistent coherent messaging.” Asked if the public was receiving such messaging, she said: “Unfortunately not, no.”
Robert West, a Sage member and professor of health psychology at University College London, said there was definitely a risk that people would become “demob happy” and bend rules in advance of specific dates. While it was unlikely to influence mask-wearing and other protective measures, it could result in more “contacts with others, either outside or inside, which are very, very hard to police.” Even though the public had been told not to plan around the outlined dates, they would invariably do so, said West. “And the government knows that – it’s not like it doesn’t have any behavioural advisers.” Dr Daisy Fancourt, who leads University College London’s Covid-19 social study into the psychological and social impact of the pandemic, said compliance with rules had been “incredibly high” and at its highest in recent months. The challenge as the country reopened would be whether people would understand what they were allowed to do, she said. “The times we found compliance going down have been when the rules have been relaxed,” she said. “We saw that very clearly, for example, at the end of the first lockdown last year, because the implicit message is that things are not as serious. But the problem is that infection levels are still really high, hospitalisation levels are still really high. So it’s going to be a case of trying to make sure that people don’t mistakenly think that the situation is in fact, a good one.” She said it was vital the government rolled out a comprehensive communications plan that reached people at community level “to ensure that the messages are getting out to everybody, rather than just a core few”.
John Drury, a professor of social psychology at the University of Sussex, who is also on SPI-B, said vaccinations were “not infallible” and not everyone would be vaccinated, meaning infection suppression measures – including providing financial support to enable people to self-isolate – were still important. Earlier this month Dido Harding, the head of NHS test and trace, said that between 20% and 40% of people contacted by test and trace could not or did not comply with the rules. Research suggests a majority of people who apply for a one-off £500 payment for isolation are rejected. “People need information, but also they need material support,” Drury said. Reicher accused the government of a failure not only of messaging but of policy. “The other mitigations are being forgotten about – we’re not talking about test and trace, about supporting people to self-isolate, making environments safe and ensuring the places aren’t open if they’re unsafe, we’re not talking about making sure that employers allow people to stay at home and work from home if they possibly can. We don’t have a strategy of infection suppression,” he said. “We should be combining the vaccine rollout with suppression. To rely on one without the other is a risky way to go. They might get away with it, and of course we all hope they will. Because if they don’t, we’re the ones who are going to suffer.” A government spokesperson said all dates in the roadmap were subject to change. “As the roadmap makes clear, our approach is driven by data not dates. Each step allows time to assess the impact of the previous one and provides a week’s notice before any changes occur,” they said."
2021-02-26T14:21:45Z,politics,Politics,'Lying is no longer a sin': former French ambassador on Brexit and Boris Johnson ,"When Sylvie Bermann arrived in August 2014 as France’s new ambassador, London was, she says, a city of “extraordinary dynamism and optimism”. French cabinet ministers were queuing up to visit, one after the other, all searching for “Britain’s recipe for success. It was an an astonishing place.” Now, Bermann says in an interview in her flat on Paris’s Left Bank, lined with the souvenirs of 40 years in France’s diplomatic service, “It feels like I’ve lived through a revolution. To see all that blown up, deliberately, for what? A blind belief in some mythical idea … How did it happen?” To answer the question, the now-retired career diplomat, who has worked in Hong Kong, New York, Brussels and Moscow and was France’s ambassador to Beijing before she moved to Britain, has written a book that pulls no punches. Goodbye Britannia, published this month in France, calls Boris Johnson an inveterate liar, describes Brexit as the triumph of emotion over reason, and suggests its roots lie in a combination of deluded British exceptionalism and rank political opportunism. For a woman who fell in love with Britain on her first visit, to Brighton to learn English as a schoolgirl “sometime in the mid-1960s”, and whose best friends have lived in London for more than 30 years, Brexit is also a matter of personal sadness. “When you’ve admired a country for a long time, appreciated its humour, tolerance, courtesy, openness – of course it’s sad,” she says. “It also means, now, there’s no more jelly or Stilton in Marks & Spencer’s in Marché St Germain. And that’s Brexit, too.” First and foremost, though, was the shock. “No one thought it would happen, not even the Brexiters,” Bermann says. “David Cameron told me several times there was no way he could lose – he just wanted to solve his problem with his Eurosceptics.” At endless embassy lunches and receptions, she says, she was assured by all that “‘the British are pragmatic; we just won’t do this’. One very senior Brexiter told us: ‘We’re not leaving, and we’ll keep annoying you. Are you sure you want us to stay?’”
Right up until referendum night, Bermann says, the story was the same: “I went to the party hosted by Roland Rudd, from the Stronger In campaign. George Osborne came by at about 11pm, and everyone congratulated each other. People were sure.” Bermann went back to the French residence, on Kensington Palace Gardens, got a couple of hours’ sleep, then went downstairs at about 5am to watch the final results with her staff. “It was,” she says, “a bombshell. I wanted to analyse the reasons.” Bermann blames a toxic mix of largely concocted fears over immigration, populist politicians willing to exploit them, and an identity crisis by which a nation that “not so long ago ruled the waves, somehow convinced itself it was in a dictatorship”. The question of Britain’s identity was key, she says. “It’s very strange. On the one hand the British say, ‘We’re the best, we hold all the cards, we’ll divide and rule as we always have – and on the other: we’re a vassal state to Brussels.”
She spent a lot of time trying to talk to Brexiters, “and it was impossible – not to convince them, even, but simply to … discuss it with them. This really is an ideology. Brexit was a victory of passion over reality.” The national narrative of a country never defeated, and uninvaded since 1066, had – according Bermann - created a “mad” and obsessive conviction among Brexit true believers that Britain had single-handedly won the second world war. “Look, I did a lot to acknowledge the role of the British in the war,” she says. “I presented a lot of légions d’honneur to British veterans, and it was very moving. But at the same time, I’m sorry, the Americans and the Red Army did their bit.” A lack of any real understanding of what the EU contributed to the UK did not help the remain cause, she says, nor did the fact that the campaign was so lacklustre. “Cameron said people would be better off in – but he never said how,” Bermann says. It was “the demagogues and the populists”, however, who got Brexit over the line, Bermann says. “Farage managed to forge this link between the EU and immigration. [Jeremy] Corbyn played a very negative role too, he was a Brexiter at heart. “There was no opposition campaign. And then of course Johnson, the determining factor. Charming, charismatic – and with no genuine reason at all to be hostile to the EU. He knew all those articles he wrote about it from Brussels were false.”
Bermann has few kind words for the role the prime minister, whom she met often during his time as mayor of London, played in the Brexit process. From the moment he started to campaign for Brexit, she says, his bad faith was evident. “No one should be surprised he gets called a liar,” she says. “Just look at the side of that bus: a flagrant lie. But lying is no longer a sin. The views of someone with no competence are worth as much as those of an expert – as Michael Gove said.” Bermann was all the more shocked by Johnson, she says, because the first time she met him, at a breakfast, he had given “a fine speech, about how Sparta, in ancient Greece, had vanished because it cut itself off, while Athens, open city, flourished”. She had more time for Theresa May, whose “inflexibilities and mistakes” – including the red lines of Brexit means Brexit, leaving the EU’s single market and customs union – produced the hardest of hard departures but who “at least had an honest side”. Bermann left London in 2017, but followed developments closely from her next – and final – diplomatic post in Moscow. “The deal that was finally arrived at is a deal in which Britain sacrificed everything to a mythical idea of sovereignty,” she says. “I’m sorry, but France is sovereign. Germany is sovereign. When we decide to share our sovereignty, it is to reinforce our power in the world, because there are now two superpowers, the US and China. Absolute sovereignty simply does not exist.” Global Britain is also a myth: “The UK has erected new barriers with its biggest partner. For the US, it’s no longer the bridge it was. With China, there are moral problems. India won’t play unless it gets visas. Who will Britain be global with?” Meanwhile, Britain is now a third country, Bermann says, “which means frontiers, documents, declarations. It wanted to leave because of EU bureaucracy, but it has a mountain of new paperwork – and companies are already suffering.”"
2021-02-26T11:00:55Z,politics,Politics,Justice secretary defends Matt Hancock over breach of law,"There are plenty of times when the government acts unlawfully, the justice secretary has admitted, but “getting something wrong is not the same as deliberately flouting the law”. What mattered, said Robert Buckland, was that the government did not break the same law twice. Last week the health secretary, Matt Hancock, was found by a high court judge to have acted unlawfully by failing to publish multibillion-pound Covid-19 government contracts within the 30-day period required by law. The judge Mr Justice Chamberlain ruled that the failure to do so breached the “vital public function” of transparency over how “vast quantities” of taxpayers’ money was spent. But Buckland has now said the key thing is that Hancock got something wrong rather than deliberately breaching the law. “Every day, every month, there are cases bought against the government about whether it has acted lawfully or not,” Buckland told ITV’s Good Morning Britain. “There are plenty of times when the court says no. “The important thing is for the government to act according to the ruling of the court. When you read the [court] documents you see the lesson has been learned and it’s not a matter of the government trying to get away with it,” he added. “If the government carries on ignoring the rulings and breaking the law, that would be unacceptable. I’m not sure that getting something wrong is the same as deliberately flouting the law.” When challenged by the presenters over the fact that many people have been fined for getting the law wrong – with leading lawyers warning of a “concerning trend of police overreach and casual criminalisation, often of young or other potentially vulnerable people” – Buckland said: “The key thing for me is to make sure the government abides by the law and where a court ruling has made, they abide by it and lessons are learned. “Judging people on their actions is the best way to assess here,” he said. “Respect for law is the best way to live our lives.” Buckland refused to criticise Hancock over his refusal to apologise for his unlawful behaviour, his dismissal of the court ruling by insisting it was just “delayed paperwork”, and his apparent attempt to deflect responsibility on to his officials. Asked last week if he would resign, Hancock said no, arguing that it was not true to say he had refused to publish contracts, some of which went to friends of senior Tories. “Some of the paperwork got a little bit delayed and I’m absolutely backing my team who did a phenomenal job in incredibly difficult circumstances,” he said at the time. Buckland declined to respond to questions about whether Hancock should apologise. “The key this for government is: will they abide by the rule of law? And of course they will,” he said. “There’s no ifs and buts about that.”"
2021-02-26T10:16:01Z,politics,Politics,Alex Salmond to testify at Holyrood over claims of conspiracy against him ,"Alex Salmond is due to give evidence at Holyrood on his allegations of a Scottish government conspiracy against him, with MSPs expected to issue a last-ditch order seeking the release of evidence. The former first minister is expected to testify on oath from 12.30pm after weeks of wrangling over his appearance, and legal battles over the publication of his allegations against his former protege Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish National party. In a dramatic intensification of his feud with his former allies, Salmond accused the current first minister and his former colleagues, including Peter Murrell, Sturgeon’s husband and SNP chief executive, of conspiring to the point of wanting him jailed. They were involved, he alleges, in “a deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort” to destroy his reputation and career. In a development linked to those allegations, the committee that will question Salmond is preparing to serve a legally enforced disclosure order on the Crown Office, Scotland’s prosecution service, later on Friday. MSPs will order the Crown Office to release private WhatsApp and text messages between senior figures in the SNP and the Scottish government that Salmond believes prove they colluded to bolster his prosecution for multiple alleged sexual assaults. Salmond was charged in 2019 with 14 counts of sexual assault, including one of attempted rape, but was acquitted of all charges after a high court trial in March 2020. Sturgeon, who is due to finally give evidence next Wednesday, robustly rejected his claims and opposition criticism of her conduct in fiery exchanges during first minister’s questions on Thursday. Both Salmond and Sturgeon are expected to be questioned for about four hours. She said Salmond had not yet presented a “shred of evidence” to justify his conspiracy theories. She said opposition leaders were traducing prosecutors and government institutions “just because they happen to dislike this government, and to sacrifice all of that on the altar of the ego of one man”. These former allies, once the most potent partnership in Scottish politics, are being questioned by a cross-party committee set up to investigate the Scottish government’s botched internal inquiry in 2018 into sexual harassment complaints against Salmond brought by two civil servants. That inquiry was declared unlawful on procedural grounds by a civil court judge in January 2019, and its conclusions struck down, after Salmond lodged a judicial review. He was later awarded £512,000 in legal costs by a judge; the Scottish government is estimated to have spent more than £600,000 fighting that case. Leslie Evans, the permanent secretary of the Scottish government, has defended the government inquiry and said it was justified given the significance of the allegations against Salmond, and the need to protect government staff from harassment. The committee’s disclosure order, using very rarely used powers under the Scotland Act that set up the devolved parliament in 1999, is the second time it has demanded the Crown Office release private messages. In late January, the committee made its first instruction to the Crown Office. Some were handed over the following week, with MSPs only allowed to see them in a private room without getting any copies. It emerged those messages included many from women who became complainers against Salmond in his trial. MSPs admitted that those were personal and private, and established those women were giving each other support. Rape Crisis Scotland, which has represented many of the complainers, was furious and believed the committee had no right to read them. It said releasing private messages could dissuade future victims of sexual violence from coming forward. Opposition members of the committee believe the Crown Office gave MSPs the wrong messages, and had failed to hand over those that Salmond alleges proved a conspiracy. However, the committee is fast running short of time to study any fresh disclosures: some want to read them before Sturgeon gives evidence on Wednesday. It is unclear whether the Crown Office can be forced to comply or time can be found for the committee to study them before she appears."
2021-02-26T06:00:08Z,politics,Politics,Blair says collaboration on Covid could have cut three months off crisis,"World leaders could have cut the length of the Covid outbreak by three months if they had collaborated on vaccines, testing and drugs, Tony Blair has claimed as he launched a report on preparing for the next deadly pandemic. The former Labour prime minister urged the UK to take the lead in developing a new “health security infrastructure” that would ensure countries coordinate better in identifying emerging new threats as well as developing, testing and manufacturing vaccines and treatments. “Had there been global coordination a year ago, I think we could have shaved at least three months off this virus,” Blair told the Guardian in an interview. The report, The New Necessary, published by his Institute for Global Change, argues that in future, with the right international coordination and investment, the creation of a new vaccine could be achieved in as little as 100 days. “The time that it’s taken for us to identify the virus, to develop a vaccine and to get it into production and distribution has been roughly, 15 months. And the result of that has been that the world has suffered a huge, catastrophic economic event as well as a health event,” he said. “The obvious lesson to draw for the future is, number one, you have to prepare for the potential of this happening again, or with different variants of this particular virus. And number two, you cannot afford to take this long to get on top of it.” With Boris Johnson chairing the G7, Blair called on the UK to spearhead the creation of a more responsive system for tracking diseases and collaborating on tackling them. The report calls on the government to treat preparing for the next pandemic as “akin to a military operation”, tracking the emergence of new diseases using state-of-the-art surveillance and having “surge capacity” ready to produce vaccines and drugs. It calls for pandemics to be dealt with as potential security threats – like climate change or cyber-attacks, Blair says – to ensure the issue gets the government time and attention it requires. Johnson was criticised for skipping several Cobra meetings in the early days of the pandemic, leaving them to be chaired by the health secretary, Matt Hancock. Perhaps ironically, for someone regarded by his critics as an arch free marketeer, Blair argues that in tackling the virus over the past year, “there was a whole series of things left to the market which it was never sensible to leave to the market”. As an example, he points the bioreactors needed to produce vaccines. “A lot of the companies that were developing the vaccines didn’t have large bioreactor capacity, whereas a lot of the bioreactor capacity was in other large pharmaceutical companies who weren’t doing the vaccines. Now, in a rational world you would have been repurposing some of that bioreactor capacity to accelerate the production of vaccine. I don’t think that was even the discussion that took place at an international level.” Blair’s institute is part thinktank, part consultancy, advising global leaders on how to make use of emerging technologies. He has made a series of high-profile interventions during the crisis, advocating some measures that have subsequently been adopted by the UK government, including mass testing and more recently vaccine passports. Having previously denied it was considering the idea, the government this week announced a review of the idea of “Covid status certificates” that would allow people to demonstrate they have been vaccinated or had a recent negative test result. Blair, who faced a political revolt when he tried to introduce a nationwide system of ID cards as prime minister, argues that some kind of certification system is inevitable, so the government should take control of it rather than allow it to develop ad hoc.
“What is obvious is that if people are going to be in close proximity with others, they’ll probably prefer to know their Covid status – either test or vaccine,” he said. “Then the only question is, do you just let the system grow up topsy-turvy, with people doing their own thing, and making their own rules and regulations around it, or to try and systematise it. And I just think it’s inevitable that you will move to the second,” he said. He brushed off claims that some groups – those without access to technology, for example – would be disadvantaged. “There’s a big problem with the inequality between different people with digital connection, but you deal with that by dealing with the problem.” In response to the idea that such certificates – likely to be held on people’s mobile phones – would create privacy issues like those that helped to sink his ID cards plan, he said: “You know, my personal view is that this resistance was always exaggerated. It was loud, but not actually that broad. I used to say to people, you know, your average supermarket’s got more information on you than the government’s got.”"
2021-02-25T22:30:38Z,politics,Politics,Labour to state 'non-negotiable' support for UK's nuclear weapons,"Labour’s commitment to maintaining the UK’s nuclear weapons is “non-negotiable”, the party’s shadow defence minister, John Healey, is expected to say in a speech on Friday, emphasising a deliberate shift in tone from the Jeremy Corbyn era. In a speech that implicitly acknowledges the perception by some within Labour that Corbyn’s public doubts over nuclear weapons and Nato helped damage the party’s reputation with certain voters, Healey will also stress the party’s commitment to the North Atlantic alliance, and to maintaining a viable UK defence industry. While Labour’s 2017 and 2019 manifestos both pledged to support the renewal of the UK’s Trident nuclear submarine system, and to back multilateral rather than unilateral nuclear disarmament efforts, these were very obviously compromises accepted by Corbyn. Corbyn is a longtime and active supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and spoke at an anti-Trident demonstration in 2016, when he was Labour leader. He has also expressed scepticism about Nato, and during a debate in 2016 declined to confirm that he would abide by a key element of membership and commit to the defence of a fellow Nato member that had been attacked by an outside country. Speaking at the Royal United Service Institute thinktank on Friday, Healey will link the UK’s Nato membership to a wider commitment to international treaties. “First, Labour’s commitment to Nato is unshakeable,” he is due to say, according to extracts of the speech released in advance. “Second, Labour’s support for the UK’s nuclear deterrent is non-negotiable. Third, Labour’s commitment to international law and the UN, to universal human rights and to the multilateral treaties and organisations that uphold them, is total. “And fourth, Labour’s determination to see British investment directed first to British industry is fundamental, not just to our thinking on defence, but on the kind of society we want to build.” Labour is, Healey will argue, “the party of sovereign defence capability – we see the steel industry, the shipyards, the aerospace and materials industries as a national asset. “We want to see a clear plan from government to enhance these capabilities. We want to see, for the good of our country, as much as possible of our equipment designed and built here.” The reaffirmation over nuclear weapons in particular appears set to reignite arguments that have raged within Labour for decades between those who support the idea and others, Corbyn prominent among them, who have long argued that the UK should unilaterally abandon weapons that no rational prime minister could ever use. On defence more widely, Healey is expected to accuse the government of having a lack of coherence, “fudging and fumbling our way into the future, with major procurement projects at the mercy of the illusion that ‘something will turn up’ to pay for them”. The government is due to publish the so-called integrated review, covering priorities in the coming years for defence, security and foreign policy. In his planned speech, Healey said this should address long-term funding shortfalls, calling this “the Achilles heel of defence plans”."
2021-02-25T20:33:32Z,politics,Politics,Tony Blair says 'cut Starmer some slack' over tax comments,"Tony Blair has urged Keir Starmer’s critics to “cut him some slack” and backed his stance on business taxes, after a backlash over comments from Starmer that appeared to suggest Labour was against taxing corporations to pay for the pandemic. Labour clarified its position on Thursday, with the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, and shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, publicly suggesting that the party was prepared to back business tax increases as long as they were not implemented immediately.
Party sources said they would also look at any plans put forward by Rishi Sunak at next week’s budget for a windfall tax on firms that have profited from the pandemic. “We’ll look at the detail of what the chancellor proposes, but we don’t think there should be tax rises right now,” said a source. Starmer’s comments on Wednesday that “now is not the time for tax rises on families and businesses” irritated some colleagues who felt they could be bounced into opposing plans mooted by the chancellor to increase corporation tax at next week’s budget – a policy Labour has previously proposed. In an interview with the Guardian, Blair, the last Labour leader to win a general election, praised Starmer and warned his party critics not to underestimate the challenges of being the opposition leader during the pandemic. “I think where people have got to cut him some slack and be fair to the guy is, it’s the government that matters at the moment,” he said. “The public have no interest at all in mouthing off as if you’re in normal political times, because they know you’re not. “I think he’s done a very good job. I think he has actually been pretty judicious in being critical where he needs to be, constructive most of the time,” Blair said. Asked about Starmer’s comments on tax, which were criticised by leftwing MPs and the grassroots campaign group Momentum, he said: “I think he’s perfectly sensible to say that. I always used to say to people when I was leading the Labour party, the Labour party’s problem is not that people don’t think you’ll put their taxes up.” The former Tory leader, David Cameron, added his voice to those warning Sunak not to seek to balance the books, writing in the Times that immediate tax increases “wouldn’t make any sense at all”. Blair predicted that the next general election would not be fought on the territory of tax and spend that has dominated many recent contests, or on the government’s handling of the pandemic, but on “who’s got the best plan for the future”, including how to respond to rapid technological change. Labour strategists are wary of being dragged into a messy debate about who should pay for the crisis, when many international experts are warning against tax increases or spending cuts while economies are still deep in recession. Answering questions after a pre-budget speech to UCL’s Institute for Global Prosperity on Thursday, Dodds said: “If government is saying they will be immediately imposing tax changes on the UK, I do think that’s the wrong decision. That is going against the vast bulk of what expert commentators are saying. If we’re talking about a longer-term trajectory then let’s have that discussion, let’s make sure we do have that more effective tax system.” However, she warned the government that measures to force through increases in corporation tax would deliver a “hammer blow” to families across the country as they struggled with the fallout from Covid-19. “That is the wrong decision to be taking right now,” she said. “The UK government’s focus should be on jobs, growth and preserving economic activity. We have had the worst economic crisis of any country in the G7, so we need to be focused on reversing that decline.” Nandy, speaking on the BBC, said Labour still believed it would be possible to increase corporation tax without compromising the UK’s competitiveness, but she added: “There will be a time for raising taxes, doing it fairly and paying down the debt – but that time is not now.” Voices from across the political divide and mainstream economists have been broadly united over the need to delay tax rises until an economic recovery from the worst recession in 300 years fully takes hold, despite record public borrowing triggered by the pandemic. Sunak is expected to confirm the biggest peacetime shortfall in the public finances at next week’s budget as the cost of responding to Covid pushes the budget deficit close to £400bn this year. However, pressure is mounting for a tougher stance as the pandemic drives up rates of inequality and fuels bumper profits for some firms, including the outsourcing giant Serco, which said on Thursday it had raked in £400m from Covid-related work including running the government’s test-and-trace programme."
2021-02-25T18:30:23Z,politics,Politics,Key questions Alex Salmond could face from MSPs,"Alex Salmond, Scotland’s former first minister, is due to give evidence under oath on Friday to a committee of Holyrood MSPs investigating the Scottish government’s botched inquiry into complaints made by two female civil servants against him. His evidence session could last all afternoon. Here are some of the questions he could face. Does he acknowledge he behaved inappropriately towards women – and that complainers found his conduct offensive or unacceptable? Nicola Sturgeon has accused Salmond, her former mentor and boss, of making “wild, baseless” claims that there is a conspiracy against him. She says this is to deflect attention from allegations about his behaviour towards women – a reference to the inquiries that have taken place in the last three years. Two female civil servants accused him of sexual harassment during an internal Scottish government inquiry in 2018. That inquiry was later found by a court to be unlawful on procedural grounds. In 2019 he was prosecuted for 14 offences of sexual assault – including one of attempted rape – against 10 women, some of whom were junior civil servants. After one charge was dropped early on in the trial, in March 2020 the jury acquitted him of all 13 remaining offences. What happened at Edinburgh airport? Salmond, the Scottish government and the SNP were approached by Sky News in late 2017 about alleged incidents involving Salmond at Edinburgh airport between 2007 and 2009, when he was first minister and regularly flying to London. Angus Robertson, a former leader of the SNP in Westminster, confirmed in a statement to the Holyrood committee investigating the botched government inquiry that he “was called by an Edinburgh airport manager about Alex Salmond’s perceived ‘inappropriateness’ towards female staff at the airport.” Sturgeon admitted last year she had been told about the approaches by Sky News in November 2017. This conflicted with her previous statements to parliament and the media that she first knew of misconduct allegations against Salmond when he told her on 2 April 2018. Where is the proof of a conspiracy? Salmond accuses the Scottish National party, the Scottish government, its most senior civil servant, Leslie Evans, and even officials in the Crown Office of a “prolonged, malicious” conspiracy against him. Sturgeon has challenged him to present proof of this rather than relying on circumstantial evidence Salmond also alleges that his former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein was given the identity of one of the two junior civil servants who had accused him of sexual harassment before Salmond and Sturgeon met at her home on 2 April 2018. On Thursday Sturgeon was asked by MSPs if she could give categoric assurances that the “name of a complainer was not passed” to Aberdein. Sturgeon answered: “To the very best of my knowledge, I do not think that happened.” Can Salmond prove it happened? Does he have any witnesses or corroboration? Why did he keep on pressing Sturgeon to intervene? Salmond had five conversations with Sturgeon during 2018, including one at her home in April 2018 where he lobbied her to intervene in the Scottish government inquiry into two complaints by female officials of sexual harassment. Sturgeon insists she told him she could not and would not intervene. Is that true? What did Sturgeon say to him during those meetings? Why did he insist on discussing it with her on five occasions over the summer of 2018 if it was true she did not intervene?"
2021-02-25T18:13:03Z,politics,Politics,UK Covid: alert level drops from 5 down to 4 as threat of NHS being overwhelmed reduces â€“ as it happened,"The UKâ€™s Covid alert level has been downgraded from â€œcriticalâ€� to â€œsevereâ€�, as cases and deaths continue to fall and the threat of the NHS being overwhelmed recedes. Nicola Sturgeon has come under intense pressure to explain what action she took over allegations that a complainer against Alex Salmond was named to one of his former aides. Serco is to pay a dividend for the first time in seven years after the outsourcing company, which is contracted to run the heavily criticised NHS Covid-19 test-and-trace programme, reported that its profits almost doubled in 2020. The number of furloughed workers in the UK rose by 700,000 to 4.7 million in January, during the third Covid lockdown, according to official figures showing employees in hospitality, women and young adults were most likely to be away from their jobs. Gavin Williamson has promised that a system for teachers to decide exam grades in England this year will be â€œfair to every studentâ€�, but faced challenges from Labour over delays in announcing the plan and how assessments could be made consistent. Boris Johnson has set up a cabinet committee to maintain his grip on keeping the UK union together, after two former heads of the No 10 unit devoted to the issue left the post within weeks of one another other. Ian Lavery, who was Labour party chair when Jeremy Corbyn was leader, has used an article for HuffPost to say it would be â€œgrotesqueâ€� and â€œmind-blowingâ€� for Labour to vote against an increase in corporation tax. Yesterday Sir Keir Starmer said now was not the time for tax rises for families or businesses. Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, has said Labour would give councils new powers to take over empty shops. In a speech she said: Where there are persistently empty shops, blighting local areas and not being filled, we should give local councils the power to step in â€“ just as they can with persistently empty homes already. 40% of small businesses say that making vacant units available for rent is one of the biggest changes that should be made to help their high street. Where these are not coming back into use via the market, we would create an â€˜Empty Shop Orderâ€™, giving local councils the power to take them over, bring them back into use and offer them to local businesses or other enterprises. Once this is successful, and council has recouped its costs, the landlord should begin receiving rent again from the property. The government should look to use the newly expanded dormant assets fund to provide loans to councils for this purpose. In a Q&A after the speech, Dodds restated the partyâ€™s opposition to corporation tax rising now. This is from the Timesâ€™ Eleni Courea.

2021-02-25T13:29:26Z,politics,Politics,Norman Fowler to step down early as Lord Speaker ,"Norman Fowler is to step down early as Lord Speaker so he can campaign on issues including HIV/Aids and the persecution of LGBT people, he has announced in the House of Lords. Lord Fowler, who as health secretary under Margaret Thatcher was central to early government information campaigns about HIV, will step down near the end of April, ahead of the formal end of his five-year term in September. Announcing the move in the Lords, Fowler, 83, said the upper house was introducing a series of structural and organisational changes and that it would be best if these were “seen through by the team who will be implementing them”. He also said, however, that after more than 50 years in the Commons and then Lords as a Conservative, he wanted to sit as an independent backbencher and speak openly on policy issues. “I’m only 83, and unless I am careful I won’t have time to start my next career,” he said. A key part of this will be campaigning on what Fowler called the “modern evils” of the continued global prevalence of HIV/Aids, and counties that criminalise or persecute LGBT people. Fowler’s status as a recognised champion of LGBT rights has its origins in his battles within Thatcher’s cabinet to ensure proper efforts were made to combat the spread of the virus. Speaking earlier this month, Fowler said he insisted that government leaflets about HIV from 1986 should explain sexual practices which made transmission more likely, despite Thatcher’s aversion to the idea. He will also speak out against the size of the Lords, which now has 830 members, including more than 50 created by Boris Johnson, despite cross-party agreement that the total should be reduced to 600. Even as Lord Speaker, Fowler was open about his concerns for the upper house, telling the Guardian in 2019 that there were too many “passengers” who contributed little. Fowler has been seen more generally as a reforming Lord Speaker, also presiding over a change to procedures on bullying and harassment, and granting many more private notice questions, the Lords equivalent of urgent questions in the Commons. The Lords has also adapted more significantly to hybrid sittings than the Commons during the Covid pandemic. MPs have to vote in person or via an in-person proxy, but peers have been able to vote electronically using a system called PeerHub since June."
2021-02-25T12:15:25Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson sets up committee to focus on keeping UK together ,"Boris Johnson has set up a cabinet committee to maintain his grip on keeping the UK union together, after two former heads of the No 10 unit devoted to the issue left the post within weeks of one another other. Oliver Lewis, a key aide who was appointed to head the No 10 union unit, quit last week after just two weeks in the role. His predecessor, Luke Graham, was let go earlier this month. The prime minister is now changing tack to head off the growing pressure from Scottish independence campaigners, with just months to go until the Holyrood elections that some senior Tories fear will result in Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP securing a convincing victory. There is also deep frustration inside Downing Street at the perceived distraction the union unit’s leadership has become. Government sources told the Guardian the question of whether anyone would succeed the two former heads was yet to be decided. Johnson will next week chair the first meeting of the union strategy committee, which will also be attended by senior cabinet colleagues including the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, and the secretaries of state for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland – as well as Lord Frost. The committee will direct a union policy implementation committee so that the broad-brush decisions set from on-high can be turned into action across Whitehall and the territorial offices. The committees are being modelled on the Brexit strategy and operations groups that directed internal government affairs in preparation for the UK to leave the EU. In an attempt to boost the Conservatives’ polling performance, regular political meetings on the union will also now be held – bringing in senior figures from the party. A No 10 source denied initial reports the unit was being scrapped and said it would continue to exist. They added the union was one of Johnson’s top priorities and that lots of people from across Whitehall would remain working on keeping all four nations together. The SNP quickly seized on the news and called it “utterly humiliating” for Johnson. “The entire shambolic episode is the perfect analogy for the Tory government’s undemocratic anti-independence stance – crumbling under the first sign of any pressure,” said the party’s deputy leader in Westminster, Kirsten Oswald. “The reality is that no amount of rebranding or merging can take away from the fact the Tories are in turmoil and their anti-independence campaign in disarray.”"
2021-02-24T21:09:32Z,politics,Politics,UK and EU fail to break impasse over Irish Sea border,"EU and UK leaders have failed to break the impasse over the controversial Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland after more than two hours of talks. However, the two sides have pledged to reach a “pragmatic solution”, with the UK agreeing to develop new plans to respond to problems with supermarket supplies. The Democratic Unionist party leader and first minister, Arlene Foster, accused Brussels of being “stubborn and inflexible” and said it had “closed its eyes to the serious crisis within our supply chain”. In a joint statement after the meeting of the UK-EU joint committee, the co-chairs, Michael Gove and the European commission vice-president, Maroš Šefčovič, reiterated their commitment to the Northern Ireland protocol and vowed to find solutions to problems caused by the new controls on trade across the Irish Sea.
They also pledged “further joint engagement with business groups and other stakeholders” in Northern Ireland and agreed that the UK could develop a new plan to tackle the issue of supermarket supplies and invest in digital solutions for traders. The summit took place amid mounting pressure on the EU and the UK from local businesses and civic leaders to soften the impact of the Northern Ireland protocol. The UK has asked for a two-year extension to all grace periods for checks including those on food, parcels, plants and medicines. However, there was no breakthrough on the issue with Foster, who attended the meeting, telling the BBC the EU was “tone deaf” to concerns of unionists over checks that have led to shortages in supermarkets and a ban on plants and trees going from Britain to the region. But the deputy first minister, the Sinn Féin Northern Ireland leader, Michelle O’Neill, who was also at the meeting, described talks as “constructive and pragmatic” with both sides agreeing to work on solutions. Gove and Šefčovič said: “The UK and the EU underlined their shared commitment to giving effect to those solutions agreed through the joint committee on 17 December 2020, without delay. The UK noted that it would provide a new operational plan with respect to supermarkets and their suppliers, alongside additional investment in digital solutions for traders in accordance with the protocol.” They added: “Noting the need for ongoing engagement and the shared desire to act at pace, the UK and EU agreed that a further joint committee would be held to provide further steers and where appropriate approvals, and would liaise on timings.”"
2021-02-24T19:34:59Z,politics,Politics,Boris the abuser merely swapped the Telegraph for Downing Street | John Crace,"The sense of ennui was almost tangible. Two men merely going through the formalities of prime minister’s questions with neither expecting their exchanges to serve much – if any – purpose. All of which was pretty much as Boris Johnson had planned. Boris has never been one to offer a straight answer to a straight question so his long-term goal has always been to lower the Labour leader’s expectations to his own level. And judging by Keir Starmer’s rather lacklustre performance, he’s just about achieved his aim. For this week, at least. Maybe Starmer will surprise us all next Wednesday by expressing himself through the medium of interpretative dance.
On Tuesday we were treated to the startling admission that Johnson had abandoned a career in journalism because he was fed up with abusing people. So we got to see that Boris had merely swapped the pages of the Daily Telegraph for Downing Street. After all, why limit yourself to an audience of a few hundred thousand when you have the intelligence of the entire country at your disposal to insult? For what better way to display your contempt for everyone than by rewriting PMQs as a pointless, unfunny farce. Starmer’s sense of resignation was apparent from the off. Normally the Labour leader can rustle up some enthusiasm for at least his first two questions before the air of futility descends, but this time he appeared to have lost the will to live before he had even begun speaking. He rushed his way through his first question about the Tory backbenchers criticising the government’s coronavirus roadmap safe in the knowledge that it would be ignored before moving on to financial support for those asked to self-isolate. Johnson merely lied, claiming that everyone was eligible for £500. Everyone, that is, apart from those who aren’t eligible. Even the digs felt laboured. Maybe Boris is finding impersonating a grown-up harder work than he had imagined. He brushed aside Keir’s remarks about croneyism in awarding PPE contracts to Tory donors with access to Matt Hancock’s Whatsapp number (what was the point of being in power if you weren’t prepared to give a few mates a leg up now and again? ) and the exchanges over which party would raise taxes higher went nowhere. At one stage it felt as if we had disappeared through the looking glass with Johnson promising the Tories would spend more and raise taxes higher than anything Labour had dreamed possible. Before going on to contradict himself by saying Labour would raise taxes higher. Confused? You will be… Johnson concluded by suggesting Starmer was a ‘“druidical rocking stone”. Though obviously this was intended as a compliment, because he’s given up abuse for Lent. “He vacillates, we vaccinate,” he said. A charge that might have carried more force if it hadn’t been the Tories who had been doing the dithering while the UK death toll exceeded 120,000. Nonetheless, Boris had got through the session almost entirely unscathed, so he had successfully executed a pointless job pointlessly. Yet even when Boris is talking pure bollocks you are still left with the feeling that somewhere inside him there is a homunculus capable of talking in proper sentences. Sadly, the same can not be said for Gavin Williamson, who was taking the evening No 10 press conference: listening to him reading a script is like hearing someone for whom English is a third language.
And a beginner at that. So it can only be an act of sadism – both towards the country and Private Pike – that Johnson has appointed Williamson to be his education secretary. One can only assume that Gav’s glory days as Fireplace Salesman of 2007 had little to do with his line in patter. Most Downing Street press conferences have a vague sense of purpose – a piece of news the government wants the country to hear. Only this time Williamson had been sent out with precisely nothing new to say. Or if there was something, then Gav had forgotten what it was by the time he started because all he could do was mouth it was safe for schools to go back on 8 March – something we’d already been told last Monday – and that he wanted children to catch up as much as possible on everything they had missed. Not that he had a clue how this was going to happen, but he hoped it would all turn out OK in the end. Gav looked straight ahead into the camera and started to ad lib about pupils “attaining their attainment targets”. A huge mistake even for someone who can barely manage a script. He couldn’t say anything on exams other than they were likely to be marked on teacher assessment. He couldn’t say how the summer schools would be staffed. He couldn’t even say how the extra money the government had made available would be allocated. Having screwed up so badly last year, Williamson has literally had one job since the beginning of lockdown and he hasn’t got round to doing it. So much for his own attainment targets. Come the end no one was much the wiser. Both of what the press conference had been about and why Gav was in charge of education. The last question went to a journalist from the TES. Why did he think that 96% of teachers felt that he was doing a crap job, she asked. Williamson quickly changed the subject. After all, his performance over the previous 40 minutes had pretty much answered that."
2021-02-24T18:40:16Z,politics,Politics,Liverpool council may hold vote to scrap role of mayor over selection fiasco,"Liverpool city councillors hope to hold an emergency vote next week to abolish the position of elected city mayor in protest at Labour scrapping its all-female shortlist for the role. They are waiting to see who, if anyone, applies to be the new candidate for a job now viewed widely as a poisoned chalice after the selection process was dismissed as a stitch-up. New nominations must be submitted by midday on Thursday and interviews are scheduled to be conducted on Monday. Two Liverpool MPs expressed their shock at Labour’s decision to re-open the process and backed calls to scrap the mayoral role. Paula Barker, the Labour MP for Liverpool Wavertree, said in a statement on Twitter, that it was her firm belief that Liverpool needed a new democratic model and that the current mayoral one was broken. She wrote: “The concentration of executive power in one office is fundamentally unhealthy.” Barker said it was “crucial” that Labour did not underestimate the frustration and anger among its own activists at the administration’s failings, adding that this presented “a long overdue opportunity for the party to break with the mayoral model once and for all”. The Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside, Kim Johnson, echoed that the current situation had shown there were “serious flaws” with the mayoral model, “where power is concentrated in one person and one office”. In a statement on Twitter, she said: “Perhaps now is the time to bring forward a more democratic and collegiate model of governance for the people of Liverpool.” Speculation is growing that an independent candidate could win in May’s election. Frances Molloy, a road safety campaigner touted as a possible Labour candidate, said: “It would in all sincerity be extremely difficult to even consider or support a process that has been far from satisfactory.” Molloy, who won an eight-year fight last year to ban old tyres on vehicles after her son was killed in a coach crash, did not rule out standing as an independent. “The three women candidates all deserved so much better. The role may now be better served by an independent candidate going forward as the political fallout and in-house fighting would be a serious distraction from the role,” she said. Theresa Griffin, a former Labour MEP for the north-west, who has also been suggested as a possible Labour mayoral candidate, said she was unsure whether she would go for it. One senior woman in the Liverpool Labour party said she “wouldn’t touch it with a bargepole after how they treated three strong Labour women” and that the job was a poisoned chalice. The Labour party suspended the selection race on Tuesday and reopened applications just before ballots were due to go out to members. The city’s current lord mayor, Anna Rothery, who has the backing of Jeremy Corbyn and the powerful Unite union, was effectively barred from reapplying. She was up against two councillors: Wendy Simon, who took over as acting mayor following the arrest of the incumbent, Joe Anderson, in December; and Ann O’Byrne, who quit as Anderson’s deputy in 2018. In her statement, Johnson also said she did not believe racism was at the heart of the move, following reports that Rothery is pursuing a racial discrimination case if the party does not reverse the decision. If she had been elected, Rothery would have been Liverpool’s first black city mayor. Amid speculation that Rothery could run as an independent candidate, as Ken Livingstone did successfully in London, a senior Labour figure said: “I think if the party turns around to you and says: ‘You are not fit for public office in our eyes’, then, why would you not be considering it?”. It remains to be seen whether the traditionally Labour city would back an independent candidate. Fury was directed at Labour’s HQ from figures across all wings of the party in Liverpool, one of its remaining northern heartlands. Councillor Barry Kushner, the cabinet member for housing, said the fiasco should have no reflection on the competence of those in charge of running the city. “There are some serious things we’re dealing with, from the pandemic, to a rise in unemployment, maintaining our children’s services,” he said. It was only in January that Liverpool councillors voted to hold a referendum in 2023 to ask Liverpudlians whether they wanted to keep the position of city mayor or replace it with a council leader and cabinet, a committee system or a hybrid model. But the Guardian understands that senior Labour figures in the city are now discussing calling a vote at next Wednesday’s full council meeting on scrapping the mayoralty before the local elections in May. They believe they would win the vote, knowing that the main opposition councillors from the Liberal Democrats have long campaigned to scrap the role. There is nothing the national Labour party could do to stop them. They think they could still hold a referendum in 2023 to decide on how the city should be governed in the long term. The council is not obliged to consult voters on the matter. The position was created in 2012 after councillors voted it through, bypassing the referendum process adopted by other cities."
2021-02-24T18:32:48Z,politics,Politics,Can a new Beveridge fix a broken welfare state?,"John Harris is so right (What British politicians won’t admit – we need to transform the welfare state, 21 February). Can we start the debate with the future of work? Daniel Suskind, in A World Without Work, advocates a payment that reflects how a nation’s social capital is the basic resource from which all else flows. All citizens contribute to the formation of this and all should be able to draw a regular dividend. The psychology needs to change from handouts to dividends as an earned return. A citizens’ basic income would underpin future life with a portfolio of occupations, including, for example, some work in the market economy, some self-employment, the gig economy, volunteering, exchange and caring. If Covid-19 has taught us one thing, it is that nothing works without social capital. Roger Read Troon, Ayrshire • I agree wholeheartedly with John Harris. However, I was disappointed that there was little mention of methods of creating employment. In the past, there were people who cleaned the streets and looked after municipal parks and gardens. On a visit to Japan, I was astounded at the number of people still employed serving the community. I have a son with learning difficulties whose highlight of the week is helping a team of volunteers looking after flowerbeds and picking up litter. How much better it would be for him to be employed (as he was before austerity) rather than pocketing his personal independence payment etc, and having nothing to do for the rest of the week. John Lawrence Ulverston, Cumbria • Those calling for a “new Beveridge” should be careful what they wish for. First, Beveridge’s social security proposals were a right-leaning liberal substitute for social democracy. He favoured levelling up the poor to a basic minimum standard, but not at the expense of any levelling down of the rich. Second, it was not Beveridge, but the Attlee government that created the modern welfare state. Socialist collectivism was the essential driver behind the NHS. Despite this, the Beveridge report was important symbolically, as a rallying point. What is required now is not another expert report but a comprehensive, inclusive and co-produced examination of the current crises of inequality and how to overcome them – much like the fairness commissions that have sat at local level over the past decade. Alan Walker Professor of Social Policy, University of Sheffield • People calling for a new Beveridge report need to be aware of the constructive accounting in the report’s appendix. In 1943 it estimated that the cost of the NHS to the exchequer in 1945 would be £170m. However, unlike the cost for social support, which was to increase, NHS expenditure in 1965 was forecast to be exactly the same. The seeds of the continual crises of the NHS stem from the Beveridge report itself. Dr Ceri Brown Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire • Beveridge’s five “evil giants” still stalk the land, albeit in mutated forms. Any fresh approach will have to tackle them: want, with a revised and fairer benefit and social security system; disease, with an integrated national and local health and social care service; ignorance, with schools valuing occupational as much as academic skills; squalor, with housing for rent, not just for ownership; idleness, with training for work in an environmentally friendly economy. Dr Colin Smith West Kirby, Wirral"
2021-02-24T18:23:02Z,politics,Politics,UK Covid: Williamson hopes children will get 'time in schools' this summer - as it happened,"Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, has said he hopes pupils in England will get â€œtime in schoolsâ€� this summer under government plans to fund catch-up school activities. Speaking at a No 10 press conference, he said: On the summer holidays, what we have done in terms of a Â£200m programme is we want schools to be putting on great activities, whether it is education-led or even wellbeing-led, so weâ€™d be hoping that schools can be offering that, draw down that funding in order to be offering that to children. Yes, weâ€™d hope that schools are offering time in schools for children and thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve put the funding there. Williamson said that plans being announced in the Commons tomorrow about how exam grades will be awarded in England this summer would involve the government trusting teachers, not algorithms. He said: We are putting trust in teachers. Thatâ€™s where the trust is going - there is going to be no algorithms whatsoever but there will be a very clear and robust appeals mechanism. And he also confirmed that secondary schools in England will be allowed to stagger studentsâ€™ return to the classroom from 8 March. Primary school pupils will all go back on 8 March. The Department for Education has published a report showing that pupils from poorer areas have suffered 50% more â€œlearning lossâ€� during the pandemic than pupils from wealthier areas. (See 3.30pm.) Greece is in â€œtechnicalâ€� talks with the UK over allowing Britons carrying a vaccine passport to travel to its tourist hotspots from May despite concerns in Brussels and other EU capitals. People who are on a GP register for learning disabilities will now be prioritised for a coronavirus vaccination in England, following updated advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). Clinical trials of vaccines against new variants of coronavirus will start in the summer to ensure updated boosters are available for the autumn if needed, Oxfordâ€™s lead vaccine researcher has told MPs. Rishi Sunak has ruled out a rise in fuel duty after concluding that reliance on cars as a transport safety measure during the pandemic is still too great, Treasury sources have said. Boris Johnson has promised that extra Covid financial support in next weekâ€™s budget will not be â€œpaltryâ€�, as he refused to rule out tax rises or extending the Â£500 payment to more people self-isolating. Momentum, the leftwing Labour group set up to champion Jeremy Corbyn and his agenda, has criticised Sir Keir Starmer for opposing an increase in business taxes in next weekâ€™s budget. At PMQs Starmer asked Boris Johnson if he agreed with him that â€œnow is not the time for tax rises for families and for businessesâ€�. Johnson sidestepped the question, but a Momentum spokesperson said later: During the pandemic big corporations like Amazon have cashed in while working people struggle to get by. Labour should support both raising corporation tax and a special Covid-19 windfall tax for sectors that have made super profits. We should use the cash to fund a new future for Britain based on a green jobs boom, a massive program of social house building, and taking rail, mail and utilities back into democratic public ownership. Boris Johnson is â€œan unrepentant and inveterate liarâ€� who feels he is not subject to the same rules as others, Sylvie Bermann, the former French ambassador to the UK during the Brexit vote, says in a new book. MPs have reversed a Lords amendment to the fire safety bill which sought to prohibit building owners from passing on any remediation costs, such as the replacement of dangerous cladding, to leaseholders and tenants. As PA Media reports, the Commons voted to disagree with the Lords amendment by 340 votes to 225, majority 115. Amendments tabled by backbench Conservative MPs were not voted on. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2021-02-24T18:03:01Z,politics,Politics,"Salmond may have questions to answer about past conduct, says Sturgeon","Nicola Sturgeon has suggested Alex Salmond still has to answer questions about his past behaviour towards women, after she accused him of peddling “wild, untrue and baseless claims” about a conspiracy against him. The first minister implied that Salmond, her former mentor and predecessor as Scottish National party leader, was being dishonest about his motives after he turned down several offers to give evidence to a Holyrood inquiry. Speaking during a Covid briefing as Holyrood officials confirmed Salmond was now expected to appear before MSPs on Friday, Sturgeon accused him of diverting attention from questions about his past conduct. “Maybe creating an alternative reality in which the organs of the state [were] all part of some wild conspiracy against him, for reasons I can’t explain, maybe that’s just easier than accepting at the root of all this might just have been issues in his own behaviour,” she said. “But that’s for him to explain, if he ever decides to pitch up and sit in front of the committee.”
Her comments came as the lord advocate, James Wolffe QC, rejected Salmond’s suggestions the Crown Office was suppressing evidence to help the government, after he answered an emergency question in parliament from Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s acting leader. Opposition parties were furious after the Crown Office urged Holyrood officials to heavily redact a piece of Salmond’s evidence on Monday night, leading to parts of it being edited out in case it breached a court order. Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, told BBC Radio Scotland that Holyrood was facing a crisis of credibility. Salmond’s lawyers said they had written to the lord advocate for an urgent explanation into the Crown’s “unprecedented and highly irregular actions”. Wolffe said he first heard about the Crown Office request after its letter was sent, and had no role in its decision. “[The] Crown has no interest in interfering with or limiting the conduct of proceedings in this parliament,” he said. “It’s only interest is securing observation and compliance with an order of the high court.” During her media briefing, Sturgeon referred to Salmond’s trial in March 2020 where he was acquitted of 14 charges of sexual assault, including one attempted rape, involving 10 women. Some of the complainants were SNP officials, others worked for the Scottish government. The motives of those women were now being “maligned [and] have been accused of being liars and conspiracists”, she said. “The behaviour complained of was found by a jury not to constitute criminal conduct and Alex Salmond is innocent of criminality, but that doesn’t mean the behaviour complained of didn’t happen and I think it’s important that we don’t lose sight of that.” Salmond, who alleges in his submissions there has been “a deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort” by his former colleagues to destroy him, has been approached for a response. Salmond pleaded not guilty and was acquitted of all 14 charges, but during his two-week trial acknowledged some incidents had taken place, including stroking the face of one junior official as she slept in a car next to him. He said he was trying to gently wake her up. He told the jury he had kissed and caressed another former official in Bute House, the first minister’s official residence in Edinburgh, but denied her allegation in court that he attempted to rape her some months later. He also admitted to having a “sleepy cuddle” with a female civil servant in his bedroom at Bute House, after drinking spirits. She had accused him of sexually assaulting her, including pulling up her dress. He told the jury that was not true but admitted later apologising to her in person. He denied outright that he had fondled the knee of an SNP politician in a car and also denied he had touched another woman’s buttocks and breasts. “I have never attempted to have non-consensual sexual relations with anyone in my entire life,” Salmond said. Some assault allegations were “deliberate fabrications for political purposes”, he told the jury. “Some are exaggerations that are taken out of proportion.” As Wolffe was speaking, it emerged the Holyrood committee has asked him back to give further evidence within the next few days, and will be issuing a legal order compelling the Crown Office to release additional, but unspecified evidence, to the parliament. It is also writing to Lady Dorrian, the senior judge who presided over Salmond’s trial last year, to ask her to set out whether her court order required Holyrood to redact significant parts of Salmond’s evidence on Tuesday."

She also claims some Brexiters are consumed with hatred for Germany and gripped by a myth that they liberated Europe on their own, describing Brexit as a triumph of emotion over reason, won by a campaign full of lies in which negative attitudes to migration were exploited by figures such as Johnson and Michael Gove. Bermann, who served as the French ambassador to the UK from 2014 to 2017 and has been one of the most senior diplomats in the French diplomatic service, including as ambassador to China and to Russia, assesses the British handling of the Covid pandemic as among the worst in the world alongside that of Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. She predicts Johnson will seek to use Covid to mask the true economic cost of Brexit on the UK economy. Johnson, she says, comes from an Eton and Oxford University class that believes they are entitled to use language to provoke. Describing him as intelligent and charming, she says he uses “lies to embellish reality, as a game and as instrument of power. The ends justify the means. He has no rules.”
Asked at a Royal United Services Institute thinktank event about her description of him as an unrepentant liar, she said: “He would not object to being called that. He knows he is a liar. He has always played with that. He was fired from his first post for that reason.” In her book, Goodbye Britannia, she seeks to define the psyche that led to Brexit. She describes “the partisans of Brexit as reciting a history in which the UK is never defeated, never invaded”. She suggests a country that considers it singlehandedly won the second world war, liberating the continent and deserving of gratitude. Referencing the more than 22 million Russians who died in the war, she says “this does not disturb the discourse of the Brexiters who peddle the myth that the UK liberated Europe alone and needs no one”. She adds that France does have a debt of gratitude to the British, but “it is right to remember that they were not alone and you cannot live with a history that stopped in June 1944”. “The corollary of an England saving Europe,” she adds, “is a detestation of Germany and contempt for cowardice – the term is often used for those who allowed themselves to be occupied, not to mention collaborated.” The British account of the second world war, relayed in films such as Dunkirk, she says, led to loss of confidence in the EU as an instrument of peace. She admits she did not believe the Brexit referendum would be lost by David Cameron’s government, pointing out that both sides of the debate had told her the same. In retrospect, she viewed the defeat as the first crisis of electoral democracy, and the harbinger of the populism that has been followed through in the US and Europe. “David Cameron was always telling other heads of government that he would win and he rejected any help from EU countries,” she told Rusi. She said that if Cameron had warned the EU that he was going to lose, Europe would have come up with a new offer on migration. British ministers told her that they might win with as much as 60% of the vote.
In the book, she asks: “How this country whose influence had been decisive in Brussels, which insolently rolled out the red carpet for French entrepreneurs and which Xi Jinping had elected in October 2015 as the gateway to Europe, at the dawn of a golden period, how has it undertaken to scuttle itself?” She predicts: “Boris Johnson’s temptation will be to hide the bill for Brexit under the Covid carpet, valued at more than £200bn for 2020, almost as much as the United Kingdom’s total contribution to the European Union since its accession in 1973, which was £215bn.” She says it is inevitable that the UK will struggle now to find influence outside the EU, and has a Scottish independence referendum hanging over its head. She says she believes the EU would feel obliged to open talks with Scotland in the event of a referendum vote to leave the UK, but that is not the official EU position, partly due to pressure from Spain. Madrid fears the knock-on impact among Catalan separatists if an independent Scotland was allowed to join the EU."
2021-02-24T13:07:37Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak freezes fuel duty over reliance on cars in pandemic,"Rishi Sunak has ruled out a rise in fuel duty after concluding that reliance on cars as a transport safety measure during the pandemic is still too great, Treasury sources have said. The chancellor is understood to have seriously considered an increase before his previous budget last March, keen to send a signal about the UK government’s green agenda. The Treasury also considered a rise of up to 5p a litre from March 2021 on the assumption that the UK would be back to somewhere near normal transport use. “More people are still using cars as safer mode of transport,” a Treasury source said. “And there is a massive cost to electric vehicles at the moment – that feels like the priority to address.” The chancellor may also extend the initiative under which drivers of company electric cars pay no benefit-in-kind tax until April 2021. The decision not to increase fuel duty means it has been frozen for 10 years at 58p a litre after a major campaign by tabloid newspapers that is estimated to have cost the Treasury more than £50bn in lost revenue. A rise in future years is seen as inevitable, however, as more motorists switch to electric cars, which could lead to a steep fall in the Treasury’s revenues unless it increases the duty. A letter to Sunak from MPs, organised by the campaign Fair Fuel, urged the chancellor on Wednesday not to increase fuel duty and even to consider a cut. The letter from 26 MPs said “any potential rise would disproportionately impact the lower paid and workers outside of London” and pointed to the prime minister’s pledge in 2019 not to raise the tax. The budget on 3 March is expected to extend Covid support packages until at least the end of June. Boris Johnson’s roadmap for lifting restrictions anticipates that all limits on social interaction will be lifted by 21 June. That will include extending the furlough scheme, expected to cost up to £4bn a month, the business rates holiday for the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors and the VAT cut for hospitality and tourism. The Times reported on Wednesday that the stamp duty holiday would also be extended."
2021-02-24T12:47:38Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit trade delays getting worse at UK border, survey finds","Delays importing and exporting goods to and from the EU have worsened since Brexit was introduced at the start of the year and will result in stock shortages and price rises for consumers, according to a report. A survey of 350 supply chain managers found that two out of three had experienced delays of “at least two to three days” getting goods into the UK, compared with 38% who reported delays in a similar survey in January. A third of this group said the delays were “significantly longer” than in January, 28% said “slightly longer” and 15% reported delays of a similar length to January. Just 18% of those surveyed by the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply (CIPS) said they experienced no delays or fewer delays.
The situation was only slightly better for exports, with 44% experiencing delays of at least two to three days getting goods into the EU. The survey comes as one of the UK’s largest chemical producers, BASF, reveals it has experienced “substantial friction” from the new trade barriers caused by withdrawal from the EU. In a submission to the Scottish parliament ahead of a committee hearing on Brexit on Thursday it said its biopesticide business “has not exported successfully from the UK during January”. It said product losses had been high and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs had been unable to answer “standard phytosanitary questions the industry warned of over two years ago” with hold-ups resulting in “damaged and unusable” products reaching the customer. It reported that drivers were being forced to sleep in their trucks for days at the UK-Irish border and lorry loads were being turned back from their journey to the EU because paperwork and mixed loads “seem to flummox port officials”. And in an indication that Brexit is not a teething problem, it sad initial optimism about tariffs “has largely disappeared”. “The lack of any transition period is one of the reasons for the practical difficulties,” in addition to the rapidly agreed deal which meant negotiators “ran out of time to address them [issues] fully,” it said in a 24-page submission by the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. In a separate submission to the Welsh affairs committee in the House of Commons, ABPI warned of an “unnecessary duplicative requirement” to batch test medicines coming in from the EU from 2022 in Northern Ireland and into Great Britain from 2023. Unless a deal is struck, the current situation could mean delays of up to six weeks to get medicines to patients, the ABPI said. Dr John Glen, a CIPS economist and visiting fellow at the Cranfield School of Management, said: “We are well into the second month of the new arrangements and the hope that delays at the border would reduce as freight volumes returned to normal and customs systems became used to the new processes has not come to pass.” He added: “The knock-on impact of these delays will trickle far down the supply chain and ultimately result in stock shortages and inflated prices for consumers.” Almost half said delays were caused by customs paperwork on both sides of the border. Glen said business should brace for the delays to continue “for at least the next few months”, with an array of new checks being introduced in the second phase of the UK application of the Brexit deal on 1 April and 1 July. A government spokesperson said the phased approach to import controls over three stages up until 1 July 2021 would “ensure traders and hauliers have sufficient time to adjust to new processes”. It added that “the latest available data shows that overall freight volumes between the UK and the EU are back to their normal levels, thanks to the hard work put in by traders and hauliers to prepare for the end of the transition period” and that extensive support was available including a £20m SME Brexit support fund as well as webinars, helplines and guides for tailored information."
2021-02-24T06:00:02Z,politics,Politics,MPs criticise academics for sending them fictitious emails for research,"MPs have criticised a project by academics that involved sending emails from fictitious constituents claiming they were concerned about financial support during the coronavirus lockdown. Researchers at King’s College London (KCL) and the London School of Economics (LSE) sent emails to every MP’s inbox from invented characters including a cleaner and lawyer. Copies of messages seen by the Guardian showed the purported senders – who signed themselves off with names including Paul, Thomas and Maryam – wrote that they worked for large companies but were “worried about the long term” and saw “people all around me who are losing jobs or experiencing pay cuts”. All emails ended with the request: “I’d like to know what you and the Conservative party are going to do to get us through this crisis in the best possible way.” Some added they were a “Conservative supporter”. Staffers in different MPs’ offices discovered the connection only when they replied with a standard question, asking for the sender’s address so they could confirm they were the right person to help, and received no response. Tory MP Tim Loughton, a former minister, challenged the academics – and asked them to confirm the messages were fake, adding: “Publicly funded offices of MPs or the MPs themselves were requested to respond to those emails.” Prof Rosie Campbell of KCL said in her reply that a similar project was being run in Germany and the Netherlands to “investigate the link between voters and constituents through the email experiment and analysis of parliamentary speeches”. Campbell explained her LSE colleague was “sending out debriefing emails at present”, and added: “We received the funding before the pandemic and deliberated as to whether we should go ahead. “We concluded that the issues we were studying were still relevant during the pandemic and that the basic emails without follow-up were not too burdensome. We sincerely apologise if this is not your view. “We are very aware how busy MPs are and raising awareness of the extremely high levels of responsiveness among MPs in the UK is one of our anticipated outcomes … It is absolutely not our intention to waste MPs’ valuable time.” Labour MP Navendu Mishra said the research coming “when staff in all MPs’ offices are working so hard to process record levels of correspondence” was “disgraceful” and called on KCL and LSE to apologise. The Unite union’s parliamentary staffer branch said workers “do not deserve to be treated as guinea pigs in some time and motion study on top of that”. The MPs’ staff branch of the GMB union sent a letter to KCL calling the project “ethically dubious”. LSE said it was not directly involved in the research. KCL did not reply to a request for comment. • This article was amended on 24 February 2021. An earlier version misnamed Prof Rosie Campbell as Prof Rosie Cooper. The subheading was also amended to clarify the nature of LSE’s involvement."
2021-02-24T06:00:02Z,politics,Politics,"Be 'muscular' and drive green recovery, Cameron tells Johnson","Boris Johnson must be “muscular” in reshaping the economy to bring about a green recovery from the coronavirus crisis, former prime minister David Cameron has said, calling for an active policy of industrial intervention. Cameron, who as prime minister from 2010 to 2016 oversaw the UK’s recovery from the 2008 financial crisis, said the lessons from that recession were clear. “My advice would be, from what I learnt, is that as well as the framework [of climate and economic policy], you have to roll up your sleeves and be quite muscular in your interventionism,” he told the Guardian in an interview. “The government has got a strong framework for green energy policy and in green investment, much of which we put in place, but it needs to combine that with active assistance and helping with key green investments that can make a difference,” he said. “There’s every opportunity for this recovery to be a green recovery.” Cameron pointed to the example of his government encouraging the German company Siemens to build a wind turbine factory in Hull. “That is a transformational investment, that only happened because we really helped to make it happen. We cleared all the obstacles out of the way, we helped in lots of different ways. And I think there’ll be lots of opportunities like that [for Johnson],” he said. Johnson has been seen as an instinctively free-market, anti-interventionist Tory in the past, though his response to the coronavirus crisis has shown a willingness to tear up the rulebook. Cameron said that even Conservative prime ministers could overrule the free market when they wanted to. “[Being] Conservative is not intervening everywhere all the time but being quite selective. That’s what Margaret Thatcher was with the motor industry, getting Toyota and Nissan and Honda to come to Britain,” he said. Cameron also wants the government to show leadership on the climate ahead of the UK’s hosting of the Cop26 UN climate summit this November in Glasgow, and as holder of the revolving G7 presidency this year. The former prime minister has joined Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former president of Liberia, former Irish president Mary Robinson, and other current and former heads of state, to focus attention on fragile states, and the opportunity to use solar and wind power to bring electric power to the 800 million people who lack it. The Council on State Fragility, of which Cameron is co-chair, issued a call to action to the G7 on Wednesday, with a report that found 90% of the world’s 800 million people who lack electricity live in fragile states. Aid donors gave only $460m for fragile states to gain energy access in 2018, which the council said fell well short of the sums needed. Sirleaf warned: “The Covid-19 crisis has derailed decades of progress on extreme poverty and will continue to have devastating indirect effects on fragile states. A global, concerned push to invest in clean energy in fragile countries could transform lives by powering homes, businesses, schools and hospitals, which will be critical for these countries to recover.” Cameron said solar and wind power were now cheap options to bring power to countries beset by conflict, deepening poverty and instability. “All the stars are in alignment, because distributed green energy systems have become way more cost effective, they’re way more available, and this links in with people’s desire to see action taken to deal with climate change and shortage of electricity in a sustainable way,” he said. “This year with the [UK presidency of] the G7 and the Cop coming at the same time, it’s a very good moment to try and get it done.” Cameron said the government’s decision to cut the overseas aid budget, which he set at 0.7% of GDP, to 0.5%, was “a big mistake” ahead of Cop26 and the UK’s G7 presidency. “It’s both a tragedy and a mistake … particularly as Britain is making its way in the post-Brexit world and wants to prove that it is a global power and can still punch above its weight, and has important elements of soft power. Our aid budget was an absolutely key element [of soft power].” Cameron refused to criticise the government, as many others have done, for giving the green light to a new coal mine in Cumbria. “I need to look at this more,” he said. “When I was prime minister, we really moved decisively away from coal for power. We still have an iron and steel industry that imports coking coal.” He added: “I try to limit my criticism of the government to one at any one time. And what’s happened over DFID [the former Department for International Development, which was axed], and aid is the thing I have called the government out on. On climate change and the targets they’ve set, I think they are still pursuing a very much world-leading strategy, which is what I put in place, and they’ve added to it with more aggressive targets, and I think that’s all to the good.”"
2021-02-24T00:01:42Z,politics,Politics,"New UK laws needed to stop hate speech and extremism, says report","Massive gaps in the law allow terrorism to be glorified and hatred to be spread, and a major crackdown is needed to stop more violence being triggered, an official report has said. The report from the Commission for Countering Extremism (CCE) calls for new laws to be considered, with groups accused of spreading hate facing bans. Potential targets named by the CCE could include the far-right English Defence League and Cage, which has been accused of supporting Islamist extremism and violence. The commission, which was set up by the government in 2017, also claimed that a tougher approach could have spotted that Thomas Mair, the man who assassinated Labour MP Jo Cox in 2016, was heading towards violent extremism. The report was co-authored by commission chair Sara Khan and former terrorism chief Sir Mark Rowley. It said that under current law praising Adolf Hitler, denying the Holocaust, praising Osama bin Laden, and far-right murderers such as Anders Brevik and Christchurch mosque attacker Brenton Tarrant was legal as long as the material did not directly encourage violence. Other legal material, the report said, includes “fascist extremist organisation circulating pamphlets which promote false claims about a ‘white genocide’ intended to stir up hatred against a racial or religious group, but which are not threatening, abusive, or insulting”. This amounted to a “gaping chasm”, the report said, with Rowley adding: “Not only have our laws failed to keep pace with the evolving threat of modern-day extremism, current legal boundaries allow extremists to operate with impunity. “Hateful extremism is creating an ever-bigger pool for terrorists to recruit from, as well as increasing violence, hate crime and tensions between and within communities. The current situation is simply untenable.” Rowley said even he was shocked by the extent of extremism and its spread, fuelled in recent years by the internet and social media. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has been briefed on the report and is studying its recommendations. Successive governments since 2005 have tried to toughen the UK’s stance against extremism, which falls short of breaking current terrorism or public order laws. But previous efforts have failed because of concerns that new laws might criminalise dissent, free speech and unpopular opinions. An attempt by the Cameron government failed because it could not define extremism. The report by the CCE has the support of critics of previous efforts including activist Peter Tatchell. Tony Blair and David Cameron have also backed the report’s findings. Rowley said this study avoided that pitfall by targeting the worst material, so called hateful extremism, where one group targets another to “to advance a political, religious or racial supremacist ideology” and wanting “to create a climate conducive to hate crime, terrorism or other violence”. It is based on a concept already in use in terrorism trials, the “mindset material” where extremist material, such as from the far right or Islamist terrorist videos, are accepted as evidence of pre-existing extremism. The biggest example of extremism that caused major harm was that of Anjem Choudary who as spokesperson for Al-Muhajiroun and its successor groups was linked to up to 100 terror recruits. The commission said possession of terrorist material should be criminalised. Such an approach may have captured Choudary’s onetime friend Khuram Butt, ringleader of the 2017 London Bridge attack. In the years before the atrocity he was arrested and released despite being in possession of beheading videos and Isis propaganda because merely possessing them was not deemed on offence. The new suggested approach drops talk of opposition to British values as being a sign of extremism and suggests a classification system could be used to rank the danger alleged extremist material poses, similar to that used for paedophile material or the harm drugs pose. Rowley said a tougher approach for the internet was needed but technology companies had pointed out there was little more they could do until they was an accepted definition of what counted as extremism: “The magnifying effect of social media had transformed it from a sideshow to a major threat.” The report said there were worrying signs the young were being duped by extremists. The study quoted figures showing that 15% of young people and 20% of young male respondents to a 2020 poll said “the official account of the Nazi Holocaust is a lie”, and other polling showed the young were five times more likely than pensioners to believe lies against Jewish people. Cage has long been a thorn in the side of government and counter-terrorism officials. Supporters say it is a community-based group fighting the excesses of the “war on terror”. Khan said Cage could meet the threshold for action if tougher measures were adopted. Cage accused the commission of introducing a state version of cancel culture. A spokesperson said: “The CCE appears to be implementing an ‘official’ state-sanctioned policy of ‘cancel culture’ arguing for further restrictions on lawful speech. The views advanced by the CCE represent a fringe authoritarian and Islamophobic lobby within the halls of power.” “Cage’s track record in seeking accountability for government overreach and violations of due process is well established. It is interesting that the CCE singles out a Muslim-led organisation for our warnings related to Prevent and ‘institutional Islamophobia’ even though this critique has also been made by a range of seasoned academics, UN rapporteurs and experts. “After 3 years, and at great taxpayer expense, the CCE concludes its work without any further clarity on what ‘extremism’ is. Instead it promotes ideas from some of the most stridently Islamophobic and censorious organisations in the industry.”"
2021-02-23T19:47:00Z,politics,Politics,Alex Salmond will not address MSPs on Wednesday after evidence redacted ,"Alex Salmond has refused to appear before a Holyrood committee on Wednesday after a submission about “malicious” attempts to smear him was edited following legal warnings from the Crown Office. The former first minister of Scotland had been poised to give evidence to MSPs on Wednesday afternoon about an alleged conspiracy by his former colleagues, but pulled out after a document was heavily redacted at the Crown Office’s request. His lawyer, David McKie, has suggested Salmond could appear on Friday instead to give him time to consider how that affects his testimony. “They put a torpedo through part of his evidence,” said a source close to Salmond. Sources at the parliament said it is closed on Friday, presenting serious logistical challenges, but a Holyrood spokesperson said the committee was meeting in private session on Wednesday morning to discuss its response. Salmond’s decision to pull out came after the Crown Office, Scotland’s prosecution service, told Holyrood it had “grave concerns” one of his submissions could be in contempt of court following a ruling during his criminal trial in March last year. His submission was then redacted by Holyrood lawyers. It involves allegations which Salmond argues are central to his explosive claims that Scottish National party and government figures wanted to destroy his reputation “even to the extent of having me imprisoned”. McKie told the parliament at 6.30pm on Tuesday those changes were a “serious legal impediment” for Salmond, who had been due to travel down to Holyrood from his home in Aberdeenshire on Wednesday morning. Salmond had submitted several documents to the parliamentary inquiry into the devolved government’s botched investigation into two allegations of sexual assault against him. The submissions were published by Holyrood on Monday night after weeks of legal wrangling. Within hours of their publication, prosecutors wrote urgently to the Scottish parliament, calling on it to either withdraw or redact one of Salmond’s documents. The parliament’s corporate body went into emergency session early on Tuesday morning and agreed to edit it. A Crown Office spokesperson would not confirm that it had complained or why. “We don’t confirm what we may have done about concerns we may have. One of the risks of providing details is that the potential impact of any breach may be worsened,” he said. In one submission, which remains unchanged on the parliament website, Salmond claims the group he alleges plotted against him included Peter Murrell, the chief executive of the SNP, who is Sturgeon’s husband, as well as the party’s compliance officer, Ian McCann, and Liz Lloyd, Sturgeon’s chief of staff in the government. Salmond said the Holyrood inquiry had already found evidence of behaviour by officials, advisers and ministers “which taken individually could be put down to incompetence, albeit on an epic scale”. “However, taken together, and over such a prolonged period, it becomes impossible to explain such conduct as inadvertent coincidence. The inescapable conclusion is of a malicious and concerted attempt to damage my reputation and remove me from public life in Scotland.” After winning his judicial review in January 2019, when a court ruled the internal inquiry was “tainted by apparent bias” and unlawful, Salmond was charged with 14 counts of sexual assault, including an attempted rape. He was then acquitted of every charge after a two-week trial in March 2020. His allegations were immediately rebutted by the SNP, Sturgeon and Lloyd, who accused the former first minister of failing to produce any evidence to justify his claims. In her own submission to the inquiry, Lloyd said any suggestion she sought to influence the government’s complaints procedure used to investigate Salmond in 2018 was “demonstrably false”. Nor did she have any say in the government’s decisions about the judicial review he mounted and then won against its complaints investigations. She rejected any insinuations she had leaked a report accusing Salmond of sexual misconduct to the Daily Record as unfounded. “I reject the allegation in its entirety and note that it is not substantiated by any evidence and is founded on a number of claims that are false,” Lloyd said. Sturgeon also rebutted Salmond’s claims in television interviews broadcast before his submissions were published late on Monday evening. “He [Salmond] has made claims, or he appears to be making claims or suggestions there was some kind of conspiracy against him or concerted campaign against him. There is not a shred of evidence about that, so this is the opportunity for him to replace insinuation and assertion with evidence,” she told STV. Late last week, Holyrood’s ruling corporate body, made up of party representatives, agreed Salmond’s dossier could be published after Lady Dorrian, Scotland’s second most senior judge, amended a court order she imposed during Salmond’s trial. Salmond alleges the strongest evidence of a conspiracy is contained in text messages in the evidence from this trial, which the Crown Office has refused to release for legal reasons. But he argues evidence already given to the committee clearly showed the Scottish government’s complaints policy was designed to snare him, by making its terms retrospective to include previous ministers. He accused Sturgeon and Leslie Evans, the permanent secretary of the Scottish government, of doing so in meetings in late 2017 when the policy was being drafted. Evans and other senior civil servants have already denied under oath that they deliberately pursued Salmond. Backed by Sturgeon, Evans said the policy was necessary and lawful to ensure government employees had a safe workplace."
2021-02-23T18:10:19Z,politics,Politics,Sturgeon says 'vaccine passports' worth considering if they can 'give us greater normality' – as it happened,"Scotlandâ€™s schools are expected to fully reopen in early April, with some household mixing allowed, after Nicola Sturgeon unveiled a partial route map to lifting the countryâ€™s strict Covid controls. Nicola Sturgeon has said â€œvaccine passportsâ€� would be worth considering if they could help people to get â€œsome greater normality backâ€�. But she also said she would like to see a â€œbroad consensusâ€� behind any plan to introduce them. (See 3.14pm.) Earlier Boris Johnson expressed concern that â€œvaccine passportsâ€� could be discriminatoryâ€�. He said Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, will lead the review to consider policy on this. (See 1.11pm.) The review is described as genuinely open, but it is understood that that ministers are not keen on a system where entry to a venue might depend entirely on whether or not someone has been vaccinated. Instead there is more interest in using test results too - so that entry might depend on either having been vaccinated, or having tested negative. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has been criticised for a â€œdisgustingly disrespectfulâ€� claim that there was never a national shortage of personal protective equipment during the pandemic. Welsh ministers and health experts have expressed concern at the UK governmentâ€™s target to lift all limits on socialising in England by June and insisted that reopening schools to all pupils at the same time is unsafe. Boris Johnson has said he is â€œvery optimisticâ€� all restrictions on normal life in England will end on 21 June, saying the government will continue to provide economic support to businesses until they can operate as normal â€“ appearing to confirm that many financial packages will be extended in the chancellorâ€™s March budget. Airlines and travel companies have reported a surge in holiday bookings after the Boris Johnson announced his roadmap out of lockdown. Unemployment in the UK edged higher to 5.1% in December as the governmentâ€™s furlough scheme continued to prevent a steep rise in job losses in the run-up to Christmas. Boris Johnson quit journalism for politics because he felt guilty about â€œabusing or attacking peopleâ€� without putting himself in their shoes, he told a group of schoolchildren. Labour has been accused of an anti-left â€œstitch-upâ€� after it reopened the contest to find a mayoral candidate for Liverpool, sidelining the three women who were in the running. (See 4.53pm.) Sir Keir Starmer has used a speech to the National Farmers Union conference to say Labour would be â€œabsolutely committedâ€� to investing in farming and rural communities. Boris Johnson has warned world leaders that failure to address the issue of climate change will undermine global security. As PA Media reports, chairing a virtual meeting of the United Nations security council (UNSC), the prime minister said climate change was a â€œgeopolitical issue every bit as much as it is an environmental oneâ€�. The UK has given the European Union until April 30 to approve the Brexit trade deal. As PA Media reports, MEPs insisted they did not have time to scrutinise the deal between it being struck on Christmas Eve and coming into effect on January 1 so it has only been provisionally implemented since then.A deadline to approve it by February 28 has now slipped after Michael Gove agreed to the EUâ€™s request for an extension. The Scottish parliament is redacting one of Alex Salmondâ€™s submissions about â€œmaliciousâ€� attempts by former colleagues to banish him from public life after legal warnings from the Crown Office. Thatâ€™s all from me for tonight. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2021-02-23T15:49:26Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson says he feels guilty about his journalism,"Boris Johnson quit journalism for politics because he felt guilty about “abusing or attacking people” without putting himself in their shoes, he told a group of schoolchildren on Tuesday. “I was like a journalist for a long time, I still am really, I still write stuff,” he told pupils at Sedgehill Academy in south-east London. “But when you’re a journalist, it’s a great, great job, it’s a great profession, but the trouble is that you sometimes find yourself always abusing people or attacking people.” He continued: “Not that you want to abuse them or attack them, but you’re being critical … maybe you feel sometimes a bit guilty about that because you haven’t put yourself in the place of the person you’re criticising, and so I thought I’d give it a go.” The prime minister’s press secretary, Allegra Stratton, said Johnson was referring to the job of reporters in holding the government to account, saying: “That is the prime minister talking about the fact that you … as journalists your job is to constantly challenge and that’s something that makes all of us in government better.” But others may reflect on Johnson’s record of writing in derogatory terms about groups other than politicians without necessarily “putting yourself in the place of the person you’re criticising”. In a 2018 column for the Daily Telegraph, he wrote that women who wore burkas were choosing “to go around looking like letter boxes” or “a bank robber”. In a 2002 column for the same newspaper, he described black people as “piccaninnies” and referred to “watermelon smiles”, language for which he later apologised but claimed had been taken out of context. In a 1998 column, again for the Telegraph, he used the phrase “tank-topped bumboys” to describe gay men. By the time he finally gave up the column when he became foreign secretary, Johnson was paid £275,000 a year, about £4.80 a word. As well as a columnist for the Daily Telegraph, he was a Brussels reporter for the same newspaper and editor of the Spectator. As a reporter he had a reputation for filing exaggerated, if colourful, stories and was famously fired from his first job at the Times after making up a quote and attributing it to his godfather. Since changing professions, the prime minister is said to have sometimes taken umbrage when facing negative press himself. The columnist and former newspaper editor Sir Max Hastings wrote in 2019: “I have handwritten notes from our possible next prime minister, threatening dire consequences in print if I continued to criticise him.”"
2021-02-23T15:01:38Z,politics,Politics,What is the Alex Salmond controversy all about?,"What is the Salmond controversy about? In August 2018, news leaked the Scottish government had investigated two allegations of sexual misconduct against Alex Salmond while he was first minister. It did so under new rules introduced due to the #MeToo movement, which allowed retrospective investigations into former ministers. Its findings were passed to Police Scotland, which launched its own investigation. Salmond denied the allegations, resigned from the Scottish National party, and immediately took the Scottish government to court, accusing it of abuse of process. In January 2019, the court of session in Edinburgh ruled the government inquiry was unlawful because the lead investigator had had prior contact with the complainers. Leslie Evans, the permanent secretary, admitted it was “tainted by apparent bias”. What happened next? Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, admitted she spoke to Salmond about the government inquiry five times while it was under way, including meetings at her home. She failed to tell Evans she had done so until hours before her third conversation, potentially in breach of the ministerial code. She also failed to tell parliament she had met one of Salmond’s former aides in her Holyrood office on 29 March 2018, when she is said to have been first told he was under investigation – another potential breach of the code. Several investigations were launched: Sturgeon referred herself under the ministerial code and the case was passed to James Hamilton, a former director of public prosecutions in Ireland; the Scottish parliament appointed a special committee to investigate the government’s handling of the inquiry and Sturgeon’s actions; and the government set up an internal review.
Two weeks after winning his judicial review, Salmond appeared at Edinburgh sheriff court on 14 counts, including two of indecent assault, nine of sexual assault and two attempted rapes. He denied all the charges. In August 2019, the Scottish government paid Salmond £512,000 to cover his legal expenses for the judicial review. It later emerged that figure was so high because of serious procedural concerns about the government’s handling of his legal challenge. What happened at the Salmond trial? In March 2020, after nine days of evidence at the high court, Salmond was cleared of 14 charges – an attempted rape, one intent to rape, 11 sexual assaults and two indecent assaults, against 10 women. One charge was dropped by the crown; the jury acquitted Salmond of all the others on majority verdicts. Salmond admitted in evidence he had an extramarital “sexual liaison” with one of the complainers, but on a different date to the one alleged in the charges, and a “sleepy cuddle” with another for which he soon apologised to her. It emerged during the trial a number of civil servants heard of two alleged incidents after the women involved told close colleagues. Once the trial ended, the Scottish parliament inquiry began to gather evidence. What has happened with the two remaining inquiries? The Holyrood inquiry has held 11 oral evidence sessions, given under oath, including several with Evans, the senior civil servants involved in drafting the sexual harassment policy used to investigate Salmond, and the officials who carried out the inquiry. MSPs heard that officials were aware of unspecified rumours about Salmond, including alleged bullying. The government has released thousands of pages of evidence but MSPs have repeatedly accused ministers of breaching promises to do so quickly. After ministers repeatedly refused to release their legal advice on the Salmond case, Holyrood voted twice to insist it was handed over. The government has not given way, and the committee has only been allowed to see a summary of the advice. What happens now? After weeks of legal wrangling over the publication of his submissions, Salmond has refused to appear before the Holyrood inquiry on Wednesday instead suggesting Friday, with Sturgeon expected to be its final witness next week. Both will appear under oath. Salmond’s evidence to the committee was published, in partly redacted form, in which he accused some of the most senior figures in the SNP and Scottish government of colluding in a conspiracy to destroy his political career – charges that Sturgeon, the SNP and the government reject. The committee is running out of time: Holyrood will stop sitting in late March before the Scottish elections on 6 May, and its officials have only a few weeks to write and publish the report. Meanwhile, the Scottish government will have to publish Hamilton’s report into whether Sturgeon broke the ministerial code: many observers think that investigation is a greater threat to the first minister than the Holyrood inquiry. If Hamilton finds she broke the code, she could resign."
2021-02-23T14:00:32Z,politics,Politics,Ex-MP cleared of sexual harassment after complainant's appeal dismissed,"A former MP has been cleared of sexual harassment alleged to have taken place several years ago in a House of Commons bar, in the first ruling by a new body set up to investigate potential misbehaviour by parliamentarians. The claim against Ross Thomson, the Conservative MP for Aberdeen South from 2017 to 2019, was investigated and dismissed in an initial investigation, and a follow-up investigation by the commissioner for standards last year. But the complainant appealed and had their case examined by an independent expert panel – the first time such a group has been formed to consider a case. The system was set up to avoid MPs being involved in judging the actions of their colleagues and as a result avoiding the appearance they may have acted more or less favourably towards them. The allegation against Thomson came from another former Scottish MP, Labour’s Paul Sweeney, who said Thomson had first touched and stroked him for several minutes, then groped his backside and genitals on 30 October 2018. An initial investigation upheld the first claim but dismissed the second – and concluded Sweeney made it “maliciously”. The commissioner for standards upheld there was no breach of the sexual misconduct policy to which MPs must adhere, but also decided the complainant’s claims were not “malicious”. The issue was referred to an independent expert group, when the complainant appealed – alleging the initial investigations were “unfair and inadequate”, according to a report published on Tuesday. But his appeal was rebuffed on the grounds that the expert group found the first investigation met a “sufficient standard” and the second was “very thorough”. A claim that investigators failed to speak to a “key material witness” was also dismissed, given the person “did no more than receive a hearsay account from an eyewitness”. Sweeney’s spokesperson said he is “considering the implications of the decision” and welcomed the first allegation about Thomson remaining upheld."
2021-02-23T06:00:21Z,politics,Politics,Thousands of UK language students left in limbo as Brexit hits travel plans,"Thousands of UK students hoping to spend the year abroad are caught in limbo after facing major disruption to their travel plans due to post-Brexit red tape and costs, in respect of which universities say they received inadequate guidance from the government. Coordinators of academic years abroad who spoke to the Guardian said there had been limited information from the Foreign Office ahead of Brexit on the onerous requirements that the shift in their status would incur in EU countries. Current advice differs according to the consulate and often conflicts with information from local embassies, with the result that many students have had to cancel or postpone placements, the academics said. “I don’t think anybody was fully aware of the extent of the entanglement of the UK with the EU. Like any sector – the same goes for fishing, transport and logistics – the university sector is grappling with the complexities of the situation that weren’t known until it happened,” said Claire Gorrara, dean of research and innovation at Cardiff University and chair of the University Council of Modern Languages. As of 1 January 2021, students arriving in EU countries must submit large amounts of paperwork to obtain visas for their stay, with requirements differing by country. Students must also demonstrate that they can afford their stay in some countries, including proof of more than €6,000 (£5,194) in their bank account in Austria, Italy and Portugal, or of an income of €700-€800 a month in Germany, Denmark and Sweden. Nigel Harkness, a pro-vice-chancellor and French professor at Newcastle University, said academics and students were unable to prepare for these changes before 1 January. “Most EU countries weren’t in a position to confirm what their own arrangements were because we hadn’t confirmed them on our side, so this has created extra bureaucracy, and it’s been frustrating. We’ve all been developing policy and processes on the hoof.” Despite the new rules coming into force nearly two months ago, academics said many students were still stuck in the UK awaiting further instructions or attempting to decipher conflicting information. Some students who remained in EU countries over Christmas to avoid Brexit complications have been told they must return to the UK to apply for their visas. “The UK government guidance remains insufficient – full of unhelpful ‘you may need’ phrases and links to other, EU government sites that often contradict that guidance. It’s all proving very confusing, stressful and expensive for students who until recently had freedom of movement,” said Julia Waters, a professor of French and the year abroad coordinator at the University of Reading. The year abroad is a mandatory part of modern languages degrees for about 7,000 students in the UK and is considered essential to improve their language fluency and cultural awareness. Lots of students had been planning to head out at the beginning of 2021, while those studying two or more languages typically divide the year into placements in different countries. The Brexit disruption follows months of uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Students have complained of inconsistent approaches across universities – some have prevented students from travelling all year, while others cancelled the first semester, in some cases at the last minute. This has been further complicated by some EU countries introducing travel bans on non-EU residents, which now apply to UK citizens. Caitlin Hodgson and Yasmin Payne, students at the University of Reading, employed a Spanish lawyer to help with paperwork after Spain closed its borders to the UK due to coronavirus. “We tried to start the application for residency on our own, which proved futile, firstly as you require a representative, and secondly as the majority of the steps must be done in person in Spain. As we couldn’t get to Spain without a residency, we found ourselves going in circles,” said Hodgson. Esme Cawley, a third-year French and Hispanic student at the University of Sheffield, said she had spent hundreds of pounds on healthcare plans that were not mandatory for other students travelling to Spain. “Navigating a year abroad post-Brexit has been a total administrative and financial nightmare. Different consulates have different requirements.” The Foreign Office said visa and entry requirements for UK nationals including students were set by individual EU member states and that it was working with universities to address challenges.
‘None of this is worth it … There’s so much uncertainty’ “I held out on my year abroad until January, and had to change my trip to Belgium. A couple of weeks after changing, I got emails from the university asking about applying for visas, and I looked at how expensive it would be post-Brexit and I thought, ‘None of this is worth it.’ I know someone who had to pay up to a grand in visa fees to go to Belgium. There’s so much uncertainty. We had a pre-departure meeting before we went and the university explained situations that could potentially arise, but said that they hadn’t been given the guidance to advise. I thought I would take a leave of absence, but in September visa charges will be a big thing I have to consider because I come from a low-income family. You also need to be able to prove you can afford to be there and I will never at any point have £5,000 just sitting in my account.” Rob Pearce, studying Dutch, French and Spanish at the University of Sheffield
‘For so many people, going on a year abroad is unfeasible at the moment’ “I had to come out before the Brexit deadline on 1 January to avoid getting a visa because they’re really expensive and a long process, and I wanted to go sooner rather than later. I was in a fortunate position to be able to take a risk, so I came out to Toulouse without a job. Trying to explain I’m not here illegally to prospective employers because I don’t have a visa has been tricky, but I have a job now. It was really stressful and a shame having to miss new year with my family, but I think it was worth it and I know I’m lucky to be here. For so many people going on a year abroad is unfeasible at the moment, having to get visas and go through all the bureaucracy.” Antonia Kessell, studying French and philosophy at the University of Edinburgh"
2021-02-22T22:30:11Z,politics,Politics,"Climate crisis is driving insecurity, Johnson to tell world leaders ","Boris Johnson is to tell other world leaders that the climate emergency is “driving insecurity” as he uses the first UN security council session chaired by a British prime minister in nearly 30 years to set the scene for the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow. The prime minister will chair a virtual session of the security council which will also be addressed by David Attenborough, who will warn leaders that without urgent and coherent action the pace of change could become unstoppable. While the security council has regularly discussed the threats from the climate emergency for almost 15 years, Johnson’s decision to focus on the subject will be seen as a statement of intent ahead of Cop26, due to be held in November. In words released ahead of the virtual meeting taking place on Tuesday, Johnson said the security council “is tasked with confronting the gravest threats to global peace and security, and that’s exactly what climate change represents”. He said: “From the communities uprooted by extreme weather and hunger to warlords capitalising on the scramble for resources – a warming planet is driving insecurity. “Unlike many issues the council deals with, this is one we know exactly how to address. By helping vulnerable countries adapt to climate change and cutting global emissions to net zero, we will protect not only the bountiful biodiversity of our planet, but its prosperity and security.” Attenborough was to tell world leaders that Cop26 could be “our last opportunity to make the necessary step-change” over changing climate. He said: “If we bring emissions down with sufficient vigour we may yet avoid the tipping points that will make runaway climate change unstoppable. If we objectively view climate change and the loss of nature as worldwide security threats – as indeed, they are – then we may yet act proportionately and in time.” Some of the most vulnerable countries are also planning to make an appeal to rich nations at the security council meeting, calling for more action to reduce greenhouse gases, and aid and other assistance to help make poor countries more resilient to the impacts of climate breakdown. Kat Kramer, the climate policy lead at the charity Christian Aid, said: “Millions of the world’s poorest people are already living with the impacts of climate change, which is forcing displacement, devastating livelihoods and putting pressure on communities who are competing over resources such as land and water. “In some countries, these impacts become the drivers of local conflicts which can be instrumentalised by leaders and escalate into violence and war. This threat of violence and insecurity threatens to undermine international peace and security.” Funding for poor countries to cope with the impacts of the climate crisis will be a key focus at Cop26. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, warned last year in an interview with the Guardian that the longstanding pledge by rich countries to provide $100bn (£70bn) a year to developing countries from 2020 was unlikely to be met. Of the tens of billions of climate finance that are provided each year, only about a fifth goes to helping countries adapt to the impacts of global heating. Along with the US, China, Russia and France, the UK is one of the five permanent members of the security council but has not chaired a session since John Major did so in 1992. There are also 10 non-permanent members, elected for two-year terms, which are Estonia, India, Ireland, Kenya, Mexico, Niger, Norway, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Tunisia and Vietnam. The UK has an official climate target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. A new target announced in December promises a reduction of 68% in annual carbon emissions by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, further and faster than any other major economy in the next decade."
2021-02-22T20:46:27Z,politics,Politics,"A year too late, Boris Johnson produces a reasonable plan | John Crace ","Last April the UK’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, said that 20,000 dead would be a “good outcome”. Almost a year on with the coronavirus death toll now north of 120,000 and the government having twice bungled its way out of previous lockdowns, you can see why the prime minister might want to avoid making the same mistakes with his roadmap out of England’s current restrictions. So for his statement to the Commons, we were treated to a rather different Boris Johnson from the usual one. A more careful Boris that was fighting the urge to make extravagant promises. This time, he insisted, his approach would be dictated by caution. Though for a prime minister who was adamant that his approach this time would be driven by the data rather than the dates, his statement was very date heavy. There was 8 March for the full return of schools and friends delivering dead letter drops on park benches. There was 29 March for the return of the outdoor rule of six. Non-essential retail, hairdressers – Boris’s Dennis the Menace barnet is in urgent need of a rethink – and holiday lets on 12 April. Indoor hospitality and some larger events on 17 May. A return to normal: 21 June. There would be no escape for those hoping to avoid the disco night at the Lib Dem party conference. Only here it got rather more confusing, because it turned out that the dates weren’t set in stone. Rather they were merely the earliest days on which the loosening of these restrictions would be considered. If the virus didn’t continue to respond to the results of the ongoing vaccine protection figures, or a new variant put a spanner in the works, then everything was back up for grabs. The dates, it turned out, were merely best-guess scenarios and Boris wasn’t committing himself to anything that resembled an exact marker of success or failure for coming out of lockdown. All he would say was that this time, it had to be irreversible. He hoped. Somehow the use of “hope” and “irreversibility” in the same sentence didn’t inspire much confidence that the government totally believed in its own roadmap. But it would have to do. Besides, it was a lot more coherent than some had feared and Keir Starmer was happy enough to give Johnson the credit for having finally come up with something sensible at the third attempt. This was not the time or place to go on the offensive, and having checked that Chris Whitty was now happy for all schools to go back on 8 March – by some accounts the chief medical officer had not been so keen at the tail end of last week – the Labour leader restricted himself to asking whether the government would improve its financial support for those forced to self-isolate. Boris seemed almost disappointed to find he had – for the most part – the total support of the opposition and morphed into a mop-haired Don Quixote tilting pointlessly at windmills. For such a significant statement, it all felt a bit of an anticlimax. Partly because almost all of the contents had been pre-briefed so there was no element of surprise, but mostly because everything did sound fairly reasonable. Whether the government stuck to its plans was another matter, but for now it looked as if it had finally got something just about right. It had only taken a year and many thousands of deaths but it had got there in the end. Even its vaccination programme was the envy of many countries. Long before the end, many Tory MPs were touting their constituencies as ideal locations for a summer holiday and not even Mark Harper, the leader of the hawkish Covid Recovery Group, seemed in the mood to pick a fight with Boris over what he saw as an unnecessary delay in loosening restrictions. Indeed, yet again, Johnson sounded quite measured in his observations that there was no such thing as a Covid-free UK and that there would always be a substantial body of risk when not everyone had been vaccinated. It was a similar prime minister who took the Downing Street press conference later that evening. Though that was less surprising given that he was flanked by Whitty and Vallance, his two super-egos. Scientists who bring out in Boris an urge not just to speak the truth but also to recognise it. Who have curbed his instincts to buccaneer with people’s lives. If only for the time being. Better late than never, we saw a Boris who could pass as sane. Someone who could cope with the certainty of uncertainty. Someone who appeared able to learn from his previous gung-ho approach. Who would have thought that possible? • This article was amended on 23 February 2021. The 120,000 figure is in relation to the UK’s death toll, not death rate as stated in an earlier version."
2021-02-22T20:44:14Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson says more deaths inevitable whenever lockdown lifts as he sets out roadmap for England – as it happened,"Boris Johnson has described the roadmap he has published for the lifting of lockdown measures in England as â€œa one-way road to freedomâ€�. He made the comment at a No 10 press conference, after he spent more than two hours in the Commons setting out his plans to MPs. In the chamber Johnson rejected a call from lockdown-sceptic Tory MPs for all restrictions to be lifted at the end of April, once all adults have had their first dose of vaccine (see 4.47pm), and in his press conference he insisted that he was being cautious. In response to a question from the political editor of the Daily Mail, who suggested he had become a risk-averse â€œgloomsterâ€�, Johnson said: The crocus of hope is poking through the frost and spring is on its way both literally and metaphorically. But I wonâ€™t be buccaneering, as you put it, with peopleâ€™s lives, and nor will anybody in government. I think when people look at this road map I think actually itâ€™s about as dynamic as itâ€™s possible to be under the circumstances and with disease and infection where we are. If youâ€™d said to me a few months ago that by June 21 we were going to be in a position where we thought it was really credible to open up everything including nightclubs, I would have struggled to believe you, quite frankly. But thatâ€™s the miracle of the vaccination programme that has delivered that. Johnson claimed that his lockdown plan would be driven by data, not dates, and that the plan for restrictions to be lifted in four stages, tied to four specific dates, with a five-week gap between them, was provisional. But, as Newsnightâ€™s Lewis Goodall points out, the tests being used by the government to determine when further easing can take place (see 12.49pm), are vague.
Here is the 60-page document (pdf) setting out the plan. And here is a summary by my colleague Peter Walker.
Prof Chris Whitty, the governmentâ€™s chief medical adviser, has hinted that he would back vaccines being made compulsory for health workers. Speaking at the press conference, he stressed that this was a political matter that was not up to him. But he said: It is a professional responsibility for doctors to do things which will protect their patients. And I expect that to be a professional responsibility for all other health and social care staff as well. He also said there were precedents for rules of this kind. For example, surgeons were expected to have the hepatitis B vaccine, he said. Johnson has said â€œthere may well be a roleâ€� for domestic â€œCovid passportsâ€�. For weeks the government has been saying it does not favour using vaccination certificates to control peopleâ€™s access to jobs or venues or services in the UK. But Johnson has now ordered a review into this. Explaining the change of approach at the press conference, he said: There are clearly some quite complex issues, some ethical issues, issues about discrimination and so on, to what extent can governments either compel or indeed forbid use of such certification. I think all that needs to be gone into so we are going to have a review of the whole issue before we come to it ... There may well be a role for certification but we just need to get it right. Some of the youngest pupils are back in classrooms in Wales and Scotland, but ministers in the two nations have insisted that they will phase the return for other year groups rather than follow the English model of reopening schools to all pupils at the same time. Real-world evidence from the Covid vaccination programmes in England and Scotland show that one dose of vaccine gives high protection against severe disease and admission to hospital â€“ and protects against even mild disease with no symptoms in younger people. Plans for all children in England to be back at school on March 8 are â€œmadnessâ€� and risk prolonging the â€œdamaging cycle of stop-start schoolingâ€�, head teachers and unions have warned."
2021-02-22T17:53:49Z,politics,Politics,Ex-Labour staffer goes to court to try to identify leaker of antisemitism report,"A former senior Labour staffer has taken the party to court in an attempt to force it to disclose the identity of the leaker of a report on antisemitism in the party that contained hundreds of private WhatsApp messages. The case is the latest in a line of legal troubles for the party stemming from the internal report, which concluded that factional hostility towards Jeremy Corbyn hampered the party’s efforts to tackle antisemitism. The report, leaked to the media without redaction, included details of staffers’ private conversations expressing hostility towards Corbyn or his close allies and bemoaning Labour’s better-than-expected performance at the 2017 general election. The report reignited the row within the party over its handling of disciplinary cases and led to party members’ suspension. One of those named in the report, Emilie Oldknow, who was once considered to be a serious contender to be Labour’s general secretary, demanded in a court hearing on Monday that the names of the leakers be revealed in order to give her the option of taking legal action against them. Five anonymous individuals who deny any responsibility for the leak were also represented at the hearing. Legal costs are being funded by the trade union Unite, according to their barrister, Jacob Dean. Oldknow’s barrister, William Bennett QC, said the dossier was a “politically motivated hatchet job” that was “deliberately misleading and relied on improperly obtained private correspondence”. Last April “a faction within the Labour party published the report to the media”, he said. Labour has said it is happy to disclose its internal evidence to allow the leaker to be identified, though the party has said it wants to remain neutral and has resisted attempts to submit its own opinion on the leaker’s identity. “We are entirely content to disclose to Miss Oldknow and effectively disclose the underlying factual information, enabling her to identify the persons responsible for the leak,” the party’s barrister, Anya Proops QC, said. But Proops said it was “not necessary and not justified” for the party to offer its “subjective opinion on who is legally liable”. “The concern is that that will draw us unnecessarily into a political controversy that the party is naturally very keen to avoid.” She said Labour’s position was that the leak was “unquestionably wrongful” and the report contained “considerable quantities of private personal data”. Bennett said Oldknow could not bring a claim against the leaker “until she knows who the wrongdoers are, what they did and how”. “It seems fairly obvious, or you might call it an educated guess, that these documents were leaked by people who were employed by the Labour party back in March 2020, or acting as officers of the Labour party,” he said. Dean said the five affected individuals had “cooperated fully with the various investigations into that leak … on assurances of confidentiality”. He said the “potential for injustice is manifest” if Labour was forced to “disclose a mass of evidence … from which the [party] has drawn certain conclusions in order to allow the applicant to draw her own, possibly different conclusions”. Unite said it was offering representation for the five individuals – as it would for all members. All five had denied leaking the report and participated in the inquiry in “good faith ... on the understanding the investigation would be confidential and protect their rights to privacy”. It added: “The leaked report points to numerous concerns, not least in regard to the spending of the Unite donations to Labour for the 2017 general election campaign. As yet these matters are unanswered by Labour and the Forde inquiry is indefinitely delayed.” The Forde inquiry is the independent investigation set up by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, into the report and Labour’s internal culture. Unite said it was disappointed not to be allowed to intervene in the case on behalf of the five members, saying: “Today’s application was a balance between the privacy rights of employees, for whom the employer has a responsibility, and the rights of Emilie Oldknow and others who are named in the leaked report.” The judge dismissed an application from the five individuals to intervene in the case and will announce her decision on the disclosure on Tuesday morning."
2021-02-22T16:19:30Z,politics,Politics,Demand from Tory MPs to scrap Covid rules 'could bring huge death toll',"Relaxing all restrictions by the end of April, a scenario demanded by some Tory MPs, could lead to a massive fourth wave of infections higher than the January peak and risk almost doubling the UK’s death toll, government documents have revealed. Lockdown-sceptic Tories have campaigned for the full lifting of all restrictions by the end of April. More than 60 MPs from the Covid Recovery Group (CRG) wrote to Boris Johnson calling on him to commit to a complete end to controls by 30 April. The government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) released documents on Monday including five different models for easing lockdown in England. They suggest that under even the most optimistic scenarios modelled by teams at Imperial College London and Warwick University, tens of thousands more people can be expected to die from Covid because vaccines will not provide complete protection against the disease, and not everyone will have the jabs. The five scenarios differed in the speed at which restrictions were lifted, roughly between two and five months, with baseline measures such as mask-wearing and test-and-trace in place at the end. All scenarios led to a resurgence of cases because so many vulnerable people remained unprotected, even with high vaccine coverage.
Scenario 1 would entail ending restrictions by 26 April, in line with demands of Tory MPs, with others seeing a progressively more cautious timetable. The modelling of scenario 1 says: “Unless vaccine efficacy is significantly better than assumed here, it is highly likely that hospital occupancy would be higher than that seen in January 2021, if all restrictions are lifted by the start of May.” It says that in scenario 1, even under the most optimistic modelling, there would be “another wave comparable in size to January 2021, resulting in a further 62,000 to 107,000 deaths in England”. The document warns that a fourth wave would occur even under the optimistic vaccine rollout scenario of 4m doses a week from the end of March 2021. The outlook is far brighter if restrictions are lifted with case rates low, vaccination rates high, and changes being made gradually. However, even under the most optimistic vaccine scenario and with cautious unlocking, models suggest there could be tens of thousands of additional Covid-related deaths by summer next year. In Warwick’s submission, the scientists say that “relaxing too quickly (scenario 1) will result in peak hospital occupancy considerably higher than the current wave and substantial additional deaths. This holds regardless of vaccine efficacy, rollout, adherence to baseline NPIs [non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as testing and isolating positive cases, hand-washing and mask-wearing], and impact of seasonality.” The government has said it hopes to vaccinate all priority groups – which will include all over-50s and vulnerable adults – by 15 April and all adults in the UK by 31 July.
It will hope that the data released by Sage may avert a collision with MPs when they vote on the regulations in the coming weeks. The CRG chair and deputy chair, Mark Harper and Steve Baker, said in a letter to the prime minister that restrictions should end when all the government’s top nine priority groups, including all over-50s, have been offered a vaccine. After that, they said, there would be “no justification” for any legislative restrictions to remain at all. Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said it was time for Johnson to face down attempts to undermine lockdown. “It is deeply concerning that a group of Conservative MPs is actively campaigning for a policy that the government’s own scientific advisers warn could lead to a deadly fourth wave, a 50% spike in the death toll and up to 100,000 more deaths,” she said. “If we are to ensure this is our last lockdown, he must now face down those Conservative MPs who have throughout this crisis undermined the national effort to defeat the virus.” The government’s roadmap, which anticipates gradual easing in four stages starting from 8 March until 21 June, is a bespoke model that does not directly correlate to the scenarios modelled by Sage. However, its closest scenario – scenario 3 – projects that the UK is likely to see a resurgence of the virus around September. In more pessimistic scenarios where the vaccine is not found to be as effective, then another fourth wave could occur similar to that in January. Speaking at a press briefing on Monday, the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said infections would probably increase as the country emerged from lockdown, but reopening fast would drive a much bigger wave of infections than releasing gradually and allowing scientists to gauge the impact of each step on the epidemic. “The sooner you open up everything, the higher the risk of a bigger resurgence,” Vallance said. “The slower you do it, the better.” He said: “Vaccines are predicted – as you’d expect and hope – to make a big difference.” But even with high levels of vaccine efficacy and uptake, he added, “it is important to remember that a large number of people in the population remain unprotected”. If all adults received an 80% protective vaccine, roughly half of the population would still be at risk from disease, he said. Given the uncertainties, Vallance said it was important to lift restrictions step by step, with enough time – four to five weeks – between each to monitor the impact. “You will be flying blind on this if you don’t wait,” he said. In a further paper on reopening schools, the modellers estimate that reopening primary and secondary schools will drive the R number up by 10-50%, and point out that a limited and cautious reopening, perhaps of primary schools only at first, would allow scientists to assess the impact on community infections."

2021-02-22T13:52:41Z,politics,Politics,Covid-19 lockdown easing in England: key dates and phases in the roadmap,"8 March All schools – primary and secondary – will open from 8 March, despite opposition from the main teaching unions who have called for a staggered reopening. Schools will be allowed to restart outdoor sports matches as well as other outdoor activities. Care home visits indoors will resume, including allowing residents to hold hands with visitors. Rules will on socialising in a public space will be relaxed, meaning one person can sit down with another individual from outside their household or bubble for a coffee, drink or picnic.
29 March The second part of the first phase of reopening will begin as schools break up for Easter holidays. Outdoor gatherings will be permitted for either up to six people – reinstating the rule of six – or two households. The new rule is designed to give greater flexibility for families to meet outside, where the risk of transmission is significantly lower. Outdoor sports facilities such as tennis or basketball courts and golf course will reopen. Organised adult and children’s sport, such as grassroots football, can also return. The government has said it hopes to vaccinate all adults over the age of 50 by 15 April. Second phase – late April The second phase will allow the reopening of some hospitality in limited circumstances, which could include serving outdoors only. Non-essential retail is expected to reopen in April. Universities and colleges could get the green light to reopen campuses.
Third phase – middle of May By mid-May, pubs and restaurants are likely to be allowed to open indoors, though there could still be limits on groups, and social distancing will be in place. This phase is also most likely to be the time that hairdressers and beauticians reopen, though there may be further restrictions on very close contact treatments that were also slower to resume after the first lockdown. The phase may also see families allowed to travel for short breaks around the UK, though with restrictions on household mixing. Fourth phase A further relaxation of social contact, likely to include some mixing indoors. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said he is optimistic about summer holidays being permitted in the UK, so June could see restrictions lifted on the tourism sector. Foreign holidays are likely to be highly dependent on the actions of other governments and the progress of international vaccination – as well as a desire by ministers to strictly limit the ability of new variants to enter the country."
2021-02-22T06:00:22Z,politics,Politics,Jess Phillips: 'Motherhood made me feel like I mattered. I wish that wasn't the case',"It is fitting that before Jess Phillips can sit down to talk about her new book on motherhood, she has to spend a few seconds encouraging her son to go back to his school work, with all the plain-speaking (“go back to school!”) we’ve come to expect from the Labour MP for Birmingham, Yardley. She straightens herself on her sofa, and smiles through my laptop screen. For Phillips, as for many working parents, this lockdown has been hard. She wasn’t impressed with the prime minister’s open letter of praise to parents last month. “I don’t want his patronising, thanks,” she says. “I want the government to pull their finger out and to have noticed that mothers across the country existed a year ago, and to have done something about that.” Phillips has been thinking a lot about what it means to be a mother – she has written a book, Mother, for the Pound Project, an independent Birmingham-based crowdfunded publisher. The book explores what motherhood means to her – in her personal life and in Westminster – and in society. Women who choose not to become mothers, she says, “are literally my superheroes. I put them on such a high pedestal – people who decide not to have children and then stick to it, against all the social pressures and almost everybody in your life assuming that you’re either infertile or cold and heartless. I think anyone who can buck social conditioning to that level, hats off to you.” For women who want to have children, but, for whatever reason it doesn’t happen, “that must feel like terrible emotional pain. I know what it feels like to want to get pregnant.” When she was a young woman, and diagnosed with various gynaecological conditions, she was told she might not be able to have children. “To add on to [the pain of infertility], the idea that society paints you as a body that didn’t fulfil its purpose, that’s the worst. We’ve got to move on from the idea that our worth as women is only in our wombs. I’ve met some mothers who I wouldn’t trust to do anything. I’ve met plenty of fathers like that.” The pandemic has brought the role of mothers into strikingly sharp focus: according to the TUC, more than 70% of women had their furlough requests as a result of school closures turned down in the first lockdown. This month, a report by the women and equalities committee warned that the government is at risk of “turning the clock back” on gender inequality by ignoring the impact of the pandemic on women.
“We can’t just come out of the pandemic and not target schemes and support for the people who have paid the greatest price: vulnerable children, and children full stop, but also women in the labour market.” Phillips is co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on women and work, and points out that many nurseries and childminding businesses are close to collapse, yet the government is focused only on male-dominated sectors such as the building industry. “All the talk about rebuilding the economy post-pandemic, post-Brexit, post-austerity, is always about diggers,” she says. “I mean, do something to make sure everyone gets to play with the digger. What have they done to get more women signed up to digger courses? Make sure I can control a digger,” she says, and although she’s half-joking, I have a sudden vision of Phillips in hard hat and hoop earrings, unstoppable at the wheel of some heavy machinery. It’s the same with domestic abuse, says Phillips, who is also the shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding. “It took until the third [statement during the first lockdown] for the prime minister to even mention it. And the first penny that reached the frontline was five months after the crisis started. It’s not for the want of people like me, in the beginning, being like ‘we should think about this’. When Covid-19 was still just a thing in China, we were talking about rising rates of domestic abuse that were being reported by Chinese charities.”
Her impression of the government’s attitude to policies that would improve the lives of women is that it’s “always considered an add-on, rather than a fundamental part of our society”. And then, when small steps are made, she says, “they expect a bloody round of applause. I’m sick of having to act grateful.” Phillips, who worked for Women’s Aid before becoming an MP, says she feels “actual pain” knowing there are no places in refuges for women and children trapped at home with abusers. “I’ve met women who were raped repeatedly in the early lockdown and didn’t feel that they could escape. When they tried, there wasn’t a bed.” When the domestic abuse bill was passed by MPs last summer – which, among other things, will place a duty on local authorities to provide refuge spaces – she was thrilled. “We matter as much as bins? This is amazing,” she says, laughing. “I’m not saying refuse collection is not important, but I do want people to not be beaten up and killed in their homes just as much.” Now Phillips is supporting Sammy Woodhouse, one of the survivors of the Rotherham grooming scandal, who is calling for children conceived as a result of rape, as her son was, to be recognised as victims within the law, giving them specialist support and the potential to prosecute their “father”. “We need to understand that children suffer harm from violence against women and girls. Even if that violence never touches them physically, we’ve got to start recognising the toll that takes on children and set up services to help them, because they don’t exist.” And the vital way to support children, she says, is to support their mothers. “We punish mothers for falling prey, rather than see how we can help them be the best moms that they can be and support them. We treat people terribly – we tell people that it’s their fault that they’re victims and that they’re going to have their children removed because they haven’t protected them.”
A powerful section from Phillips’s book deals with the grief of losing a mother. Her discussion of what it is to be motherless is – in her unsentimental style – breathtakingly clear and raw. “It would be hard, in the case of my mother, to have hyperbole about how close we were,” she says. “There wouldn’t have been a day where I hadn’t been on the phone for at least an hour, I don’t even know what we used to talk about.” On the surface, Phillips says her politics are much more like her dad’s – an outspoken, lifelong socialist. “I’m not quiet – I get that from my dad – but my mom would quietly get on with trying to change something and doing the detailed, often tedious work.” Her mother, Jean Trainor, was the daughter of a dinner lady, and a clever child who would eventually become an executive in the NHS, while also raising four kids and several unofficial foster children. Before Phillips was born, Trainor took legal action against a drugs company after her mother’s angina medication was linked to the loss of her eyesight. “I just can’t imagine a woman at the age of 26, with two kids and another one on the way, taking on a global legal action to ban the use of a drug, from a terraced house in the Black Country,” says Phillips. She learned from Trainor that was “it was never a big deal to try to change something. She always thought: ‘Well, there’s probably something that we can do’. That’s not scary then, is it?” Phillips was 28 when her mother died, and it was, she says, the reason she became an MP – her grief was dulled by distraction. “I had, like, three jobs and was a councillor, and started to do a master’s. And I had two kids. In hindsight, I can see that I had to occupy my time.” There was an element of wanting to make her mum proud, to do the sort of things Trainor would have done, to gain the platform that she might not have felt was open to her. “I don’t know,” she adds, “it’s never rational. Emotions aren’t, are they? But if my mom hadn’t died, I don’t think I’d be in the position I am now. I suppose you’re always trying to prove yourself to someone, and they’re not there, so you’ll never achieve the moment of ‘you did it, well done’.” She says she tries not to think about what her mother has missed too much. “When I was selected to be the candidate, she’d only been dead about 18 months, and I remember thinking: ‘I’m not asking much of the celestial beings, I just want a phone call, I just want to tell her.’” There’s a catch in her voice, but she instantly becomes the pragmatist. “I don’t try to paste any idea of what she would think, because some things she wouldn’t agree with. But don’t worry,” she says with a smile, “my dad is always there for those helpful hints about what I’m doing wrong.” Phillips is more sad that “my nephews never got to meet her, I hate that”. Her brother beat heroin addiction, “and she never got to see that. That I find painful.” Coming from a large family, Phillips always wanted children. She became pregnant at 22, soon after getting together with Tom, her husband (they have two sons). “My mom smashed the idea that it wasn’t the right time. She just said: ‘Well, there won’t be one.’” Motherhood, she says, “made me feel like I mattered. That’s awful, and I wish that wasn’t the case, because women who don’t have children matter and all those caveats, but I didn’t feel like that. It gave me a sense of purpose that I didn’t have before.” But, partly inspired by her mother’s example, Phillips never thought motherhood was everything – it was “a nonsense” that she wouldn’t also have a career.
When Phillips entered parliament in 2015, her sons were at primary school and they adapted to the routine of Phillips spending half the week in London. It is much harder, she points out, for women with babies or younger children. Her friend and fellow Labour MP Stella Creasy, who is pregnant with her second child, is threatening to sue the government for discrimination after it announced plans to give cabinet ministers six months’ paid maternity leave – but would not extend the plans to backbench MPs. Phillips smiles broadly when I bring it up. “When Stella told me, I thought, maybe I’ll get pregnant just to join in with the class action.” She laughs. “I thought: ‘I wonder if a 12-year-old vasectomy could be reversed?’” Phillips supports the bill – which was passed to allow the attorney general, Suella Braverman, to keep her job while on maternity leave – “because it is better than what we have at the moment, but it’s not good enough”. About 54,000 women a year are forced out of their jobs through pregnancy discrimination, and campaign organisations say the pandemic means the true figure will be higher. “If you can rush it through because of a cabinet minister, why can’t you rush it through because of the people the cabinet ministers are meant to serve?” she says.
Phillips’s children are aware of some of the abuse and threats their mother gets on social media – and the increased security at home after her friend and fellow MP Jo Cox was killed in 2016. “They’re friends with Jo’s kids, so it’s a reality to them,” she says. After Cox was killed, Phillips’s elder son said he didn’t want her to do the job any more. That must have been awful to hear? “It is, but you just have to try to be honest with them and explain it in a way that they can understand.” She says she isn’t going to be frightened out of doing her job and – she points out – the job has given her children immense advantages. “The idea of moving to London and getting a job is nothing to them any more. Most of the kids round here don’t feel like they could do that. My parents were not unprivileged, but the level of privilege that my children receive, would you swap it?” By now, it’s lunchtime and Phillips’s son comes in to say he’s hungry (“I’ll make you some lunch in a minute”). Her phone is also going off with work calls. How many working parents – and mothers in particular – are dealing with this exact scenario? Stretched in all directions, juggling and, in Phillips’s case, if not for all of us facing similar pressures, looking as if she’s absolutely on top of everything.

2021-02-21T22:31:48Z,politics,Politics,What must Boris Johnson consider before easing Covid lockdown?,"Boris Johnson will set out his roadmap for easing restrictions in England on Monday, including the reopening of schools, care homes, retail and, eventually, hospitality. Here are some of the key questions he must resolve. How many cases a day is ‘acceptable’? One criteria for moving through the four phases of reopening is that “infection rates do not risk a surge in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the NHS”? But what is that number? The British Medical Association has said it is only safe to significantly ease restrictions when infections dip below 1,000 a day, a figure far lower than the current seven-day average of 11,500. The chair of the health select committee, Jeremy Hunt, has also urged a focus on case rates.
In recent days Boris Johnson has appeared onboard with this strategy, talking about case rates needing to be “really very low”. But some Tory MPs believe this is shifting the goalposts and there will be pressure for Johnson to spell out an acceptable level of risk. What measures are needed to contain new variants – and will Tory MPs agree? Variants are said to be the biggest concern of both the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty. The infectiousness of the Kent variant has meant a higher number of people need to be vaccinated before herd immunity is reached. They also play into Johnson’s criteria for reopening – defined as whether “our assessment of the risks is not fundamentally changed by new variants of concern”. Tough border measures are intended to contain the import of variants – so will we see Johnson add countries to the “red list” requiring hotel quarantine as part of the roadmap? New variants also emerge when case rates are high, which is another argument for keeping restrictions tight for now. But Tory MPs such as Mark Harper have said it is unfair to keep the country locked down because of fears of as-yet-unknown variants.
How will the data on schools reopening be reviewed? One area where Johnson appears to have significantly departed from the epidemiological consensus is his plan to bring all schoolchildren back to class from 8 March, rather than a staggered return. Will the prime minister announce that all reopenings are provisional on monitoring the effect children returning to school has on the R number? The second part of the early reopening allowing extra social contact is timed to start with school holidays on 29 March – but what is the science behind that? How long will the public be told to work from home where they can? Johnson is not expected to launch any push back to the office, unlike what was seen over the summer. Ultimately, many firms have told workers not to return until September at the earliest, and others not until next year. Will the prime minister steer any course – or leave this entirely up to discretion? How long will social distancing and mask-wearing be enforced for? It is now generally accepted that mass testing, mask-wearing and social distancing are likely to be in place until at least the end of the year. These measures will affect hospitality businesses and the numbers that can be served in restaurants and pubs. Johnson will need to give some indication about when he expects those places can return to full capacity. When can people stay over at their relatives’ homes? Johnson has previously said indoor mixing is one of the riskiest situations and families are likely to be permitted to meet outside much sooner. But the question of overnight stays is likely to be crucial to families who live in different areas of the country – for example, grandparents who may not have seen their grandchildren in months. With much of the older generation now vaccinated, it will be an area where Johnson will be under pressure to give an aspirational date for reunions. When can people go on holiday? The prime minister may lay out a timetable for breaks within the UK for families in self-catering accommodation, which could be relatively soon, though there is concern at how the virus could spread to holiday hotspots. Restrictions are likely to be lifted to allow holidays within the UK over the summer – though Johnson may be reluctant to commit to how many households can mix during those breaks. Foreign travel looks very uncertain, even with talk of “vaccine corridors” with countries willing to take vaccinated Britons, such as Greece."
2021-02-21T22:30:13Z,politics,Politics,Labour urges Rishi Sunak to extend Covid self-isolation payments,"The chancellor must expand support for people self-isolating or risk a fourth national lockdown, Labour has said, as new analysis from the party suggests the lockdown is costing the economy £1.6bn a week. In one of her major pre-budget interventions, the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, urged Rishi Sunak to radically extend eligibility for the £500 support payment to anyone without access to workplace sick pay. At the moment only about one in eight workers are automatically able to access the payment. About 70% of people who apply for financial support are rejected, according to data from half of England’s councils. “Anyone who needs support to self-isolate should be able to access it, no matter where they live or when they develop symptoms,” Dodds said. “That is the only way we can keep the virus under control when restrictions are lifted, avoid the devastating economic damage of another lockdown and help the vaccine programme succeed. However, under the current system just three in 10 people who should be self-isolating are doing so.”
The head of the national test-and-trace system, Dido Harding, admitted earlier this month that at least 20,000 people a day are believed not to be self-isolating when they are told to, raising concerns about the system’s effectiveness. Giving evidence to a Commons committee, Harding said about 20% of people who were in touch with contact tracers did not self-quarantine in their house. Labour will argue that low-income parents of self-isolating children should also receive the payment and that rules covering asylum seekers who have no recourse to public funds should be suspended to improve isolation rates. Dodds also said the government should urgently commit to reforming statutory sick pay as another barrier to self-isolation, saying the payment of £95.85 a week was inadequate. The government is to set out a roadmap on Monday that will spell out how restrictions will be eased as the vaccination programme progresses. Dodds said the government needed to take the opportunity to improve on the holes in the system that had paved the way for multiple resurgences of the virus and a cycle of lockdowns.
“The government’s roadmap to recovery must improve the system of self-isolation in this country,” she said. “That means expanding the test and trace support payment to those who don’t have a workplace sick pay scheme, better enforcement, and action to fix the broken system of statutory sick pay. This will help prevent another lockdown, protect public health and secure our economy.” Labour has called for better awareness of the payment to aid enforcement, saying anyone who tests positive should be made aware of the payment when they receive their test result. A poll commissioned by the Royal Society for Arts, Manufactures and Commerce found huge public support for extending support payments, including from Tory voters. Handing people full pay while self-isolatingwas backed by 76% of voters overall, including 74% of Tory voters and 81% of Labour backers.
The chancellor’sbudget on 3 March is widely expected to be another rescue package for the economy, with schemes such as furlough now likely to continue until the autumn. The TUC has said the distribution of the support payment has been patchy and highly dependent on local councils’ discretion. Councils in England are responsible for processing applications for the scheme, but Labour said a “postcode lottery” had developed, and councils that had used more of the government pot were either rationing the payments or having to spend more of their own money. Labour said its calculation for the cost of lockdown was based on data from the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, which predicts that GDP in the first quarter of 2021 will be 11.6% down on the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of lockdown restrictions, which they assume will “persist for the most part of the first quarter”. This implies that GDP in Q1 2021 would be £21bn less than Q4 2019 levels, or £1.6bn a week, as a result of the national lockdown."
2021-02-21T19:10:57Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson declares he is 'fervently Sinophile' as UK woos China,"The UK is seeking to strengthen its economic and trade links with China after Boris Johnson stated he was “fervently Sinophile” and determined to improve ties “whatever the occasional political difficulties”. The prime minister’s remarks at a Downing Street roundtable with Chinese businesses are likely to infuriate backbenchers in his Conservative party who want the government to take a tougher approach to Beijing’s human rights abuses. Johnson also signalled that he wanted a resumption of formal trade discussions between the two countries by reactivating two forums – the Economic and Financial Dialogue, an annual discussion between the two countries, and the China-UK Joint Trade and Economic Commission (Jetco). Both had been suspended in response to China’s repression of civil rights in the former UK colony of Hong Kong The Downing Street roundtable took place on 12 February to mark lunar new year and was attended by some of the businesses most active in China such as the Swire Group and Tenacity, a Hong Kong-based real estate and investment group. Johnson’s enthusiasm for rebuilding trading links with China comes as human rights campaigners demand a new approach and after the US criticised the EU for pressing ahead in December with an investment deal with China. The UK suspended most formal economic dialogues with China last year in protest at Beijing’s imposition of new repressive laws in Hong Kong. Downing Street would not comment in detail on Johnson’s reported remarks but said his views on China were well known. It added that no date had yet been set for a resumption of either Jetco or the Economic and Financial Dialogue. The Lords and Commons will also be voting on the long running issue of whether UK courts should be given a role in advising parliament whether a genocide is under way in a country, such as the alleged genocide of Uighur Muslims in China’s Xinjiang province. A cross-party alliance of peers have inserted the measure giving UK courts a role into the trade bill twice, each time by a huge majority, but the amendment has then been rejected twice by MPs by narrow majorities. On Tuesday, peers have to decide whether to press the issue a third time. In rejecting the genocide amendment, minsters have repeatedly told the Commons there is no imminent prospect of the UK signing any new trade or economic agreements with China, and if there were any evidence of serious human rights abuses ministers would themselves baulk at signing any such agreements, without the need for the high court to make preliminary determinations on the existence of genocide. Johnson’s roundtable remarks suggest he is willing to sign new investment and market access deals with China. Luke de Pulford, who is one of the organisers of the genocide amendment, said: “While the Uighurs are forcibly sterilised, their children brainwashed and tens of thousands enslaved, the UK is bending over backwards to secure more Chinese trade. How bad do things have to get before Boris Johnson realises that this kind of thing enables Xi Jinping’s brutal regime?” Office for National Statistics figures show the UK imported more goods from China (£11bn) than from any other trading partner in the second quarter of 2020. This was the first quarter that China accounted for the largest proportion of UK imports of goods. The proportion of UK imports received from China increased from 8.6% in the first quarter of 2020 to 13.4% in the second quarter of 2020. There is tension across the government as to where the balance should lie with policy towards China post-Brexit, between seeking to replace European markets and presenting itself as a force for good in the world that stands up for human rights. Some argue the UK can challenge Beijing without tipping into the kind of trade and diplomatic war that has erupted between China and Australia."
2021-02-21T16:12:11Z,politics,Politics,Johnson pressured over plans to reopen schools in England on 8 March,"Pressure is mounting on the government to prove it is safe for children to return to the classroom before it reopens schools, as one of the UK government’s scientific advisers warned that the plan could lead to a resurgence of coronavirus. In a last-minute plea before Boris Johnson announces on Monday details of plans to reopen schools in England on 8 March, unions, experts and some opposition MPs, have demanded the publication of scientific evidence informing the government’s decision. They said such a move could only be justified if data showed it would not lead to the R number increasing above the danger threshold of one.
The call came as Prof John Edmunds confirmed nervousness about the schools reopening plan among some members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), of which he is one. He said the move, which is expected to be confirmed by Johnson on Monday, risked pushing the reproduction rate for the virus above one.
Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show, Edmunds said: “I think if we open schools now, the reproduction number is likely to go to something close to one, potentially slightly above.” Nine teachers’ and headteachers’ unions have branded the plans “reckless” and urged the government to commit to that date only if the scientific evidence is clear that it is safe.
Now an independent thinktank, the Education Policy Institute (EPI), and the Liberal Democrats have called for the data to be published alongside any reopening plan. In a statement, the EPI said: “Independent health advice should support the reopening plan. And this should be consistent with keeping the R rate below one.” Natalie Perera, the chief executive of the EPI, said: “We hope that the government will be able to announce this week a plan for the safe return to school for all children on, and after 8 March, but this must meet key tests of safety, and practicality. “It is crucial that the government publishes the scientific advice on reopening schools in order to secure public confidence in its plans.” Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem education spokesperson, tweeted: “Fully reopening schools in one go just to see them close in a few weeks would be reckless. We need to see robust science behind any ‘open in one go’ plan, or a roadmap so once schools are fully open, they can stay open.” Dr Mary Bousted, a joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “A ‘big bang’ reopening of schools on 8 March runs a series of unnecessary risks. It raises the prospect of returning the R rate to above one – at which point the virus spreads exponentially. “This in turn could threaten the only government Covid success story – the vaccine rollout – because of the potential for new variants, against which vaccines appear to be less effective, to spread quickly through schools, and into the community.
“Surely Boris Johnson has had enough of English exceptionalism. What is so different about Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, who are taking a cautious, phased approach to school opening which enables their governments to assess the impact on the R rate and to make necessary adjustments to their plans?” But the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said he wanted all pupils in England back in school by 8 March. He told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday that more coronavirus testing and “Nightingale classrooms” could address some of the issues. Starmer said: “Ideally, I would like to see all schools back open on March 8th and all children back into schools on March 8th. “I have been worried through the pandemic – a number of people have – about the impact that being out of school has on, particularly, vulnerable children, and the attainment gap is getting bigger.” He said the government would have to follow the data and the scientific advice on the issue, “but that’s what we should be working towards”. The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the unions knew best about what was safe for schools, but he denied a rift with Starmer. Asked about Starmer’s comments, McDonnell said: “All the teachers’ union including those who represent the headteachers are all saying the same thing. So I think listen to the unions. I don’t think that’s different from what Keir is saying. “Keir is saying when it’s safe, and if we have to have a staggered reopening of the schools, let’s listen to those on the frontline.”
Edmunds suggested he also favoured a phased reopening. Asked if it would be better to open primary schools before secondary schools, Edmunds said: “Sticking to the epidemiology, it is always safer to take smaller steps and evaluate.” And he suggested that children should be vaccinated alongside adults. “I think there’s an argument for turning to children as fast as we can,” he said. Edmunds, who has two children in secondary school, added: “There will continue to be major disruption in schools until we have vaccinated our children.” Education sources have told the Guardian that the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, was “very unhappy” with the idea of all 10 million children and staff returning to schools in England on 8 March, although the government denied this was the case and insisted Whitty was not opposed to any of the options being discussed."
2021-02-21T16:08:28Z,politics,Politics,Shaun Bailey under fire for 'unacceptable' remarks on teenage mothers,"The Conservative candidate for London mayor, Shaun Bailey, has been criticised for newly emerged comments in which he suggested teenage mothers pushed people who “do the right thing” down the housing ladder. Bailey has previously been condemned for comments about teenage pregnancies, suggesting that distributing condoms encouraged girls to get pregnant. Labour said the newly unearthed comments, made to the Sun in 2010, were “completely unacceptable” and “reek of misogyny”. Bailey, who is trailing Labour’s Sadiq Khan in the polls ahead of the May elections, told the Sun that teenage pregnancy was disadvantaging other housing claimants. The article no longer appears online but has been archived. “Teenage girls might not get pregnant just to get a flat, but they are a lot less careful because they know they will be looked after on benefits. So people who are trying to do the right thing get pushed down the housing ladder, but nobody in our PC world will talk about it,” he told the newspaper when he was the Tory general election candidate for Hammersmith in west London. The shadow minister for mental health, Rosena Allin-Khan, said: “Shaun Bailey’s views about women reek of misogyny and are completely unacceptable in 21st-century London. He simply has the wrong values for London. “Not only does he peddle Trump-like fake news and attack Londoners’ values on diversity, but he has a history of repeatedly promoting his deeply misogynistic views.” A Bailey campaign spokesperson said: “It might be good politics to misrepresent comments made over a decade ago, but it won’t help Londoners secure safer streets, more affordable homes or a better transport network. If Sadiq Khan and Labour choose to run a campaign based on personal attacks rather than their record in London, people will draw their own conclusions as to why that is.” The Conservative candidate has made a series of controversial comments during the campaign, including suggesting that homeless Londoners could save up a £5,000 deposit for a mortgage. Labour has also called for the Crown Prosecution Service to investigate Bailey’s publication of leaflets headed with fake City Hall insignia, calling it a “fraudulent device” to gain undue influence, as described by the 1983 Representation of the People Act. He also made remarks in a 2008 Guardian interview in which he expressed concern that terminations were being used flippantly by underage girls and said the limit should be reduced to 22 weeks. “Our children are using abortion as contraceptive – this is the real problem,” Bailey said in the interview, given when he was running as the Conservative candidate for Hammersmith. He has been dogged by news stories detailing previous comments about teen pregnancy, single mothers and welfare, including from 2005, when he said “a culture of dependency rules the working-class” and “this liberal agenda hasn’t benefited the working class. The working class look to rules. The rules are important to them. Take away the rules and they are left in limbo.”"
2021-02-21T15:02:17Z,politics,Politics,Virtual Lords could be here to stay after Covid – but will MPs follow?,"When the House of Lords began holding virtual proceedings during the first lockdown last spring, there was a spate of videos popular on social media showing peers struggling with mute buttons or interrupted by computerised voices. But, 10 months on, it could be the upper house that has the last laugh. While the Commons and the Lords now hold so-called hybrid sittings, where members can participate in the chamber or by video link, it is the Lords – with an average age of 70 – that has seemingly embraced the modern era more thoroughly. MPs – average age nearer 50 – have to attend Westminster to vote, or trust a whip or fellow MP with a proxy. But since last June peers have been able to vote electronically. The system, known as PeerHub, has worked with barely a hiccup, recording more than 46,000 votes to date. Perhaps more significantly, while Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, appears set on a near full return to business as usual once the coronavirus crisis abates, the upper house seems more likely to maintain some of the innovations brought about by the pandemic. John McFall, the former Labour MP who is senior deputy speaker in the Lords and chairs its procedure committee, says the chamber has a commitment to inclusive participation, and the option to speak remotely assists this. When asked if video participation could continue once more normal life has returned, he told the Guardian: “As an officer in the House of Lords, I’m always careful in saying ‘this is going to happen’. But given that we have said equity is the guiding principle in this, if people can’t come then it’s a legitimate question to look at when we review the hybrid house sittings.” The Commons also has yet to decide what format it will take after social distancing measures are eased, but Rees-Mogg has heavily hinted that he would like a full return to physical sessions, calling the hybrid version “a second-rate way of conducting business”. This would not be popular among all MPs, with some set to push for a model that would have physical participation as the norm but allow for video speeches by people unable to attend, for example owing to illness, caring responsibilities or bad weather. “We’ve demonstrated that it’s technically possible and perfectly effective,” says Caroline Lucas, the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion. “It’s not as good as being there, but it’s better than having no standing there at all. So definitely we should learn from that.” Alison Thewliss, the SNP MP for Glasgow Central, also wants continued provision for some remote participation. With primary-age children, she says she has been “pretty much living in a corner of my living room” and has found virtual participation hugely efficient – despite the occasional mishap. During one Treasury select committee session last summer, her children were playing in the street outside. “The second I started asking my question, my daughter thought it would be a good idea to start shouting ‘Mummy!’ through the window,” she recalls. “This was the precise second – not the other two hours of the meeting.” Not all agree with remote participation. Richard Holden, the Conservative MP for North West Durham, and part of the 2019 intake of Tories, says video participation leads to “a series of short, set-piece speeches rather than a real debate”. “My instinct is to say, let’s have everybody back in parliament, speaking in parliament,” Holden says. “That’s where we’re all sent. The default should be a return to normal, and if there are any changes, there have to be very strong arguments for them.”
While there are also dissenters in the Lords, the enthusiasm with which peers have taken on remote participation is shown by the fact that, on a few occasions, the chamber has only just maintained its quorum of three members physically present. “Sometimes, if one of the government people wants to go to the loo, they have to bring in someone else,” says Jenny Jones, a Green peer. Jones is one of the members who also likes to attend in person – “I find I can’t get my full fury across on broadband” – but she is full of praise for the Lords technical staff who have guided “IT-resistant” peers like herself into mastering the virtual system when needed. “The House of Lords has taken to it thoroughly. In part that’s because the authorities saw a lot of the peers as vulnerable, and so they had to act,” she says. “And so, having barely moved for several hundred years, all of a sudden we have done a lot fast.” Virtual parliament mishaps In one early mix-up, the Labour life peer Lord Liddle sat in blank bemusement as his name was repeatedly called and he was urged to unmute. He missed his moment to speak as the time allocated for the debate in which he was trying to speak ran out. In another early session there was more than a minute of near silence as the Tory peer and junior minister Lord Gardiner failed to appear to answer a question. Gardiner later said he had been on the phone to the Lords IT department. The first virtual session in the Lords involved a technical mishap that was nothing to do with the peers’ efforts, as several times an electronic voice from the Microsoft Teams system interrupted speeches to read out some peers’ phone numbers. Not a mishap, but perhaps an oddity: one early star of the virtual Lords was Labour’s Lady Hayter who, unable to have the House of Lords added as a digital backdrop, instead printed a giant photo of the chamber and propped it up behind her."
2021-02-21T13:29:27Z,politics,Politics,Matt Hancock's ex-neighbour under investigation by UK's medicine agency,"The former publican and neighbour of Matt Hancock who secured lucrative work producing millions of vials for NHS Covid tests is under investigation by the UK’s medicine agency, the Guardian can reveal. Alex Bourne, who used to run the Cock Inn near the health secretary’s old constituency home in Thurlow, won about £30m of work producing the test tubes despite having no prior experience in the medical devices industry. Prior to the pandemic, his company, Hinpack, made plastic cups and takeaway boxes for the catering industry. Now it supplies tens of millions of vials from its production site on an industrial potato farm complex in Cambridgeshire.
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) confirmed it has launched an investigation into Bourne’s company. “We take all reports of non-compliance very seriously,” said Graeme Tunbridge, director of devices at the MHRA. “We are currently investigating allegations about Hinpack and will take appropriate action as necessary. Patient safety is our top priority.” The Guardian understands the MHRA investigation was launched after officers from the local South Cambridgeshire council passed on some concerns reported to them about hygiene and safety standards around the end of January. Through his lawyers, Bourne said he was unaware of any MHRA investigation and had not been contacted by the regulator.
Bourne made headlines last year after the Guardian revealed that he had offered his services to respond to the pandemic via a personal WhatsApp message sent to Hancock, whom he had known for several years. Bourne and his wife previously ran the village pub in Thurlow, a few hundred yards from Hancock’s former constituency home. The Conservative cabinet minister was a supporter of the pub, attending its reopening after refurbishment in 2016 and nominating it for an award in 2017. Contacted back in November, Bourne’s lawyers initially denied that their client had any discussions with Hancock in relation to Covid-19 supplies. Bourne later backtracked, telling the Guardian he had in fact exchanged text and email messages with Hancock over several months. However, he categorically denied that he profited from his personal contact with Hancock and the DHSC said “there is no evidence” to support claims he received preferential treatment.
Bourne’s company supplies test tubes via a large distributor of medical products that has contracts with the DHSC. His lawyers said previously that while he had no experience in the highly-regulated medical supplies industry, he involved a partner company that did have relevant experience and hired qualified experts. They said that the medical devices that Hinpack manufactures are “by no means complicated and are well within our client’s existing skillset”. However, the MHRA investigation and information provided to the Guardian by well-placed sources raise questions about whether he is upholding appropriate regulatory standards. Bourne created his medical-grade processing facilities, installing inflatable “clean rooms”, in a building on an industrial farm owned by his father-in-law Robert Smith, one of the leading potato suppliers to supermarkets. According to allegations from sources, there was a period of months early in the operation when Hinpack production workers had no permanent toilets or access to running water for hand washing. Workers were also accused of failing to follow strict hygiene protocols when entering the inflatable rooms, according to the sources, and failing to change in and out of protective clothing properly when taking breaks. For a period, workers were using outdoor portable toilets without hand-washing facilities, the sources added. Bourne’s lawyers said all of these allegations were “untrue” and suggested they may have been made maliciously. They insisted that coveralls are always appropriately discarded, and running water and toilet facilities were available to staff, who were made fully aware of strict hygiene protocols.
The lawyers added that the MHRA had previously approved and inspected Hinpack’s products and working practices. Another complaint relates to the burning of waste. A source with direct knowledge of Hinpack’s operations said that waste was repeatedly burned by the company last autumn. In October, during an unconnected visit to another part of the farm site, the Environment Agency (EA) recorded evidence of burning of waste by Hinpack. It issued guidance to Bourne but said it would not take further action unless it happened again. In November, residents reported further burning of waste at the site. The EA said the this report did not contain enough details to identify the company responsible. However, Bourne’s father-in-law later wrote to residents to address the issue of “burning of rubbish”. In the letter, he explained that his son-in-law had originally searched for other production sites and “literally begged me to move into our buildings as no alternative could be found … Alex has assured me no burning of rubbish will take place on the site in the future.” Bourne’s lawyers said the report about burning commercial waste in November was untrue and suggested it was the result of a malicious complaint.
Meanwhile, a local Thriplow councillor, Conservative Richard Williams, has asked South Cambridgeshire council to investigate whether breaches of planning regulations have been committed at the site. There is a dispute over whether new consent is required for certain buildings and structures on the site, but Bourne’s lawyers concede that a car park used by Hinpack shift workers requires planning permission. They added they were in the process of applying for it. Asked about Bourne’s work producing vials at a Downing Street press conference in December, Hancock replied: “I had absolutely nothing to do with that contract.” But questions remain about the relationship between the two men. Locals have described Bourne and Hancock as “friends” and “buddies”. The DHSC said it would not comment on “the secretary of state’s personal relationships” and Bourne has played down his relationship with Hancock. Earlier this month an image went viral after it appeared to show that Hancock has a photo of Bourne’s old pub on the wall behind him in a room at his home from which he sometimes gives live TV interviews.
It has also emerged that a member of the landlord family of Hancock’s former constituency home, the Vesteys, had recently bought a house from Bourne in London. Hancock claimed rent for his use of the Vestey family’s Thurlow house – a few hundred yards from the Cock Inn – in his MP’s expenses for the years during which he rented it. Robin Vestey bought the £1.2m London house from Bourne and his wife’s family last November. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing. Lawyers for Bourne said the Vestey purchase of the London house arose simply because Vestey lived nearby and liked it. They said Vestey was not involved in Bourne’s Covid-related projects. Vestey did not respond to a request for comment. The DHSC said the government had issued a “call to arms” last spring to secure home-produced supplies for Covid-19 testing as global demand soared. A spokesperson said: “Information on product requirements was shared with all suitable or potential suppliers. All suppliers have to pass through a rigorous regulatory and validations process to ensure that they meet the same high quality standards. We continue to ensure all contracts are awarded in line with procurement regulations and transparency guidelines.”"
2021-02-21T09:37:35Z,politics,Politics,Sussex medicines firm takes production line abroad in white van to beat Brexit ban,"A Sussex pharmaceutical company has told how it had to bundle a production line into a white van and take it to Amsterdam to beat a Brexit medicines ban. The impromptu four-wheeled mission to the Netherlands has secured the supply of the asthma drug Ventolin for France, where the company, Mediwin, had a huge order book. Lisa Cooke, its finance director, said the company had been preparing for Brexit since the referendum but had not counted on an overnight block on wholesale distribution from the UK into EU member states. “It was a bit of a white-knuckle ride a couple of weeks ago. We had stockpiled supplies, particularly of Ventolin because it was being sold in huge quantities in France and we were getting anxious that we would run out,” she said. “So our production manager hired a van and took five machines – which was essentially one production line – to the Netherlands. He got the line up and running. We’ve rented an apartment and got six people working over there now. And so far we’ve hired 15 people in the Netherlands and they want another 10 or 11.” Under the EU single market freedoms known as “parallel distribution”, Mediwin was allowed to buy drugs for a range of conditions, including type 2 diabetes, glaucoma and atrial fibrillation, from one member state and repackage them for another member state at lower prices. In a blow to the British company, production lines in Littlehampton are now at near standstill while assembly ramps up in the Netherlands. Further expansion will take place in Spain and other EU countries. “To put things into context we usually receive around 75 pallets of stock a week – in January we have received two,” Cooke said.
She said while she hoped over time to replace the EU sales with UK custom, it had been heartbreaking to have to slash production and work hours for staff in the UK. “I’ve got about 70 people at the moment who I’ve had to ask to half their hours,” she said. “It has been horrible, absolutely horrible.” The drastic measures are a reflection of the lack of preparation time pharma firms were given for the new Brexit rules. Other companies have also been hit by sudden trade barriers. Two weeks ago it emerged that a Welsh pharma company producing a cancer drug with a short shelf life had moved its production to Dublin to keep supplies going for patients across the EU. Ian Price, the director of the Confederation of British Industry in Wales, said the company, which did not want to be named, had to discard 200 to 300 consignments destined for the EU because of the new Brexit trade barriers. Cooke said Mediwin was being forced to lay off 45 people in the UK. “We were going to invest in a site in the UK a couple of years ago we we needed to expand. That £2m investment has gone to Spain. We’ve got a fabulous new production facility which will come online in Barcelona, in two or three months time,” she said. “Once we had the Brexit vote, we knew that we were in significant danger for a number of reasons, so our growth plans for the UK stopped almost immediately. We started investing in Barcelona. We have had to merge our main UK trading company with a Spanish group company to protect licences.” The company had built up a booming trade in wholesale medicine supply, going from 19 employees 10 years ago, to a workforce of 150 in 2020."
2021-02-20T21:00:42Z,politics,Politics,Labour MPs dismayed at orders to maintain ‘radio silence’ on Brexit,"Labour MPs are being asked by the party’s high command not to focus on problems caused by Brexit when asking questions in parliament, dealing with the media, or posting on social media, according to sources in the parliamentary party. After a week in which Labour leader Keir Starmer delivered a major speech on how the country should rebuild the economy and reduce inequality without once mentioning Brexit, relations with the EU or the severe problems that have confronted many UK exporters since 1 January, senior party figures reacted with astonishment. On Saturday night former cabinet member and Europe minister Peter Hain said Brexit had become the “elephant in the room” for Labour. Hain told the Observer: “It’s quite understandable that Brexit has not been top of Labour’s agenda, but it’s not sustainable to ignore this elephant in the room hurting British businesses, our vital performing arts sector, our security and our foreign policy reach. The Tories delivered a last-minute mess of a Brexit with damaging consequences, not least to stability on the island of Ireland.” One senior backbencher said the message from the top was very clear – that there should be virtual “radio silence” on the issue. “The order that is coming out is: ‘Don’t mention the war.’ We are being told that Keir wants to move on and that if we mention the B-word let alone suggest we a need better deal with the EU than Boris Johnson’s we are being unhelpful.” Several sources said that MP Carolyn Harris, Starmer’s parliamentary aide with responsibility for coordinating with Labour members – including on what questions they ask at prime minister’s questions – had been discouraging interventions on Brexit, saying they would damage the leader. With difficulties for UK exporters continuing and problems over the Irish protocol unresolved, one member of Starmer’s frontbench team said that attempts to “brush the problems under the carpet just because we wrongly voted for Johnson’s deal in December is pretty close to negligence”. He added that Starmer was “terrified” of offending voters in red wall seats in the Midlands and north where pro-Brexit voters deserted Labour at the 2019 election. Since 1 January Starmer has not raised Brexit or problems caused by it once at PMQs, and interventions on the issue from backbenchers have been rare. None of the shadow cabinet or frontbench team have made a speech in parliament on the issues affecting UK businesses.
But pressure is now building on Starmer and his shadow cabinet to lay out a vision of how he would try to improve access to the EU single market – the UK’s biggest export market – after it emerged that thousands of UK firms that export to the bloc are struggling with extra costs and bureaucracy, driving many to invest in warehouses and subsidiaries on the continent, while scaling down and laying off staff in the UK. At a special meeting of the parliamentary party before Starmer’s speech, Neil Coyle, the MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark, said Labour should make a “land grab” to become the party of business, given how damaging Brexit had been to trade. He called for an extension of a theme in Starmer’s speech about a new partnership with business to cover the immediate concerns of every industry “from fishing to finance” as a result of the severe limitations of the government’s trade deal with the EU. Former transport secretary Andrew Adonis said it was incredible that Starmer had chosen not to mention Brexit in his speech. “Keir’s speech on the economic challenges ahead didn’t once mention the words Brexit, trade or Europe. This is unsustainable. It’s like discussing the weather without mentioning the wind and the rain.”
Referring to Starmer plan for a recovery bond he added: “The best ‘British recovery bond’ would be to rejoin the European customs union and single market as soon as possible. “Slashing our trade and raising prices at this moment is disastrous. The crisis Britain faces isn’t in its capacity to borrow – which has has never been cheaper – but rather mass unemployment and an economic slump. “Brexit is a major cause of both. Labour won’t be credible until it promises to fundamentally renegotiate Johnson’s damaging trade reduction treaty.” The Green party’s Caroline Lucas, whose party has shown some signs of pushing up in the polls in recent weeks, said: “It beggars belief that in his much-trailed ‘reset’ speech on business and the economy, the leader of the opposition – himself once the most pro-European member of the shadow cabinet – couldn’t even bring himself to mention the B-word once. “Such radical amnesia may be deemed politically convenient by Starmer, but it represents a shocking abdication of responsibility from the official opposition.” A Labour source said: “Since January we have consistently and repeatedly highlighted the red tape from Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal that is holding British business back. “Only last month, Labour called for more customs agents to help businesses cope with more red tape.”"
2021-02-20T16:43:24Z,politics,Politics,UK government under growing pressure over Covid procurement,"The UK government faces growing calls to release details of a VIP fast lane for emergency procurement contracts related to its pandemic response after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, was found to have acted unlawfully. A high court judge ruled on Friday that the failure to publish multibillion-pound Covid-19 government contracts within the 30-day period required by law breached the â€œvital public functionâ€� of transparency over how â€œvast quantitiesâ€� of taxpayersâ€™ money was spent.
Last year, ministers and officials refused to admit which companies were awarded multimillion-pound Covid-19 contracts after being processed in a high-priority channel for firms with political connections. A report by the National Audit Office said a government unit, set up to procure PPE in a highly unusual departure from standard procurement practice, established the high-priority lane to deal with leads â€œfrom government officials, ministersâ€™ offices, MPs and members of the House of Lords, senior NHS staff and other health professionalsâ€�. Almost 500 companies given high priority due to such connections secured contracts to supply PPE with 10 times the success rate of nearly 15,000 companies that were not given enhanced attention. Labour stepped up its criticism of the government on Saturday, led by deputy leader Angela Rayner who said the government must â€œcome cleanâ€� over Â£2bn in funds awarded to â€œdonors and croniesâ€�, adding: â€œThis is public money, the public has a right to know.â€� The shadow chancellor to the Duchy of Lancaster, Rachel Reeves, tweeted: â€œHow much further does this have to go before this government cleans up its contracting? Publish outstanding contracts and details of the VIP fast lane now.â€� The shadow health minister, Rosena Allin-Khan, tweeted: â€œTory donors were given VIP PPE contracts. The price government paid for PPE increased 1,400%. Many orders were unusable or inadequate, but refunds were not given.â€�
The Good Law Project (GLP) has called on the government â€œto publish the names of all the companies who went through the VIP lane, together with who introduced them and, where they were successful, the prices they were paidâ€�. It has also urged the government to publish PPE contracts â€œwith pricing details visible to enable proper scrutinyâ€� and recover funds from companies who failed to meet their obligations. Research by the procurement consultancy Tussell had found Hancockâ€™s Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) had spent about Â£15bn buying PPE from different companies by the beginning of October, but that only Â£2.68bn worth of contracts had been published. Government regulations require all contracts with a value of more than Â£10,000 to be published and to be sent for publication within 30 days of being awarded. The Liberal Democratâ€™s foreign affairs spokesperson, Layla Moran, who supported the GLP in the case, said the ruling should mark the end of the secrecy over the governmentâ€™s Covid spending. â€œWithout our judicial review, who knows how many contracts would still remain unpublished,â€� she said. â€œIndeed, government only began to rectify the situation after we initiated legal proceedings.â€� The DHSC was contacted for comment. On Friday, it said contracts were awarded â€œat speedâ€� to secure PPE during the pandemic, and that 8bn items were delivered to frontline workers for their protection. â€œWe fully recognise the importance of transparency in the award of public contracts and continue to publish information about contracts awarded as soon as possible,â€� the department said. During the court case, the DHSCâ€™s head of procurement explained the challenges of procuring PPE rapidly during the pandemic and ensuring that contracts were published. The department denied it had any intention not to publish them. Hancock has not acknowledged the ruling publicly, but tweeted a photo on Saturday morning thanking NHS workers for their service during the pandemic.
A DHSC spokesperson said: â€œWe have been working tirelessly to deliver what is needed to protect our health and social care staff throughout this pandemic, within very short timescales and against a background of unparalleled global demand. â€œThis has often meant having to award contracts at speed to secure the vital supplies required to protect NHS workers and the public. â€œAs the 2020 NAO report recognised, all of the NHS providers audited were always able to get what they needed in time thanks to the effort of government, NHS, armed forces, civil servants and industry who delivered over 8bn items of PPE to the frontline at record speed.â€�"
2021-02-20T06:00:24Z,politics,Politics,Fears of English local elections chaos due to lack of staff and venues,"Staff shortages and a lack of available polling stations risk bringing chaos to May’s local elections in England, officials have warned, with concerns that some counts could take so long they contravene the law. The dearth of staff is so acute that some councils are appealing for pandemic volunteers, who have delivered food parcels or helped at vaccination centres, to assist at polling stations on 6 May. The Cabinet Office has confirmed it will push ahead with two sets of council elections – including one postponed from last May – as well as ballots for the London mayor and assembly, for a series of other mayors, and for police and crime commissioners (PCCs). Scotland and Wales are holding elections on the same day for their parliaments, and for PCCs in Wales, which are organised separately. An already complex set of votes has been made even more logistically fraught by the need for Covid-secure polling stations and limits on the numbers of people allowed at counts. Laura Lock, the deputy chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators (AEA), said matters had been made more difficult by a government request earlier this month that schools not be closed for use as polling stations if possible, and by the requisitioning of many other venues as testing or vaccination centres. Finding polling stations had become “really difficult”, Lock said. “Each week, people are telling us: ‘I’ve lost another station because of testing or vaccines.’ It’s just been constant. We’ve been raising this with the Cabinet Office, saying we need both arms of government to be pulling in the same direction.” Members were also reporting big shortages of staff, Lock said, a problem compounded by the fact that many election workers and volunteers tended to be older and that even with the rapid vaccination programme, people were wary. “My mum often works at polling stations, she’s had her first jab now, and will have had the second by the election,” Lock said. “But for, basically, the minimum wage, having spent 12 months avoiding everyone, do I want her to risk it? I’m not sure.” Some councils, she said, were asking pandemic volunteers to help with election jobs that do not require training, such as managing queues. There was a particular expectation that counts could be a lot slower, Lock said. By law, council elections need to be declared within four days of the vote, and there was a risk some returning officers – often council chief executives – could be held responsible if this does not happen. Going beyond four days could be a breach of official duty, Lock said, but noted that the law stipulates returning officers have to make every reasonable effort to reach the deadline, which could allow for exceptional circumstances. One source said council chief executives were aware of the issue and were likely to prioritise counts of council votes, as those for mayors and PCCs have a seven-day limit for completion. But it could mean some results coming a number of days after polls close. The Cabinet Office is understood to be in contact with the AEA, particularly over the shortage of polling station venues. After the Department for Education and Cabinet Office wrote to election officials and headteachers this month asking that schools not be used for polling stations if possible, to avoid further disrupting pupils’ education, the AEA said that in some cases this was too late, as polling cards – which give the location of the local polling station – had already been sent for printing. Cat Smith MP, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, said ministers had been “too slow to act, leaving everything until the last minute and forcing council workers to pick up the pieces”. She added: “For months, Labour has been calling on the government to adapt and introduce safer voting methods, including voting over multiple days and all-postal voting. With less than three months until the election, ministers must answer serious concerns about the shortages of electoral staff, lack of venues, and finally publish a detailed plan about how these elections can run safely.” A Cabinet Office spokesperson said the government had allocated extra resources for councils to cope with venue and staffing difficulties, and that while the hope was that schools would not be used for polling stations, there was a recognition that in some places there was no alternative."
2021-02-19T19:12:54Z,politics,Politics,Oliver Lewis quits as head of No 10's union unit after two weeks,"The clearout of former Vote Leave staffers in Boris Johnson’s inner circle has continued with the departure of Oliver Lewis, a key aide who was appointed to head the No 10 unit devoted to keeping the union together just over a fortnight ago. Lewis, who was head of research at the Vote Leave campaign under Dominic Cummings, acted as the de facto deputy to David Frost when he negotiated the UK’s Brexit deal. Friends said Lewis had decided to resign, as he felt his position inside Downing Street had become untenable – with one suggesting he had been accused of leaking to the press. “He was loyal to Boris for more than five years: he’s done an awful lot for the administration,” said one senior Tory. No 10 has been beset by bitter internal power struggles in recent months, most dramatically the departure in November of Cummings, Johnson’s chief aide, shortly after the resignation of another Vote Leave alumnus, the then head of communications, Lee Cain. Those departures were spurred after Cain’s promotion to chief of staff was blocked by Johnson’s fiancee, Carrie Symonds. The loss of Lewis is also likely to be seen as connected to the continued tussles for influence inside No 10. It is nonetheless a surprise, with Lewis’s position appearing cemented earlier this month when he was put in charge of the union unit, the section inside No 10 devoted to policies aimed at maintaining the union. The appointments of Allegra Stratton as Johnson’s press secretary and former civil servant Dan Rosenfield as his chief of staff were meant to mark a professionalisation of the No 10 operation, in place of Cummings’s idiosyncratic management style. But there are continued reports of tensions inside Downing Street. Lewis replaced the former Scottish Conservative MP Luke Graham shortly after Johnson made a visit to Scotland to push his pro-union message. It is unclear who will take on the critical role, with Scottish independence deemed a growing threat inside government as the Holyrood elections loom. The Scottish National party’s Westminster deputy leader, Kirsten Oswald, said: “Boris Johnson’s taxpayer-funded anti-independence campaign is completely falling apart. As support for independence grows, the Tories are losing advisers like rats on a sinking ship.” Lewis’s departure followed the unexpected promotion of Frost to a seat around the cabinet table earlier this week. Frost’s new role, in which he will also chair the partnership council overseeing the implementation of the EU trade agreement he negotiated, came after several allies of Michael Gove were given plum jobs in No 10, which reportedly irked the Tory peer. Frost had previously been earmarked by Johnson as national security adviser – an appointment openly criticised by former prime minister Theresa May because of his lack of foreign policy expertise. He was then shifted to a role as international policy adviser, focused on Brexit – but friends say he threatened to resign earlier this week, amid concerns about reporting lines in No 10. Gove’s allies have insisted he was not put out by the pugnacious Frost’s elevation, which appeared to sideline Gove from involvement in implementing Brexit, including the Northern Ireland protocol – previously a central part of his role. “David is a proven negotiatior and will sort out all outstanding issues with the protocol,” said a source close to Gove. However, Frost is regarded by his EU counterparts as a hardliner, whose elevation is unlikely to smooth fraught relations over the protocol."

2021-02-19T15:01:14Z,politics,Politics,Matt Hancock acted unlawfully by failing to publish Covid contracts,"The health secretary, Matt Hancock, acted unlawfully by failing to publish multibillion-pound Covid-19 government contracts within the 30-day period required by law, a high court judge has ruled. The judge, Mr Justice Chamberlain, ruled the failure to do so breached the “vital public function” of transparency over how “vast quantities” of taxpayers’ money was spent. The judgment is a victory for the Good Law Project (GLP), a crowdfunded not-for-profit organisation that is making a series of legal challenges related to the government’s procurement of protective personal equipment (PPE) and other services during the pandemic.
Research by the procurement consultancy Tussell had found Hancock’s Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) had spent about £15bn buying PPE from different companies by the beginning of October, but that only £2.68bn worth of contracts had been published. Government regulations require all contracts with a value of more than £10,000 to be published, and to be sent for publication within 30 days of being awarded. The GLP highlighted three PPE contracts to illustrate their case: a £252m contract for the supply of face masks with a finance company, Ayanda Capital; a £108m contract with Clandeboye Agencies, which had previously supplied only confectionery products, and PPE contracts worth £345m with a company trading as Pestfix. None of the contracts was published within the required 30-day period. Tussell found that the average time for publication of Covid-19 related contracts was 47 days, which meant the government’s own 30-day deadline was likely to have been breached “in a substantial number of cases”, Chamberlain said. Hancock and the DHSC had fully opposed and defended the challenge, including by arguing that the GLP had no legal standing to bring a case. The DHSC’s head of procurement had explained the challenges of procuring PPE rapidly during the pandemic and ensuring that contracts were published, and the department denied it had any intention not to publish them. Chamberlain ruled: “The secretary of state’s evidence provides a cogent explanation of his historic failure to comply … but this explanation amounts to an excuse, not a justification. It follows that, in my judgment, the secretary of state acted unlawfully by failing to comply with the transparency policy.” The obligation to publish contracts within 30 days “serve a vital public function and that function was no less important during a pandemic”, he said. “The secretary of state spent vast quantities of public money on pandemic-related procurements during 2020. The public were entitled to see who this money was going to, what it was being spent on and how the relevant contracts were awarded.” Jolyon Maugham QC, the GLP’s director, welcomed the judgment and said it was significant for the organisation’s other legal challenges, which include one related to the Cabinet Office’s contract with the research company Public First, which was heard on Monday. The government argues in those cases too that the GLP has no legal standing. The GLP has written to Hancock asking him to publish all outstanding contracts, and the names of companies whose offers to supply PPE were processed through the “VIP lane”, a high-priority route given to referrals by MPs, peers and others with political connections. The government has refused repeated requests to publish the list of companies. Maugham said: “I’d rather that there was no need for organisations like ours to have to sue government to get it to come clean. The public is plainly entitled to know how and with whom and at what prices government spends public money. “Anything else is a recipe for corruption. But until government understands and respects that there is a genuine public interest in how they are awarding Covid contracts, including through the VIP lane, we have little choice.” A DHSC spokesperson said contracts were awarded “at speed” to secure PPE during the pandemic, and that 8bn items were delivered to frontline workers for their protection. “We fully recognise the importance of transparency in the award of public contracts and continue to publish information about contracts awarded as soon as possible.” The GLP’s judicial review challenge was supported by the Labour MP Debbie Abrahams, Caroline Lucas of the Green party and the Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, who all welcomed the judgment."
2021-02-19T13:28:29Z,politics,Politics,'Data not dates': expert views on how to lift England's Covid lockdown,"Boris Johnson is due to chart a course out of England’s third national lockdown on Monday, which is expected to begin with schools reopening from 8 March. Details of the plan are likely to be finalised on Sunday. What do experts think the prime minister should do? Prof Gabriel Scally, president of epidemiology and public health section, Royal Society of Medicine “The prime minister should outline his goal of getting the infection rate down to a minimal level and keeping it there – restoring normal functioning to much of society and the economy. “To do that, the lockdown should be tightened for six weeks, but it should also be the last. All international arrivals [not just from the government’s ‘red list’] to undergo managed isolation for 14 days. “The failed and costly test-and-trace system should be replaced by a complete find, test, trace, isolate and support system, adequately resourced, run by the NHS and led locally by the directors of public health. “A system of green zones should be used in England, whereby areas with near elimination of Covid are protected by buffer zones across which travel is restricted for non-residents. Local authorities with the highest residual levels of the virus should be given extra resources and powers. “Agreement should be reached to enable travel restriction across the Scottish-English border so that Scotland can reach their goal of zero Covid as soon as possible. “Finally, the prime minister and Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, should agree to pool vaccine supplies as it is in the best interests of both islands to inoculate their populations quickly.” Prof Karl Friston, computational modeller and neuroscientist at University College London “I would announce three things. Firstly, with the numbers looking good, serious consideration should be given to unlocking sooner rather than later. “When one models mitigated responses to the virus – as opposed to the worst-case scenario of unmitigated responses – we may be coming out more quickly than some of the rhetoric implied. But that is crucially conditioned upon careful and mitigated unlocking that is sensitive to the local infection prevalence. “Second, we should allow local authorities control over removing measures, with central government issuing overall direction in terms of criteria. Criteria for local unlocking – first schools, then retail and so on – are going to have to be sensitive to local infection levels. “I would not announce that ‘by 1 April we will do this and by 8 May we will do that’. It would be more: ‘These are the criteria we would need to see before we take the next step in a gradual process towards normality.’ The current phrase is ‘data not dates’. That is absolutely right. “Third, base those criteria on a simple principle: contain viral spread. In short, you can apply a critical threshold of incidence in your local area that would trigger an increase or a decrease in restrictions.” Prof Rowland Kao, epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh and member of SPI-M, which advises the government “In terms of metrics [for when to relax restrictions], it’s cases in the population and hospitalisations. One of the reasons why vaccination of the elderly is not the criterion for lifting restrictions is that most of the burden in hospitals is due to longer-term care of under-65s with Covid. “Cases are important because they mean that, at the very least, should we get things a bit wrong and R goes up too much due to relaxation, then a course correction becomes even harder and there remains the possibility of the course of the epidemic running away from us. It also means it becomes more likely that any variants with higher transmissibility will remain unnoticed for a longer period of time. “Dates [for lifting curbs] are important from the point of view of planning. However, [they] have to be tied to metrics which, if they are not reached, would mean that relaxation could not occur. “Schools are already the obvious [first step]. Any meeting outdoors in small numbers will also be relatively low-risk and provide people with opportunities to make social contact. Initially keeping travel distances short will help to keep any outbreaks more localised, though there is always the chance that it will still jump due to some essential travel. The very last things should be large gatherings in enclosed places.” Dr Zubaida Haque, former head of the Runnymede Trust “Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities have been caught in the perfect storm of disadvantaging factors. We knew they would be overexposed because of the types of frontline, lower-paid and less secure jobs they are over-represented in. “So the government should focus on financial support to self-isolate. Making people on low incomes choose between putting food on the table and self-isolation is putting them in an impossible position. “Providing accommodation for people to self-isolate would also help BAME communities. You can understand why the virus spread quickly in overcrowded and multigenerational housing. “I don’t understand why making schools safe has not been the biggest issue because it means safer communities. If schools were to open, the lack of space needs to be addressed. The government has done nothing about requisitioning or renting buildings so children can spread out. Teachers should get priority access to vaccines before they are told to return.” Dr Kit Yates, senior lecturer in mathematical sciences at Bath University “This lockdown must be our last. Allowing the infection to spread through the younger, unvaccinated population still risks overwhelming healthcare services. Even before the vaccinations began, about three-quarters of people in intensive care were under 70. Hospital occupancy has only recently returned to levels lower than the first-wave peak. This is not to mention the potential impact of long Covid which is thought to affect 5-10% of those infected. “I am as keen as anyone to see schools open. They have been first to open and last to close, so it’s surprising that so little has been done to reduce the potential for transmission within them. Mask-wearing in classrooms, better ventilation and smaller bubbles could make a real difference, as could a rota system with half attending one week and half the next. Schools should be the test case that allows us to evaluate when and how to further ease restrictions. “In the longer term, ensuring vaccines are rolled out to the entire population is important to reduce severe cases. Widespread testing, alongside a locally driven test, trace and isolate system and sufficient support for people to self-isolate, could quickly suppress outbreaks. Accredited Covid-safe environments will help to reduce potential transmission, while stricter border controls will limit the possible introduction of variants that may evade the vaccines.” Prof Susan Michie, professor of health psychology at University College London and member of SPI-B “We need to retain restrictions long enough to get infections down to a safe level for reopening. Then we need to keep them low to prevent future national lockdowns. “That requires root-and-branch reform of test, trace and isolate by bringing it into public health, primary care and the NHS. Self-isolation needs to be supported financially and practically. In other countries, people are paid a decent percentage of their wages to isolate and are visited every day and offered help with getting provisions, as well as psychological support. “Another key plank is effective border controls to replace the current leaky system. People are entering the UK from countries where there may be new Covid variants, or they may have travelled indirectly from countries with known variants. “We need a comprehensive strategy of aiming towards zero Covid, with quantified milestones, so we can be clear about what needs to happen.” Prof Graham Medley, professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and member of SPI-M “As vaccination is rolled out, keeping R (and therefore prevalence) low depends on the measures to reduce the amount of contact between people. There is lots of uncertainty in both the vaccine and the impact of relaxation of measures. “It is impossible to predict exactly what is going to happen, so it is impossible to predict the best time to change measures. Whilst it makes it much harder for people and businesses to cope if dates are not given, having a prescribed timetable is a hostage to fortune.”"
2021-02-18T22:54:32Z,politics,Politics,Holyrood agrees to publish evidence from Alex Salmond,"Holyrood’s governing body has agreed to publish evidence from Alex Salmond in which he repeatedly accuses Nicola Sturgeon of breaking the ministerial code, after a committee investigating the Scottish government’s handling of harassment allegations against the former first minister twice voted against publication. The decision clears the way for Salmond to give evidence in person and under oath before the Holyrood inquiry. He had refused to attend last week after the committee of MSPs reached crisis point, splitting 5-4 and largely along party lines over publication of the evidence. Following a second split vote on Wednesday, the committee agreed to refer the matter to the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) for a final decision, while it repeated its invitation to Salmond to appear next week. A redacted version of the submission has been published elsewhere in the media. Salmond insists it is an essential part of his case alleging that Sturgeon lied to parliament. The current first minister has consistently denied her predecessor’s allegations and is scheduled to appear before the inquiry in the first week of March. The inquiry is considering the Scottish government’s botched handling of sexual harassment allegations against Salmond made by civil servants in 2018. A judicial review of the process, brought by Salmond and costing the taxpayer substantially more than £500,000, found the investigation to be unlawful and “tainted with apparent bias” in January 2019. In a letter to the inquiry committee on Thursday, Holyrood’s presiding officer, Ken Macintosh, wrote: “Following two meetings of the SPCB today, at which a range of opinions were aired, the SPCB collectively agreed that on balance it is possible to publish the submission by Alex Salmond on the ministerial code.” A spokesperson for the inquiry committee said the submission would now be processed in line with evidence-handling rules – which may mean segments are redacted – and published early next week. Following the decision, the chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland, Sandy Brindley, wrote to Macintosh seeking “urgent reassurances” that parliament intends to uphold the contempt of court order which protects the anonymity of the complainers in Salmond’s criminal trial on 14 counts of alleged sexual assault, including an attempted rape, of which he was acquitted last year. Questioning whether there was a sound legal basis for the decision, Brindley added that the treatment of the complainers from the trial had been “intolerable, particularly online”. “They have been hounded, identified online and had threats made against them. I am clear that if the parliament publishes anything which could lead to the identification of any of the complainers you will be directly responsible for putting their safety at risk.” The SNP MSP George Adam said the public would be utterly bewildered that the corporate body of the national parliament had “ignored clear legal advice” and decided to publish information “which it knows could jeopardise the court-ordered anonymity of complainants in a sexual offences case”. Opposition MSPs on the inquiry disputed this interpretation, and welcomed the move. The Scottish Conservative committee member Murdo Fraser said: “We must hear Alex Salmond’s side of the story to uncover what really happened.” Scottish Labour’s Jackie Baillie said: “From the very outset of this process I have been clear that I believe the committee has the right to consider any evidence that may be relevant to its work, and I am glad that the Scottish parliament’s corporate body has agreed. “This committee is duty bound to get to the bottom of this sorry affair that frittered away over £500,000 of public money and which let down the women involved so badly.” After a court challenge by the Spectator magazine last Thursday, the senior Scottish judge Lady Dorrian agreed to amend a court order she imposed on what could be reported about Salmond’s criminal trial. In her written reasoning, which was published on Monday, Dorrian said it was not for the court “to interfere with … or to seek to direct the committee in any way”."
2021-02-18T18:10:18Z,politics,Politics,"UK's £1,000 child citizenship fee ruled unlawful by appeal court","Home Office fees of £1,000 for children to register as British citizens are unlawful, the court of appeal has upheld in a landmark ruling. The high fees that children or their parents are expected to pay to secure British citizenship have been controversial for many years. Children who have a right to register as British citizens but may be prevented from doing so because of the high cost or lack of access to legal advice risk losing out on rights and benefits. Thursday’s ruling found that ministers had failed to assess and consider the impact of this fee on children and their rights, pointing out that for some families it was “difficult to see how the fee could be afforded at all”. The Home Office charges £1,012 for a child to register for citizenship. However, the process costs about a third of that, at £372. The Home Office says the profit is used to fund other areas of its work. In December 2019, a high court judge ruled that the fee was unlawful after finding it prevented many children from being registered for citizenship, leaving them feeling “alienated, second-best and not fully assimilated into the culture and social fabric of the UK”. The Home Office appealed against the high court’s ruling that the department had failed in its duty to assess the best interests of children and give primary consideration to these interests in setting the fee. The court of appeal rejected this appeal and the department must now reconsider the fee and ensure that children’s best interests are taken fully into account in doing so. Responding to the judgment, Carol Bohmer, the chair of the Project for the Registration of Children as British Citizens, which brought the case, said she was “delighted” the courts had again held that the “scandalously high” fee was unlawful. “We will continue in our mission so no one is in future forced to grow up in the UK suffering the alienation and isolation that is currently the experience of so many young people,” she said. Bohmer, along with the project’s founder, Solange Valdez Symonds, have been campaigning for eight years to reform citizenship fees for children. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Citizenship registration fees are charged as part of a wider fees approach designed to reduce the burden on UK taxpayers. The Home Office acknowledges the court’s ruling and will review child registration fees in due course.”"
2021-02-18T18:10:01Z,politics,Politics,"Gove relaxed about losing key Brexit brief to Lord Frost, allies suggest","Allies of Michael Gove have insisted he does not feel chastened after Boris Johnson wrested the key Brexit brief away from him and appointed his chief EU negotiator, Lord Frost, as a full-time member of the cabinet. With his duties reduced, Gove is expected to step up work strengthening the ties between the countries of the United Kingdom as head of the Cabinet Office “union unit” in the run-up to elections in May, the Guardian understands. “There will be more focus on it,” one No 10 source said. Johnson himself holds the position of minister for the union but had previously been urged to create a dedicated role to respond to growing support for Scottish independence as well as tensions in Northern Ireland. A leaked report from late 2019 by the former Scottish minister Lord Dunlop suggested the creation of a senior cabinet post on a par with those of the chancellor, foreign secretary and home secretary to oversee “the functioning of the union”, though Downing Street has not embraced the idea so far. Gove has frequently raised the need to head off a strong independence movement in Scotland and was one of those around the cabinet table to oppose a “no deal” Brexit scenario amid fears it would further fuel calls for another independence referendum. Sources say the internal market bill was also seen by Gove as a way of pulling Scotland and Northern Ireland closer to London before it got hijacked by the controversial, and now aborted, Brexit clauses. One source previously close to Gove’s own Conservative party leadership campaign, said they believed there was a tacit understanding that Gove would eventually get more responsibilities, which could be a big policy brief – such as health or home affairs, currently headed by Matt Hancock and Priti Patel – in any upcoming reshuffle.
However, such a move to a distinct policy area would also allow Johnson’s old rival to be eased away from top-level strategy decisions. On Wednesday, Lord Frost, who is said to be the person Johnson trusts most intimately in government, was handed a full ministerial brief and a seat at the cabinet table to take charge of post-Brexit Britain, including the chairmanship of the partnership council due to oversee operation of the Brexit trade deal, which was given to Gove just two days previously. Sources confirmed that Frost, who was given a peerage last year, had demanded a ministerial post – although under the Brexit deal the UK chair of the partnership council had to be ministerial level or above. Frost, a former UK ambassador and whisky lobbyist, was originally offered the post of national security adviser, an appointment that drew anger in Whitehall and from some MPs including former prime minister Theresa May because of his perceived lack of experience. The job was withdrawn from Frost and given to Sir Stephen Lovegrove in late January, with Frost given responsibilities as the prime minister’s EU relations adviser, though it will now come with full ministerial perks. One Whitehall source said the transition had been “harmonious” but suggested there had been some spin around Gove’s apparent demotion in order to counter the narrative that there had been a Gove “takeover” in No 10 after two of his most trusted aides, Lady Finn and Henry Newman, were promoted to work in Downing Street by the prime minister’s new chief of staff, Dan Rosenfeld. Another Gove ally called the suggestion of a No 10 feud “totally overblown mischief making”. They said that Gove himself had made it clear he wanted to move on from Brexit and look more closely at internal government reform. Johnson has asked Gove to chair the national recovery taskforce subcommittee which deals with public services, including the backlog in the courts, the NHS, schools and universities. “He’s had a lot of Brexit,” the source said, insisting Gove had himself suggested Frost for the partnership council role. Gove has chaired more than 200 meetings of the EU exit operations committee – known inside Whitehall as XO, which deals with issues arising from Brexit. That committee is also expected to be wound down in July when final Brexit controls are introduced on the UK side of the border in Northern Ireland."
2021-02-18T17:38:22Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer's Covid recovery bonds could be more than a gimmick,"It’s a sign of how bad things have got for Sir Keir Starmer that the Labour leader felt the need to float his idea for British recovery bonds in his speech on the economy. Opposition leaders tend to keep specific policy proposals under wraps in the early stages of a parliament because they know there is a risk they will be filched by the government if they are any good. Instead, they prefer to focus on the big picture: the current lot are making a total hash of things, there must be no return to the failed policies of the past, we must invest in the future. And most of Starmer’s speech was indeed made up of that sort of stuff, coupled with the usual harking back to the postwar Attlee government. It would be naive in the extreme to imagine that recovery bonds will change voter perceptions of Labour overnight but, if more than a gimmick to liven up a so-so speech, the idea is an interesting one. The thinking behind them is that only a fraction of the excess savings built up during the pandemic will be spent so the rest could be doing something more useful than sitting in bank accounts
Labour says the recovery bonds would have the same attractions as traditional national saving bonds – interest-bearing, safe and long term – with the difference that the proceeds would be earmarked to pay for the post-Covid recovery. George Soros recently came up with a similar proposal for the EU, with the difference that governments would issue perpetual bonds on which the capital would never be repaid. At present, savings rates on money lent to the government through National Savings and Investment (NS&I) are at nugatory levels, so if Starmer’s idea is to have any hope of working, the interest rate on the bonds would need to be much more attractive. But if they proved popular they could act as a test run for a much bigger project – financing the greening of the economy. Barclays dividend payouts signal fewer long-term Covid scars It goes without saying that Barclays has had better years. Provisions against loan defaults have rocketed and as a result profits have taken a hit. But – and it’s an important but – the bank has weathered the Covid-19 storm reasonably well. A sign of its confidence is that it has resumed dividend payouts to shareholders, albeit only at a modest level. The performance of Barclays – the first of the big UK lenders to report its results – highlights the difference between the current recession and the last one, back in the late 2000s. Then, the financial system was central to the problem: banks had too little capital to cover losses made on risky investments and when the crash came the flow of credit stopped abruptly. A financial crisis morphed into an economic crisis. This time, the banks are peripheral. Naturally enough, they can expect to suffer losses because many of the businesses that have been closed as a result of government restrictions will not reopen. Consumers have been paying off their credit card debts, which is good for the financial health of the individuals concerned but bad for bank profits. But unless there is another, far more serious, leg of the pandemic to come, the banks have enough capital to cope. That means there is unlikely to be a dangerous feedback loop whereby recession leads to a financial crisis which in turn deepens the recession. Although 2020 saw the biggest one-year contraction in the economy in more than 300 years, it may leave fewer long-term scars than the ostensibly less severe downturn of a decade earlier.

2021-02-18T15:34:23Z,politics,Politics,No 10 criticised as Frost cabinet role amplifies gender imbalance,"Boris Johnson is facing criticism over his appointment of the Brexit negotiator David Frost to a full-time ministerial job and a place at the cabinet table, which will put the proportion of female UK cabinet ministers at one of its lowest levels in recent years. Five women are full members of Johnson’s cabinet, making up just 21.7% of its 23 full members, now to include Lord Frost, appointed to lead on Britain’s relationship with the EU. One of those five, the minister without portfolio Amanda Milling, is unpaid. The attorney general, Suella Braverman, attends cabinet but is not a full member. In 2015, David Cameron appointed seven women, making up 30% of 22 cabinet posts, according to a UK government briefing paper, and the highest number of concurrent women cabinet ministers was eight (36%), from May 2006 to May 2007 under Tony Blair.
Felicia Willow, the Fawcett Society’s chief executive, said: “Women make up 50% of the population and yet we continue to see men dominate positions of power in our society. The pandemic has brought the problems of an overwhelmingly male government into sharp focus. The policy response to Covid has disproportionately impacted women at work, financially, and in the home. Women have been inadequately represented in government, in cabinet, and in Sage [the Scientific Advisory group for Emergencies].” She added: “We simply shouldn’t be going backwards on equality. The prime minister has committed to supporting a 50/50 parliament; appointing a 50/50 cabinet would show how serious he is about achieving this.” Grilled by fellow Conservatives on equality in the cabinet during a tense liaison committee hearing last year, Johnson was unable to say how many women in top jobs would be “enough” to secure proper gender representation. While his first cabinet was hailed as the most ethnically diverse, with six ministers from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, there are now just four BAME full members, making up 17.4%. The cabinet compares unfavourably on gender with the numbers of women in senior ministerial posts in the devolved nations. In Scotland, seven out of 12 cabinet secretaries are female. Of nine ministers in Wales, five are women. The Northern Ireland executive has six women among 12 executive ministers. In a January 2020 Women in Politics report by the Inter-Parliamentary Union, which ranked countries according to the percentages of women they had in ministerial positions, Spain topped the league with 66% – 10 female ministers out of 15 – with Finland in second place, according to publicly available information. It ranked the UK in 49th position, trailing countries including Rwanda, Ethiopia and South Korea. Frost will replace Michael Gove as the UK chair of the partnership council, the body set up to settle disputes resulting from the trade agreement, and will take Gove’s role chairing the withdrawal agreement joint committee. Labour’s Emily Thornberry, the shadow international trade secretary, has criticised the fact that the person charged with managing the UK’s post-Brexit trading relationships with Europe is “someone who has never been elected by anyone in this country, and won’t be accountable in the House of Commons to any of us who have”.
Frost has been described as a low-key figure, who largely shuns the camera, and a Brexit true believer. Educated at Nottingham high school, he studied French and history at Oxford where he gained a first. After joining the Foreign Office he was posted to Brussels in 1993, where he is said to have become disenchanted with the European “super-state”. He left the diplomatic service in 2013 to become the chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association. Johnson made him his political special adviser after the 2016 Brexit referendum and as prime minister promoted him to chief adviser and negotiator on Europe. He was given his peerage in September."
2021-02-18T14:33:23Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer's post-Covid plan for Britain – the key points,"Keir Starmer has used a speech to set out his vision for how Labour would seek to rebuild the UK after the coronavirus crisis, giving a handful of specific policy ideas and several more general approaches. Here are the main points. British recovery bond An official savings scheme intended to harvest the additional savings accumulated by some households during lockdown, so they can be used for post-Covid spending on infrastructure and jobs. There has been much recent commentary on how governments can best unleash what is estimated to be well over £125bn in spending suppressed amid the coronavirus pandemic. Others have come up with similar ideas. Last year the centrist New Policy Institute thinktank proposed a “coronavirus bond”, while this week Tory MPs based in the north of England suggested a savings scheme targeting their region for investment. Start-up loans for businesses This is another familiar idea, not least as it would be based on the existing Start Up Loans Company, a government-backed scheme that provides investment for new businesses. But Labour argues that so far it is both too unambitious – providing fewer than 9,500 loans per year since it started in 2012 – and biased towards London and south-east England. Starmer’s plan would pledge to fund 100,000 businesses over five years, and spread the regional basis of the investment, with Labour pointing to figures showing almost a quarter of all money so far has gone to London. Partnership with business If there was a standout line in the speech, it was perhaps less about new policies than Starmer’s argument that Labour had a tendency to see business as “something just to be tolerated or taxed”, a not-very-coded repudiation of what some voters saw as the attitude under Jeremy Corbyn. Working with businesses, Starmer said, was “pivotal to my leadership”, dismissing what he called a false choice between a vigorous economy and improved equality. But he also stressed that businesses would be expected to be central to both helping equality outcomes, and tackling the climate emergency. Tackling deep-rooted inequalities
Aside from Harold Wilson, whose “moral crusade” Starmer borrowed, the only individual referenced in the speech was Prof Michael Marmot, the epidemiologist and chronicler of the hugely varying life chances faced by people in the UK. Last year, a 10-year update of Marmot’s pioneering study into national inequalities found that a decade of austerity had seen life expectancy stalled for the first time in more than 100 years, and even reverse for the most deprived women. The Covid pandemic, Starmer argued, had “got into the cracks and crevices of our society and forced them open with tragic consequences”, worsening such inequalities. While politicians invariably point to tackling such issues as a key focus, Starmer made this central to his speech, and clearly views it as a dividing line with the Conservatives, for all Boris Johnson’s talk of “levelling up”. Public services – but also financial responsibility There were a series of familiar policy commitments based on spending and public services, including to maintain the £20-a-week uplift in universal credit introduced with Covid; money to local authorities to limit council taxes rises; ending the public sector pay freeze; and measures to help business, such as extended business rate and VAT relief, and a longer Covid furlough scheme for employees. But here, too, was a pledge aimed clearly at voters who felt Labour had appeared too profligate at the 2019 election. “Under my leadership Labour’s priority will always be financial responsibility,” Starmer said. “I know the value of people’s hard-earned money – I take that incredibly seriously.”"
2021-02-18T13:25:39Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer: Labour must work with business to create fairer society,"Keir Starmer has argued that Labour must build “a strong partnership with businesses” if it is to create a more just and equal post-Covid society, announcing plans for a public saving scheme to boost investment in the recovery. Castigating the government for wanting to maintain existing inequalities after the pandemic, the Labour leader set out what he called a “moral crusade”, borrowing Harold Wilson’s phrase to set in place a national transformation equivalent to that seen after the second world war. Starmer stressed that this involved working with the private sector, saying that for too long the party saw business as “something just to be tolerated or taxed”. “A fair society will lead to a more prosperous economy,” Starmer said in the much-trailed speech, billed as his opportunity to spell out his personal vision for the future of Labour, and of his leadership. “It’s not the choice of one or the other, as the Conservatives would have you believe. We either have both or we have neither. Harold Wilson once said that the Labour party is a moral crusade or it is nothing – he was right.” Working with business, Starmer said, was “pivotal to my leadership, and to my vision of the future”, stressing that this also involved businesses taking a central role in dealing with social responsibilities and the climate emergency.
One key idea in the speech was a saving scheme intended to help people invest in the UK’s post-Covid future, based on Bank of England forecasts showing many households have accumulated savings during lockdown, which will not necessarily be spent. Starmer proposed the idea of a “British recovery bond”, which would work like the long-standing bond schemes run by National Savings and Investments, but with the money going directly into Covid recovery schemes.
The plan is similar to the idea of a post-Covid “northern recovery bond” floated earlier this week by the Northern Research Group of Tory MPs and the Centre for Policy Studies, the thinktank co-founded by Margaret Thatcher. Starmer also pledged to create 100,000 startups in the next five years, with a focus on pushing funds to help this nationally, beyond London and the south-east of England. A significant section of the speech was devoted to an examination of inequalities, arguing that coronavirus had demonstrated “a deadly ability to find the most vulnerable and to expose deep inequalities and injustices”. These must be addressed, he argued, likening current times to the postwar period, with a “determination that our collective sacrifice must lead to a better future”. “The terrible damage caused by the virus to health and prosperity has been made all the worse because the foundations of our society have been weakened over a decade,” Starmer said, citing the work of the epidemiologist Prof Michael Marmot, which showed declining life expectancy in some poorer areas. “What sort of legacy is that, for a party that’s been in government for a decade, that life itself has got cheaper, and shorter?” Starmer said. Given this, next month’s budget amounted to “a fork in the road” for the UK, Starmer said, dismissing the idea that the government was able to address the scale of inequalities shown up by coronavirus. “If you can’t decide whether to plunge hundreds of thousands of children into poverty by cutting universal credit, you have no chance of mending our broken system,” he said. Saying he would end the public sector pay freeze, extend business rate and VAT relief, and boost the Covid furlough scheme, Starmer also stressed that under his leadership, “Labour’s priority will always be financial responsibility”. Answering questions after the speech, Starmer insisted his plans were vastly different to the self-styled “levelling up” proposals put forward by Boris Johnson. “It’s very important with this prime minister not to just listen to what he says, but to see what he does,” Starmer said, pointing to areas such as the public sector pay freeze and the possibility of the £20-a-week uplift in universal credit ending: “These are not the signs of a government that understands the future needs to be different.”"
2021-02-17T22:36:04Z,politics,Politics,Alex Salmond invited again to give evidence to Holyrood committee,"The Holyrood committee investigating the Scottish government’s handling of sexual harassment allegations against Alex Salmond has repeated its invitation to the former first minister to give evidence next week despite another narrow vote not to publish key evidence submitted by him. After a lengthy meeting late on Wednesday, the committee resolved that last week’s court ruling had “no impact” on its decision not to publish evidence that Salmond says is an essential part of his case alleging that Nicola Sturgeon broke the ministerial code. But Salmond refused to attend the inquiry last week after the committee reached crisis point, splitting 5-4 over publication. After a court challenge by the Spectator magazine, the senior Scottish judge Lady Dorrian agreed last Thursday to amend a court order she imposed on what could be reported about Salmond’s criminal trial on 14 counts of alleged sexual assault, including an attempted rape, of which he was acquitted last year. In her written reasoning, which was published on Monday, Dorrian said that it was not for the court “to interfere with … or to seek to direct the committee in any way,” and on Wednesday night the majority of MSPs resolved that “the scope of the order has not changed”. A majority also agreed to refer the matter to the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, as publisher, for a final decision. Holyrood’s own lawyers have previously advised against publication for legal reasons. Salmond’s lawyers, Levy & McRae, who were also instructed by the Spectator, wrote to the committee last Thursday to say they believed Dorrian’s amendment should clear the way for the parliament to publish the relevant evidence, thus enabling Salmond to appear in person, and earlier said that he had “cleared Wednesday from his diary”. It is understood that, although Salmond has resubmitted his evidence with certain amendments to the committee following Dorrian’s ruling, the committee was not able to consider this later document on Wednesday for administrative reasons. A Scottish parliament spokesperson said: “The committee tonight considered the detail of Lady Dorrian’s ruling and its impact on the committee’s decision not to publish Mr Salmond’s evidence on the ministerial code. The majority of the committee is clear that the judgment has no impact on its previous decision and understanding of its legal obligations and its decision on the publication of the submission from the former first minister on the ministerial code. The scope of the order has not changed. “However, the committee is keenly aware that publication is for the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body and has tonight agreed to refer this to the SPCB for a decision on its publication. “The committee is pleased to hear that Mr Salmond is willing to give evidence next Wednesday. He can, as a minimum, give evidence on all of his published submissions and records. As such, the committee plans to write to him tomorrow to invite him to attend next Wednesday.” Salmond has claimed that officials close to Sturgeon and her husband, Peter Murrell, chief executive of the SNP, were involved in a conspiracy to bolster the government and police investigations, and had pushed complainants into giving evidence. Sturgeon has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and suggested the former SNP leader is angry with her because she “didn’t collude with him to make these allegations go away”. The option remains for the committee to compel Salmond to appear in person. The committee’s timeframe for completing evidence sessions and writing its report is becoming increasingly tight, with Holyrood going into recess at the end of next month for May’s election."
2021-02-17T22:30:17Z,politics,Politics,"Covid hit UK hard because of years of Conservative rule, Keir Starmer to say","Keir Starmer will use a major speech on Thursday to claim that the coronavirus pandemic has hit the UK disproportionately hard because 10 years of Conservative rule “weakened the foundations of our society”. The Labour leader, who has faced internal criticism in recent weeks for failing to chart a clear political course, will say Rishi Sunak’s budget next month is “a fork in the road” and should be a moment to “diagnose the condition of Britain and to start the process of putting it right”. “We can go back to the same insecure and unequal economy that has been so cruelly exposed by the virus, or we can seize this moment and go forward to a future that is going to look utterly unlike the past,” Starmer will say. He will argue that the aftermath of the pandemic that has claimed more than 100,000 lives, with those in poorer communities disproportionately hit, calls for a Beveridge-style reassessment of life in the UK. “The terrible damage caused by the virus to health and prosperity has been all the worse because the foundations of our society had been weakened over a decade,” he will say. “This must now be a moment to think again about the country that we want to be. A call to arms – like the Beveridge Report was in the 1940s.” The report paved the way for the welfare state. Boris Johnson has insisted he wants to “build back better” from the pandemic, but the Labour leader will suggest the prevarication over whether to extend the £20-a-week increase in universal credit introduced a year ago showed that the Tories were only offering “a roadmap to yesterday”. By contrast, Starmer will say the pandemic has “shifted the axis on economic policy” and Labour would seek a new relationship between government, the public and business, with no return to “business as usual”. “The age in which government did little but collect and distribute revenue is over. The mistakes of the last decade have made sure of that,” he will say. “I believe people are now looking for more from their government – like they were after the second world war. They’re looking for government to help them through difficult times, to provide security and to build a better future for them and their families. They want a government that knows the value of public services, not just the price in the market.” Starmer will argue that the Conservatives undermined the country’s resilience by cutting back public services and leaving too many people vulnerable to the pandemic because of inequality, insecure jobs and overcrowded housing. Allies say he has been influenced by Prof Michael Marmot’s landmark work on health inequalities. Marmot was commissioned by the last Labour government to examine the underlying causes of the stark differences in healthy life expectancy across the UK. Reviewing the impact of his work in 2019 against the backdrop of a decade of austerity, Marmot said a more progressive tax system might be necessary to tackle health inequalities. He has recently given a presentation to the shadow cabinet, according to one Labour source. Starmer hopes his critique of the government for undermining the UK’s resilience to the pandemic will lay the groundwork for an attack on the Tories as effective as George Osborne’s claim that Gordon Brown failed to “fix the roof while the sun is shining”. Osborne and David Cameron’s success in pinning the blame for the 2008 financial crash on what they claimed was Labour mismanagement of the public finances helped shape the debate in the 2010 general election and beyond. Some of the Labour leader’s critics have argued that he has failed to land enough blows on Johnson for mismanaging the Covid crisis – or to link the government’s failings to a wider narrative. As well as seeking to address that challenge, the speech, to be delivered from Labour headquarters by video-link, is also expected to set out new policies. Another influence, Starmer’s allies say, is new CBI director-general Tony Danker’s recent speech advocating “governments and businesses working together” to tackle challenges such as decarbonising the economy. One frontbench colleague said the speech marked a shift away from focusing solely on Johnson’s incompetence, towards setting out a distinct political stance. “He wants to put an ideological stake in the ground,” the MP said. The shadow cabinet office minister, Rachel Reeves, recently promised a wave of “insourcing” to undo the large-scale use of private contracts to carry out key public services, and Starmer has reaffirmed Labour’s intention of abolishing tuition fees – but some internal critics have complained that the policies are not yet part of a coherent story."
2021-02-17T20:22:20Z,politics,Politics,Defence research agency for 'high-risk' projects on cards for UK,"Legislation to pave the way for a US-style defence research agency to back high-risk research projects is set to be announced, government sources confirmed. The idea, which was in the 2019 Conservative manifesto, was the brainchild of Boris Johnson’s former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, who has written extensively about the success of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa). Some commentators had expected it to be quietly shelved after Cummings’ departure from No 10 but ministers said they thought it would help the UK to be at the cutting edge of developing technologies. An announcement from the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, could be made as soon as this week, with £800m of funding set aside. The UK version is expected to be called the Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria). Kwarteng’s intention is for the agency to be free of some of the rules that usually govern investments made with taxpayers’ money so that it can back projects in the knowledge that they could fail, government sources said. The agency is also expected to be exempted from the Freedom of Information Act – a move that will raise concerns that it could become a secretive nexus between the government and arms industry. The Conservative manifesto said the agency would “support blue skies research and investment in UK leadership in artificial intelligence and data”. Darpa, which has existed for more than 60 years, works closely in the US with private-sector firms and has been involved in the early-stage development of many technologies originally created for defence purposes but which have had much wider use. In a 2017 blogpost, Cummings wrote: “In the 1960s and 1970s a combination of unusual people and unusually wise funding from ARPA created a community that in turn invented the internet … and the personal computer.” Cummings said he believed freeing the UK from the constraints of EU state aid rules after Brexit would allow taxpayers to back creative early-stage research. When Cummings left Downing Street last year there was speculation that he might be given the plum job of leading the powerful new agency, but government sources played that down on Wednesday. “The agency is independent of government. It will have its own chair and chief executive – that’s for the agency to decide,” a business department source said. The hope is for the new body to be up and running by 2022. During last year’s general election campaign Johnson claimed leaving the EU would make it easier for the government to back businesses."
2021-02-17T19:05:20Z,politics,Politics,Brexit negotiator David Frost to have cabinet role as EU pact enforcer,"Boris Johnson has given his Brexit negotiator David Frost a full-time ministerial job and a place at the cabinet table, where he will lead on Britain’s relationship with the European Union. Lord Frost will replace Michael Gove as the UK chair of the partnership council, the body set up to settle disputes resulting from the trade agreement, and will take Gove’s role chairing the withdrawal agreement joint committee, a body mired in difficulties over the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol. The partnership council will head the political and technical structures that will implement and enforce the Brexit agreement in detail and will play a key role in any future negotiations on issues such as the protocol and financial services, where talks are ongoing.
Frost’s appointment to chair the joint committee, which was co-chaired by Gove and the European commission vice-president, Maroš Šefčovič, cements a powerful position as the new linchpin in the EU-UK relationship. On Tuesday Šefčovič told the Irish parliament that the partnership council would be constituted shortly, followed by the establishment of 19 specialist committees which will oversee EU-UK relations on everything from energy to aviation. Some on the EU side will be concerned that Frost’s pugnacious and frank style may not be suited to delicate political landscapes such as Northern Ireland where tensions over Brexit checks remain heightened. Gove said it was a “great appointment”, adding that there is “no-one better” for the job. But the shadow international trade secretary, Emily Thornberry, criticised the fact that the person charged with managing the UK’s post-Brexit trading relationships with Europe is “someone who has never been elected by anyone in this country, and won’t be accountable in the House of Commons to any of us who have”. Gove has now been given the task of tackling the post-Covid backlog in public services, including the courts, the NHS, schools and universities, as part of his new role on a public services subcommittee on the national recovery taskforce. Sources say his work chairing more than 200 Brexit exit operation (XO) committee cabinet meetings made him the right candidate. It is understood he will still co-chair a meeting of the joint committee with Šefčovič next week and a meeting with Northern Ireland businesses on Thursday. The XO committee is expected to be wound down in July when the final Brexit controls, on animal and plant imports, are introduced on the UK side of the border. Gove is said to be passionate about internal market legislation, which before Brexit was considered a vehicle for strengthening ties with Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Frost said he was “hugely honoured to have been appointed minister to take forward our relationship with the EU after Brexit. In doing so I stand on the shoulders of giants and particularly those of Michael Gove who did an extraordinary job for this country in talks with [the] EU over the past year.” Frost, who was given a peerage last year, was previously set to become the prime minister’s national security adviser, an appointment which had caused a backlash over his lack of security experience and his role as a political appointee rather than a civil servant. His new duties were set out last month as it was announced that Sir Stephen Lovegrove, the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Defence, would take on the national security adviser role instead of Frost. On Wednesday Downing Street confirmed those duties had been elevated to a full ministerial post and said Frost would be a full member of the cabinet. His appointment will take effect from 1 March. Johnson handpicked Frost, the former chair of the Scotch Whisky Association, to lead the Brexit negotiations as soon as he was elected prime minister. He is widely credited with a take-no-prisoners attitude to the negotiations, which resulted in a deal that allowed significant UK divergence. Frost’s role will also include post-Brexit reform, Downing Street announced, saying he would look at “reform and regulation to maximise on the opportunities of Brexit”."
2021-02-17T17:54:39Z,politics,Politics,HMRC denies misleading MPs over tax avoidance by its contractors,"A group of MPs has accused HM Revenue & Customs of “misleading” a parliamentary committee, and possibly breaking the civil service code, by withholding “embarrassing” information about how it had engaged at least 15 contractors who used tax avoidance schemes while working for the tax agency. In a report on Wednesday, the all-party group of MPs and peers claimed that HMRC had put the management of its reputation “ahead of telling the truth”. HMRC rejected the claim, saying its leaders had not misled parliamentarians, and that it was possible for contractors to use such schemes without the participation or knowledge of the organisation that had hired them. The row involves the “loan charge”, a government measure originally announced in 2016 that is designed to claw back unpaid taxes from people who, HMRC says, used so-called “disguised remuneration” tax avoidance schemes. Under these often complex schemes, external contractors – ranging from IT workers to locum nurses – were paid using loans rather than salaries, thus sidestepping usual income tax and national insurance arrangements. Rows about the issue have raged for years, with claims that many individuals have been unfairly landed with “life-changing” demands for repayment, even though they often believed they had little or no choice but to enter into these schemes. HMRC’s position has long been that these arrangements “do not work” and that it has warned against the use of tax avoidance schemes for years. The all-party parliamentary loan charge group is made up of MPs and peers who have “concerns” about this issue, and its secretariat is staffed and funded by the Loan Charge Action Group campaign. The parliamentary group has now published a letter and report on HMRC’s own use of contractors using disguised remuneration schemes, including arrangements subject to the loan charge. The group said Freedom of Information requests had revealed that at least 15 contractors using disguised remuneration schemes had worked for HMRC and its wholly owned division Revenue and Customs Digital Technology Services (RCDTS) between 2016 and 2020, and that as recently as July 2020, HMRC and its subsidiary still had a contractor using one of these schemes. The report stated: “It is clear there were indeed contractors working for HMRC, as well as government departments, using loan arrangements. The fact that HMRC has tried to evade questions on this matter is disgraceful and, we believe, a clear attempt to seek to cover up this embarrassing fact.” It added: “The whole farce of the loan charge fiasco is surely demonstrated no more powerfully than by the fact that HMRC itself was using contractors engaged on what they now claim to be ‘aggressive’ and ‘defective’ tax avoidance arrangements. As well as not acting at the time to close these down, it also follows that HMRC was therefore also embroiled in such tax avoidance arrangements.” HMRC had previously been asked several times, including by the House of Lords economic affairs committee in late 2018, if it had employed contractors making use of such arrangements, and the report claims the tax collection agency had refused to directly answer this question. HMRC had instead, the report claims, “put management of their reputation and public relations ahead of telling the truth, including to the point of providing statements designed to give a misleading impression and withholding the truth when they discovered it. This is simply not acceptable for any governmental body and may … represent a breach of the civil service code”. An HMRC spokesperson said: “HMRC senior leaders did not mislead members of the House of Lords, and we have never endorsed or participated in disguised remuneration tax avoidance schemes. It is possible for contractors to use disguised remuneration without the participation or knowledge of their engager. Whenever it is or has been discovered that a contractor providing services to HMRC or RCDTS is currently using a disguised remuneration scheme, we have acted and will act promptly to terminate the relevant engagements.” The spokesperson added: “We continue to warn people about the risks of using tax avoidance schemes, and our advice remains the same – if something looks too good to be true, it almost certainly is.”"
2021-02-17T17:18:44Z,politics,Politics,Air systems in some UK quarantine hotels 'risk spreading Covid' ,"Some quarantine hotels housing people who have travelled to the UK from Covid-19 hotspots are using ventilation systems that risk causing localised outbreaks, according to a report. The ventilation expert’s survey, seen by the Guardian, found that multiple hotels near Heathrow airport have systems that provide inadequate airflow or could even spread the virus, prompting calls from Labour and the Unite trade union for urgent government action. The government’s tender document, issued to firms that were bidding for contracts to provide hotel space for quarantining travellers, said rooms should have “individual ventilation systems” or windows that open safely. According to the report, almost none of the hotels near Heathrow – including some understood to be among the 16 housing quarantined travellers – allow guests to open the window to let in fresh air. This is typical in airport accommodation owing to noise and fumes. At least one of the quarantine hotels uses a heat exchange system that extracts air from inside and uses its warmth to raise the temperature of air being sucked in from outside. While this is energy efficient, the report said such systems increase the chances of spreading an airborne virus due to the mixing of airflow. “This would be the most dangerous for the cross-contamination of Covid in the air,” the report said. The report was commissioned by a hotel group that has single-room ventilation systems but missed out on the government contract. The company and the engineer who performed the survey have declined to be named. The Guardian has verified the engineer’s credentials, while experts have backed the concerns raised in the report. Ventilation systems have been cited as a potential cause of outbreaks at quarantine hotels in Australia. Alyson Prince, an infection control specialist at a London hospital, said UK hotels using heat exchange systems without open windows could face the same issue. “If they’re quarantining people who potentially have Covid and hoping to use that kind of system, there’s a problem,” she said. “There is some mix of air so there is crossover.” She also pointed to a passage in the government’s tender document that reads: “Alternatively, the hotel will have a non-recirculating ventilation system that permits redirection of the air flow from corridors and staff areas into individual’s rooms.” She said this must be a mistake as it would not make sense to direct air flow from corridors and staff areas into rooms. Dr Trupti Patel, an infectious diseases expert, said Covid-19 particles could spread in buildings without single-room air conditioning systems. “To this end it is advised that any hotel housing individuals with Covid or suspected Covid should either have no central air conditioning or have heat recovery units with windows that can be opened to allow for natural ventilation, the optimal method to boost air exchange rates,” she said in a letter to the private healthcare provider Cavendish Health. A government spokesperson said: “Air conditioning systems must not recirculate air and for those without air conditioning, they must provide adequate natural ventilation.” Unite said it would immediately take up the issue with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and said hotel staff could strike if working conditions were deemed to be unsafe. The union’s national officer for hospitality, Dave Turnbull, said the use of hotels without high-quality ventilation would be “another huge failure for a quarantine policy that has been littered with them”.
The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said ministers must urgently reconsider the safety measures. “It’s worrying that there could be gaps in the hotel quarantine system that put staff and people staying in the hotels at risk,” he said. “This is a complex issue, but ministers have had a year to plan for this and can draw on examples of best practice from across the world. Urgent action must be taken to address these issues.” A 10-day hotel quarantine, at a cost of £1,750 borne by passengers, is mandatory for people arriving from a “red list” country. Four people who did not make themselves known on arrival at Birmingham airport were fined £10,000 on Tuesday. Travellers in quarantine hotels in England face an additional bill of up to £1,200 if they test positive for coronavirus during their stay. The Guardian put the concerns to all the relevant hotel groups. Accor, the owner of Novotel, which is housing quarantine travellers, said it did not use the kind of systems cited as a concern by experts. Holiday Inn’s owner IHG is understood to have ventilation systems that comply with government standards. • This article was amended on 27 February 2021 to clarify that Dr Patel was quoted in her capacity as an independent expert, not in her role as an NHS consultant."

2021-02-17T13:23:46Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit forces Northern Ireland buyers to cancel orders for 100,000 trees","Orders for almost 100,000 trees have been cancelled by Northern Ireland buyers because of a post-Brexit ban on the plants being moved from Britain, the Guardian can reveal. Leaders in the business say it is a major setback for tree-planting programmes in Belfast and elsewhere in the region. The Woodland Trust in Northern Ireland has just cancelled an order for 22,000 trees, which were destined for schools and communities as part of a Northern Ireland greening project. “It’s a disaster. They’re just stopping any exports from mainland UK over to Northern Ireland. We can’t get any trees over from any of the nurseries that we would usually deal with over there,” said Gregor Fulton, an estate and outreach manager at the trust. Scotland-based Alba Trees, one of the biggest suppliers in Britain, selling around 250,000 trees a year to Northern Ireland, says it has also been hit. “At a stroke, Brexit has taken away a huge chunk of our business,” said Craig Turner, the chief executive. “We turned down an order of 70,000 oaks a couple of weeks ago because we can’t ship them.” And Belfast city council, which has an ambitious tree-planting programme involving 1m plants, confirmed it had a delivery of “300 large specimen trees” from a supplier in England “delayed due to new rules around the movement of plants” from Britain. The horticulture division that Brexit has created between Britain and Northern Ireland is expected to be raised at meeting between local business leaders and the European commission vice-president, Maroš Šefčovič, on Thursday. The issue is one of many problems caused by Brexit, including a ban on the export of live shellfish to the EU. “We thought it would be teething problems that would be resolved quickly. It just seems ludicrous really,” said Fulton. “The irony is that I can now get a tree easier from Latvia than I can from Britain, which totally undermines all the work on biosecurity,” he added, referring to the risk of importing pests and diseases. The problem arises from three new rules applying to Northern Ireland, which is observing EU customs and regulatory rules on plants and animals as part of the Northern Ireland protocol. A ban on British soil being moved into Northern Ireland emerged two weeks ago, with garden centres protesting about a block on supplies from British nurseries. Fulton said he had been told washing all the soil off roots could be the solution. “That’s just not practical. We got an order in last year of 56,000 trees in one go. You can’t wash 56,000 trees’ roots. It would be too big a cost and the nurseries are just not going to do that,” he said. If bare-rooted trees were available in sufficient quantities, buyers would then face Brexit paperwork involving health certification and customs for the plants. A further barrier stems from the EU’s list of species prohibited or restricted for import from third countries, which now includes the UK. The list is designed to protect Europe from diseases and pests, but includes native trees including oaks, alder and birch, important for mixed woodlands. Mike Harvey, director at Maelor Forest Nurseries in Wales, which sells about 32m trees a year, said it too had had to stop selling to Northern Ireland, with a recent order for 1,000 oaks about to be cancelled. What enrages Harvey is not so much the ban on movement of trees to Northern Ireland, but the continued importation of trees from Ireland for forestation projects. He said Brexit gave the UK an opportunity to close the border to EU trees and give the country a fighting chance of stopping the “drift of disease from south-east Europe to the north-west”. The diseases, which some put down to climate change, include ash dieback and the Xylella disease, which could enter the UK via olive trees and can affect several species of broad-leaved tree. “It’s typical that the EU puts these restrictions in place and applies them rigorously in Northern Ireland but we leave the borders open to trees coming in from the EU including Ireland and the Netherlands,” Harvey said. “If we want to control disease and give ourselves a chance, it’s actually a good thing to stop transportation of these trees between our islands.” The obstructions have emerged just as Northern Ireland’s environment minister, Gordon Lyons, launches a campaign to remind farmers they have only weeks left to apply for funding to plant native woodlands to help deliver on a pledge to plant 18m trees by 2030. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it had “intensified work with the EU … to address the outstanding issues raised about the operation of the Northern Ireland protocol, such as those concerning the movements of plants, trees, soil and growing media”. It said the UK-EU joint committee to be held no later than 24 February would “provide the necessary political steer and approval to this work”. • This article was amended on 19 February 2021. Xylella disease could potentially enter the UK, but has not yet done so as an earlier version stated."
2021-02-17T12:01:19Z,politics,Politics,Brush with stardom: Dominic Raab's broom call sweeps internet,"Dominic Raab has defied the trend for Conservative politicians to pose in front of union flags when appearing on television via video call, instead opting for an old-fashioned world map, a framed engraving and … a broom. It was the foreign secretary’s broom that drew particular comment on Wednesday morning, as Twitter users speculated as to why it was resting up against the door of the room he was broadcasting from. It appeared, suggested one user, that Raab had positioned the broom as a wedge against the door “to keep the family out”. Another replied: “What’s the betting the family put a broom on the other side first?” Another remarked, unkindly: “TBF, that’s the cleverest thing he’s done in years.” The perhaps not-so-carefully curated background to Raab’s television appearance came after a number of his Conservative colleagues were seen to have the national flag hanging in apparently informal circumstances at home or in the office. Boris Johnson, Priti Patel, Grant Shapps, Gavin Williamson, Robert Jenrick, Matt Hancock and Nadhim Zahawi are among the senior Tories who have had flags on prominent display when broadcasting recently. Another Conservative politician hung bunting above her head before appearing on a broadcast video call. There is no suggestion that Raab intended any affront to his colleagues by not choosing to fly the flag in his house. One sensible explanation of his decision, which appeared on social media, was that the broom was there to gently keep the door closed. “My guess is that the latch is broken and the door swings open otherwise,” wrote a Twitter user going by the name of Richard. “This is his stopgap solution. I have a door like this that I’ve only recently fixed. The Guardian asked the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office if any symbolism was intended by the broom, but had not received a reply by the time of publication."
2021-02-17T00:01:04Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Raab calls for ceasefires to enable Covid vaccinations,"Dominic Raab, the UK foreign secretary, is to ask for ceasefires to be implemented in conflict zones so local populations can be vaccinated against coronavirus, arguing that the world has “a moral duty to act”. The British minister is to chair a meeting of the UN’s security council in an effort to persuade members to agree a resolution calling for locally negotiated ceasefires in areas such as Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen. “Global vaccination coverage is essential to beating coronavirus,” Raab will say at the meeting, reflecting concerns that wherever the disease is unchecked it could increase the likelihood of vaccine-resistant strains emerging. But while charities welcomed the UK’s initiative, they called on wealthy countries to consider going further. Sam Nadel, Oxfam’s head of policy and advocacy, warned that the poorest countries enduring conflict risked not getting any vaccines without “a massive increase” in global production. Nadel called on the British government to “unblock the supply problem by insisting vaccine science and knowhow is no longer treated as the private property of a handful of pharmaceutical corporations but shared with qualified manufacturers around the world”. Last week the UK government came under criticism for refusing to halt the supply of bombs and missiles to Saudi Arabia that could be used in the war in Yemen, after the incoming Biden administration declared it would suspend such arms sales. The UK estimates that about 160 million people are at risk of otherwise being excluded from vaccination programmes. “We have a moral duty to act, and a strategic necessity to come together to defeat this virus,” the minister is expected to add. Ceasefires have been negotiated in the past to allow emergency vaccinations. In Afghanistan, in 2000 and 2001, warring factions agreed to stop fighting to allow over 10 million children to be vaccinated against polio, which remained prevalent in the country. Wednesday’s meeting has been called by the UK, which holds the monthly rotating presidency of the 15-strong UN body. It will also hear complaints from other member countries that not enough has been done to share Covid-19 vaccines fairly around the world. According to research from Duke University’s Global Health Innovation Center, high income countries have ordered 4.2bn doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, while the poorest countries have secured 670m. Britain has ordered 407m doses, about four times the size of its adult population. Mexico’s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, said his country would highlight the inequality of vaccine availability across Latin America and the Caribbean. “The countries that produce [vaccines] have very high vaccination rates, and Latin America and the Caribbean much less,” Ebrard told reporters at a government news conference, adding that the situation was “not fair”. The UK said before the meeting that it wanted to support “equitable access” to the vaccines, and wants greater cooperation to help poorer countries with vaccine storage and managing the complex supply chains required to produce doses.
It also wants more countries and other donors to contribute funding to the Covax initiative, which aims to allow 92 low or middle-income countries to buy vaccines in a bloc using money provided by wealthy countries. Despite recent cuts in the overseas aid budget, the UK has given £548m to the programme. Formally, the UN discussion will review whether any progress has been made since last July, when the security council passed a resolution calling for a global ceasefire to tackle the pandemic. That was sought by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, but only passed following several months of wrangling between the US and China. Critics said so far it has had very limited discernible impact on conflicts around the world, while new ones, such as the autumn war between Azerbaijan and Armenia, have flared."
2021-02-16T18:58:47Z,politics,Politics,Home Office ignored Covid advice not to put asylum seekers in barracks ,"The Home Office ignored advice from Public Health England that housing asylum seekers in dormitories in army barracks was inappropriate in a pandemic, months before an outbreak of 120 Covid cases. In a high court hearing on Tuesday – brought by six asylum seekers who claim that conditions at the barracks are inhumane – the Home Office conceded that it was arguable that the use of Napier barracks to house the group was unlawful and in breach of human rights. Counsel for the Home Office admitted to failings and confirmed that, following the launching of several legal actions, sweeping changes to Napier barracks in Folkestone, which has been used to accommodate hundreds of asylum seekers, have been made. Judge Martin Chamberlain told the court that Public Health England advised the Home Office on 7 September last year that dormitories were not suitable accommodation during a pandemic. However, the judge said: “This advice was apparently not followed.” Following an outbreak of 120 cases at the barracks last month, the site was locked down, with residents told they couldn’t leave. At Napier accommodation is divided into blocks, with two 14-bed dormitories in each and shared shower and toilet facilities. While the home secretary, Priti Patel, has previously rejected criticisms of the barracks – describing it as “an insult to say they are not good enough for asylum seekers” as they previously housed “our brave soldiers” – the court heard that sweeping changes had been made following legal challenges, including emptying the barracks of around fourth-fifths of its occupants. Previously there were around 400 people at Napier but as of Tuesday Lisa Giovannetti QC, representing the Home Office, said there were just 63 people left in the barracks. The judge said Giovannetti accepted that a letter circulated to the residents of Napier saying they could not leave the barracks under any circumstances gave a “false impression”, as even when people are self-isolating due to Covid 19 they can leave their homes to seek medical assistance or to avoid a risk of harm. The barracks has been in use to accommodate asylum seekers since September 2020. It is a Ministry of Defence facility built in 1890. Giovannetti said the Home Office would be meeting with public health officials on Thursday to discuss “how to safely manage a Covid outbreak at Napier going forward”. She said that how the 63 people remaining would be divided up in terms of dormitories and blocks was one of the matters that would be discussed at the meeting. “None of the people in Napier should be detained,” she said. Giovannetti added: “The secretary of state accepts unequivocally that there is no power to detain other than Covid restrictions. They are free to come and go.” Emily Soothill, a solicitor at Deighton Pierce Glynn, representing some of the asylum seekers who brought today’s challenge, said: “We welcome today’s concession by the home secretary that it is arguable that the use of Napier Barracks to house asylum-seekers is unlawful and in breach of human rights. “Our clients were subjected to demeaning conditions in Napier Barracks for over four months while there was a widespread outbreak of Covid-19 in the barracks. Many suffered a deterioration in their mental health before the Home Office was ordered by the court to move them to alternative adequate accommodation. We are therefore pleased that our clients’ claims will now proceed to a full trial on an expedited basis so that there can be proper scrutiny of the lawfulness of using disused military barracks to house asylum seekers. “Refugees seeking sanctuary in the UK, many of whom have experienced torture and trafficking, have the right to be housed in humane conditions and both Napier and Penally barracks therefore urgently need to be closed.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The government provides safe, warm and secure accommodation with three nutritious meals served a day, all paid for by the taxpayer. Napier has previously accommodated army personnel and it is wrong to say it is not adequate for asylum seekers. “The Home Office has worked extremely closely with Public Health England to minimise risks of coronavirus and this track record will be robustly defended in court. Today’s initial hearing is one step in the legal process – the Home Office has not lost or conceded the case.”"
2021-02-16T18:03:05Z,politics,Politics,Creative industries treated as 'afterthought' by UK government after Brexit,"The creative industries have been left by the government to face the consequences of a “no-deal Brexit”, a parliamentary hearing into the impact of EU visa arrangements on artists and crew was told. MPs at the digital, culture, media and sport committee hearing told DCMS minister Caroline Dinenage that her department was treated as an “afterthought” by the government, and that during Brexit negotiations the creative industries were not prioritised, despite their accounting for about a quarter of the UK’s economy. “As a department you’re almost an afterthought, frankly … [the cultural sector] which is a world-leading part of the UK economy has basically been left to endure no-deal Brexit,” said the DCMS committee chair, Julian Knight. Dinenage said that DCMS plays a “pivotal role in bringing all the other government departments together” but added that some departments did not work “super collaboratively together all the time”.
The committee held two sessions to discuss the EU visa arrangements for artists and cultural workers, which have created layers of bureaucracy that led to £600 in visa-related costs for one British pianist who was due to perform at a concert in Spain. Lyndsay Duthie, the chief executive of the Production Guild of Great Britain, said it was more likely that a European production such as Game of Thrones, which was partly shot in Northern Ireland, could now avoid the UK altogether because of the extra costs involved. “It is possible that people with companies would base themselves in a European centre to avoid some of that red tape, but we don’t want that to happen,” she said. MPs asked Dinenage if the restrictions on artists coming from the EU to the UK was part of an ideological push by the Home Office to deliver its election promise to “take back control” of UK borders. Dinenage said the MPs were “barking up the wrong tree” and that the Home Office would have been “very interested in the visa proposals that the EU was putting forward, if they were firm guarantees”. Earlier, Deborah Annetts, the chief executive of the Incorporated Society of Musicians, said the government needed to provide “cast-iron advice” to musicians looking to work in European member states, which at present have different entry requirements for UK acts. She said: “They know the issues around mobility and carnets, which are the two things that are uppermost in the minds of the music sector at the moment. They should be sorting this out; so far, they have not.” Dinenage confirmed that at present, there are no ongoing negotiations with individual EU member states over entry requirements, visas and work permits for artists, musicians or technical crew. This week Sir Ian McKellen, Julie Walters and some of the biggest names in British theatre signed an open letter appealing to the prime minister to revisit the visa rules, saying they are a “towering hurdle” that must be urgently addressed. “Before, we were able to travel to Europe visa-free. Now we have to pay hundreds of pounds, fill in form after form, and spend weeks waiting for approval – just so we can do our jobs,” the letter said."

Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed that a phased return to school for younger pupils will start from next Monday. This will include children aged four to seven and secondary pupils who are required to carry out practical assignments. Nearly 69,000 additional laptops and tablets have been delivered or dispatched by the government to help children with remote learning in the past week. Four passengers were each fined Â£10,000 after arriving at Birmingham airport without declaring they had travelled from a â€œred listâ€� country during the previous 10 days, West Midlands police said. Travellers in quarantine hotels face an additional Â£1,200 bill if they test positive for coronavirus, the government has revealed. This is on top of the Â£1,750 fee for entering the programme and will apply to guests required to extend their stay beyond the initial 11 nights. The vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi has apologised for â€œany confusionâ€� over when people with asthma can expect to be offered a coronavirus jab after previously telling LBC that everyone who uses an inhaler would be in priority group six. Jo Whiley has said she is living a â€œnightmareâ€� after she was offered the coronavirus vaccine before her sister who has learning difficulties and diabetes. There have been a further 275 cases of coronavirus in Wales, taking the total number of confirmed cases to 199,793. A further 474 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths reported in hospitals to 79,593, NHS England said on Tuesday. There have been another 10,625 confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK. It brings the total number of cases in the UK to 4,058,468. Another 799 people have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus, bringing the UK total to 118,195.

2021-02-16T15:27:43Z,politics,Politics,EU 'clearing house' seeks to calm Brexit tensions over Northern Ireland ,"The EU is seeking to “de-escalate” Brexit tensions in Northern Ireland with the establishment of a new “clearing house” committee to work out solutions to issues caused by new trade barriers including controls on supermarket and chilled meat supplies. The European commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič said the introduction of the Northern Ireland protocol had been “administratively extremely challenging” but the EU was doing as much as possible to “calm down” and stabilise the backlash over checks and controls on goods entering the region from Great Britain. He told MPs on Ireland’s European affairs committee that the UK rejected a transition period over issues such as the “supply chains of sausages” and that “teething problems” were inevitable. “We knew this might happen. We have been discussing this with our UK partners for the last year.” The barriers to supply chains have fuelled local protests, anti-protocol graffiti and an official campaign by the Democratic Unionist party to scrap the protocol completely. Šefčovič said a new clearing house would be set up to assess any political solutions and act as an early warning system to alert both the UK and the EU to problems arising locally. But he added the implementation of the protocol “is a shared responsibility” and the onus was on both sides to make it work. “It must be always a two-way street,” he said. “We also have to recognise the fact that we knew from the beginning that the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, the customs union and the single market is a massive operation, that it’s not possible to prevent all the disruption. “It was quite obvious from the beginning that there will be teething problems and I believe that we can resolve them if we work very well together,” he told the Dáil committee. But he indicated there would be little flexibility around the protocol until the UK had implemented it fully, telling the committee that “official controls at the border control posts are currently not performed in compliance with the withdrawal agreement protocol and the European Union rules”. There were “very few identity checks, [a] very limited number of physical checks” and the EU could not assess the impact of trusted trader schemes and simplified health certificates for products such as chilled food until it had “real time” access to the customs data. He will meet Northern Ireland business and civic leaders in an online summit on Thursday ahead of a meeting of the joint committee he chairs with the UK Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, which is due to take place no later than 24 February. He gave little detail on the clearing house but said it would assess and evaluate political solutions to the protocol issues. It would be bolstered by the establishment of new Brexit structures including a partnership council, also to be jointly chaired by Gove and 19 “specialised committees”. Šefčovič told the Dáil committee that he “deeply regrets” last month’s aborted attempt to suspend part of the protocol in an EU vaccine row and said there would be a monthly meeting of commissioners “with the highest stake in this new EU-UK relationship” to ensure such a blunder was not repeated."
2021-02-16T11:41:57Z,politics,Politics,Scottish Labour leadership hopeful open to independence poll,"Monica Lennon, a contender for the Scottish Labour leadership, has said support for independence could increase if Labour fails to accept a fresh referendum may be needed. Lennon, a candidate backed by the party’s left, said more voters would desert Labour and back independence if they saw the party lining up with Boris Johnson by refusing to accept the case for a referendum. Anas Sarwar, the leadership frontrunner, has rejected calls to back a new referendum, but Lennon said pro-independence parties would have a mandate to hold a fresh vote if they won a majority of Holyrood seats in May’s Scottish elections.
“If people in Scotland through the ballot box express that they want a referendum, it would be foolish and undemocratic to ignore that,” Lennon told the Guardian. One could be held within the five-year lifetime of the next parliament, but not this year, as some SNP leaders have suggested. “It would be irresponsible for anyone to race ahead and force a referendum to happen this year while we’re still in the middle of a pandemic,” she said. “But for those people who want to hide behind Boris Johnson [by rejecting one], then I would say that would be a disaster for Scottish Labour and actually that itself puts the union at risk. I believe the biggest threat to the union is Boris Johnson and the Tories.” Lennon leapt to prominence last year after MSPs backed her private member’s bill to make Scotland the first country in the world to provide free period products. Vogue magazine then made her one of 12 women who changed the world in 2020, alongside the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, and Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand. Elected to Holyrood in 2016, Lennon, a former council planning officer, said Scottish Labour could only win back voters who swung behind the SNP over the past decade if it acknowledged many believed in independence. The failure to do so after the 2014 independence referendum led to Labour being “wiped out” in the 2015 Westminster election, losing 40 seats. “We’ve been losing people’s trust and confidence for a long time, and it takes a while to put that back together,” she said. Lennon said she wanted to prevent the SNP and the pro-independence Scottish Greens winning a majority in May. But if that failed and a referendum was organised, Labour should instead campaign for a federal option on the ballot as an alternative to independence, she said. That could be similar to proposals in a federalism blueprint commissioned by Jeremy Corbyn, the former UK party leader, she said. It advocated replacing the Lords with an elected senate and substantial new powers for the UK’s devolved parliaments and English regions. “We’re sounding very grumpy about the constitution,” she said. “We’re telling people it’s irresponsible to be talking about it. But they’re going to talk about it anyway; they’re going to talk about it without us. I’m standing to lead the party because I’m sick and tired of Scottish Labour being left behind, talking to ourselves.” Sarwar has said it is “deeply irresponsible” to support another independence referendum, and believes Labour should focus solely on the pandemic, combating the deep recession and attacking Nicola Sturgeon’s domestic policy record. He and other Labour figures admit, however, the party has been too slow to offer counter-proposals to independence. Keir Starmer’s plans to unveil a UK-wide constitutional convention in January were delayed when Richard Leonard suddenly resigned as Scottish Labour leader, triggering the current contest. The winner is due to be announced on 27 February. Lennon said Labour should already be campaigning to devolve employment and drugs legislation to Scotland, so Holyrood could scrap restrictive trade union laws and decriminalise drugs to tackle the country’s record rates of drug deaths. The absence of a compelling alternative from Labour, she said, meant many voters had moved towards independence: 21 opinion polls in succession have shown a yes majority, excluding don’t knows. “Because Scottish Labour haven’t been showing that there’s a better way, then people are being asked to respond to opinion polls that give them a binary choice between independence, which involves jumping off a cliff, or staying with what we have, which a majority of people don’t like,” she said."
2021-02-15T19:15:08Z,politics,Politics,Covid contracts: why are courts needed for public to get answers?,"In the terrifying, unprecedented onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, it did not make headline news that the government had suspended normal tendering processes for its spending of public money. There were then delays in publishing many of the new multi-million-pound contracts, for test and trace, personal protective equipment (PPE) and other services. But as the contracts were published, the number of questions about which companies were winning work and why quickly grew.
Reporters, including at the Guardian, soon discovered numerous companies with links to Dominic Cummings, Michael Gove and other senior Tories that had been granted emergency contracts for government work. It gave rise to the suspicion – denied by the government and the companies that benefited from its rapid spending – of a “chumocracy” in which contracts bypassing the tendering process went to firms with friends in high places. Late last year it emerged that the government had created a “high priority lane” for PPE companies referred by an MP, peer or government official. The existence of this route was first revealed by Jolyon Maugham QC, of the Good Law Project (GLP), who was leaked government documents, calling it “the VIP lane”. Maugham and the GLP, a not-for-profit organisation financed by crowdfunding that describes its mission as achieving progressive change through the law, has been challenging some contracts with judicial reviews, alleging their award was improper. The GLP’s case claiming “apparent bias” against the Cabinet Office over a £564,000 contract with the research company Public First, whose owners have previously worked with Cummings and Gove over many years, is the first to reach a hearing.
The judge, Mrs Justice O’Farrell, must now decide on the merits of the arguments and the propriety of the contract process. The government says there was nothing inappropriate about awarding a contract to a reputable firm that senior Downing Street officials, including Cummings, knew and trusted. Public First has always maintained it secured the contract because of its stellar reputation in focus group research, and its ability to help the government at speed. Whatever the result of the legal battle, one element is clear already: Cummings’ role in the process of awarding Public First a contract has only been revealed as a result of GLP’s legal challenge. When the Guardian and openDemocracy first reported on the contract in July, we asked the Cabinet Office if the longstanding ties between James Frayne and Rachel Wolf, who run Public First, and Cummings and Gove, were a factor in the award. The Cabinet Office replied that this was “nonsense”. Just last week, the Cabinet Office cited commercial sensitivity and refused a freedom of information request from the Guardian for more documentation, including emails and correspondence, relating to the Public First contract.
The government has responded in a similarly limited way to questions about all its spending: justifying contracts on the basis of the health crisis, saying necessary due diligence was done but releasing little in terms of hard evidence to assuage concerns over conflicts of interest. It is only due to the GLP’s judicial review challenge that the public can see how the decisions were taken on this one contract, and how centrally Cummings was involved. Maugham has complained about the government’s legal costs, approaching £600,000, for defending the contract, which the GLP may have to pay if the judge rules against it. Critics might conclude that the courts are a hugely expensive and unnecessarily adversarial forum for the government to provide public information about how it has spent the public’s money in response to the pandemic."
2021-02-15T16:06:20Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Cummings’ witness statement on Public First: key excerpts,"Dominic Cummings’ 10-page witness statement was submitted to the high court as part of the Cabinet Office defence of a judicial review of the contract awarded to Public First. Below are verbatim excerpts, edited to distil his explanation of his role in the process. It begins with the opening line of the section titled “Prior knowledge of Public First”. I am friends with James Frayne, Rachel Wolf and Gabriel Milland [partners at Public First]. I have not met James Frayne since 2016. I have previously worked with them in government and outside. For example, both James Frayne and Gabriel Milland worked at the Department for Education (“DfE”) when I was special adviser at DfE (2011-2015). James Frayne and I worked on the euro campaign 20 years ago, other political issues, and set up the campaign to fight the proposed formation of a regional assembly in north-east England in 2004. I have talked to them extensively about focus groups and public opinion over many years.
I knew from my experience that Public First were very good at running focus groups and that its key staff had thought extensively about how people who usually ignore most news and political communication think and might be influenced. I knew that I could rely on them to make an extra effort, beyond what they were paid to do. I knew they would give us honest information unlike many companies in this sector. Very few companies in this field are competent, almost none are very competent, honest and reliable. The Covid project contract The public health crisis developed quickly in February 2020. As the seriousness of the situation escalated, it became clear to me that, while there were very many brilliant officials who made enormous efforts throughout this crisis, Public Health England did not have the right resources in place to meet the government’s communications requirements of the emerging pandemic. […] They did not have the people or skills needed to undertake this type of public communications at speed. Neither did the DHSC [Department of Health and Social Care], the NHS or the Cabinet Office. Some of the first drafts of mass communication material were confusing and confusion clearly could have deadly consequences. So I became involved and started giving directions. […] Urgent help was needed to communicate effectively essential health messages to the public. I requested that Public First be brought in to mirror the focus groups already being done just as I also requested that the government start doing other polling in parallel to what it was already doing. I was the driving decision-maker on this. […] The country was facing an unprecedented national emergency. Thousands of lives were at stake, hundreds of billions of pounds were at stake. The extra money spent on doubling the focus groups and polling was essentially irrelevant in those circumstances. A few people did raise the question of how we could justify this as value for money. I responded that this was not the normal world, we were in a once-a-century pandemic and many thousands of pounds here was trivial if it helped us save lives and minimise economic destruction. It is important to stress that this exercise was totally non-political: I did not seek, nor was I interested in, anything to do with what other political parties were doing or saying – this exercise was only about the public health aspects of Covid. […] I am a special adviser and as such I am not allowed to direct civil servants. However, as a result of my suggestion, I expected people to hire Public First. The nature of my role is that sometimes people take what I say as an instruction and that is a reasonable inference as people assume I am often speaking for the prime minister. Civil servants could have disagreed and did disagree with my suggestions all the time and my response depends on my expertise of the matter in hand and other circumstances. On this occasion, I was an expert, I had just assembled a team of people to work on mass communication a few weeks earlier in the election campaign, I knew what the basic pillars of organising a communication campaign are and I expected people to listen to me. I had no involvement in the contractual arrangements with Public First or their remuneration. Urgency and allegations of apparent bias Obviously I did not request Public First be brought in because they were my friends. I would never do such a thing. […] The fact that I knew the key Public First people well was a bonus, not a problem, as in such a high-pressure environment trust is very important, as well as technical competence. […] I am sure that the work done by Public First allowed better and faster decisions and this saved lives and minimised damage. I would do the same again without a moment’s hesitation and I believe all those involved in mass communication would share this judgment. The full unedited witness statement is available here."
2021-02-15T13:47:36Z,politics,Politics,England's route out of Covid lockdown taking shape but timings unclear ,"While the government has said very little about how lockdown restrictions in England will start to be relaxed, there is a lot to be read between the lines. With a week to go before Boris Johnson spells out his roadmap for lifting the lockdown, leaks about new rules and timetables being discussed in multiple meetings across Whitehall will be filtering into newspapers. The chronology now seems to be taking shape. There is a hope of allowing a small easing of restrictions at the same time as schools reopen, to allow people to meet one other person for a coffee in the park, say, rather than just for exercise, without running the risk of being moved on by police. That would put the whole country under something similar to the tier 4 rules that were in place across swathes of England in December. Apart from schools reopening, the difference to a full lockdown is only subtle. Next on the list is some limited socialising outside, including the reopening of some low-risk sports such as golf or tennis. Next comes non-essential retail, close to the tier 3 measures, and then comes the return of hospitality, which will also be phased starting with outdoor dining, more akin to tier 2. Household mixing indoors – a priority for many people – is considered one of the most high-risk activities. What is still unclear this week is the timetable, which will be spelled out by Johnson on Monday next week. Those dates will be framed as the earliest dates that restrictions can lift. It will be highly dependent on the data and ultimately at the discretion of Boris Johnson, who is feeling extremely cautious, as Downing Street aides repeatedly brief. Much of that goes against his instincts. With the vaccine programme going great guns, you might expect Johnson’s innate boosterism to start straining at the leash. Yet he emphasises that while a longer lockdown is miserable, public anger if the country needs to enter a fourth lockdown will be far worse. For now, the public mood also seems to be on the side of caution. Whereas last time there was intense internal pressure from the Treasury to press ahead with reopening the economy as infection rates fell and hospitalisations stabilised, this time there is no such pressure. Rishi Sunak has resigned himself that his March budget will be yet another rescue package and any hopes of recouping some of the billions spent in the past year will have to wait at least six months. There is, of course, extreme agitation from a sizeable chunk of the parliamentary Conservative party. The Covid Recovery Group is demanding a return to normality by 1 May, with families able to holiday together over the bank holiday, international travel resuming and wedding receptions going ahead at full capacity. But those MPs have very little power to affect anything, short of writing letters to the prime minister. There is no opportunity coming down the track for a parliamentary rebellion. No 10 is examining a number of different timetables, much of it dependent on new data on the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing community transmission. That study by Public Health England is not expected to be available to ministers until the end of the week.
Under a more optimistic timetable, Johnson could spell out an aim for friends to be meeting in pubs by April and families holidaying together at the English seaside from early summer – though international travel is widely believed to be written off because of fears about new variants. Under a more pessimistic timetable in which the vaccine rollout slows or new variant threats develop, those dates could be pushed back far further. One government official said at the weekend that August was their most pessimistic presumption for the reopening of hospitality, which would be terminal for many businesses."
2021-02-15T10:04:58Z,politics,Politics,"Napier barracks not suitable for accommodation, experts found","A former army barracks used to house asylum seekers did not “meet acceptable standards of accommodation” when it was surveyed by planning and environmental experts seven years ago, it has emerged. A report on Napier barracks, near Folkestone, Kent, filed by CgMs Consulting, now part of the RPS Group, concluded that “the buildings were never intended for long-term use” and converting the housing blocks on the site was an “unsuitable approach”. The report was submitted to Folkestone and Hythe district council in 2014 as part of a planning application by the housebuilder Taylor Wimpey, which in September 2020 was granted planning permission to demolish Napier barracks and build 355 houses. The revelations raise questions about the future of the controversial site after reports suggested the Home Office intended to consult the public on maintaining its current use as temporary accommodation for asylum seekers. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has argued that the sites were sufficient for “our brave soldiers and army personnel”, but the Guardian understands that military personnel have not been accommodated at the site for a decade and a half. Her Majesty’s Prison Inspectorate will enter the site this week after months of accusations levelled at the Home Office, and its private contractor Clearsprings Ready Homes, over the treatment of the asylum seekers on the site. The Guardian understands that since the on-site inspection was announced on Wednesday, the Home Office has dramatically reduced the number of men housed inside to between 50 and 100. In mid-January, nearly 400 men were staying there. In addition, asylum seekers claim there has been additional cleaning and maintenance since the inspection was announced, cleaning and fixing facilities that have been dirty or broken for months. The Home Office said it was temporarily moving a number of asylum seekers from the Napier accommodation into self-isolation facilities, to allow others to self-isolate more easily, while individuals may leave the site for more permanent accommodation as it becomes available. Taylor Wimpey’s plans for the Shorncliffe garrison, which takes in Napier barracks, remain on the company’s website and, as well as housing, include a primary school and improved recreation facilities. Folkestone and Hythe district council approved planning for a 355-home development on the Napier and Burgoyne barracks part of the garrison on 18 September last year, at the same time as the Home Office started to house asylum seekers on the site. The Guardian understands Burgoyne barracks is owned by Taylor Wimpey but Napier is still owned by the MoD, and it is expected to be bought and handed over to Taylor Wimpey in 2026. The CgMs report, seen by the Guardian and Kent Live, and filed as part of a broader application in 2014, said: “Much of the land owned by the MoD has become surplus to requirements as the existing buildings no longer meet acceptable standards for accommodation, offices and storage. “Built to a standardised layout and using common construction techniques of the time, these buildings were never intended for long-term use. “Converting these purpose-built barrack blocks into residential dwellings is regarded as an unsuitable approach, primarily due to the potential constraints arising from their reuse; either allocating the building entirely as a single unit, or subdividing existing spaces into multiple and undersized units.” Following a review of available government property, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) agreed last summer to temporarily hand over two of sites – Napier Barracks and Penally Camp in Pembrokeshire, which have since been dogged by allegations of cover-ups, poor access to healthcare and legal advice, and crowded conditions.

2021-02-14T18:39:44Z,politics,Politics,Alex Salmond case: Holyrood inquiry 'more traumatic than trial',"A woman who made sexual assault allegations against Alex Salmond has described the Holyrood inquiry into the Scottish government’s botched handling of initial complaints as “in many ways more traumatic” than the trial itself. The woman was one of nine who gave evidence against the former first minister when he was tried in March 2020 on 14 charges of sexual assault, including one of attempted rape, and acquitted of every charge at the high court in Edinburgh. A Holyrood committee is now investigating the Scottish government’s handling of the original complaints that he sexually harassed two officials. A judicial review of the process, brought by Salmond, found it was “tainted with apparent bias” in January 2019. In an interview with BBC Scotland’s newly launched The Sunday Show, the woman said she believed the committee’s conduct had made it “significantly harder” for others to come forward with similar complaints. Addressing directly claims by Salmond and his supporters that the charges resulted from a conspiracy driven by figures close to Nicola Sturgeon, she said: “It is utterly absurd to suggest that nine women could be persuaded to lie to the police, to perjure themselves in court. The truth is that we individually had experiences of Alex Salmond’s behaviour.” Salmond admitted in his own evidence at trial that he should have been “more careful with people’s personal space”, while civil servants told the court they tried to reinforce the practice of not allowing female officials to work alone with him. Instead of the impartial investigation she had hoped for, the woman – who cannot be named for legal reasons – told BBC Scotland’s political editor Glenn Campbell that she believed it had descended into a “political fight”, and that the row “effectively allowed the government to get away with not being properly scrutinised on its procedures”. And she added that the inquiry had been “in many ways more traumatic than the experience of the high court trial”. The woman told Campbell: “What has happened is they have taken your very personal experiences and exploited them for their own self-serving political interests, and that is something in itself that is really traumatic.” She added: “I think that they really had an opportunity to ensure they could investigate the creation of procedures that would make it safe and easy for women to come forward, and they have made it significantly harder.” Responding to the interview, Scottish National party MSP Linda Fabiani, the committee convener, said that she would like to issue a personal apology for anything that had made any complainant feel like they had been exploited. She accepted that the process had “become more political than it should”, but that she hoped to make recommendations “that will be taken on board to protect women in the future”. The committee is now battling to break the deadlock over publication of evidence that Salmond says is an essential part of his case alleging that Sturgeon broke the ministerial code. The former first minister refused to attend in person last Tuesday after the committee voted narrowly against publication, for legal reasons. But on Thursday, the senior Scottish judge Lady Dorian agreed to amend a court order she imposed on what could be reported about Salmond’s criminal trial after a legal challenge by the Spectator. On Friday, the committee again postponed Sturgeon’s evidence session – which her spokesperson described as “hugely frustrating” – in the expectation that Salmond could now agree to appear once lawyers for both Holyrood and the former first minister assess Dorian’s written judgment, which is to be published on Monday. Earlier this month, a number of the women who testified against Salmond hit out at the Crown Office and MSPs after their private messages about the case were released to the Scottish parliament. The women said releasing the texts – after Holyrood issued an unprecedented legal order demanding they were disclosed – could have “grave consequences” for future victims of alleged sexual violence if people feared their private correspondence could be disclosed."
2021-02-14T16:01:28Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson calls Trump impeachment over Capitol attack 'kerfuffle',"In an interview with US television on Sunday, Boris Johnson characterised Donald Trump’s impeachment and acquittal on a charge of inciting insurrection against his own government as “toings and froings and all the kerfuffle”.
The prime minister’s words jarred with those of Joe Biden. In a statement on Saturday night, the new president said: “This sad chapter in our history has reminded us that democracy is fragile.” Five people died as a direct result of the attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters, who the president told to “fight like hell” in his attempt to overturn election defeat, on 6 January. In the former president’s second impeachment trial, House prosecutors showed chilling footage of lawmakers being hustled to safety by Capitol police. Members of the pro-Trump mob chanted “hang Mike Pence” as they searched for Trump’s vice-president. Some erected a gallows outside the Capitol. Johnson has condemned the Capitol attack. On Sunday he appeared on CBS’s Face the Nation. Asked what signal the acquittal of a president who stoked such violence while casting doubt on a free election would send to the rest of the world, he said: “The clear message that we get from the proceedings in America is that after all the toings and froings and all the kerfuffle, American democracy is strong and the American constitution is strong and robust.” Biden is not so sure. Democracy “must always be defended”, he said, adding: “We must be ever vigilant … each of us has a duty and responsibility as Americans, and especially as leaders, to defend the truth and to defeat the lies.”
In the Senate chamber on Saturday, 57 senators voted to convict Trump. But a two-thirds majority in the 100-member body was needed for the former president to be formally punished and stopped from running for office again. Seven Republican defections, among them Mitt Romney of Utah, the 2012 nominee for president, made it the most bipartisan impeachment verdict of four in US history. Every impeachment of a president has ended in acquittal: Andrew Johnson in 1868, Bill Clinton in 1999 and Trump in his first trial last year. But the final vote tally on Saturday also showed that 43 Republican senators were content to suggest inciting a mob to attack Congress and attempt to overturn an election did not merit punishment. Many, including minority leader Mitch McConnell, who excoriated Trump in a speech after the vote, said the trial was unconstitutional because Trump had left office. Experts disagreed and the Senate twice voted that hearings should proceed. Constitutional experts expressed concern for America’s 233-year-old system of government. Andrew Rudalevige of Bowdoin College told Axios: “Congress not even pushing back against a physical assault suggests that there’s a lot they will put up with.” Doug Jones, a former Democratic senator from Alabama, wrote: “In any trial, the accusing party must connect the dots between the words and actions of the defendant to the harm that occurred … the House managers did just that. “…If Trump’s actions are not impeachable, then nothing is, and we may as well strike that provision from the constitution.”
While Trump was in office, Johnson cleaved so close to the president and his populist policies and style that Biden was reported to have called the prime minister “the physical and emotional clone of Donald Trump”. Asked on Sunday if he was concerned he and the new president might “start off on the wrong foot”, Johnson avoided the question. “I’ve had,” he said, “I think, already two long and very good conversations with the president and we had a really good exchange, particularly about climate change and what he wants to do.” Johnson also said the UK was “delighted now, I’m very delighted, to have a good relationship with the White House, which is an important part of any UK prime minister’s mission.” Such subjects, Johnson said, included Nato and Iran, “but above all, on the ways that the US and the UK are going to work together to deal with the environmental challenge that faces our planet.
“And there, I think some of the stuff we’re now hearing from the new American administration and from the new White House is incredibly encouraging. And we want to work with the president on that.” Johnson will host a virtual meeting with Biden on 19 February, to discuss attempts to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. According to Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, the US has recorded the most cases (27.5m) and most deaths (484,000) from the virus. The UK is in fourth place for cases (4m) and fifth for deaths (117,000), also behind India, Brazil and Mexico. The UK has a much higher figure for deaths per capita. Both the British and US governments have been pilloried for their attempts to tackle the problem. Touting vaccination efforts in the UK, Johnson told CBS: “I reckon science, in this arm wrestle, science is winning.”"
2021-02-14T11:09:43Z,politics,Politics,"Raab shrugs off Brexit troubles, urging people to take ‘10-year view’ ","Potential losses in UK trade with the EU because of Brexit will be more than made up by more opportunities in developing markets, Dominic Raab has claimed, saying people should take a “10-year view” of the current troubles faced by companies. Questioned about warnings from a number of firms that bureaucracy and duties means they will go out of business, or have to relocate operations inside the EU, the foreign secretary also appeared to blame Brussels, saying it was “imposing” obstacles to trade. Since the end of the Brexit transition period in January, with the UK’s status outside the single market and customs union, a number of firms have said their current position is untenable, with JD Sports saying last week it expected to open a major warehouse inside the EU to avoid bureaucracy over shipments to European customers. Asked about the experience of companies facing such difficulties, Raab told BBC1’s Andrew Marr programme that the government was “doing a huge amount to support them, with advice and guidance, particularly intermediaries dealing with things like custom declarations”. He added: “We have always been clear that there are changes that come with exiting the transition period, and what we’re trying to do is support businesses as best we can to manage those.” Raab said such disruption should be seen in a broader context. He said: “You can always take individual cases, and I know they matter, but overall we’re in an excellent position to grasp the opportunities of a global Britain. “I think if you take a 10-year view, as well as looking at the short-term risk, which is right to do, actually the growth opportunities in the future are going to come from emerging and developing economies around the world.” Asked if this meant UK businesses should accept less trade with the EU and focus more on places such as Asia, Raab replied: “I wouldn’t put it quite in those terms, but it’s certainly right to say that we want to bank, if you like, the baseline of our European trade – it’s very important to us, and they are obviously our neighbours – but if you look at the opportunities for growth in the future for UK companies … the growth economies are going to come from the Indo-Pacific region.” Raab also appeared to blame the EU for many of the barriers, saying the government was seeking to “reduce and mitigate as far as we can the bureaucratic obstacles that the EU is imposing”. He was bullish about the idea of EU financial centres taking considerable business from the City of London, despite Amsterdam having overtaken London as Europe’s top share trading centre. Raab said: “[The EU] may be able to, if you like, nick a bit of business here or there from the City, but the problem is, the measures they will take to achieve that undermine their own competitiveness.”"
2021-02-14T09:05:37Z,politics,Politics,Pandemic has had negative impact on mental health: poll,"More than four out of 10 people say the Covid-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on their mental health, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. In the survey, 43% say their mental health has deteriorated over the past year, while more than a third (35%) report that their physical health has got worse. The shocking data bears out warnings from experts who have predicted that Covid-19 and the resulting restrictions on movement and activities, as well as job losses and lay-offs, would trigger a mental health crisis. Last December Dr Adrian James, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, warned that the UK was facing “the biggest hit to mental health since the second world war”, with lasting effects. “It doesn’t stop when the virus is under control and there are few people in hospital. You’ve got to fund the long-term consequences,” he said. By the end of last year as many as 10 million people, including 1.5 million children, were thought to be in need of new or additional mental health support as a direct result of the crisis. With financial pressures mounting on many individuals and households, 30% of people told Opinium that their personal finances were in a worse state as a result of the pandemic, with those on the lowest incomes worst affected. One-third (33%) of those on a low income (under £20,000) said the pandemic had had a negative impact on their personal finances, with just 15% in this bracket saying their finances were in a better state. For those on average incomes of between £20,000 to £40,000, 24% said the effect had been positive, 26% negative and 29% that it had not been significant. For those earning more than £40,000, 27% said the effect had been negative, while 27% said it had been positive and 42% reported no significant impact. With the budget on 3 March approaching, 44% of people believe the main priority for the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, should be fostering economic growth and recovery, while 37% cite jobs and 34% investment in public services."
2021-02-13T19:09:26Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer facing pressure to end silence on Tory Brexit failures,"Labour leader Keir Starmer is coming under growing pressure from senior party figures and activists to hold Boris Johnson to account over the disastrous effects of his Brexit deal on many UK businesses.
After more than six weeks of virtual radio silence on Brexit, the Labour leader has yet to make a sustained challenge of any sort to the prime minister on the issue. This is despite hauliers reporting massive falls in trade volumes to the EU and half of 470 UK exporters telling the British Chambers of Commerce in a survey that they are facing real problems. When Johnson announced the limited free trade deal with the EU on 24 December, Starmer made a statement saying Labour would accept the deal to avoid any risk of a no deal outcome. But he insisted it was limited and flawed and that Labour would stop at nothing to expose its shortcomings. “We will hold you to account for it. Every second you are in power. For the promises you have made. And the promises you break,” Starmer said. Since then – despite Johnson having insisted the deal would boost UK trade and that there would no border in the Irish sea – many UK exporters have been driven to take drastic action, either stopping exports to the EU altogether or setting up operations inside the single market, meaning the loss of jobs, investment and tax revenues in the UK. Last night Richard Corbett, a former Labour leader in the European parliament and ex-member of the shadow cabinet, called on Starmer to start exposing the prime minister’s “incompetence and malevolence”. “The idea that the Brexit issue is done and dusted is for the birds,” Corbett told the Observer. “First, because Johnson’s deal is full of gaps that still need to be negotiated including on services and on fisheries. “Second, because where it has settled issues, it has done so badly, as shown by the crescendo of complaints from companies and others including musicians and students. “And third because the government seems intent on seeking conflict with the EU, from threatening to tear up the agreement on Northern Ireland to departing from the level playing field commitments. “Just as with Covid, Labour must highlight Johnson’s incompetence and malevolence, and point to how the damage can be rectified.” Ben Bradshaw, the MP for Exeter and a former Labour cabinet minister, said it was entirely right that Starmer had decided to focus his criticisms mainly on Covid-19. “However,” Bradshaw added: “With the mounting evidence of basic flaws and problems in Boris Johnson’s deal it is not going to be sustainable not to talk about Brexit for very much longer. Otherwise, what is the point of being the opposition?” It is understood that several members of the parliamentary party have relayed their concerns to the leadership about Starmer’s silence on Brexit since the start of the year. As shadow Brexit secretary under Jeremy Corbyn, Starmer was the party’s leading advocate of a second referendum, and warned of the dangers of being outside the single market. But since Johnson struck his deal, tensions have grown. Among those with concerns about Labour backing Johnson’s deal in December was the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds. Many Labour MPs say that Starmer, having ordered his troops to support the deal, fears he would fall into a political trap set by the Conservatives if he now attacked Johnson for its consequences. Labour MPs also say it is clear that Starmer is worried about his party losing the support of more traditional Labour voters who voted for Brexit, if he were to start to criticise the deal that implemented it. At the 2019 general election the Tories took many seats from Labour behind the so-called red wall in the Midlands and north of England, which Starmer knows he will have to win back to have any chance of entering Downing Street. But Labour pro-Europeans say the issues are too important to ignore because of fears of being embarrassed at the dispatch box. Michael Chessum, national organiser for the leftwing Labour grouping, Another Europe is Possible, said: “Again and again, Starmer seems to be going back on his promises. He won the Labour leadership on a cast-iron promise to defend freedom of movement, but last month he announced on live national television that this was no longer his policy. “He has carefully manufactured an image as a principled internationalist – and yet he whipped for the government’s dreadful Brexit deal in December. And when he voted for that deal, he did so promising to hold the government to account on it for every second it was in power, but there isn’t much evidence of that.” A spokesman for Starmer said he was not available for comment on Saturday, and that Rachel Reeves, who has responded to stories about post-Brexit chaos by accusing the government of incompetence, was leading on the issue. The spokesman added: “This government ignored British business during negotiations, gave them a matter of days to prepare for the deal and is now downplaying the challenges exporters are facing. “The Conservatives have wrapped businesses in red tape and higher costs, and put contracts and jobs at risk. Labour will challenge them every step of the way on the implementation of the deal in order to get the best result for the British economy.”
In the latest Opinium poll for the Observer, the Tories have stretched their lead to 5pts, to 42% (up 3pts on a fortnight ago) while Labour are on 37% (down 1pt). Boris Johnson maintains his lead on who would be the best prime minister: 32% now select Johnson (-1) while 27% think Starmer would make the best PM (-2); 25% said neither and 16% said they don’t know. On Sunday Labour launches plans to help ease the Covid debt burden faced by firms across the country by setting up a British business recovery agency. While not specifically mentioning Brexit, Dodds says the party’s priority is to “help businesses get back on their feet, secure our economy and get Britain on the road to recovery”. British business is currently weighed down by £71bn of Covid debt through government-backed loans during the crisis – with the chancellor encouraging banks to begin asking for repayments in March. New analysis by Labour reveals that 850,000 businesses are at risk of closure in the next three months, putting 2.4 million jobs at risk. Labour’s plan would ease the debt burden on business, secure the economy and help British business to rebuild with a range of measures including converting the bounce back loans scheme into a “student loan style” arrangement, so that businesses have to start repayments only when they are making money."
2021-02-12T18:11:08Z,politics,Politics,Scottish parliament's Salmond inquiry postpones Sturgeon appearance,"The Holyrood committee investigating the Scottish government’s handling of sexual harassment allegations against Alex Salmond has postponed Nicola Sturgeon’s appearance before it in an attempt to break the deadlock over the former first minister’s evidence. The committee reached crisis point earlier this week after it voted narrowly against publishing evidence that Salmond says is an essential part of his case alleging that Sturgeon broke the ministerial code, resulting in the former first minister refusing to attend in person. Sturgeon’s planned evidence session on 16 February was delayed for what is believed to be the fourth time after the committee met on Friday to consider a ruling by the senior Scottish judge Lady Dorrian, who agreed to amend a court order she imposed on what could be reported about Salmond’s criminal trial on 14 counts of alleged sexual assault, including an attempted rape, of which he was acquitted last year. The Spectator magazine and its publisher, Andrew Neil, had challenged Dorrian’s original order, arguing it prevented journalists and Holyrood from reporting allegations made by Salmond about the government and its investigation. Dorrian amended her order, although in a different form to that originally sought by the Spectator, and will provide her written judgment on Monday. Salmond’s lawyers, Levy & McRae, who were also instructed by the Spectator, wrote to the committee on Thursday to say they believed the amendment should clear the way for the parliament to publish the relevant evidence, thus enabling an oral evidence session. The committee’s timeframe for completing evidence sessions and writing its report is becoming increasingly tight, with Holyrood going into recess at the end of next month for May’s election. It is understood the committee will use this Tuesday’s session to consider the implications of Dorian’s written ruling, in the expectation that Salmond will make his long-awaited appearance the following week, with Sturgeon attending in the first week of March. A Scottish parliament spokesperson said: “At its meeting today, the committee was united in its desire to complete this inquiry in an open and transparent way, and to publish its report and recommendations next month. “Given the impact of the recent court judgment is not yet known, the committee has agreed that it must have the time to reflect on the impact on its work once the full written judgment is published early next week.”"
2021-02-12T17:21:01Z,politics,Politics,UK Covid: R value below 1 for first time since July as number receiving first vaccine dose passes 14m – as it happened,"Here the latest key developments at a glance: Prof Neil Ferguson is “hopeful” this will be UK’s “final lockdown”, and said Boris Johnson will “have some bandwidth” to start reopening schools in March before potentially beginning to ease other restrictions the following month. The reproduction number, or R value, of coronavirus transmission across the UK is between 0.7 and 0.9, according to the latest government figures, falling below 1 for the since July last year. The UK reported a further 758 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Friday, bringing the UK official death toll to 116,287. Downing Street has defended the level of restrictions that will be in place at quarantine hotels, with hotel staff to decide whether travellers are allowed out of their rooms. Scottish government ministers continue to draw attention to the UK’s “insufficient” border controls, before the managed quarantine restrictions coming into force on Monday. GPs and other vaccinators can now give coronavirus vaccinations to people aged between 65 and 69 in England if they have done all they can to reach older and clinically vulnerable people in higher priority groups. Downing Street has said the plan to ease the lockdown in England will be set out on 22 February, after Tory MPs were concerned this would be delayed. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has said Wales has achieved the first milestone in its vaccination strategy - to offer vaccination to everyone in the first four priority groups. the nation has so far given jabs to 700,000 people. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that one in 80 people in England had Covid-19 in the week ending on 6 February, or around 695,400 people in total, while 1 on 60 people in London were estimated to have the virus that week. In Wales, it was one in 85 in the same week, in Northern Ireland one in 75 and in Scotland around one in 150, the ONS estimates. That’s all from me, thanks for following along.

2021-02-12T16:51:00Z,politics,Politics,"Forde inquiry delay suggests Labour not serious on racism, black MPs say","Nine black Labour MPs have said the delay in publishing the Forde inquiry risks giving black members and supporters the impression that the party does not take racism seriously. In a statement circulated on Friday, the MPs, among them two shadow cabinet ministers, said they were “disappointed and seriously concerned” by the indefinite delay to the inquiry, which is being withheld over concerns it could prejudice an investigation by the information commissioner. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, appointed Martin Forde QC last May to investigate the leak of an unredacted report into the party’s complaints process. The report included details of alleged conversations between party officials about black MPs that were condemned as racist and led to a backlash among black Labour supporters.
Detractors say it is unclear why Forde has waited until now, 10 months after the information commissioner was informed of the data breach and seven months after the report was initially due to be delivered, to warn of the risk of prejudicing the external investigation. “The possibility of a racist culture and a hostile environment for black members within the party needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency and the Forde inquiry is an important tool for doing just that,” the MPs said. The signatories to the statement were Marsha de Cordova, the shadow women and equalities secretary, Chi Onwurah, the shadow science minister, and the MPs Diane Abbott, Dawn Butler, Florence Eshalomi, Kim Johnson, Clive Lewis, Kate Osamor and Bell Ribeiro-Addy. The Guardian understands they are pushing for a meeting with Starmer to present their concerns. One signatory said: “The fact that so many black MPs signed points to the fact that people are increasingly fed up with the leadership line on race generally, and their crude attempts to kick the Forde inquiry into the long grass in particular.” The MPs said that fears of prejudicing the information commissioner’s investigation must be weighed against the importance of addressing members’ concerns about racism. They called for the release of parts of the report not relating to the leak “but to the prevailing culture in the party”.
“Delaying the Forde inquiry and failing to provide a future date by which its findings will be published risks further doubling down on the impression that the party does not take issues of anti-black racism seriously,” the statement said. “The abuse contained within the [leaked] report and the issues it seeks to address are incredibly serious and must be part of our attempts to ensure the Labour party is an inclusive and tolerant place. “The fact that members who contributed to anti-black racism have been readmitted to the party is a cause of concern and this delay only adds to the anxiety.” MPs have previously raised concerns that Starmer is taking the support of black and minority voters for granted. A leaked policy document calling on the party to “use of the [union] flag, veterans [and] dressing smartly” to win back disillusioned voters was criticised by Lewis as “moving down the track of the nativist right.” The Labour party has been approached for comment."
2021-02-12T14:50:25Z,politics,Politics,How do England's quarantine rules compare with those of other countries?,"Guests in quarantine in England have to stay for 10 days, with negative tests required for them to then be released. In Australia and New Zealand, isolation lasts for 14 days from the time of arrival, while Hong Kong requires 21 days in hotel isolation. Only arrivals from 33 countries including Brazil and South Africa need to go into quarantine in England, although more countries could be added. In other countries such as Australia, all arrivals – regardless of country of origin – must go into quarantine. In Australia and New Zealand only citizens or residents are allowed to enter, with a small number of exceptions requiring government approval before travel. Taiwan is similar but also allows international students to enter. Arrivals in England will have to pay £1,750 for the 10-day stay. New South Wales in Australia charges a similar amount for 13 nights, with discounts for couples or families in both cases. New Zealand doesn’t charge returning citizens if they are staying in the country for longer than 90 days. The UK government says there will be a “deferred repayment plan” spreading the cost over 12 months for those unable to pay. Other countries apply fee waivers in circumstances such as returns for funerals. Hong Kong and some Australian states bar guests from leaving their rooms during quarantine, while New Zealand in most cases allows regular outdoor exercise or smoking, sometimes in multi-storey car parks attached to a hotel. England will allow “supervised exercise” but it appears discretionary, “only with special permission from hotel staff or security”, according to government documents.
Other countries including New Zealand and Australia have regular testing of staff working at the hotels, but England appears not to have opted for mandatory testing. Because the other countries have a Covid-19 elimination policy, hotel staff are far more at risk than the rest of the population. But since community transmission remains high in the UK, staff are as likely to catch it elsewhere. Guests who test positive in quarantine in England are expected to prolong their stay for 10 days following the positive result. That means they risk infecting other guests and staff. In New Zealand, those who test positive – including staff – are transferred to a special quarantine facility in Auckland with heavier restrictions."
2021-02-12T14:20:10Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer to launch fightback with Labour policy blitz,"Keir Starmer will seek to assuage growing criticism of his leadership within Labour by kicking off a major policy blitz next week, as the party aims to paint a picture of what it would do in government. Concerns about Labour’s direction were underlined last week by a leaked strategy document that urged the party to focus on a new patriotic approach, including more use of the union jack. The document prompted some ridicule from MPs and calls for the Labour leader to flesh out his vision for the party and the country in more detailed policy terms. Starmer is expected to set out some key planks of a future Labour government’s economic policy in a speech on Thursday, one of a series of interventions the party hopes will also raise the profile of his shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, before the budget on 3 March.
An immediate focus will be financial support for business – particularly the hospitality sector – which Starmer will highlight has taken on unfeasibly high debts during the Covid-19 crisis. Members of the Labour frontbench are also to be given more of a visible role, after the shadow Cabinet Office minister, Rachel Reeves, delivered a high-profile speech on government cronyism and wastage this week. A number of other keynote speeches are planned in the coming weeks, including from the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, and the shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds. One Labour source described the strategy as “showing a bit of ankle”, but said Starmer would begin to transition into the role of a more combative opposition leader as the vaccine programme started to alleviate the immediate public health crisis. “That means we can start to focus on the bigger picture stuff and talk about systemic change,” the source added. Angela Smith, Labour’s leader in the Lords, said the past year had been about “pressing the reset button” and that voters would begin to see a more passionate side to Starmer. “Still waters run deep. My own sense of Keir is that he’s very passionate about his politics and what he believes in and what he wants to achieve,” she said. “He’s not someone who’s going to shout and holler, and be offensive, or cry on someone’s shoulder. But it runs deep, what he believes in. “He’s said we can’t go back to business as usual and he will know his challenge is now to set out what that looks like. But he couldn’t do that in an environment where people didn’t trust us. You need foundations on which to build. “If you look at great Labour victories – Attlee, Wilson, Blair – they all came at a time when things needed to change. They gave an optimism that things would change, but also the credibility that they were the people to do it.”
Another shadow cabinet minister said they had been frustrated about not being able to rally a better defence of Starmer amid criticism over the leaked document to the Guardian. “You can’t coordinate a big fightback while everyone is in their separate cities. Keir is still a figure who is unknown – and there is plainly frustration he has not exposed his own personality and vision. That is something that you will see he is about to do,” they said. One shadow minister added: “I think there has been a feeling we have toed one side of the fine line in supporting the government through a pandemic and [that] we need to start stepping firmly over the other side of the line. And Keir says he agrees with that.” The flak taken by the Labour leader has come most notably – but not only – from the left of the party, and has included a number of high-profile rebellions. Several rebels have expressed feelings of being misled by Starmer’s leadership campaign, which, they said, had a more leftwing agenda closer to that of Jeremy Corbyn’s. “It’s not universal, but there is definitely a sense that this is not what we signed up for,” one leftwing MP said. “Government incompetence gets pretty boring. There’s an element of Covid determinism, which is, let [Boris] Johnson make a mess of this, and we’ll look competent and reap the benefits. It hasn’t panned out.” Another senior staffer said: “It does feel reminiscent of the Ed [Miliband] era – it’s a bit of a blancmange.” There are also fears among members on the party’s right, many of whom bristled at Starmer’s decision to vote for Johnson’s Brexit deal. One said: “We are facing a very difficult fight over the next few years, where the Tories are going to spend lots of cash in seats they won, stick a picture of the MP next to a bypass or bridge with a grinning Boris on the leaflets and say: ‘The Labour MP never got this done in 20 years, look what a difference I’ve made.’ I’ve not heard a single answer to how we combat that.” One of Starmer’s close aides, Anneliese Midgley, who previously worked for Unite and for Corbyn, is to head over to Labour headquarters to work on campaigning strategy one insider describes as “to get the party machinery working more closely with the leadership’s political strategy”. Staff at the Southside HQ in London face a challenging runup to the local elections and a more widespread need to keep party activists motivated when they cannot campaign or canvass because of the pandemic. Though private polling before the elections, which are scheduled for 6 May, has been mixed – described in briefings as abysmal in some places – there are chances for Labour to make some symbolic gains, including the high-profile West Midlands mayoralty. Whatever the criticism of the leaked “flags and veterans” strategy that drew some derision, advisers are determined there must be a broader push to appeal to voters who have previously voted Conservative. Polling at the moment shows Starmer has mainly been highly attractive to former Liberal Democrat voters in southern seats. “We might get to Blair levels in the south of England but not win back enough seats to get us a majority,” said one insider."
2021-02-12T13:14:09Z,politics,Politics,What can England learn from quarantine mistakes in other countries?,"The government is doing more than opening quarantine hotels for international travellers from Covid-19 variant hotspots – it is opening up a world of pain for itself, a dripping tap of bad news likely to keep ministers awake at night. From 15 February all arrivals from more than 30 countries, including South Africa and Brazil, will be confined to a quarantine hotel for 10 days before being released, assuming they test negative for Covid-19. That is the easy part. If other countries with mandatory hotel isolation are any guide, the government in England will find itself enmeshed in controversy over how the centres are organised, and will have to make running repairs to satisfy the public when controversies erupt. Escapes The point of quarantine is to keep people isolated, but hotels are not prisons. Australia and New Zealand have seen multiple escapes by guests who have slipped out through gaps in fences and fire escapes or, in one case, by knotting bedsheets together and climbing out of a fourth-floor window. Some escapers went to their nearest off-licence; one went to a supermarket and bought deodorant; others just went for a stroll. In one sad case, a bereaved woman and her children climbed out over a fence after being denied permission to see her dead husband. Short of building dedicated quarantine camps – a bad and expensive idea – the best way to deal with the inevitable escapes is an efficient track-and-trace system, which the UK arguably lacks. Security Australia and New Zealand initially relied on private security to enforce isolation in their hotels. But after a series of escapes and bungles in the early days, governments have increasingly turned to the armed forces and the police to enforce quarantine, with New Zealand handing over management of the entire operation to an air commodore. In the Australian state of Victoria, the decision to use private security has become a hot political issue, especially when it was suspected that infected security staff at its hotels were a cause of a major community outbreak. The government in England says it is going to rely on private security at quarantine hotels.
Sex Human nature being what it is, and single people being stuck in a hotel with a few hundred others with nothing to do, a proportion will attempt to have sex with each other, regardless of the rules. Staff members also get involved: in Melbourne a severe outbreak last year was linked to security guards having sex with guests; in New Zealand, soldiers have been disciplined for propositioning people in quarantine, and a staff member was fired after spending 20 minutes in a guest’s room. Food With sex off the menu, food becomes the most discussed issue in quarantine hotels. Producing three meals a day for a few hundred people is a challenge, and there will inevitably be complaints on social media. For residents with allergies, special needs, or children, it is especially difficult as rooms have no cooking facilities. A single parent with five children in quarantine in New Zealand had an ingenious solution: making toasted sandwiches using the hotel room’s iron. Lack of space: England is to have fewer than 5,000 quarantine rooms available for arrivals from 33 countries, and that may be enough given that the £1,750 price tag will put many off. But should other countries be added to the red list, such as Spain, space may quickly run out. That can be embarrassing: the popular children’s entertainers the Wiggles had a sell-out tour planned for New Zealand in March but its management forgot to book quarantine places, putting the tour in doubt. After lobbying of MPs and a rebuke from the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, spots for the cast and crew were found. Guest behaviour Different countries have different restrictions on what those in quarantine may do, ranging from Hong Kong’s draconian 21-day isolation where people cannot leave their rooms, to others that allow some fresh air and exercise outdoor. The West Indies cricket team got into trouble in isolation when team members were caught socialising and eating together. Elsewhere, police in New Zealand found cannabis concealed in tennis balls being thrown over the fence of one quarantine hotel. Other guests have attempted to have meth delivered, and staff reported finding bongs constructed from water bottles. Air conditioning Because Covid-19 appears likely to be spread mainly through the air, hotel air conditioning can end up in the news. The system at the five-star Pullman hotel in Auckland may have spread the South African Covid variant, meaning that people who had tested negative and were allowed to leave later developed symptoms. In Hong Kong, guests can pay extra for a room with windows that open. Cost The £1,750 single-person charge for a quarantine stay in England covers only a proportion of the cost to the government. New Zealand charges a similar amount and operates a similar number of places, at a cost of more than £1m a day."
2021-02-12T12:27:58Z,politics,Politics,"England's current lockdown could be the last, says Neil Ferguson","The scientist whose data modelling led to the first UK lockdown has expressed hope that the current lockdown could be the last. Prof Neil Ferguson, who advises the government as part of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats advisory group (Nervtag), said the nation was “in a better place than I might have anticipated a month ago”. He told Politico’s Westminster Insider podcast: “The lockdown has really driven down cases quite fast. They’re basically halving about every 17 days at the moment or so, and that means in a month’s time – the prime minister’s talked about potentially reopening schools – we might have some bandwidth to do that, at least primary schools. “And if we continue to see then a continued decline without large outbreaks, then perhaps starting to relax other aspects of society the following month.” Boris Johnson is due to set out a roadmap for easing England’s lockdown in the week starting 22 February, with 8 March earmarked for a wide reopening of schools. Ferguson said that if the situation played out according to the best estimates, much of England could be in the equivalent of tier 2 measures by May, and areas with very low incidence in tier 1. He said the UK was starting to enter a phase where a large proportion of the population were immune to the virus. He estimated that up to one-third of the population could have been infected, and that added to that number were the people who had received the Covid jab. He said the vaccine coverage among the over-70s was “better than I could have hoped for”. Ferguson cautioned that it would be “a bumpy road” and he would be “a fool to try and predict out six months”, he but said he believed the vaccines would start allowing for restrictions to be eased. However, he echoed other scientists in cautioning that social distancing measures must be relaxed slowly in order to prevent another surge in infections. “I’m hopeful it will be the final lockdown, so long as we are relatively cautious in coming out of this lockdown,” he said. “If we relax too quickly without seeing the effect of each stage of relaxation, we may do what we’ve done before and relax too much, see a surge in case numbers, and still need to tighten up measures again.” He said it was highly unlikely the virus would ever be eradicated and it would continue to cause hospital admissions and deaths, but that these could be driven to a much lower level – as with influenza – by immunisation, making it what he called a “manageable prospect”. Ferguson said it was his “fervent hope” that by this time next year the country would be “basically back to normal”, without any significant degree of the current controls in place, although it partly depended on what was going on in the rest of the world. There has been some confusion over when precisely Johnson will detail the roadmap for easing restrictions. Johnson and other ministers have variously committed to detail the plan on 22 February or during the week that follows. On Friday the Home Office minister Victoria Atkins told Sky News: “On 22 February the prime minister will make a statement to the House of Commons where he will set out our roadmap to ease lockdown.”"
2021-02-12T11:31:12Z,politics,Politics,Priti Patel describes Black Lives Matter protests as 'dreadful',"The home secretary, Priti Patel, has described the Black Lives Matter protests that swept the UK last year as “dreadful” and said she did not agree with the gesture of taking the knee. The protests, in which demonstrations took place in more than 260 towns and cities in June and July, were the largest anti-racism protests in Britain for decades. They were sparked by the death of George Floyd while in the custody of police in Minneapolis. Outrage grew at the fate suffered by Floyd, whose heart stopped on 25 May as a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, according to a medical examiner, with solidarity protests held across the world. As part of the demonstrations in the UK, statues of slave traders – including that of Edward Colston in Bristol – were toppled or removed, and a memorial to Sir Winston Churchill in central London was vandalised with the words “is a racist”. There has since been a public reckoning with Britain’s slavery and colonial past. Earlier this year, a Guardian investigation revealed that scores of tributes to slave traders, colonialists and racists had been taken down or were to be removed across the UK, with hundreds of others under review by local authorities and institutions. However, during a radio interview on LBC on Friday morning, Patel said she did not support the protests. Asked if she would be prepared to take the knee, she replied: “No I wouldn’t, and I would not have done at the time either. “There are other ways in which people can express their opinions, protesting in the way that people did last summer was not the right way at all … I didn’t support the protests. Those protests were dreadful.” She added: “We saw policing as well coming under a great deal of pressure from some of the protest. I don’t support protest and I also did not support the protests that were associated …” Interrupted, she sought to clarify that she was not criticising the right to protest but rather the “dreadful” action last year. Patel’s comments came after the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, accused the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, of overseeing “loony leftwing wheezes” following the creation of a landmark commission to improve diversity in the capital’s public spaces. Khan announced he would be forming the commission days after the statue of Colston, a 17th-century slave trader, was pulled down in Bristol. The commission for diversity in the public realm will review what makes up London’s public realm, discuss what legacies should be celebrated, and make a series of recommendations that will help to establish best practice, the London mayor’s office said. The commission is not being established to preside over the removal of statues, it added. • This article was amended on 16 February 2021 to add text clarifying that statues of slave traders had been “toppled or removed”, not just “toppled”."
2021-02-11T23:23:55Z,politics,Politics,Gove and Šefčovič reiterate commitment to NI protocol after crisis talks,"Michael Gove and the European commission’s vice-president have reiterated their “full commitment” to the Northern Ireland protocol following crisis talks in London. A joint statement said Gove and Maroš Šefčovič had a “frank but constructive discussion” on Thursday evening, in which they agreed to “spare no effort” in implementing solutions. They pledged “further joint engagement by the UK and the EU with business groups and civic society in Northern Ireland”. The two politicians agreed to convene the joint committee, which oversees implementation of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, no later than 24 February to provide “the necessary political steer”. The talks come amid mounting tensions over post-Brexit problems in Northern Ireland, and anger in EU capitals at UK demands for a rethink. In a letter to Gove late on Wednesday, Šefčovič ruled out major changes to the Brexit deal’s Northern Ireland protocol, saying the EU was not prepared even to consider any “flexibilities” until the UK fulfilled the obligations to which it had already signed up. Šefčovič detailed a series of what he called “shortcomings” in the UK’s observance of border arrangements in Northern Ireland under the protocol, which requires goods shipped from Britain to the region to meet strict EU customs rules. Measures to which Britain signed up as part of the agreement reached last December “urgently need to be fully and faithfully implemented” as a “prerequisite to assess whether any facilitation, as requested, is necessary or justified,” he wrote. The letter reflects anger in some EU capitals at what they see as British attempts to exploit controversy over the commission’s brief move to trigger article 16 of the protocol last month in an effort to prevent vaccine exports getting into the UK. The commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has apologised for the move, saying it was a mistake she deeply regretted, and the commission is working on mechanisms to ensure future EU legislation is double-checked for its impact on Northern Ireland. But there is resentment among several member states at Britain’s subsequent attempt to capitalise on the commission’s blunder by demanding a wholesale rethink of the protocol, which was designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. Ireland’s prime minister, Micheál Martin, called for the EU and UK to “dial down the rhetoric”. Martin said there were “elements the British government could sort out, but likewise on the European side I would say some member states need to cool it as well”. The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, also said on Thursday that both parties must be conscious of their responsibilities. “The difficulties on the island of Ireland are caused by Brexit, not by the protocol,” Barnier said. “The protocol is the solution.” Last week Boris Johnson accused the EU of appearing to “cast doubt” on the Good Friday agreement by triggering article 16, while Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, said the episode had “changed the political situation” and demanded fundamental changes to the protocol. EU diplomats have objected particularly strongly to the tone of a letter from Gove, who co-chairs the EU-UK joint committee on Northern Ireland with Šefčovič, to his European counterpart on 2 February, with one describing its tone as “extraordinary”. With freight arriving in Northern Ireland from Britain facing serious delays and disruption, Gove demanded a two-year postponement of the introduction of full checks on supermarket food, medicines and parcels until 2023.
He also called for an “urgent reset” of the other parts of the protocol, including a permanent reduction of bureaucratic barriers hindering the movement of pets, plants and food products to the region, through “political, not technical” solutions. “It’s clear the commission made a serious mistake on article 16,” another EU diplomat said. “But the British response is transparent and infuriating. It is using that mistake as an excuse to demand we tear up parts of an agreement it signed up to.” David Frost, the UK’s chief Brexit negotiator, told the Lords EU committee on Tuesday that a resolution to the increasingly strained relations required a “different spirit” from the EU, which he said was struggling to get used to a “genuinely independent actor in its neighbourhood”. But Šefčovič said in his reply to Gove that “blanket derogations” from EU rules on meat products and parcels “cannot be agreed beyond what the protocol foresees already”, while more flexibility on pets and plants would entail “the UK committing to align with the relevant EU rules”. The EU vice-president also said Britain was not complying with the terms of the protocol in a number of areas. Border control posts at ports in Northern Ireland were not yet fully operational, he said, while official controls were “currently not being performed in compliance with the withdrawal agreement protocol and EU rules”. There were “very few identity checks” on goods and “a very limited number of physical checks other than on live animals, fish and plants”, he said, while “non-compliant consignments” were being accepted even if destined for Ireland. Packages were not being monitored as required, goods were entering Northern Ireland “without being declared or without valid certificates”, and the UK had “not fulfilled its obligation” to allow the EU real-time access to key customs IT systems. • This article was amended on 11 February 2021 to clarify that the commission moved to trigger article 16 but backtracked before it was due to come into force."
2021-02-11T19:15:18Z,politics,Politics,Ministers to discuss 'vaccine passports' as patience urged over holidays,"Ministers are to discuss the development of “vaccine passports” for travel on Friday, after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, urged the public to be patient about making holiday plans. If the proposal gets the go-ahead, several Whitehall departments are expected to be involved in drawing up the system, which would form the UK’s contribution to what could become a global approach to proving who has been vaccinated. A government spokesperson said: “The UK government, like most nations, wants to open up international travel in a responsible safe and fair manner and we continue to be guided by the science. “We want to ensure there is an internationally recognised approach to enable travel and are working closely with international partners to do so.” Government insiders are keen to stress that the idea is at an early stage – and there is as yet no guarantee that foreign holidays will be a possibility in 2021. They also underline the fact that any certificate to prove someone has been vaccinated would not be intended for used domestically, for allowing access to venues such as pubs and restaurants, for example. Ministers will discuss the idea at a meeting of the Covid-O committee, the key decision-making forum for day-to-day management of the pandemic. A briefing paper for the meeting, leaked to SkyNews, said: “We should not set even speculative timelines on when this may change border measures.” Hancock insisted on Thursday it was still too early to be certain about what the summer holds. His cautious message came after a week of conflicting signals on whether travel restrictions and other Covid rules will be lifted in time to allow summer travel. The health secretary had previously pointed to his hopes for a “happy and free great British summer”, but on Wednesday the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, and the prime minister urged caution. Hancock told BBC Breakfast: “I know that people are yearning for certainty over whether they can have a summer holiday, but pandemics are difficult times and there is a lot of uncertainty, so I am afraid that people will have to be patient before we can get that certainty.” In Scotland, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, also echoed the uncertainty. She said: “Right now, today, I would say to people not to book foreign holidays, and I would say just be cautious about booking holidays even domestically. If you want to take the chance that it will be ok, that’s not for me to decide for you … but I can’t give you 100% guarantee that by the time we get to the date things will be OK … if you want to err on side of caution then hold off a little bit.”
Holidays are banned under the current lockdown, but the travel industry is desperate for rules to be relaxed by summer. As of next Monday, all arrivals from more than 30 high-risk countries will have to quarantine in hotels near their arrival airport for at least 10 days, at a cost of up to £1,750. The system appeared to be off to a shaky start on Thursday, with the booking website crashing and reports of few rooms available. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), the chopping and changing of rules over the last year has inflicted greater damage to the UK’s economy than has been seen in other European countries. In a statement on Thursday quoting data from Oxford Economics, it said the UK faced a GDP loss of 10% in 2020, while Germany, which imposed fewer travel barriers, would experience a loss of 5.3%. “We believe the impact of constantly shifting policies on testing, quarantines and the placing of countries in so-called high-risk red zones, will jeopardise the return of a sector which contributes nearly £200bn annually to the UK economy,” said the WTTC president and CEO, Gloria Guevara.
The government is under growing pressure from its own MPs to clearly set out plans for easing restrictions once the most vulnerable citizens are vaccinated. Steve Baker, the Conservative MP and deputy chair of the Covid delivery group, urged the government not to be swayed by pessimistic public pronouncements from scientists. Several experts have sounded warnings in recent days about the risks of reopening schools and the economy too rapidly. “Having a full public debate is essential at this time but I fear senior scientists are failing to recognise their power to spread despair and despondency,” Baker said. “Some seem to be floating untested hypotheses in the media. Doing so is not science. It is the death of science. Perhaps worse, it brings scientists squarely into the political domain, something we would I am sure all like to avoid.” He said Boris Johnson must stick to the 22 February date he has given in recent statements for announcing the “roadmap” out of lockdown. That date would allow schools the promised two weeks’ notice if they are to reopen on 8 March, as Johnson has said he hopes they will. In the next 10 days, Johnson, senior ministers and scientific advisers will be weighing up the latest data on how the vaccine rollout is progressing and what impact it is having on death rates, hospitalisations and the spread of the virus."
2021-02-11T18:21:09Z,politics,Politics,UK Covid: Keir Starmer and Nicola Sturgeon criticise government over 'too leaky' borders - as it happened,"The UK has recorded 678 further deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. There were 13,494 people who tested positive in the last 24 hours and 1,842 people were admitted to hospital since yesterday. More than 13.5 million people have had at least one vaccine dose as of 10 February."
2021-02-11T18:17:25Z,politics,Politics,MPs pass 'long overdue' bill for ministers' paid maternity leave ,"MPs have voted to give ministers formal paid maternity leave for the first time, hailed as an “important and long overdue change” as the government pledged to bring forward more sweeping maternity protections before the summer recess. However, the move to give the attorney general, Suella Braverman, six months’ paid leave drew accusations of double standards during the parliamentary debate, including over the omission of any reference to paternity leave and the failure to extend similar benefits to backbenchers. Some MPs also protested over the language in the bill, which refers to a person, rather than a woman, which minister Penny Mordaunt said was “not a policy decision around language”. Mordaunt said the bill put an end to the “wholly unacceptable” situation of a minister having to resign in order to take leave. Braverman is expecting her baby at the end of February. Giving her backing to the bill, Caroline Nokes, the Conservative chair of the women and equalities select committee, said it was a “mess” that the issues had not been resolved in a more considered matter. “What a mess that it is well into the 21st century before we have had to face this situation. And why oh why did it cross nobody’s mind that we might need to address this prior to it having the urgency it now does?” she said. “Is it really that unthinkable that a secretary of state or one of the law officers could become, heavens above, pregnant?” Nokes said the legislation does not go far enough as it fails to address adoption leave or shared parental leave, noting that she wanted reassurances that “swift” action would follow to deal with remaining issues. Two pregnant backbench MPs spoke in the debate raising the disparity. Labour MP Feryal Clark, who is due to give birth at the end of April, said she was “scared about taking informal maternity leave”. “I’m scared that it will be used against me politically, and most depressing of all, I’m scared that beneath the warm words of ‘good luck’ and ‘congratulations’ some members will take a dim view of my taking of maternity leave at all,” Clark said. Stella Creasy, who is pregnant with her second child, has said she will consider legal action unless similar benefits are extended to backbenchers. “I want to be clear with the government: they have made some commitments today, but like the Suffragettes said, this has got to be deeds, not words. “I am early on in my pregnancy, I shouldn’t have to reveal that, but I am doing that today to be very clear to pregnant women around this country that they will find champions in this place, that it is not enough that we only act for that small group of women at the top of our society. We must act for every woman to be able to have maternity leave.” Labour MP and mother of the house, Harriet Harman, said the bill should be an impetus to address low maternity pay. “The government have done the right thing by the attorney general and women cabinet ministers. Now they need to put right the completely wrong situation for the rest of the women in the country and what they face,” she said. “Statutory maternity pay is only £152 per week and at that it is less than half of what you would get on the national minimum wage – so her income is clobbered just when she needs to be spending more. Honestly, if men had babies, do we really think that maternity pay would be so insultingly low? Not a chance.” Some MPs, including Labour’s Tonia Antoniazzi, the Conservatives Sir Edward Leigh and the SNP’s Joanna Cherry, said they did not agree with the language in the bill. Antoniazzi said: “The fact that it refers to a person who is pregnant and doesn’t mention ‘woman’, ‘women’, ‘she’ at any point is totally at odds with all other maternity rights and protection legislation.” Mordaunt, the paymaster general, said it had been a “particular drafting issue” but said: “I do understand how offensive the word ‘person’ or ‘persons’ can be in this context and I hope that we can make some changes, if not to the legislation, but to the explanatory notes.” The ministerial and other maternity allowances bill cleared the House of Commons after receiving an unopposed third reading. It will now undergo further scrutiny in the House of Lords."
2021-02-11T18:14:31Z,politics,Politics,Spectator wins challenge to court order in Alex Salmond case,"The Spectator has won a legal action that could clear the way for Alex Salmond to give evidence to Holyrood about a botched Scottish government inquiry into allegations of sexual misconduct against him. A senior Scottish judge, Lady Dorrian, has agreed to amend a court order she imposed on what could be reported about Salmond’s criminal trial on 14 counts of alleged sexual assault, including an attempted rape, of which he was acquitted last year. The magazine and its publisher, Andrew Neil, had challenged her original order, arguing that it was too loosely worded and prevented journalists and Holyrood from reporting allegations made by Salmond about the government and its investigation. Dorrian accepted that her order could be tightened up, although in a different form to that originally sought by the Spectator. She issued an oral ruling on Thursday after a two-hour hearing, confirming that she would change it. The Scottish parliament confirmed its committee investigating the botched government inquiry would meet in emergency session at 2pm on Friday to consider the implication of the ruling. Soon after Dorrian’s ruling, Salmond’s lawyers, Levy McRae, who were also instructed by the Spectator in this legal action, wrote to the committee to say he is willing to give evidence. The firm has told MSPs they believe Dorrian’s order should clear the way for the parliament to publish Salmond’s evidence, with suitable redactions. On Tuesday, the committee narrowly voted against publishing Salmond’s submission for legal reasons linked to Dorrian’s original court order, largely because it had been published by the Spectator, with small redactions. Salmond then refused to give evidence to the committee, having been invited to do so on Tuesday this week, claiming he would be unable to properly make his case that figures within the Scottish National party and close to the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, had conspired against him. The Spectator also argued Dorrian’s order breached article 10 of the European convention on human rights. It believes a submission to the committee by Geoff Aberdein, Salmond’s former chief of staff, should also be published to the extent that it does not breach the amended order. The Scottish parliament’s lawyers, who watched the hearing, will now have to decide whether Dorrian’s ruling changes their advice to the committee on publishing the Salmond and Aberdein submissions, probably in highly redacted form. However, the committee is running out of time. It is due to interview Sturgeon under oath on Tuesday, and has only six weeks to finish its inquiry and then write and publish its report before Holyrood is suspended for May’s parliamentary election. The Spectator used the same lawyers retained by Salmond in its challenge, from the law firm Levy McRae, which has acted for Salmond during his civil action against the government in 2018, his criminal trial in 2019 and the Holyrood inquiry. Ronnie Clancy QC, Salmond’s advocate in his civil action in 2018, acted for the Spectator in Thursday’s court hearing, while Duncan Hamilton, an advocate and close friend of Salmond’s, was Clancy’s junior. During Thursday’s hearing, Clancy argued that the original order had a chilling effect on the reporting of the Salmond controversy, and that it risked breaching the European convention on human rights and common law, which required courts to carefully limit any curbs on press freedom. He said the order had clearly influenced the Holyrood committee’s decisions and its legal advice. “It’s my submission that it is very much in the public interest that the terms and effect of the order be revisited to clarify its effects on the committee’s inquiry,” he said. “It’s self-evident that a basic principle of law is that if you’re imposing orders which have criminal sanctions, it’s very important that the person who might be at the receiving end of that order has a very clear idea of how they’re going to get into trouble by taking a certain course of action.” Alec Prentice QC, acting for the Crown Office, Scotland’s prosecution service, said it had no objection to Dorrian’s revisions. Lawyers for the Spectator, Salmond and the Scottish parliament will pore over Dorrian’s detailed ruling, which is due to be published on Monday."
2021-02-11T18:09:16Z,politics,Politics,Businesses offered £20m Brexit fund after border trade disruption,"Small British businesses are being offered access to a £20m Brexit support fund from the government to help them with new trade rules following border disruption in the first few weeks since the UK left the EU. In response to mounting criticism from business leaders over the impact of the new arrangements, the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, said the funding would help businesses adapt to the changes. Traders will be able to apply for a grant of up to £2,000 each to pay for practical support for importing and exporting. The grants will also help companies prepare for additional import controls that are due to come into force from April and July.
“The government has listened carefully to the issues raised by the business community through the Brexit business taskforce, and that’s why we are bringing forward this financial support to help small businesses adapt to the changes to our trading relationship with the EU,” Gove said. Suggesting that businesses could now “seize new opportunities available to a fully independent, global-trading United Kingdom,” he said the targeted funding would help small businesses get more of the practical support they need to adjust to the new processes, and prepare for further checks on EU trade. Additional UK import controls will be introduced in April and July as part of a staged approach to the changing post-Brexit rules. The move comes days after the government sought to defend its record on Brexit after freight industry leaders claimed exports to the EU nosedived in January, following the end of the transition period on 31 December. Half of British exporters to the EU are facing difficulties and higher costs for import and export activities due to mounting red tape and border disruption, according to a survey from the British Chambers of Commerce published on Thursday. The government said overall freight flows between Great Britain and the EU in the last week had reached 98% compared with the same time last year, that there was no disruption at ports, and that compliance with the new rules remained high. Official trade figures for January are due to be published next month. Business leaders broadly welcomed the new support fund, but warned that further action was required to address bottlenecks and red tape that still remain and which are adding substantial costs to doing business. Stephen Phipson, the CEO of Make UK, the manufacturers’ organisation, said: “These are more than teething troubles which, if not addressed, threaten to become permanent structural barriers.”"
2021-02-11T18:00:20Z,politics,Politics,UK government's own climate laws may halt roadbuilding plans ,"The first sign that the government was in serious trouble over the long-mooted expansion of Heathrow airport came in a little-noticed letter from the Department for Transport in May 2019. In it, a government official acknowledged for the first time that the UK’s obligations under the Paris agreement, and its carbon budgets, would have to be taken into account in infrastructure planning decisions. At that point the government had publicly vowed to press ahead with the airport expansion following a parliamentary vote in favour in June 2018. But the letter, to the green campaign group Plan B, showed its decision was vulnerable, as the official wrote: “I can confirm that the department will carefully consider this request [for a review of the airports national policy statement]. As well as giving careful consideration to the net zero report and the declaration of environment and climate emergency … it may be necessary to consider the Committee on Climate Change’s recommended policy approach for aviation … and any relevant decisions taken by the government in the coming months as a result.” There were many further twists in the Heathrow story, but the central point that major infrastructure planning decisions need to take account of the UK’s legally binding obligations on the climate has been affirmed. Campaigners now want to use the same argument to force a review of the government’s £27bn roadbuilding scheme, which they say would bust the UK’s carbon target and is incompatible with the obligation to reach net zero emissions by 2050, enshrined in law in June 2019. Mike Childs, the head of science at Friends of the Earth, said: “We need to see a conclusive end to the damaging fixation with new fossil fuel-heavy projects. It’s hypocritical having a government that is happy to talk the talk on climate change, but then spends billions of pounds on roads.” The power of judicial review has been essential in holding ministers to account when their standing legal obligations conflict with their current whims. But it is under threat from this government. Smarting after the supreme court ruled his prorogation of parliament over Brexit illegal, Boris Johnson included a pledge to change legal oversight of the executive in the Tory manifesto at the last general election. The UK’s unwritten constitution means governments have little but goodwill and tradition to restrain them in curbing the power of judges, and the government enjoys an 80-seat majority. When the pandemic finally wanes, ministers may have more appetite for such far-reaching changes. For the roads campaigners, it is essential to seek an early judgment before concrete is poured on the new schemes. Pledges to build new roads were an old staple of governments wishing to demonstrate their business-friendly credentials through infrastructure that would supposedly create jobs and encourage enterprise, and this seems to be the motivation behind this government’s plans. Yet ministers seem to have little interest in other projects that have a better chance of creating jobs and improving the economy, while reducing emissions, from railway expansion to home insulation. On Wednesday, the government admitted that its green homes grant scheme – the central plank of Boris Johnson’s pledge to “build back better” – would have most of its £2bn funding withdrawn. Applicants for the grants have been forced to wait months for their money, with the result that most of the £2bn government spending earmarked for the scheme remains unspent. Yet that unspent funding will not be rolled over after March, meaning the scheme is essentially over before it has really begun. Looked at in the light of the pandemic, the roadbuilding scheme also appears increasingly questionable. Hundreds of miles of new motorway may end up being less essential to the way people really want to work in the future than the build-out of broadband connectivity and mobile phone coverage in rural areas. That would also create “shovel-ready” green jobs around the country and equip the UK for a low-carbon and digital future. But that seems as far away as ever."
2021-02-11T17:18:30Z,politics,Politics,"You can’t fault Matt Hancock’s work ethic, just everything else | John Crace","You can’t fault Matt Hancock’s work ethic. While most of his cabinet colleagues have used the pandemic as an excuse to slide beneath the radar, the health secretary has been front of stage almost every day. Whether it’s been taking Downing Street press conferences, giving coronavirus updates to the Commons, threatening to bang up serial liars for 10 years – Boris Johnson and Michael Gove need to watch out – or freelancing as a spokesperson for tourism in the south-west of England, Hancock has been your man. But it turns out that even that workload isn’t enough to keep him fully occupied, as on Thursday he was back in parliament to outline his plans to completely reorganise the NHS. Perhaps anticipating what was in store, only three backbenchers were in the chamber to hear the statement, but Matt was profoundly unbothered by the lack of an audience. His eyes, which for so long have looked like hollow sockets, regained their sparkle because he was back in his element, living his best life as a junior account executive in a management consultancy. KPMG’s loss has been parliament’s gain. Or possibly vice versa. Hancock shook with excitement as he began talking in tongues. No opportunity to talk corporate bollocks was passed up as he greedily took the credit for a restructuring that he said would “support and challenge” something or other and “reduce bureaucracy and improve accountability via the fulcrum of integrated care systems”. AKA undoing some of the mess caused by a previous Tory government’s attempts to reorganise the NHS back in 2010. Trying to unfuck previous fuck-ups is an increasingly popular Westminster pastime. Some might say that the middle of a pandemic was not really the time to embark on wholesale changes to the NHS, Matt acknowledged. But he begged to differ. What better time could there be than when hospitals were overstretched and staff were exhausted? Doctors and nurses would find the excitement of the reorganisation a welcome distraction from their workload; a break from the monotony of having to deal with record patient levels. The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, didn’t sound wholly convinced. He rather imagined that implementing radical changes during the current crisis might be the one thing too much for most NHS workers. Besides which there might yet be lessons we needed to learn from a crisis that had killed more than 100,000 people and led to 200,000 appointments being delayed for 12 months that had not yet been anticipated. So, just maybe, it was better to put the thing on hold for a few months and see where we were in the summer. As for the rest of it, he would withhold judgment for now; partly because nothing could be as bad as the “competitive tendering” current system brought in 10 years ago, but mostly because – much like the rest of us – he didn’t fully understand exactly what Hancock intended to do. He’d reserve comment until the health secretary fleshed out his proposals in plain English. “I’m taking that as cautious support,” Hancock exclaimed excitedly, almost restored to his old Tiggerish self, as he mistook a noncommittal response for something more enthusiastic. Ashworth scratched his head and looked understandably confused. The chair of the health select committee, Jeremy Hunt, who was nursing a broken arm sustained while out running that morning, described the proposed restructuring as “brave”. As in, potentially foolhardy. During his own stint as health secretary, he’d never dared to suggest such changes. However much they may have been needed. The department of health was littered with the bodies of ministers who had come unstuck trying to reorganise the NHS. As so much of what he said was vague to the point of incomprehensibility – “empowering frontline staff”, “embedding accountability in integrated care systems”, etc – Hancock was able to survive the session almost unscathed. Even though he never did get round to explaining how social care would be integrated with healthcare when the government had still to announce its social care plan. But that was a minor issue. As was the fact that the video link to Labour’s Imran Hussain went down before the MP had managed to ask his question: Hancock merely chose to answer the question he imagined would have been asked. In Mattworld, everything was going just great. His plan was a surefire success that was all but up and running already and it was only a matter of time before he was acknowledged as the saviour of the NHS. Blessed are the management consultants, for they shall inherit the Earth."
2021-02-11T15:34:57Z,politics,Politics,Labour to delay publication of antisemitism inquiry findings,"Labour is to indefinitely delay publication of the findings of a highly charged inquiry into a leaked report on antisemitism and internal party culture under Jeremy Corbyn, amid concern it could prejudice an investigation by the information commissioner. In a leaked letter seen by the Guardian, the chair of the inquiry, Martin Forde QC, told Labour’s general secretary, David Evans, that the seriousness of the investigation meant the inquiry findings could not be published. An unredacted report on Labour’s handling of antisemitism claims, leaked in April last year, reignited the row within the party over its handling of disciplinary cases and led to party members’ suspension. The report included hundreds of private WhatsApp messages from named staff members, many of them expressing hostility towards Corbyn or his close allies and bemoaning Labour’s better-than-expected performance at the 2017 general election. Labour’s then general secretary, Jennie Formby, reported the leak to the Information Commissioner’s Office to look into potential security breaches. After Keir Starmer’s election as party leader, he ordered an independent inquiry under Forde. The Guardian understands that the ICO had also received complaints not only about the original leak of the private messages but also the passing of the private messages to the Forde inquiry, which some of the subjects have claimed was also a breach of data protection laws. However party sources said it was only the original leak which is subject to investigation. In his letter, which was read out to the party’s national executive committee (NEC) on Thursday, Forde said his report could only be published after the ICO had concluded its investigations, which could include looking at whether criminal acts were committed. The Guardian understands that senior Labour figures have expressed concern at the seriousness of the ICO’s inquiries. Labour is already subject to legal proceedings by numerous staff members named in the report with the first stage of the court hearings set to begin in two weeks. Forde wrote in his letter that the panel had been “working extremely hard to deliver our report in the early part of this year”, but he added: “We have recently been made aware, however, that as a result of those potential breaches, the ICO has indicated it is making inquiries, pursuant to its statutory duties. “Having regard to the possible direction and outcome of those inquiries, we are therefore concerned that the publication of our report could prejudice those inquiries and our ability ultimately to deliver our final report to the NEC.” Forde said he had considered whether any aspect of the report could be published and concluded that it could not. “We consider there is a real risk that even partial disclosure of our report and findings could have the potential to prejudice the ICO’s work. As soon as its inquiries are completed, and resolved, we will provide a report,” he said. He hit out at “ill-informed speculation as to the perceived delays” and said the inquiry had considered more than 1,000 submissions from party members and affiliates. “Any suggestion that I or my panel have been subject to pressure from the party regarding the delivery, content and conclusions of our report is entirely refuted. In fact, the party and its officers have not sought to influence its content in any way,” he wrote. • This article was amended on 12 February 2021. After publication, Labour party sources stated that the ICO investigation covered only the initial leak of private messages, and not the passing of those messages to the Forde inquiry. Text has been changed to reflect this."
2021-02-11T15:25:16Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit cost will be four times greater for UK than EU, Brussels forecasts","The economic blow dealt by Brexit will be four times greater in the UK than the EU, according to the latest forecasts by Brussels. A month into the new relationship, the European commission said the UK’s exit on the terms agreed by Boris Johnson’s government would generate a loss in gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of 2022 of about 2.25% in the UK compared with continued membership. In contrast, the hit for the EU is estimated to be about 0.5% over the same period. Equivalent to lost economic output worth more than £40bn over two years, the commission said that although worse damage had been avoided thanks to the 11th-hour trade deal signed in December, substantial barriers to trade still remained and would come with a heavier cost for Britain. “While the FTA [free trade agreement] improves the situation as compared to an outcome with no trade agreement between the EU and the UK, it cannot come close to matching the benefits of the trading relations provided by EU membership,” the commission said in its winter economic forecast. Most mainstream economists have already forecast that Brexit will deliver a bigger hit to the UK economy than to the EU. However, the figures compiled by the commission mark the first official EU estimates made since the deal was agreed. The forecast comes as the UK government comes under mounting pressure over delays to cross-border trade after a month of the new rules, with business groups warning that further disruption is expected as more new border checks come into force later this spring. The deal agreed between London and Brussels included maintaining zero-tariffs – taxes on the sale of goods across borders – between the UK and the EU. However, businesses have faced additional costs and delays from new paperwork, customs checks and confusion over the new system. The commission said the “trade shock” from these so-called non-tariff barriers amounted to the equivalent of a tax on imports worth 10.9% for the EU and 8.5% for the UK. It said there was a bigger impact on growth for countries with a higher share of goods trade with the EU – such as Ireland – and that the lack of a deal on services – which form 80% of the UK economy – would hurt the UK, as well as EU nations where doing service-sector business with Britain was more important. However, it said the last-minute trade deal helped to reduce the negative effect by about a third for the EU and a quarter for the UK compared with a no-deal scenario and reverting to World Trade Organization terms.
The winter 2021 economic forecast projects that the EU economy will grow by 3.7% in 2021 and 3.9% in 2022 as the impact of tougher lockdown measures at the start of 2021 give way to a vaccine-fuelled recovery later in the year. It said the EU economy should return to pre-pandemic levels in 2022, earlier than previously thought, but added that it would take longer for some nations than others. The economies of Italy and Spain are not expected to return to pre-crisis levels until later than 2022, as countries with a higher dependence on tourism largely in southern Europe suffer from a slower return of international travel. The Bank of England forecasts growth of 5% in the UK in 2021 and 7.25% in 2022, with GDP returning to pre-Covid levels towards the end of the yearThis, it said, would be faster than the EU thanks to better progress in administering the Covid vaccine."
2021-02-11T14:06:14Z,politics,Politics,NHS and social care blueprint: key points,"Every part of England to be covered by an integrated care system (ICS), incorporating local NHS bodies, local government and other organisations, together tasked with supporting integration of health and social care. Enhanced “powers of direction” for the government over a newly merged body comprising NHS England and NHS Improvement.
A recognition that competition is not the only way of driving service improvement, the reduction of bureaucracy on commissioners and providers, and elimination of the need for competitive tendering where it adds limited or no value. A requirement for health and adult social care organisations to share anonymised information where such sharing would benefit the health and social care system. Introduction of powers for the health and social care secretary to require data from all registered adult social care providers about all services they provide, whether funded by local authorities or privately by individuals. A new duty for the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to assess local authorities’ delivery of adult social care services, and a power for the secretary of state to intervene where, following assessment under the new CQC duty, it is considered that a local authority is failing to meet their responsibilities. Powers enabling the health and social care secretary to make emergency payments directly to all social care providers when needed to prevent instability in care. Increasing collaboration between ICSs and with NHS England on commissioning to make decisions, pool funds and facilitate services to be arranged for their combined populations. Power to impose capital spending limits on foundation trusts, which have greater autonomy that non-foundation trusts, where necessary as a safeguard for financial sustainability. Establishment of a statutory medical examiner system within the NHS for the purpose of scrutinising all deaths that do not involve a coroner, to increase transparency for the bereaved. Tackling obesity by conveying a new power on ministers to alter certain food labelling requirements, in addition to already announced further restrictions on the advertising of high fat, salt and sugar foods including before the 9pm watershed. Responsibility for the process of introducing fluoridation of water to be moved from local authorities to central government. Bringing forward measures to enable the health and social care secretary to set requirements in relation to hospital food. Allowing the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to develop and maintain publicly funded and operated medicine registries in order to provide patients and prescribers, as well as regulators and the NHS, with the information they need to make evidence-based decisions. Powers to implement comprehensive reciprocal healthcare agreements with countries outside the EEA and Switzerland to support the health of citizens when they travel abroad, subject to bilateral agreements. Remove the Competition and Markets Authority’s function to review mergers involving NHS foundation trusts, placing oversight in the hands of NHS England. Allowing the secretary of state to intervene at any point of a reconfiguration process – for example, the closure of several stroke units being replaced with a single centralised hyper-acute unit. At present the secretary of state can only intervene in reconfigurations after a local authority referral. A duty for the health and social care secretary to publish a document once every five years setting out roles and responsibilities for workforce planning and supply in England."
2021-02-11T14:06:14Z,politics,Politics,No 10 says all children can use playgrounds to exercise ,"Children can use playgrounds for exercise but not for socialising, Downing Street has said, as the government sought to defuse an angry row after it appeared to suggest rules on children playing outdoors were stricter than those for adults exercising. The controversy arose after a statement from the Cabinet Office suggested a child should not meet another for exercise and that they should use playgrounds only if they did not have a private garden.Adults are allowed to meet one other person outdoors for daily exercise. The prime minister’s spokesperson sought to defuse the row, saying it was acceptable for children to play outside, including in playgrounds, even if they had a garden at home. “Going to the park with the kids is not only allowed but perfectly reasonable,” he said. “We have been clear that exercise is allowed under the national restrictions. That continues to be the case, and the reason we ensured playgrounds stayed open was to ensure that children continued to use them for exercise purposes.” Asked whether the rules were different for families who have gardens, he said: “It is reasonable for any families to take their children to the park and to use playgrounds. As we’ve said previously, people should keep 2 metres apart if they’re in a circumstance where there are other people around, playgrounds being one example. They should keep that 2-metre rule. But again, we’re asking people not to go outside for socialising.” The row started after two young children were ordered home by police officers for building a snowman and told to play in their own garden – despite not having one. Downing Street said on Wednesday it was fine for children to play outside, after Tim Greany and his sons Bo, six, and Wren, eight, told BBC Newsround they had been “upset and annoyed” at the officers’ response to the playing near their home in London. There was confusion after the Cabinet Office issued a statement saying: “Playgrounds are primarily for use by children who do not have access to private outdoor space, and while parents, guardians or carers are allowed to take children to a playground for exercise, they must not socialise with other people while there.” Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the health select committee, said the advice was overly officious. “I’m in the ‘go harder and faster’ camp on Covid but it does seem over-zealous to allow two adults to exercise outdoors but not two children (who face much lower risk from Covid but probably greater mental health risks from lockdown),” he tweeted. The Tory MP Steve Baker, a key figure in the Covid Recovery Group of MPs who are demanding a swifter end to lockdown, told Sky News: “This unabashed vehemence in the expression of state power beyond the limits of the law would be comical if it were not for real. As the government succeeds in vaccinating vulnerable, incidents like this only underscore the need to reclaim our lives once and for all.”
Playing Out, a group that ordinarily encourages parents to organise play sessions for children on their streets, said it was asking the government to include play as essential exercise – one of the limited reasons people are allowed to leave the house under current legislation.
The health secretary, Matt Hancock, who was recently pictured playing rugby with his children in the park, told Sky News on Thursday that the same rules applied to children and adults. “The rules are really clear. Exercise outdoor with members of your own family or one other person one to one, that’s OK. “Of course going to the park with your kids to play rugby is not only allowed but perfectly reasonable and totally fine.”"
2021-02-10T22:24:01Z,politics,Politics,"Comply with Northern Ireland protocol before expecting changes, EU tells UK","The European commission has ruled out major changes to the Brexit deal’s Northern Ireland protocol, saying it would not even consider any flexibility unless the UK first meets its obligations under the pact in full. Hours before a major meeting in London on Thursday to resolve problems in the region, the commission’s vice-president, Maroš Šefčovič, said in a letter to Michael Gove that the protocol was “the only way” to protect the Good Friday agreement. He said it was “the solution agreed by the UK and the EU to the significant challenges” posed for the island of Ireland by Brexit, “designed to ensure clarity and predictability for people and businesses while minimising disruption”. The agreement represented “a balanced outcome” and was “a mutually agreed legal obligation”, Šefčovič said – but he warned that it required “full and faithful implementation” and listed several areas in which he said the UK was not complying. Boris Johnson last week accused the EU of appearing to “cast doubt” on the Good Friday agreement following the bloc’s short-lived decision to invoke article 16 of the protocol as part of an attempt to block Covid vaccines getting into the UK. The UK has asked for a two-year transition period on core elements to the protocol, including checks on supermarket food supplies from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, and demanded a “permanent solution” on chilled meats from GB. In a strongly worded letter this month, Gove also sought an extension of temporary arrangements and a “light touch solution” for parcel post, so consumers could continue to buy online from British stores, plus a common travel area for pets. The Cabinet Office minister insisted that the UK wanted “urgent resolution” of the problems, and that lengthy technical discussions would not be acceptable. “What is required is political, not technical solutions,” he said. But Šefčovič said in his reply that the UK’s full and urgent implementation of the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol was “a prerequisite to assess whether any other facilitation, as requested” was either necessary or justified, pointing to what he called “a number of current shortcomings”. He said border control posts at ports in Northern Ireland were “not yet fully operational”, while official controls were “currently not being performed in compliance with the withdrawal agreement protocol and EU rules”.
There were “very few identity checks” on goods and “a very limited number of physical checks other than on live animals, fish and plants”, he said, while all “non-compliant consignments” were being accepted, even if destined for Ireland. Packages were not being monitored as required by the 17 December agreement, he said, goods were entering Northern Ireland “without being declared or without valid certificates”, and the UK had “not yet fulfilled its obligation” to allow EU inspectors real-time access to key UK customs IT systems. Šefčovič said he was “convinced that all of these are teething problems, for which we should be able to find swift solutions”, but insisted that “blanket derogations” from EU rules on meat products and parcels “cannot be agreed beyond what the protocol foresees already”. A common travel area for pets and shipments of seed potatoes and other plant products from Britain to Northern Ireland would entail “the UK committing to align with the relevant EU rules”. A UK government spokesperson said it was “disappointing” that the commission had “failed to acknowledge the shock and anger felt right across the community in Northern Ireland from its decision to trigger article 16, and the need to take urgent steps to restore confidence as a result”. “The chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster [Gove] will underline the need for such action and political leadership in this regard when meeting with vice-president Šefčovič in London tomorrow,” the spokesperson added."
2021-02-10T19:15:32Z,politics,Politics,Johnson’s bluff and bluster leave Starmer boxing in the dark,"Where’s that 10-year prison sentence when you need it? Too many more prime minister’s questions like this and everyone will be making false claims on their arrival documents in the hope of getting sent down. And begging for no parole and a cell with no TV. There again, it might just be easier and cheaper to bang up Boris Johnson instead. After all, Boris and the truth have seldom even been on nodding terms with one another, so it wouldn’t be too hard for parliament to come up with some new law he has broken. There was a brief four-month period after Keir Starmer became Labour leader when PMQs felt animated. Relevant even, with Starmer time and again getting under Johnson’s skin. Since then, the balance of power has shifted somewhat. Not so much that Keir’s questions have become any less coherent; rather that Boris has managed to nullify them with a mixture of bluff and bluster so that no one really cares that much any more. Johnson has shamelessly managed to lower people’s expectations to the point where everyone would be astonished if he were to give a straight answer to a straight question. He has become the overlord of political anti-matter. This week was yet another case in point. A low-key affair from which almost no one would remember that Starmer had got slightly the better of the exchanges because most would have zoned out midway through. Johnson likes to think of himself as an enthusiast – someone who makes things happen through force of personality – but torpor is his secret weapon. Somehow the Labour leader needs to find a way of not allowing himself to be dragged down to Johnson’s level. Things got slightly more lively when Starmer reminded MPs that it had been Johnson who had said, “Fuck business”, had always written two opposing columns, had nominated Donald Trump for a Nobel prize and had given Dominic Cummings a pay rise. Not all of which was completely accurate, but Starmer was counting on Boris not to remember precisely what he had and hadn’t done. The Labour leader then moved on to border security. A report showed there were 33 countries that had stronger measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. “We are among the toughest,” Johnson insisted, momentarily forgetting that none of the restrictions announced by Matt Hancock the day before would come in force until next week. And why, if the measures were necessarily so draconian, had it taken the government nearly a year to put them in place. Surely a crime worthy of a 10-year stretch should have been made into law before more than 100,000 people had died? Boris closed with a trademark rant. This time about how some Labour ministers were viewing the pandemic as a “great opportunity”. It seemed to have slipped his mind that he had said much the same at last year’s online Tory party conference. Nice to know the country is doing its bit to further people’s political careers. Still, why let memory get in the way of a good soundbite? One possible way of improving PMQs presented itself at the Downing Street press conference later in the afternoon. And that was to make sure that Boris is not allowed out in public unless he is within 2 metres of Patrick Vallance, as the chief scientific adviser appears to be the father Johnson clearly wanted to have had. When Boris is around Vallance, he can more or less pass himself off as an adult. He stands a bit straighter, he brushes his hair, but most of all he sounds more honest and realistic. Not that Johnson really had much to say, other than to ask the two million people in the top four tiers who have yet to be vaccinated to come forward, but he managed to do so in a way that sounded more or less sincere. There was also some unexpected humility when he was asked about whether the improving infection rates might lead to an easing in the lockdown restrictions sooner rather than later. The Boris of old would have just yelled, “hell, yeah” but the new, more grown up Boris, looked across at Daddy Vallance and replied that it was still far too early to ease up. Any talk of summer holidays would have to wait for at least a fortnight and probably longer. Old habits die hard, mind, and Boris became noticeably more hesitant when asked about newly released data that showed the government had last year ignored all the scientific advice aimed at preventing a worst case scenario. “We get a lot of different advice, don’t we Daddy?” he said furtively, while not getting round to explaining why he had allowed his natural enthusiasm to blank out the critical guidance on schools, going back to work and Christmas gatherings. For a brief second or two, what could have been a look of contrition crossed his face. Maybe it’s just begun to dawn on him that his poor decisions have cost thousands of lives. But that was quite enough reality for one day. Hancock can spin out these briefings for the best part of an hour, but Johnson got this one done and dusted in just 30 minutes. Being a near grownup was awfully hard work and Boris needed to put his feet up for the day. Baby steps and all that."
2021-02-10T18:31:08Z,politics,Politics,UK Covid: Boris Johnson says 'great strides' made with vaccinations but many are yet to be reached – as it happened,"Boris Johnson has appealed to two million people in the top four priority groups for vaccination to volunteer for the jab this week. It was particularly important for social care workers, he said, in a hint that ministers are concerned that some of them are intentionally refusing the vaccine. The government is committed to offering 15 million people in the four groups - care home residents, frontline health and social care workers and all over-70s - a first dose of the vaccine before Monday 15 February. Speaking at a press conference at No 10, Johnson said 13 million people had already been vaccinated. But he went on: But that still leaves nearly 2 million people â€“ a population roughly twice the size of Birmingham â€“ that we still hope to reach. And there are people across the country who for one reason or another havenâ€™t yet taken up their offer. So now is the moment to do it, wherever you are â€“ you wonâ€™t be more than about 10 miles away from a vaccination centre. So, go online, or get someone to help you or simply pick up the phone and call 119. And let me appeal to the fantastic social care workers we all rely on to look after our relatives, our parents and grandparents. If you have not received a letter, please contact your employer and fix it up. Sir Patrick Vallance, the governmentâ€™s chief scientific adviser, and Johnson both stressed the importance of adopting a cautious approach to lifting lockdown. Speaking at the news conference, Vallance said: Itâ€™s worth remembering that even with very high vaccine uptake, and itâ€™s great to see so many people have come forward and been vaccinated, thereâ€™s still a large number of people who arenâ€™t vaccinated. And there will be a significant number of people in high risk groups who arenâ€™t yet vaccinated, because they either havenâ€™t had an opportunity to, they canâ€™t take it for some other reason or they havenâ€™t come forward. And those people remain at risk. And so itâ€™s important that we go cautiously in opening up in order to be able to measure the effects. And one of the things thatâ€™s really crucial in this is to get enough information to know the trajectory weâ€™re on and not jump ahead of it, because weâ€™ve very high levels and that could take off very quickly. So I think caution is important as we go into opening things up, and measuring is important, and data is whatâ€™s going to be important. The virus isnâ€™t going to be particularly interested in dates. Johnson, who last year was frequently criticised for being over-optimistic about the prospects of containing Covid, also backed a cautious approach. He said that although he would like to be able to say there was evidence that the vaccination programme is already starting to have an impact, he had not seen that data yet. Johnson said people should be â€œa little bit more patientâ€� with regard to planning a summer holiday. But he refused to go as far as Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, who said this morning it was wrong for people to be booking holidays now for the summer, either abroad or in the UK. Asked if he agreed with Shapps, Johnson told the press conference. Iâ€™m afraid it is just too early for people to be certain about what we will be able to do this summer. We hope to be able to say more in the week of the 22nd. I understand why people want to make plans now but weâ€™re just going to have to be a little bit more patient. No 10 has revealed that MPs will not get a vote on the plan to threaten people with up to 10 years in jail if they lie about visiting a â€œred listâ€� country with a high Covid risk, because the penalties will apply under an act that is already law. (See 2.31pm.) Two former Conservative attorneys general and backbench MPs have branded proposed sentences as disproportionate and an abuse of power. And Sir Jonathan Jones, a former head of the government legal department, said this about the plan on Twitter.
Pharmacists in England are considering strike action unless the Treasury writes off a Â£370m debt from a support package awarded during the pandemic, which saw many chemists help deliver vaccines. The government is facing a backlash from its own MPs after announcing a Â£3.5bn fund to fix dangerous cladding on high-rise buildings in England, with the offer of loans to leaseholders to fix similar problems in shorter buildings. The head of the civil service has been urged to investigate the appointment of a former Conservative MP and campaign manager for Boris Johnson as head of the Office for Students, with Labour calling the move â€œanother example of cronyismâ€�. As Peter Walker reports, James Wharton, who was an MP from 2010 to 2017 and is now a Conservative peer, was appointed to head the independent regulator of higher education in England despite having no experience of the sector.

2021-02-10T17:10:21Z,politics,Politics,No 10 defends taxpayer-funded photos of PM's dog playing in snow,"Downing Street has defended the use of a taxpayer-funded photographer to take pictures of the prime minister’s dog, Dilyn, frolicking in the snow, saying their role is to document the work of the government. A series of photos of Dilyn appeared on No 10’s Flickr account, alongside pictures of Priti Patel visiting a vaccination centre and Boris Johnson preparing for prime minister’s questions. Asked whether taking snaps of the dog was an appropriate use of taxpayers’ money, the prime minister’s spokesperson said: “These photographers document the work of government, as well as the work inside No 10.” He added that the photographer was “a cross-government resource” who would “support other government departments in their work, and other cabinet ministers and ministers in the work they’re undertaking”. Responding to the suggestion the dog was part of the government, a Labour source said: “The government has made such a dog’s dinner of issues from the border response to kids’ education. Dilyn would be a marked improvement and probably waste less taxpayers’ cash.” The spokesperson confirmed Johnson had three photographers on the government payroll: his special adviser and longtime photographer, Andy Parsons; a Ministry of Defence photographer on secondment in Downing Street; and a new recruit. The government’s annual report on special advisers revealed that Parsons, who took a posed shot of Johnson signing his resignation letter when he left Theresa May’s cabinet, works part-time on a pay rate equivalent to a full-time salary of £100,000 a year. Johnson’s spokesman said the carefully selected photos were made available for free. “We make these pictures available for editorial use, not just domestically but internationally as well.” In October, the Cabinet Office advertised for a photographer to “promote the work of ministers and the wider government visually”. The ad for the £60,000 a year post said: “No two days will ever be the same in this role. One day you may accompany a cabinet minister on an international visit, working closely [with] press officers across Whitehall to deliver a series of coordinated announcements, and the next you will be working in the Cabinet Office producing innovative visual content.”"
2021-02-10T16:44:42Z,politics,Politics,Spectator asks judge to allow fuller release of Alex Salmond claims,"The Spectator magazine has launched a court action in an attempt to publish more details about Alex Salmond’s allegations that former Scottish National party colleagues conspired against him. The magazine will ask Lady Dorrian, Scotland’s second-most senior judge, on Thursday to amend a court order she imposed during Salmond’s trial last year on 14 counts of sexual assault and an attempted rape, where the former first minister was acquitted of all charges. Their legal action came to light as Nicola Sturgeon, Salmond’s successor as SNP leader, clashed with Conservative and Labour leaders over her private meetings with Salmond where they discussed harassment claims against him. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, said Sturgeon was clearly in breach of the ministerial code by failing to notify civil servants she was meeting Salmond. Sturgeon’s written evidence about those meetings “utterly contradicted” what she had first told parliament about them, Davidson said. She and Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s acting leader, said Sturgeon should quit if she was found to have broken the ministerial code. “We have failed women, taxpayers’ money and a cover-up at the heart of government, and this whole affair stinks to high heaven,” Davidson said. “Someone should take responsibility for these failings. Shouldn’t it be you, first minister?” Questioned by Baillie during first minister’s questions, Sturgeon refused three times to confirm she would resign if found to have breached the ministerial code. She insisted she had acted honourably throughout the process. “All along I was determined I would do nothing to intervene in, or compromise the confidentiality and the independence and integrity of, a process that was kicked off because women – whose voice frankly has been too often lost in this whole process – because women came forward with complaints,” she told MSPs. It is thought the Spectator wants to publish more details about Salmond’s submission to a long-running Holyrood investigation on the Scottish government’s botched internal inquiry into allegations he sexually harassed two female officials. The Holyrood committee is in crisis after a deep split on Tuesday over how to handle Salmond’s submission. After a tense four-hour meeting, the committee voted five to four against releasing Salmond’s written statement. There are suggestions the magazine, published by the veteran editor and broadcaster Andrew Neil, also wants to publish a submission to the Holyrood inquiry from Salmond’s former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein. The committee has been told by the parliament’s lawyers it cannot publish Aberdein’s submission for legal reasons. It is understood the Spectator will argue there is a strong public interest in disclosure under article 10 of the European convention on human rights, given the significance of Salmond’s allegations about Sturgeon’s government and party. Baillie, a committee member who voted to publish Salmond’s document in heavily redacted form, said the Spectator’s legal action could prove critical to the committee’s investigation. Salmond refused his second witness date on Tuesday this week after claiming it was too legally difficult for him to appear if the committee was unable to refer to his submission. He had also asked for an indemnity against prosecution in case he gave out legally-restricted information; the parliament said it was impossible to give him that assurance. The standoff has led to speculation he will refuse to give evidence to the committee. With time quickly running out before Holyrood is dissolved in time for May’s Scottish elections, MSPs on the committee believe their inquiry is on the brink of collapse. Baillie said that if the court ruled in the Spectator’s favour, her committee should hold an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss its ramifications for their investigation. “The credibility of the committee and its work hangs in the balance. If the Spectator’s legal challenge is successful, then the committee must seize the opportunity to question Mr Salmond,” she said."
2021-02-10T14:31:42Z,politics,Politics,JP Morgan hires Chuka Umunna for senior sustainability role,"The former high-profile Labour politician Chuka Umunna has been hired by the US bank JP Morgan to lead its European environmental, social and governance (ESG) work. Umunna, 42, who was an employment lawyer before becoming a Labour MP in 2010, follows in the footsteps of other former UK lawmakers who have entered top finance jobs after leaving politics.
His appointment, first reported by the Financial Times, was announced to staff via a memo on Wednesday morning. The son of a Nigerian businessman and an Irish-English mother, in his new role Umunna becomes one of Britain’s most senior black bankers. As a full-time employee, Umunna will advise JP Morgan’s corporate clients on how to make their investments, takeover deals and fundraising more sustainable and socially responsible. Demand for ESG advisory services has grown, as asset managers such as Legal & General and BlackRock heap pressure on companies that fail to address the climate crisis. Umunna moves to JP Morgan from the communications company Edelman, which he joined last July to become head of its ESG consultancy team. He will drop a string of non-executive director roles to take the job at the Wall Street company, stepping down from companies including software firm Vista Equity Partners and UK fintech firm Digital Identity Net UK. JP Morgan has not revealed the value of Umunna’s financial package. The former politician was the Labour MP for Streatham in south London for nine years until 2019. Although Umunna was never in government, during his political career he rose to become a well-known figure in the shadow cabinet and served as the shadow business secretary. Umunna briefly entered the race to become Labour leader in 2015 but withdrew from the leadership contest, citing the impact the increased level of attention would have on him and his family. He left the Labour party, then led by Jeremy Corbyn, along with a group of other breakaway MPs to join the short-lived Change UK party in 2019. Umunna’s political career came to an end after he joined the Liberal Democrats, vacated his south London seat and unsuccessfully contested the Cities of London and Westminster constituency in the 2019 general election. Several other former senior British politicians have entered top finance roles after leaving frontbench politics.
The former Conservative chancellor Sajid Javid was hired as a senior adviser to JP Morgan in 2020, in a return to his previous career in banking, although he remains an MP. The former Labour prime minister Tony Blair was hired as a global adviser at the Wall Street bank in 2008. George Osborne, Conservative chancellor from 2010 to 2016 and known for having a portfolio of jobs since leaving office, took up a full-time role earlier this month as a partner at the London-based boutique investment bank Robey Warshaw. Osborne has given up nearly all of his other jobs, including editor-in-chief of the Evening Standard newspaper and adviser to the investment firm BlackRock, to become a full-time banker."
2021-02-10T13:36:20Z,politics,Politics,From Covid to Cuba: the growing list of Tory cronyism rows,"The choice of a Conservative peer with no direct experience of the higher education sector to lead the Office for Students has ignited claims of cronyism. Other appointments under Boris Johnson have prompted similar claims. Peerages The last two rounds of peerages prompted accusations of nepotism and cronyism. In July, Johnson’s list of new peers included his brother Jo, his strategic adviser Edward Lister and the newspaper owner Evgeny Lebedev, whose parties Johnson has attended. In December, Johnson gave a peerage to the Tory donor Peter Cruddas, going against advice from the Lords appointments commission. A Guardian analysis found that almost a quarter of peerages awarded in 2020 went to Conservative donors and close associates or former colleagues of Johnson.
Coronavirus appointments There has been controversy about opaque processes leading to people with links to the Conservatives or government being put into leading roles in efforts to combat the spread of coronavirus. One instance was the decision to make Dido Harding, the former head of TalkTalk who is a Tory peer, the head of the test-and-trace programme. Another was the appointment of Kate Bingham, the wife of the Treasury minister Jesse Norman, to head the vaccines taskforce. However, Bingham did have relevant business experience as a venture capitalist specialising in biotechnology. Ambassador to Cuba Last month the former Conservative MP George Hollingbery, who represented Meon Valley in Hampshire from 2010 to 2019 and was a junior minister, was appointed as the British ambassador to Cuba, a post that usually goes to experienced diplomats. Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union, which represents Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office staff, said the choice “once again suggests that to this government, who you know is more important than what you know”. Home Office adviser In December it emerged that Nimco Ali, a close friend of the prime minister and his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, had been appointed in October as an adviser on tackling violence against women and girls via a “direct appointment process”, without open competition or advertisement for the £350-a-day job."
2021-02-10T12:12:57Z,politics,Politics,Lord Ashcroft is leading donor for Tory London mayoral candidate,"The Conservatives’ London mayoral candidate has received nearly 40% of his campaign donations from the former party treasurer Lord Ashcroft, who has been at the centre of a decade of offshore tax controversies. Shaun Bailey, the challenger to Labour’s Sadiq Khan, has raised £255,000 in cash since the beginning of 2020, according to Electoral Commission records, but has been in effect heavily reliant on a £100,000 Ashcroft donation to keep his faltering campaign alive. Labour seized on the disclosure to accuse Bailey of being out of touch – while the Conservatives accused their opponents of spending too much time on PR, in one of the first skirmishes of the London mayoral election due in early May. Ashcroft was a heavy donor to the Conservatives in the previous decade but confirmed in 2010 he had been not domiciled in the UK for tax purposes throughout that period – although it was widely believed he was. So-called non-doms only pay UK tax on their UK income. The businessman and financier subsequently said he would change his tax status to comply with a change in the law requiring members of the House of Lords to be domiciled in the UK. Ashcroft subsequently resigned his seat at Westminster in 2015 to concentrate on other interests and had appeared to be drifting apart from the Conservatives, although he retained his peerage and title. A company Ashcroft is linked to, Medacs Healthcare, an existing contractor to the NHS, was also recently awarded a £350m contract to provide Covid-19 lab testing to the NHS. Ashcroft is non-executive chairman of its owner Impellam Group. Last month, when news of the contract emerged, Ashcroft’s spokesman said he was not involved in the negotiation of the contract with the Department of Health and Social Care and did not know about it until after it had been awarded. Campaign insiders say Bailey has struggled to recruit other big-name donors despite promises of help from the prime minister. Boris Johnson, partly because he is so far behind Khan in the polls. Late last month, Bailey had to release his three most senior media advisers because of lack of funds. Campaign sources said at the time that the Conservatives had to “focus resources on ground campaigning and digital”. The Conservative is polling at 28% to Khan’s 49%, according to a survey conducted by Redfield & Wilton Strategies last month, which would put the Labour incumbent on course for a record-breaking win in 20 years of mayoral contests. Labour also highlighted other names on Bailey’s donor list, including the construction company Keltbray, owned by the Tory donor Brendan Kerr, which gave £25,000 in July. Keltbray owned a joint venture waste company from 2008 to 2011 with the crime boss David Hunt called Keltbray Hunt. A spokeswoman for Kerr has previously said the construction magnate did not have any association with Hunt. “The only dealings between them relate to a subsidiary company of the Keltbray Group, of which Mr Kerr is the majority stakeholder, entering a joint venture in the company Keltbray Hunt.” The party also picked out some Bailey donors dating back to 2018. They included Michael Tory, a former head of investment banking at Lehman Brothers at the time of its collapse, who donated £2,500 that year. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said: “If the Tory candidate cares at all about standing up for Londoners then he will start by respecting London’s values when it comes to accepting political donations.” But a spokesman for Bailey said Labour should focus on voters’ issues: “If Labour really cared about Londoners’ values, they would tell their mayoral candidate to stop funding his PR budget and start cutting crime.”"
2021-02-10T11:01:53Z,politics,Politics,Leon Brittan’s widow intensifies attack on Met over false sex abuse claims,"The widow of Leon Brittan has signalled she may intensify her battle to make senior police officers pay for the hounding of her husband over false claims of sexual abuse. Lord Brittan, a former home secretary, died in January 2015 with his reputation under a cloud after being targeted by Scotland Yard in a VIP sexual abuse investigation triggered by the testimony of a fantasist, Carl Beech. Lady Brittan, whose public statements have been rare, used an extensive newspaper interview to accuse Scotland Yard of a “culture of cover-up” and its leadership of lacking a “moral spine”. Beech falsely claimed to detectives that he was the childhood victim of an establishment paedophile ring, which police fell for. Detectives raided properties linked to Brittan, the D-day veteran Lord Bramall, and the former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor. The investigation into Beech’s bogus claims launched in 2014 was called Operation Midland and despite intense criticism the Met insisted it was right to pursue it. But Midland collapsed in March 2016 without charges or even an arrest, and Beech was unmasked as having made up his account and was later jailed for 18 years for multiple counts of lying and one of fraud. Midland investigated claims a VIP paedophile ring abused children in the 1970s and 80s and even murdered youngsters. A detective described Beech’s claims as “credible and true” and came after the revelations about Jimmy Savile, who got away with his crimes. Lady Brittan told the Daily Mail: “In the end, it’s the leadership of any police force. That’s where the buck stops. But I think a lot of this comes down to culture. And one of the things that interests me is, as an outcome, is the police appear to have a culture which is cover up and flick away. “I suppose as a former magistrate, indeed the wife of an ex-home secretary, I’ve always believed that a strong moral compass is essential to every public body and especially to police forces, and above all, to its leadership. I think it’s very important. “However, it just seems to me the Metropolitan police has preferred its corporate or personal ambitions to a strong moral compass. I suppose the question I must ask myself, and maybe I ask publicly, is when and how is the corporate culture going to change?” She is angered that no officer faced serious punishment and said: “Not a single person in this case has resigned, lost their job, been fired, demoted or disciplined. Nobody whatsoever. “There has been a little bit of hand-wringing which does not amount to a row of beans. If, in a case like this, accountability does not involve firings or resignations at the point of responsibility, what then is accountability?” The Met has apologised to those wrongly targeted and paid compensation to them or their families. It admitted a string of blunders in 2016 after a damning report by a retired high court judge. Lady Brittan also accused the police watchdog, now called the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which investigated the scandal of a whitewash. It has stood by its findings. She also criticised the former Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who as a backbench MP pressed for a criminal investigation into Beech’s claims. Lady Brittan said: “It was about the most despicable thing I think a human being could do to another.” Watson has previously said he felt “very, very sorry” about the way events turned out, adding: “I genuinely feel very deeply for the people who have had injustices done to them as a result of the failed police inquires – I really do.” Police say they have been extensively investigated over the scandal and have put in place reforms."
2021-02-09T19:59:53Z,politics,Politics,EU to seek more time to ratify Brexit trade deal amid tensions with UK,"The European Union is expected to ask for more time to ratify the Brexit trade deal, the UK’s chief Brexit negotiator has said as he laid the blame for continuing UK-EU tensions at the door of Brussels. David Frost claimed that a resolution to now strained relations required a “different spirit” from the EU, in comments made less than 48 hours before a crunch meeting between Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and a senior European commission figure. Appearing with Gove before the Lords European Union committee on Tuesday, Frost blamed tensions on the bloc struggling to get used to a “genuinely independent actor in its neighbourhood”. He also told the committee that the UK had been told informally that day that the EU would be seeking an extension to the ratification of the trade deal between both sides. “We have heard informally from the commission today that we are likely to get a formal request to extend the two-month period that is in the treaty for ratification on the EU side,” Frost said. “We wait to see what that request constitutes and how long they wish to extend the process for. Obviously, it is a little disappointing given that we did discuss this only a month ago.” As well as news of the expected delay, Frost listed a series of “niggling border issues”, such as Brussels’ decision to place barriers on live UK shellfish exports. “I think it’s been more than bumpy to be honest in the last six weeks,” he said. Gove, who is due to hold talks in London on Thursday with the European commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič to try to resolve ongoing issues around the Northern Ireland protocol row, compared the recent difficulties with the EU to a plane taking off. “We all know that when an aeroplane takes off, that’s the point when you sometimes get that increased level of turbulence,” said the minister, who is in charge of implementing the Brexit deal. “But then eventually you reach a cruising altitude and the crew tell you to take your seatbelts off, and enjoy a gin and tonic and some peanuts. We’re not at the gin and tonic and peanuts stage yet but I’m confident we will be.” Both Gove and Frost were forced to deny that the UK was engaged in a tit for tat struggle with the EU over the recognition of diplomatic representatives after a near-year-long row about the UK’s refusal to grant full diplomatic status of the EU mission to the UK. Frost accused the EU of placing restrictions on the operation of the UK’s ambassador in Brussels and his team. A vivid example of the ongoing problems surrounding the Northern Ireland protocol and its impact on movement of goods was put to Gove by Lord Faulkner, who said he had received a letter from a heritage railway in Downpatrick, Northern Ireland. The railway was due to receive something as a gift from a counterpart in Devon and had approached several delivery firms. Of those who replied, two had said they were not accepting any deliveries between Britain and Northern Ireland any more while another provided a list of requirements. There was no immediate reaction from the European Union to Frost’s comments about the request for a delay to ratifying the trade deal. However, it emerged separately on Tuesday that Ireland and the EU Commission are meanwhile exploring ways to create an internal EU alert mechanism to protect the Northern Ireland protocol and avert repeats of the article 16 fiasco two weeks ago. Irish and commission officials were to meet on Tuesday to discuss mechanisms that will flag implications for Northern Ireland, intended or otherwise, in any future EU legislation, RTE reported. The goal is to avoid any repeat of the blunder on 29 January when the commission triggered Article 16 of the protocol to try to safeguard Covid-19 vaccine supplies, apparently oblivious to the political uproar this would cause in Dublin, Belfast and London. The commission swiftly backtracked. EU legislation is to be checked early for any implications for the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland, with any concerns channelled to Mairead McGuinness, Ireland’s EU commissioner, according to RTE. The Irish government and EU commission made no immediate comment."

Hancock has said the lifting of travel restrictions will depend on how vaccines perform against the new variants. (See 1.35pm.) The Timesâ€™ political editor, Steven Swinford, thinks this remark may have killed off summer foreign holidays.
Government scientific advisers have designated a new version of the Kent variant â€“ the Kent variant, with a mutation found in the South African variant (or B117 with E484K, to use the jargon) â€“ as a variant of concern. (See 5.41pm.) Covid-19 has accounted for the highest proportion of deaths in England and Wales of any week so far during the pandemic, claiming more than half of lives lost in some areas, according to new data. The government has refused to rule out lengthening the school day and shortening summer holidays in England to help pupils catch up on lost learning. Boris Johnson narrowly saw off a fresh backbench rebellion over Britainâ€™s trade approach to countries suspected of committing genocide. As PA Media reports, MPs voted 318 to 303, majority 15, to remove two Lords amendments from the trade bill, including one which would have forced ministers to withdraw from any free trade agreement with any country which the high court ruled is committing genocide. It was replaced by a government-backed compromise amendment aimed at giving parliament a vote on whether to pursue agreements with such countries. Labour says there was a huge government rebellion in the vote which took place in the last half hour.
Lord Frost, the UKâ€™s Brexit negotiator, has blamed the severely strained tensions with the EU on Brussels struggling to accept a â€œgenuinely independent actor in their neighbourhoodâ€�. As PA Media reports, Frost told a committee of peers I think the EU is still adjusting somewhat, as we thought they might, to the existence of a genuinely independent actor in their neighbourhood. Giving evidence to the same committee, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, described the problems as akin to turbulence on a plane. He said: We all know that when an aeroplane takes off, thatâ€™s the point when you sometimes get that increased level of turbulence. But then eventually you reach a cruising altitude and the crew tell you to take your seatbelts off, and enjoy a gin and tonic and some peanuts. Weâ€™re not at the gin and tonic and peanuts stage yet but Iâ€™m confident we will be. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2021-02-09T18:16:27Z,politics,Politics,Thinktank critical of NHS Covid response has links to Hancock,"Labour has demanded that Matt Hancock return donations from the chair of an influential conservative thinktank after it published a report saying there was “no reason to be grateful” for the NHS during the coronavirus pandemic. The report published by the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) claims to debunk “myths” including that “the NHS is the star performer of the pandemic” and that it “has done the most amazing job under the most difficult of circumstances”. Written by Dr Kristian Niemietz, the IEA’s head of political economy, it says: “There is no rational basis for the adulation the NHS is currently receiving, and no reason to be ‘grateful’ for the fact that we have it. It should go without saying that if the UK did not have the NHS it would not have no healthcare system. It would have a different healthcare system.” After suggesting possible alternative systems used overseas, such as insurance-based models, it adds: “There is no guarantee that this would have served the UK better during the pandemic, but there is certainly no reason to believe that it would have done any worse. There is nothing special about the NHS, neither during this pandemic, nor at any other time.” Electoral Commission records show that the chair of the IEA board, Neil Record, has donated £32,000 to Hancock. In a letter to the health secretary, the Labour deputy leader, Angela Rayner, urged Hancock to pay back the donations and condemn the “disgraceful attack” on the NHS. She wrote: “As health secretary it is your job to protect and defend our country’s greatest institution – our National Health Service – and stand up for our NHS staff who have sacrificed so much throughout the pandemic to save lives and keep us safe. It is therefore deeply concerning that our country’s health secretary is so closely linked to … an organisation which criticises our NHS and is committed to its dismantling, abolition and replacement with a privatised healthcare system.” The public has shown its appreciation for NHS staff in the pandemic, from the weekly “clap for carers” between March and May last year to making personal protective equipment for frontline workers and delivering meals to hospital staff. Referencing the “clap for carers”, the IEA report says: “It was soon followed by self-made posters and adverts saying ‘Thank you NHS’ or some variation thereof, usually showing hearts and rainbows drawn around the NHS logo, popping up everywhere. Crises often trigger a collective ‘Rally-Round-the-Flag Effect’, and ‘Rally-Round-the-NHS’ is the modern British version of that.” The IEA is one of the most politically influential thinktanks in the UK, previously boasting that 14 members of Boris Johnson’s cabinet had been associated with its group’s initiatives. The report, released on Tuesday, says the NHS was only the star performer “in the way in which for proud parents watching a school performance, their own child will always stand out as the ‘star performer’, even if nobody else sees it that way”. Niemietz writes: “The claim of this paper is that an effective pandemic response is compatible with a variety of public spending levels, a variety of trade regimes, and a variety of healthcare systems.” Rayner urged Hancock to take action “to assure NHS staff and the British people that you don’t share the view … that we should not be grateful for the NHS or thank the NHS and its staff for their work during the pandemic”. The IEA and Department of Health and Social Care have been approached for comment."
2021-02-09T17:45:49Z,politics,Politics,Holyrood inquiry split over publication of Alex Salmond evidence,"The Holyrood inquiry into the Scottish government’s handling of sexual harassment allegations against Alex Salmond is in crisis after deep divisions emerged over publication of his evidence to the investigation. During a tense four-hour private meeting on Tuesday, the nine-strong committee voted by five to four against publishing a statement that Salmond says is an essential part of his case alleging that Nicola Sturgeon broke the ministerial code. Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat MSPs said the decision raised critical questions about the committee’s ability to properly investigate the botched Scottish government inquiry into allegations Salmond sexually harassed two female officials – claims Salmond has repeatedly denied and of which he was acquitted in court. It is now thought Salmond will refuse to appear before the committee. He had been due to give evidence under oath on Tuesday but pulled out because he insisted the submission be published so he could refer to it. The committee split along party lines: the four Scottish National party MSPs and Andy Wightman, a former Scottish Green MSP now sitting as an independent, voted against releasing it. The two Tory committee members and one each from Labour and the Lib Dems voted to publish it in redacted form. Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s acting leader and a committee member, said: “The decision not to publish this vital evidence is, in my view, a blow to the credibility of the committee, and, by extension, to the parliament itself. The evidence in question is already largely in the public domain and by refusing to publish it, even with appropriate redactions, the committee has denied itself the chance to question the former first minister.” That was echoed by Alex Cole Hamilton, the Lib Dem committee member. “The future of this whole inquiry is in jeopardy but we owe it to the complainers, who must have hated every second of this process, to at least try to reach a conclusion,” he said. “If we are to get to the bottom of how the Scottish government failed the women at the heart of these complaints so terribly, then we must hear from the subject of its investigation.” Salmond has not yet responded, but is reportedly considering staging a press conference before Sturgeon gives evidence to the committee on Tuesday next week. A parliament spokeswoman said it had clear legal advice that publishing the submission would breach court orders, even if it was redacted. That was because it had been leaked and published by the Spectator; Holyrood’s legal advice was it could only be used by the committee if its contents were carefully redacted. The spokeswoman added: “In addition to the issues around Mr Salmond’s submission, there are a number of conditions to his appearance that the committee simply could never meet, including waiving threat of all legal prosecution. It is simply not within the committee’s gift to make such a commitment.” Salmond’s submission to the committee is identical to that given to James Hamilton QC, Ireland’s former director of public prosecutions, who is investigating Sturgeon for allegedly misleading parliament over her dealings with Salmond and her knowledge about the internal inquiry in breach of the ministerial code. MSPs who voted against publication accepted the advice that it is legally impossible to use it now it has been leaked, but also believe Salmond’s evidence is not central to their inquiry into serious failures in the Scottish government’s original investigation into the claims against the former first minister. The government paid Salmond £520,000 in legal costs and about £180,000 on its own legal bills after he won a legal action in 2019 challenging their handling of the investigation, plus at least £50,000 on advice preparing civil servants giving evidence to the Holyrood inquiry."
2021-02-09T14:01:35Z,politics,Politics,Lord Freud breached code of conduct over Charlie Elphicke references,"A Conservative peer breached parliament’s code of conduct when he and five MPs tried to get senior judges to intervene in a hearing on whether references to support the former MP Charlie Elphicke at his sentencing for sexual assault could be made public. Lord Freud failed to meet the standards of conduct expected of individual members and has agreed make a personal statement to the House of Lords, according to the commissioner for standards. Freud agreed to apologise after being found to have breached the code of conduct by seeking to interfere in a legal decision.
An investigation was launched when a member of public complained after reading a Guardian report that the head of the judiciary had admonished Freud and five MPs for seeking to influence a judge overseeing a hearing about the release of the references. Freud and the MPs – Sir Roger Gale, Adam Holloway, Bob Stewart, Theresa Villiers and Elphicke’s estranged wife Natalie – have also been referred separately to the standards commissioner by the Labour MP Helen Hayes. The outcome of that complaint is yet to be known. It had not been Freud’s idea to contact the judges and he had not realised that the letters were being sent on House of Commons headed paper, according to Tuesday’s report into his conduct. The peer had also “genuinely lacked knowledge of the nature of the judicial hierarchy” and the letters had been drafted by others. Freud told the commissioner, who interviewed him last month, that with hindsight “I think I and indeed the MPs do not understand the relationship between junior and senior judges.” He and the commissioner discussed the nature of the hierarchy of the court system that a more senior court can review the decisions of a lower court, but that judges are independent of one another in their decision-making rather than in what could be described as a line-management relationship. Lord Freud said he had “assumed a hierarchy, which there is but not in that context”. The commissioner rejected the suggestion that the peer and MP’s letters to senior judges had been intended to raise “matters of principle”. Instead, they had been attempts to persuade them to intervene. Freud, Gale, Holloway, Stewart and Theresa Villiers were among several people who had provided character references to support Elphicke at his sentencing in September, when he was jailed for two years after he was found guilty of three counts of sexual assault against two women. The Guardian then lodged a request to gain access to the references provided by the parliamentarians – who were not known at the time – and a date was set for a court hearing. Freud and the MPs subsequently identified themselves as the authors of references. However, they and Natalie Elphicke then wrote to senior judges, copying in the judge who was due to oversee the hearing, expressing concern that “matters of principle” should first be considered by senior members of the judiciary and by parliament. They were rebuked by the office of the lord chief justice for England and Wales, who said told them it was “improper” to seek to influence the decision of a judge who would ultimately rule on the basis of evidence and argument in court. The commissioner for standards interviewed Freud on 6 January and was provided with copies of the letters written to the senior judges, in which the peer and MPs said they had no objections to being identified as the authors of the references but said that the release of letters by other figures would have a “chilling effect”. Elphicke is appealing against his conviction."

In an article for the Guardian, Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones, the former Tory candidate known as “the black farmer”, has criticised Downing Street for failing to address criticisms from Johnson’s civil society and communities adviser, Samuel Kasumu. In a leaked letter to the prime minister last week, Kasumu raised concerns about the conduct of Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, suggesting she may have broken the ministerial code when she publicly criticised a black journalist on social media, and said tensions over race policies within No 10 had become “unbearable”.
Emmanuel-Jones, a businessman and food producer, writes: “When the story broke last week that Samuel had wanted to resign, my heart sank. He subsequently agreed to stay on. But when I read his long, heartfelt resignation letter to his boss, Boris Johnson, setting out his concern that the party is ‘choosing to pursue a politics steeped in division’ – words which he has not retracted – it once again posed the question: does the Conservative party still have a problem with race?” He said the Conservatives had been behind the curve, leaving a great void that has been filled by the Labour party. “When the subject of race does come up, the Conservatives look clumsy and out of step. Take the Windrush debacle, in which black British people were denied health treatment, benefits, and were threatened with deportation: it will take years to repair the damage this scandal caused,” he writes. Emmanuel-Jones, who failed to win the seat of Chippenham for the Tories in 2010, also condemns government ministers including Badenoch and the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, for failing to stand up for black Britons. “Only last week, Kwarteng railed against the idea of ‘decolonising the curriculum’ (that is, rebalancing our teaching so that the voices of those who were colonised are heard more often). “And we have a black equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, who ditches diversity training and who claims anti-racism campaigners want children to be taught that black people are good and white people are bad. Other black MPs remain silent, despite the huge national support for Black Lives Matter since the death of George Floyd last year.” The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, is criticised by Emmanuel-Jones for appearing to be uncaring when he claimed that taking a knee was copied from Game of Thrones. “The media management of this – in which the foreign secretary seemed to think it originated in Game of Thrones – made the party come across as uncaring or lacking understanding.” On Friday, the former government race adviser Simon Woolley said Badenoch’s position had become untenable. Downing Street said: “It would not be appropriate to comment on individual staff members. This government is committed to inclusion and bringing communities together and is the most ethnically diverse in this country’s history. “Last year we established a commission on race and ethnic disparities to examine and tackle inequality and discrimination wherever it is found. It is due to report shortly.”"
2021-02-09T08:35:27Z,politics,Politics,UK ministers accused of 'engineering' vote on genocide claims,"A Conservative backbench rebellion designed to give the UK courts a role in determining whether a country is committing genocide appears to have been frustrated by what rebels claimed was government chicanery and a denial of democracy. Ministers arranged Tuesday’s vote so that if the rebels back an amendment passed by the Lords giving the court a role, they will also be backing a separate Labour-sponsored amendment passed in the Lords imposing human rights audits before trade deals are signed. Some Tory MPs are prepared to rebel to give the courts a role, but not if by so doing they are also backing the Labour-sponsored plan. One leading campaigner for what has become known as the genocide amendment complained: “Peers voted on the two distinct propositions separately so it is not clear why the clerks regard it acceptable to treat the MPs’ endorsement of one Lords amendment as endorsement of the other. They should not be bundled together. It is not even a parliamentary trick, it is a denial of democracy.” The campaign to give the UK courts an advisory role in declaring if a country is committing genocide has drawn passionate support outside parliament, and is driven by allegations that Uighur Muslims are suffering a genocide at the hands of the Chinese government. The genocide claims cannot be referred to the international courts due to a Chinese veto, so campaigners wanted a right to refer the issue to the domestic courts. Iain Duncan Smith, the lead Tory rebel, said: “The sad tragedy is that the government has so engineered it that the democratically elected House of Commons will not be able to vote on Lord Alton’s genocide amendment, which passed in the Lords with a majority of 171”. Nus Ghani, another Tory rebel MP, said she was “appalled at the parliamentary games played over an issue as grave as genocide”. Benedict Rogers, the chief executive of Hong Kong Watch, described the tactics as outrageous, adding: “I have never seen a government so afraid to do the right thing.” It is now likely MPs will back a government-backed compromise designed to give the foreign affairs select committee, and a parallel committee in the Lords, powers to investigate whether a genocide is occurring, and then to make a recommendation on whether a government trade deal should go ahead. Ghani complained: “A select committee can already prepare a report on genocide and the offer is meaningless since genocide can only be determined by a judicial process.” She added that majorities on both the foreign affairs select committee and the Lords’ international relations select committee did not want to be given the role, if there was no power to refer the issue to the courts. Lord Alton, an independent peer, said: “Both select committees in the Commons and Lords have said they would not wish to take on this role without having the opportunity to then refer the issue to the high court. It would take up a huge amount of time, energy and effort.” He said he did not think MPs were as impartial or as appropriate as judges in determining such complex issues. The issue has also become a test for the government’s policy towards China, a policy made more difficult by the US’s recent decision asserting that China is committing genocide against Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang province. Ministers have also warned peers that the proposal might create diplomatic difficulties. MPs rejected a role for the courts in determining genocide by a wafer-thin margin of 11 votes last month, but since then, peers reasserted their support for the measure by a huge majority of 171, forcing the government whips in the Commons to put the squeeze on their backbenchers for a second time. In a joint letter signed by 20 civilian groups including the Burma campaign, the World Uyghur Congress and Yezidi Emergency Support, the groups say the UK has played a key role in the past five years leading the fight to protect the Yazidis when Isis was trying to wipe them out, and a role for the UK courts in determining genocide could be the start of a new global atrocity prevention strategy. If the courts were given a determination role, it would still be up to ministers to determine whether a trade agreement should be retained. Ministers say the proposal would give courts a role they do not seek and could backfire, since proof of genocide is such a high bar to overcome."
2021-02-08T22:00:54Z,politics,Politics,UK editors call on ministers to protect freedom of information,"Editors of UK national newspapers are calling on the government to protect the Freedom of Information Act following criticism that the public are being unfairly obstructed when they seek to scrutinise the work of official organisations. Six editors at papers ranging from the Daily Telegraph to the Mirror have signed an open letter coordinated by openDemocracy requesting an urgent investigation into the act amid fears that the public are being stonewalled. Last November an openDemocracy report accused ministers of running an “Orwellian unit” at the heart of government that sought to control the release of potentially embarrassing information. It said Whitehall departments were rejecting requests at the highest rate since the introduction of the act 20 years ago. In the letter, the editors raise serious concerns about the difficulties that journalists and the public experience when trying to use freedom of information legislation across government to request information from official files. Among the editors to have signed the letter are Katharine Viner of the Guardian, Roula Khalaf of the Financial Times and Chris Evans of the Daily Telegraph. The letter is also backed by a number of former Fleet Street editors including Paul Dacre, who edited the Daily Mail for a quarter of a century, and by academics and lawyers. They call for measures to speed up official responses to freedom of information requests by the public and a strengthening of the information commissioner, the body that regulates the act. The editors say the act “is a critical tool for ensuring that journalists and members of the public can scrutinise the workings of government. We have, however, become increasingly concerned about the way in which the legislation is being interpreted and implemented.”
Drawing on the conclusions of the openDemocracy report, they point out the “increasing evidence of poor practices across government”, such as failing to respond to requests. They criticise the operation of the FoI clearing house, a little-known unit within the Cabinet Office that requires Whitehall departments to send it requests that are deemed to be potentially sensitive or too expensive to answer. The unit routinely instructs departments to send it drafts of proposed responses so that they can be vetted. “This raises serious questions about whether information requests by journalists and researchers are being treated and managed differently,” the editors write. According to the openDemocracy report, the budget of the Information Commissioner’s Office, the regulator tasked with implementing freedom of information legislation, has been cut by 41% over the last decade at a time when its caseload has increased by 46%. Viner said: “At a time when journalistic freedom is under threat around the world, the government’s time-wasting over legitimate FoI requests is at odds with its global commitments to press freedom. Given the huge amounts of public money now spent with private contractors, a clear commitment to greater transparency and a well-funded information commissioner are manifestly in the public interest.” John Witherow, the editor of the Times, said: “Transparency is not a privilege or a gift bequeathed to a grateful citizenry by a benign government. That message has failed to get through to the government of Boris Johnson, which seems hellbent on making it harder. This is not only a disgrace but a mistake.” A government spokesperson said the clearing house had operated for 15 years to ensure a consistent approach to requests for information. “This is especially important for complex FoI requests where we must balance the need to make information available with our legal duty to protect sensitive information and national security,” they said. “This government remains fully committed to its transparency agenda, routinely disclosing information beyond its obligations under the FoI Act, and releasing more proactive publications than ever before.”"
2021-02-08T18:26:23Z,politics,Politics,UK Covid: over-70s in England urged to contact NHS if they have not received vaccine offer yet – as it happened,"Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, England’s deputy chief medical officer, has said the South African variant of coronavirus is unlikely to become dominant in the UK. Speaking at the No 10 press conference, he acknowledged that reports about the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine offering only “minimal” protection against mild or moderate illness from the South African variant (see 9.05am) were “scary” for some people. But he said people should be reassured. He said: We have small numbers of the South African variant in the UK at the present time. And as I’ve said, I’m not seeing, and the early modelling data do not suggest, a transmissibility advantage for this virus. So, that being the case, it’s not going to kind of overrun or overtake the current B117 virus [the Kent variant - now the dominant one in the UK] in the next few months, or that is the most likely scenario, that it won’t happen. I don’t think that this is something that we should be concerned about right at this point in time, and I agree with you that the stories and the headlines around variant viruses and vaccines are a bit scary. And I wish they weren’t. Van-Tam and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, also said that vaccines were being adapted to counter new variants and that people were likely to offered regular booster jab to counter the new version of the virus, as happens every year with flu. Hancock announced that people aged 70 and over in England are being urged to arrange to have a Covid-19 vaccine if they have not already been inoculated, in a change of tactics by the NHS. Boris Johnson hinted that travel restrictions might tighten, not loosen, over the coming months, as Covid cases fall, when he said that border controls would work best when infection rates were lower than they are now. (See 1.32pm.) At the press conference Van-Tam said it was impossible to say now what restrictions would be in place in the summer. But he said the more elaborate people’s plans were, the more they were at risk. He said: How quickly [restrictions] can be released will depend upon three things - the virus, the vaccine and the extent to which the public obey the rules that are in place, which thankfully the vast majority do ... The more elaborate your plans are for summer holidays, in terms of crossing borders, in terms of household mixing, given where we are now, I think we just have to say the more you are stepping into making guesses about the unknown at this point. Hancock said almost 25% of adults in the UK have now had their first dose of vaccine. And take-up has exceeded expectations, he told the press conference. He said: We have now, as of today, vaccinated more than 12.2 million people - that’s almost one in four of all adults across the United Kingdom. Take-up of the vaccine so far has been significantly better than we hoped for. Based on the work we had done before the vaccination programme started and looking at the surveys, we knew that the UK had one of the most positive attitudes to vaccine uptake, but even so we thought we would get take-up of around 75%. I’m really pleased to be able to tell you that as of midnight last night, among the over-80s, we have now given a first dose to 91%. Among those aged between 75 and 79, it is 95%, and almost three-quarters of those aged between 70 and 74 who were the most recent group to be invited. Earlier Ipsos MORI released polling suggesting more than 80% of people think the government is doing a good job on vaccines.
The South African coronavirus variant is the single biggest threat facing the UK, Sir Keir Starmer has said. The hostile environment for migrants means many people living in the UK with unofficial or uncertain status will be unlikely to take up coronavirus vaccinations, despite a government push for this to happen, charities have warned. In an interview with the World at One Diane Abbott, the former shadow home secretary, argued that the hostile environment policy had contributed to vaccine hesitancy amongst black and Asian people more generally. As HuffPost reports, she told the programme: The whole hostile environment policy has created a situation where people are sceptical about authority, even when they have an absolute legal right to be here. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research has slashed its forecasts for growth this year after the delay to recovery caused by the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Irish government has promised to crack down on travellers from the Middle East who use the “Dublin dodge” to enter the UK and evade coronavirus restrictions. That’s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global live blog. It’s here."
2021-02-08T17:47:19Z,politics,Politics,Yorkshire lobster exporter says Brexit costs have forced it to close,"A lobster exporter who is winding up his 60-year-old family business has blamed the government for failing to be honest about Brexit red tape and hidden costs. Sam Baron, who worked alongside his father to set up Baron Shellfish in Bridlington, east Yorkshire, said the government had failed to be straight with the fishing industry. Industry experts said that Baron Shellfish, the first lobster-tank business in Europe’s largest shellfish port, appears to be the first big exporter to have announced its closure. Speaking from Bridlington on Monday, where he is in the process of dismantling hundreds of lobster crates, Baron said: “All we have had is bullshit from the government, promises that haven’t been kept. I am winding up the business while I still have enough to pay redundancy to my staff. “People say Boris has tried his best, but it just hasn’t been enough,” he said. “It’s the extra costs and uncertainty. We have to fill in new health notes, and there is a lot of new paperwork, including the catch certificates. Every time you put lobsters on transport, if anything in the paperwork is wrong, you have lost everything. “It is all Brexit-related – the extra costs, extra paperwork and the extra gamble – and it is down to the government and the EU. Every time you send out transport with lobster, it is like playing Russian roulette with five bullets in your gun.” While inside the common market, Baron’s company bought lobsters from businesses in Bridlington and sold to countries including Spain, Belgium and Italy. He has exported up to five tonnes of lobster a week to mainland Europe. Baron, 58, who voted to remain but came round to the idea of leaving the EU, is planning to pay off three members of staff and sell his crates and vehicles. “I voted to stay in because I was worried about the business. But I wish we had never gone into the EU in the first place,” he said. Many fishers have been unable to export to the EU since catch certificates, health checks and customs declarations were introduced at the start of this year, delaying their deliveries and prompting European buyers to reject them. Trucks with slogans such as “Brexit carnage” and “incompetent government destroying shellfish industry” parked metres from Downing Street in London last month. Boris Johnson has described the changes as “teething problems”, and said they had been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. The prime minister has said an additional £23m fund had been created to compensate businesses that “through no fault of their own have experienced bureaucratic delays, difficulties getting their goods through where there is a genuine buyer on the other side of the Channel”. Baron said his late father, Mick, who died three years ago, would have been furious with the way his family firm and the industry had been treated by the EU and the government. “He would have been up in arms. He might have got his 12-bore [shotgun] out. This is not what we were promised.” In a further indication of Brexit-related problems in the fishing industry, George Eustice, the environment secretary, told the Commons on Monday he had written to the EU commission “seeking urgent resolution” to barriers placed on some UK shellfish exports. Under longstanding EU rules, catches of live bivalve molluscs such as mussels, oysters, scallops, cockles and clams from non-EU member states can only be imported without treatment if they come from waters deemed of the highest quality. These rules have closed off many exports of live bivalve molluscs from the UK since Brexit took full effect. Responding to an urgent question on shellfish exports, Eustice said: “Bringing an end to this traditional and valuable trade is unacceptable and I recognise that this is a devastating blow to those businesses that are reliant on the trade. “While we do not agree at all with the commission’s interpretation of the law, we have had to advise traders that their consignments may very well not be accepted at EU ports for now. “I am seeking urgent resolution to this problem and I have written to commissioner [Stella] Kyriakides today. I have emphasised our high shellfish health status and our systems of control and I have said if it would assist the trade we could provide reasonable additional assurances to demonstrate shellfish health.” A government spokesperson said ministers were working closely with fishing industry representatives and the authorities in EU member states to ensure that goods could continue to flow smoothly to their markets. “We have announced a £23m scheme which will provide crucial support for fishermen and seafood exporters, who have experienced delays and a lack of demand for fish from the restaurant industry in the UK and Europe. This is in addition to the £100m fund announced by the prime minister last month,” he said."
2021-02-08T16:42:00Z,politics,Politics,Artists urged to shrug off Brexit blues in cross-Channel project,"Artists on both sides of the Channel are being encouraged to beat the Brexit blues in a project exploring the new relationship between the UK and France. I Love You, Moi Non Plus aims to highlight how the arts across all disciplines from painting, illustration, photography, music and writing can break down the borders thrown up by Britain’s departure from the EU. A number of celebrities including Brian Eno, Ai Weiwei, Stella McCartney, Jean Paul Gaultier, Tamara Rojo of the English National Ballet and the British contemporary artist Bob and Roberta Smith have already agreed to contribute their interpretations of what the British-French relationship means to them. However, the organisers are keen for the well known to serve as inspiration for everyone else to express themselves.
“In response to Brexit and the new borders now in place, the project seeks to highlight how art and creativity can maintain connections between communities across the Channel, unifying voices from across Britain and the EU,” said a spokesperson for the Somerset House arts centre, one of the project’s partners along with the fashion chain Dover Street Market. I Love You, Moi Non Plus – inspired by Serge Gainsbourg’s 1969 hit with Jane Birkin – echoes last year’s lockdown competition inspired by David Hockney called Hope in Spring, dreamed up by Ruth Mackenzie, the chair of the London Arts Council. Mackenzie is also involved in this latest project, which she said aimed to remind people that Brexit was more than “an economic catastrophe”. “Art provides links between us that we really need right now,” she said. “But artists have had no voice in these [Brexit] discussions. As in any divorce you have to pay attention not just to the economics, but the emotional bedrock.”
Among the early entries is a 2012 film by the Chinese artist Ai called Learning to Sing the Grass Mud Horse Song, which highlights how censorship and lack of freedom resonates with European and British artists who can no longer move freely between the UK and the continent. The music producer and artist Eno has created an image merging the union flag and the tricolour, while the French director Mohamed El Khatib’s offering follows the red, white and blue theme with school lines reading Je ne dois pas dire du mal de Boris Johnson (I must not say bad things about Boris Johnson). Théo Recoules of the Sabir agency, which is coordinating the project, said it was hoped the famous artists would inspire contributions from “ordinary citizens”. “We want to hear from anyone, anywhere who have something to say about the unique relationship between France and Britain,” Recoules said. “It’s open to all and we hope the entries will be as different as possible. Since 2016, the subject of Brexit has been treated exclusively by politicians in London and Brussels, while we citizens had very little voice to express ourselves.” Work can be submitted by sharing it on social media under the hashtags #ILoveYouMoiNonPlus, #ILYMNP and #LifeAfterBrexit, or on the Dover Street Market website before the 25 February deadline. All submissions will be published online and the best will be chosen for an exhibition to be held in Paris and London when coronavirus restrictions are lifted. “I believe there is an artist in everyone, and like the David Hockney project it’s about finding that artist,” Mackenzie said."
2021-02-08T13:33:42Z,politics,Politics,Alex Salmond demands clarification of rules before he faces MSPs,"Alex Salmond has said he will not appear before MSPs on Tuesday morning after strongly criticising their investigation into a botched Scottish government inquiry into sexual harassment claims against him. The former first minister’s lawyers accused the Holyrood committee of taking an “absurd position” over Salmond’s submission to its investigation and setting “offensive” parameters on what he can say. Salmond’s lawyer, David McKie, said he would give evidence to the committee by 16 February but only if he was given written clarification on what he would be allowed to discuss without breaching legal restrictions imposed by the courts and Holyrood’s lawyers on his evidence. Salmond is angry that the Scottish parliament’s lawyers have ruled his submission cannot be published or used by the committee because it risks breaching court orders issued when Salmond was on trial for 14 alleged offences against 10 women. He was acquitted of every charge. The parliament’s lawyers have said the former Scottish National party leader can refer to his submission in oral evidence, which they admit has been published, nearly in full, by the Spectator. Committee members fear their investigation is on the brink of collapse because of the continued impasse with Salmond. In a letter sent on Sunday to the committee, McKie wrote: “Asking a witness to accept the constraints of speaking only to evidence selected by you on the undisclosed advice and direction of unidentified others is not acceptable in any forum and is, in our client’s view, particularly offensive when the remit he seeks to address has been set for you by parliament and addresses the unlawful actions of an elected government and the needless squandering of hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money. “What legal advice could possibly justify the absurd position of our client being told he can essentially read out or repeat ‘elements’ of a submission but that the same elements (freely available to all online at the Spectator) cannot be published.” The committee has delayed discussing its response to Salmond’s new letter until Tuesday morning, when it will meet in private rather than questioning him, after finishing a public evidence session with the SNP chief executive, Peter Murrell, who is Nicola Sturgeon’s husband.
Murrell was questioned again by the committee on Monday morning and pressed on whether he was involved in other, undisclosed text messages, involving Salmond. He denied withholding any information relevant to the committee’s investigation. Some committee members privately share Salmond’s frustration and are critical of the parliament’s legal advice, but suspect his decision not to appear is based on the Crown Office’s refusal to release internal SNP text messages he alleges prove senior party figures conspired against him. Sturgeon, his successor as SNP leader, denied on Monday she had allowed the Scottish government to mislead the court of session in 2018 after Salmond launched legal action over the government investigation of harassment complaints against him. Its evidence to the court said Sturgeon first learned about the claims against Salmond from him on 2 April. It has been alleged she was first told on 29 March, by one of his former aides, Geoff Aberdein. Sturgeon said she disputed claims the court was misled and that she looked forward to giving evidence to MSPs on 16 February. “I will answer all and any questions put to me, and I will also take head on the opportunity to address some of the ridiculous suggestions made about this whole situation,” she said during her daily coronavirus briefing. A Holyrood spokesperson defended parliament’s stance and insisted Salmond had received repeated reassurances about his freedom to state to his case. The committee had already published two submissions from Salmond and “many, many pages of records and documents from him”, the spokesperson said. “Mr Salmond had been contacted to make it clear that he can speak freely in committee about all of his contact with Nicola Sturgeon and his views on her actions,” they said. “He was given the opportunity to make a lengthy opening statement on Tuesday and would have had four hours to answer questions in public. He was also invited to send more written evidence for publication after the meeting.”"
2021-02-08T10:46:14Z,politics,Politics,DUP MP under pressure to apologise for Songs of Praise BLM remarks,"A Democratic Unionist party MP has sparked condemnation after describing an edition of Songs of Praise that featured only black people as the “BBC at its BLM worst”. Politicians in Northern Ireland and anti-racism campaigners urged Gregory Campbell to apologise and called on the DUP to sanction him. Sinn Féin said it had reported his comments to the House of Commons standards commissioner. The East Derry MP linked the programme to the Black Lives Matter movement in comments posted on Facebook on 31 January after the semi-final of the gospel singer of the year competition. He wrote: “There were five singers, all of them black. There were three judges all of them black and one presenter who was incidentally, yes black. The singers were all very good but can you imagine an all-white line up with an all-white jury and presented by a white person? No I can’t either.” The North West Migrants Forum said in a statement it was astonishing that Campbell watched a programme full of love and praise for God and saw only skin colour. “Is he uncomfortable watching a programme where Black British people and culture are celebrated centre stage? Did he think the BBC was racist when other programmes – night after night, decade after decade – only featured white people?” it said. The group added: “It is deeply worrying that Mr Campbell can confidently display such clear bias, apparently without fear of challenge or accountability.” The statement was co-signed by Belfast Islamic Centre, Amnesty International UK, Black and Asian Lawyers for Justice and other groups. Stephen Farry, an Alliance party MP, urged the DUP to remove the whip from Campbell. The DUP made no immediate response. The East Derry MP was expected to issue a statement later on Monday. He has triggered complaints before by mocking the Irish language, saying “go raibh maith agat” (thank you) sounds like “curry my yoghurt”."
2021-02-08T00:14:29Z,politics,Politics,Peer is asked to investigate the activities of extreme right and left,"The government has reportedly ordered an investigation into the extreme fringes on both ends of the political spectrum, with a peer tasked with offering recommendations to the prime minister and home secretary. The review will be led by John Woodcock, the former Labour MP who now sits in the upper chamber as Lord Walney and was appointed as the government’s independent adviser on political violence and disruption last November. Announcing the review in an interview with the Telegraph, the unaffiliated peer cautioned that the UK must take notice of the rise of far-right groups in the US following the storming of the Capitol building last month. Woodcock stressed that there was “not an equivalence of threat between the far-left and the far-right” in the UK, with the latter a far bigger issue. In September, Home Office data showed that right-wing extremists now make up almost a fifth of terrorists in jail, rising from 33 in 2018/19 to 45 in the year to 30 June 2020 in England and Wales. Furthermore, last year’s annual figures for the government’s controversial Prevent scheme showed that the largest number of referrals related to far-right extremism. James Brokenshire, the security minister, warned that far-right terror posed “a growing threat”, which had been accelerated by the amplification of conspiracy theories online during the pandemic. Of the cases ultimately referred to the government’s Channel programme for specialist support, 302 (43%) were referred for rightwing radicalisation. Walney told the Telegraph that there had also been isolated incidents of some leftwing causes “overstepping the mark into antisocial behaviour”, and the activities of these groups would also be investigated. He said: “There have been a number of, at the moment isolated, examples of climate change activist groups, particularly Extinction Rebellion, overstepping the mark into antisocial behaviour. I think there’s been a recognition that, even among that movement, they have at times risked undermining their own cause. “I’m coming at this with an open mind, but with an understanding that there is clearly a potential for groups to develop into increasingly problematic areas.” The home secretary, Priti Patel, has previously claimed Extinction Rebellion activists are “so-called eco-crusaders turned criminals” who threaten key planks of national life. In a speech to the annual conference of the Police Superintendents’ Association last September, Patel said XR was “attempting to thwart the media’s right to publish without fear nor favour”, and claimed their campaign of civil disobedience was “a shameful attack on our way of life, our economy and the livelihoods of the hard-working majority”."
2021-02-08T00:00:35Z,politics,Politics,Government hits back at claims Brexit is stifling exports to EU,"The government has sought to defend its record over Brexit after freight industry leaders claimed exports to the EU had nosedived since the transition period ended on 31 December. When Boris Johnson announced on Christmas Eve that he had secured a last-minute Brexit deal he insisted there would be “no non-tariff barriers” to trade with the EU. Exporters, however, are pointing to burdensome extra form-filling and inspections, and a shortage of customs agents to smooth the process – with 10,000 in place against the 50,000 that the haulage industry said were needed. The Observer revealed at the weekend that the Road Haulage Association (RHA) had written to the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, last week suggesting there had been a drop of as much as 68% in the volume of goods exports passing through UK ports and calling for an “urgent intervention”. Whitehall sources vehemently rejected that claim, insisting freight flows were up to 95% or even 100% of normal levels on some days in January – though part of the RHA’s argument was that in many cases lorries were travelling back empty from the UK to the EU. “We don’t recognise these figures at all,” said a Cabinet Office spokesperson, adding: “We know there are some specific issues and we are working with businesses to resolve them.” A government spokesperson said: “Thanks to the hard work put in by hauliers and traders to get ready for the end of the Brexit transition period, there are no queues at the Short Straits, disruption at the border has so far been minimal, and freight movements are now close to normal levels, despite the Covid-19 pandemic. “As a responsible government, we made extensive preparations for a wide range of scenarios at the border, including the reasonable worst case. However, it appears increasingly unlikely that our reasonable worst case scenario will occur.” However, the RHA’s figure was corroborated by Richard Ballantyne, the chief executive of the British Ports Association, who said it was “broadly in line” with his experience since new year. While the worst disruption has been experienced in Northern Ireland, where shoppers have at times been confronted by empty supermarket shelves, UK exporters from fishing firms to plant nurseries have complained of significant problems. Shellfish exporters have been taken aback by a ban on the export of unprocessed bivalve molluscs such as oysters and scallops. The government had hoped the ban could be lifted in April, but the European commission suggested last week that the rule, which applies to imports to the EU from third countries, would remain indefinitely. Chris Vinnicombe, who fishes for oysters on the Fal estuary in Cornwall, told BBC Politics South West: “Boris [Johnson]’s wonderful deal for the fishing industry – which obviously it is not – this deal should have actually incorporated the likes of live bivalve molluscs. This is going to end up as a complete write-off. It’s going to finish the whole fishery here. The Fal oyster fishery is one small part of it. This is a countrywide problem.” Some Brexiters, including the Conservative MP John Redwood, have argued that the government should support the shellfish industry to sell more of its product to UK consumers. Meanwhile, the Scottish National party is calling on the government to demand a “grace period” for Scotland, as it has for Northern Ireland, to allow Scottish exporters, including the fishing sector, more time to get used to the new post-Brexit regime. Gove last week conceded there were “serious problems” with the operation of the new Irish Sea border, and called on the EU to delay until 2023 the application of EU customs and product standards. The SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said: “Ultimately, the only way to protect Scotland’s economy is to become an independent country and regain the full trading benefits of EU membership. In the meantime, it is crucial that the UK government delivers the immediate support and financial compensation that Scotland requires – including an emergency grace period to mitigate the damage of Brexit. “The Tory government has already sought a grace period for Northern Ireland until 2023 but yet again Scotland’s interests have been sidelined. Any deal for Northern Ireland is welcome – but Scotland must get the same instead of being left out in the cold again. Gove will be questioned by MPs on the EU scrutiny committee on Monday, along with senior officials from the Cabinet Office transition taskforce."
2021-02-07T22:30:22Z,politics,Politics,Rachel Reeves: Labour would oversee radical 'insourcing' of public services,"A Labour government would launch a radical programme of “insourcing” to bring public services back under democratic control, the frontbencher Rachel Reeves will say as she accuses Boris Johnson of handing £2bn of Covid contracts to Conservative “cronies”. The shadow cabinet office minister and close ally of the party leader, Keir Starmer, has repeatedly highlighted the failings of private sector contractors, most recently by urging the government to “sack Serco” from its role in tracing the contacts of Covid cases. Reeves will use a speech at Labour’s London headquarters on Monday to attack the government for spending lavishly on contractors throughout the pandemic, without adequate oversight. Labour claims more than £2bn of taxpayers’ money has been spent on products and services provided by firms with a financial or personal connection to the Conservative party. Contracts highlighted by the party include those awarded to Randox, the testing company that has employed the Conservative MP Owen Paterson as a consultant, and Hanbury, the political consultancy whose founders included the senior Vote Leave figure Paul Stephenson. “This current Tory party is rife with conflicts of interest. It’s all cheques and no balances,” Reeves is expected to say. Normal rules for tendering public contracts were suspended early in the pandemic to allow ministers to move quickly in securing necessary supplies – but Reeves will accuse the government of using the fast-track system favour firms of friends or donors or with other links to the party. “This government has eroded not only our public services to the brink of collapse, but so much of what it means to be an honourable and transparent government,” she is due to say. And with Starmer’s top team facing internal criticism about the failure to set out concrete policy, Reeves will also outline what a Labour government would do differently. She will say the party would launch the biggest wave of “insourcing” in a generation, bringing contracts back under the control of central and local government. Labour would also extend the freedom of information act to public services provided by private companies, to allow journalists and campaigners to scrutinise taxpayer-funded contracts. And Reeves will promise the creation of a new integrity and ethics commission to “guarantee standards in government”. “While this Tory government has denied key workers in our public services a pay rise, they paid 900 management consultants at Deloitte £1,000 a day to work on test and trace,” she is to say. “The beating heart of our country is the key workers who have kept us going through this last year. That’s why we applauded them. Children weren’t banging pots and pans for management consultants. They were clapping our key workers.” An investigation by the National Audit Office found the government had not always made available sufficient documentation to allow scrutiny of procurement decisions made during the pandemic. “The lack of adequate documentation means we cannot give assurance that government has adequately mitigated the increased risks arising from emergency procurement or applied appropriate commercial practices in all cases,” the NAO said. “While we recognise that these were exceptional circumstances, there are standards that the public sector will always need to apply if it is to maintain public trust.” As a backbencher, Reeves chaired the business select committee’s inquiry into the chaotic collapse of the construction firm Carillion, which held more than 400 public sector contracts. Her speech comes as Labour councils urge the government to hand more powers to local authorities to tackle unemployment and kickstart their economies, instead of relying solely on the private sector. Analysis by the Local Government Association Labour group suggests 5.4 million people are either furloughed or claiming jobseeker’s allowance in England. More than 1.1 million of those are in the capital, with other hard-hit areas including Birmingham (140,000), Leeds (76,000) and Manchester (68,000). The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is expected to extend the furlough scheme in next month’s budget, but as Covid restrictions are lifted and the scheme unwound in the coming months firms will have to decide whether to bring staff back into full-time employment. The LGA Labour group’s leader, Nick Forbes of Newcastle city council, said: “Councils want to do everything we can to fire local economies and create opportunities. From test and trace to PPE we’ve seen government make the wrong calls throughout this crisis because they have repeatedly refused to trust local communities to take decisions that work for their area. “We have the local knowledge, the networks and the on-the-ground understanding and up-to-date information you need in a crisis – that’s why government should give us the space we need to fight for local jobs.” A Conservative party spokesperson said: “Throughout the pandemic British businesses have worked with our public services to help in the fight against coronavirus by delivering a wide variety of support, including PPE, hand sanitiser and ventilators. “Yet at every turn throughout the pandemic, Labour have tried to play politics and score political points.”"
2021-02-07T15:07:40Z,politics,Politics,UK importers brace for 'disaster' as new Brexit customs checks loom,"British firms are warning of an escalation in Brexit red tape as the government prepares to introduce a long list of new controls on imports from the European Union in April and July. In the coming months further checks are due to be phased in at the UK border, controlling everything from the import of sausages and live mussels to horses and trees, along with new rules on the locations these checks can take place. One logistics firm warned the situation had “disaster written all over it”, saying businesses need more time to prepare, while accountancy firm KPMG said some of the “biggest headaches” facing traders are yet to come. Importers fear British customs are not ready for the new controls, and that logjams at points of entry could cause fruit and vegetable shortages in the spring.
Much of the focus on Brexit trade since January has been on UK exports, as the EU imposed its customs checks immediately – with hauliers reporting that the volume of exports going through British ports to the EU fell 68% last month compared with January 2020. However, the British government chose a phased approach, postponing the introduction of certain import procedures by three to six months. These grace periods were designed to give businesses more time to adapt to the new rules and ways of working, but many are set to expire shortly. The next big change is due on 1 April, when British customs will begin controlling imports of animal products, including fishery produce and live bivalve molluscs such as mussels; food considered high-risk such as mince and sausages; and plants and plant products. These checks, known as sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) controls, mean all the correct documentation is needed for each consignment arriving in Great Britain, including import forms and health certificates signed by vets. More changes occur in July, as traders moving goods must make their full customs declarations on entering , rather than submitting forms at a later date. In addition, imports will have to enter the UK at specific locations known as border control posts. More changes affecting certification and regulations of items such as medical devices have been given a longer transition period, until January 2022 and the start of 2023 in some cases. The meat processing industry is concerned about April. “If we have as much trouble importing as we are having exporting it could be quite challenging,” said Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association. The overwhelming majority of meat processors’ trade is with EU countries: the UK imports pork and beef from the continent, while exporting products including beef and lamb – a two-way trade worth £8.2bn a year to the British economy. Once the grace periods end, if the paperwork accompanying a meat shipment is missing or incorrect, it cannot travel to its destination. Hold-ups at European ports because of problems with documentation for exports from the UK led to containers of British meat left rotting on the dock at Rotterdam. “Delays cost money. If you have a lorry held up for 30 hours unexpectedly that causes a nightmare problem logistically,” Allen said. “Someone is waiting for that delivery, possibly waiting for it to go on the shelves and it is stuck on the port while someone gets the paperwork right.”
Allen warns that repeated delays could lead to the loss of business: “In time, if you consistently fail to deliver, customers start to look elsewhere.” The prospect of empty shelves is “shocking” for artisan cheese retailer La Fromagerie. After 30 years sourcing specialist French and Italian cheeses to sell in her London stores and to UK customers online, Brexit has left Patricia Michelson facing added import taxes and duties. “If things don’t improve I can see prices going up in April by 10% to 15%. Transporters put their price up straightaway by 15%,” Michelson said. “We will have to see if it is viable or not going forward, or not get as many cheeses as we used to.” Since the start of the year, hauliers bringing freight from the EU into Britain have been able to complete their customs declarations up to six months after delivery. These delayed declarations are no longer allowed after June. This could lead to big problems, warns Adam Shuter, joint managing director of Exact Logistics, a transportation firm which specialises in delivering goods from Germany – from car parts and napkins to tea and trees – to their final destination in Britain. Based in Rugby, the firm has been “snowed under” since beginning customs clearance in January and is taking on more staff. “From July everything will have to be cleared at the point it arrives in the UK and in my opinion that has got disaster written all over it,” Shuter said. “I don’t think the systems are robust enough to be able to process the information quickly enough”. Shuter believes the government should extend the grace period until the systems can cope and traders are used to the new regime and paperwork. However, not everyone is convinced an extension is the answer. Border checks will need to be introduced at some stage, to prevent leaving Britain open to fraud or smuggling, and to comply with wider World Trade Organization (WTO) standards. From July, goods entering the UK must be checked at official border control posts, of which there are currently 36. Some firms fear there will not be enough manpower on the borders.
There is “trepidation” ahead of the new procedures, said Jonathan Whittemore, head of production and procurement at Johnsons of Whixley, a wholesale nursery in North Yorkshire. It imports plants and trees from the Netherlands and Belgium to sell to landscaping firms. “How are these checks at border control posts going to work? If you unload 80 boxes from a lorry, where do you put them to inspect them? If we are talking about the docks at Killingholme, how on Earth are they going to manage to do that?”
The new checks and processes could mean that “some of the biggest headaches for hauliers and companies which import are definitely yet to come,” says Tim Sarson, a tax partner at accountancy firm KPMG. The introduction of animal and plant inspections in April coincides awkwardly with the time of year when Britain starts to import more groceries from southern Europe. “You’ve got SPS checks which are slowing things down just as you’ve got volumes ramping up from Europe, if there are going to be shortages of fresh fruit and veg, that is when it is likely to happen,” Sarson said. Import controls will be introduced “in stages as planned”, said a government spokesperson. “Government stands ready to help businesses keep their goods flowing smoothly,” they added. • This article was amended on 8 February 2021 to clarify some text relating to UK and GB imports."
2021-02-07T14:07:24Z,politics,Politics,EU and UK 'acting like absentee landlord' over Brexit in Northern Ireland,"The EU and UK have behaved like an “absentee landlord” in relation to Northern Ireland, an expert on Brexit in the region has said, as a new report by the Institute for Government has warned of more conflict across all issues “if the UK fails to manage the relationship” with Brussels. Under the Brexit trade deal more than 20 committees and bodies are supposed to be set up to cement a working post-Brexit relationship on everything from fishing to energy supplies and aviation deals. A further dozen or so were due to be created following the signing of the Northern Ireland protocol a year ago, and it is the failure to set up these management structures that is being seen as the cause of rising tensions in the region that led to the withdrawal of Brexit staff at ports last week. “The protocol is not an easy thing to start up with a click of the fingers. But there has been this sense of an absentee landlord with all these rules coming into play and with no means of direct engagement to help manage the consequences of it,” said Katy Hayward, a professor of sociology at Queen’s University in Belfast and a former adviser to the government’s now defunct Brexit department. “The main concern of the European commission has been to demonstrate and prove to other member states that the single market is being protected,” she said, adding that such a one-dimensional approach had been a misfit for Northern Ireland, a region still going through a post-conflict peace process that the EU itself had put to the fore of negotiations. The report by the Institute for Government on managing the UK’s relationship with the EU makes a similar point on the wider Brexit relationship and says the structures for management need to be put in place urgently. Bronwen Maddox, the thinktank’s director, described it in a podcast on Saturday as like “the hidden wiring was missing”. The institute says the committees will serve as platforms for expert and on-the-ground reporting which will act, in Northern Ireland’s case, as an early warning system to head off problems before they arise. Its report says “the government appears inclined at every turn to downplay the significance of the UK’s relationship with the EU – and to have a preference for dealing bilaterally with individual member states rather than with the EU institutions. “It may also fear that creating an overelaborate bureaucracy to manage the EU relationship would produce a mindset where the EU looms larger in internal thinking than it needs to. “The government wanted a Canada-style agreement with the EU but … Brussels will never regard the UK as simply Toronto on Thames – and if the UK fails to manage the relationship well it may find it ends up with more conflicts with the EU than if it had spent more time thinking in advance about the issue.” Under the Northern Ireland protocol a working consultative group was supposed to have been set up to feed into the UK-EU joint committee overseeing the implementation of Brexit. But although the protocol was signed off more than a year ago it was never set up, leading to the rigorous application of it that has led to restrictions on food, pets and plants, all of which has been seized upon by loyalist communities and others as evidence of separation from Great Britain. But Hayward says there are solutions for Michael Gove and the European commission vice-president, Maroš Šefčovič, who will meet next week, with part of the protocol explicitly allowing for an easing of controls at ports. Article 6.2 of the protocol states the committee shall regard Northern Ireland’s “integral place in the United Kingdom’s internal market” and make “best endeavours to facilitate trade between Northern Ireland and the other parts of the UK”. It adds that the ease of trade between Northern Ireland and the UK shall be kept under constant review and the committee can at any time make “appropriate recommendations with a view to avoiding controls at the ports and the airports of Northern Ireland to the extent possible”. Hayward said: “The hope would be that those EU observers could recognise the nature of the situation and would be able to see where there could be flexibility and pragmatism.” • The headline and text of this article were amended on 7 February 2021 to better reflect Prof Hayward’s comments."
2021-02-07T08:00:05Z,politics,Politics,Crunch time for SNP as Sturgeon and Salmond’s rift comes under scrutiny,"As Alex Salmond exchanged a modest elbow bump with his QC, Gordon Jackson, following his acquittal on 13 charges of sexual assault at Edinburgh’s high court, the backdrop was a desolate Royal Mile, emptied of its usual tourist bustle by the encroaching pandemic last March. The verdict in the nine-day trial of Scotland’s former first minister, who led the country to the brink of independence, ought to have dominated headlines for days: instead it was relegated within hours as a nationwide lockdown was announced. A year later, with two inquiries into the Scottish government’s handling of the initial claims of sexual harassment that led to Salmond’s trial reaching their conclusion, that sense of multiple realities remains. Here is a Holyrood committee charged with scrutinising the Scottish government’s botched handling of the complaints, continually frustrated by that government’s delayed and incomplete evidence. Here is the SNP, after a decade in power, on course to win a landslide majority in May’s election. Here is a first minister, under investigation by Ireland’s former director of public prosecutions, James Hamilton, over whether she lied to parliament about when she first knew about the allegations and breached the ministerial code by failing to report meetings with Salmond, which would require her resignation. Here is Nicola Sturgeon, whose already impressive trust ratings have soared over the past 12 months thanks to her perceived competence and humanity in handling the coronavirus pandemic: research last week by YouGov for the Times found she has a net approval rating of +21 in Scotland, compared with Salmond at -60 rating, worse even than Boris Johnson’s -54. “Of course the general public have been prioritising Covid,” says Jackie Baillie, Labour MSP and a Holyrood committee member, “and this work is difficult to explain and full of intricacies, but the institutions of government need to be held to account.” The next two weeks will see the principal actors give their evidence under oath as the committee hurries on to complete its report before the election recess begins on 25 March. Hamilton is also expected to publish his findings by then. But in the latest twist, Salmond has signalled he may not attend his long-awaited appearance this Tuesday, following a row over the committee’s refusal to publish his key submission, in which he claims Sturgeon lied to parliament and broke the ministerial code, because of legal constraints. Salmond branded the decision “farcical” and is reportedly considering holding a press conference instead. Salmond has claimed that officials close to Sturgeon and her husband, Peter Murrell, chief executive of the SNP, were involved in a conspiracy to bolster the government and police investigation, and had pushed complainants into giving evidence. In a submission to the committee last week, he branded the behaviour of the current Scottish government a disgrace, and accused the country’s most senior civil servant, Leslie Evans, of having a bias against him. The following week, it should be the turn of Sturgeon, who has had three scheduled appearances postponed. She has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and suggested the former SNP leader is angry with her because she “didn’t collude with him to make these allegations go away”. And on Monday, the day before Salmond, Murrell is to give further evidence after MSPs agreed to use compulsion powers if he refused. He is expected to be questioned about text and WhatsApp messages about the investigations, which he has previously said under oath do not exist.
Those close to Sturgeon describe her mood as bullish, after nearly two years of not being able to answer in detail the charges laid against her. A spokesperson for the first minster said that – while she accepts such scrutiny is entirely legitimate she had been subjected to “a litany of smear, innuendo and outright falsehoods” and would relish the opportunity to set the record straight. “It is obvious to any reasonable person that these conspiracy theories are an attempt to deflect, but they cause real distress and risk making it harder for women who suffer harassment to come forward in future. The first minister’s view is such nonsense should no longer be indulged.” She may well be interrogated on the charge that she lied to parliament. Sturgeon previously told the Holyrood chamber she first heard about allegations of sexual misconduct at a meeting with Salmond at her home on 2 April 2018. It has since emerged that she was told about them by his former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein, in her office a few days before on 29 March, a meeting Sturgeon has said in written evidence she had forgotten about. Various factors had made the committee’s work frustrating, said Baillie: “The obstruction of the Scottish government in terms of delayed and redacted evidence; third parties leaking information to the media before it comes to committee; and more widely my concern that the Holyrood parliament does not have the powers to hold the executive to account.” She is especially concerned that, she argues, there has been no opportunity to judge whether the Scottish government’s sexual harassment policy is fit for purpose, because of its ongoing refusal to provide the committee with sight of its legal advice for the judicial review of the process, brought by Salmond, which found the investigation to be “unlawful” and “tainted with apparent bias” in January 2019. “They say the judicial review was conceded on a technical point about the independence of the investigating officer, but they also took legal advice on the policy itself, which would tell us whether that policy is sound for the future.” Among the SNP membership, there is a significant intersection between those who have spoken publicly in support of Salmond, those who are critical of what they consider to be a cautious leadership strategy on a second referendum, and those who have concerns about the Scottish government’s plans for transgender legal reform. The sacking of Joanna Cherry from the party’s Westminster front bench brought these tensions to the fore last week. Now Scotland, a new national membership organisation for the independence movement, was launched on Friday to create space for activists to come together beyond the current “toxic divisions”, said co-founder and former SNP MP George Kerevan. “The Salmond inquiry has clearly caused people to take sides, and there is a clash of political generations. Many people who joined the SNP post-referendum barely knew who Alex Salmond was and view him as ‘yesterday’s man’. Those pro-Salmond tend to be the old vanguard of SNP activists who campaigned for the party in the early years when the independence movement was tiny.”
There are others who question whether the irreparable rift between Salmond and Sturgeon translates into a similar split in the party. One prominent Glasgow activist explains: “Before the trial, I’d say it was 50/50 in terms of those who believed him and those who didn’t. But a year on there’s been a real shift. People are angry with him now: he had his day in court, things are going well for the party despite the pandemic, so why can’t he move on?” More widely, she says, many activists have concerns that the adversarial nature of the inquiry and its coverage will make women think twice about coming forward. Although Salmond said in his own evidence at trial that he should have been “more careful with people’s personal space”, while civil servants told the court they tried to reinforce the practice of not allowing female officials to work alone with him, since the verdicts the female complainants have been subject to relentless abuse and exposure online. Last week, a number of these women attacked the committee and the Crown Office after their private messages about the case were released to the Scottish parliament. In a statement released by Rape Crisis Scotland, the group, understood to be SNP figures, said that releasing the texts could have “grave consequences” for future reporting if people feared their private correspondence could be disclosed. (The committee is now understood to be seeking the release of further messages, which may include texts from Murrell to SNP officials). Sandy Brindley, the chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland, told the Observer: “We should be in no doubt that this is having a very real and significant impact on many survivors across Scotland and beyond. For an issue so important to descend into game playing and political manoeuvring is so destructive and damaging”. Recent polling for YouGov found that, while a significant proportion of Scots do not believe either Salmond or Sturgeon’s accounts so far, many more believe Sturgeon. Only 13% believe Salmond has generally told the truth, compared with 50% who say he has not, while 30% say Sturgeon has generally told the truth, versus 36% who say this is not the case. Crucially, SNP voters strongly take Sturgeon’s side, with 49% believing she has generally been telling the truth, and only 13% believing she has not. These numbers are reversed for Salmond: only 14% think the former first minister has generally told the truth, while 42% disagree. Sir John Curtice, analyst and professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said Sturgeon should be more concerned about vaccine rollout. “The UK government has cottoned on to the fact that their perceived handling of the pandemic is worse than Scotland, and are clearly trying hard to politicise the issue to damage Sturgeon. For most members of the public, when they are getting the vaccine is the much more salient issue. “All the polling shows that Sturgeon is an invaluable asset to the SNP,” said Curtice. “YouGov also found that one third of people say, frankly, they don’t know who is telling the truth. She will have to give a good account of herself but she starts with the advantage that people are more likely to believe her.”"
2021-02-07T07:00:04Z,politics,Politics,From fashion to farming: how Brexit is hitting Britain's trade,"Fashion “Since Brexit, sales to EU countries have rapidly declined,” says Rachael Attwood Hamard, the managing director of Britannical. The luxury children’s clothing brand is just one member of the UK’s £35bn fashion industry, which is warning that gaps in the Brexit trade deal could be devastating for businesses from retail and manufacturing to modelling and design talent. Complex VAT charges and handling fees now in place have led shoppers in Europe to stop ordering or to reject deliveries. Some brands and retailers have ceased selling across the Channel because it is no longer profitable.
Veteran designer Katharine Hamnett warns “British brands will die” without a “radical overhaul” of customs arrangements with the EU, including VAT rules. Sandal-maker Álvaro says the European market is “now practically shut” because of the new tax regime, while it had waited more than seven weeks for a shipment of components to a supplier in Florence held up by paperwork. Tamara Cincik, chief executive of Fashion Roundtable, which organised an open letter to the government last week – signed by more than 450 industry members – said: “Pre-pandemic [the UK fashion industry] was growing 11% year on year. But there is a real risk of it being utterly decimated from the gaps in the Brexit trade deal and UK government policy.” Additional red tape and taxes plus restrictions on travel in Europe for work risk an exodus of talent. UK manufacturers and designers say they have suffered delays and additional costs on shipping materials, samples or components to and from Europe. Meanwhile, the UK’s model industry, worth about £250m, fears losing talent and bookings because of the paperwork now involved in travelling to work. John Horner, the boss of Models 1, said a quarter of his business comes from Europe, and that was now at risk, with many other agencies set to lose out even more. Sarah Butler Fish The fishing industry is a tiny part of the UK economy, worth about 0.02% of the total, but its huge symbolic value meant it was a key factor in negotiating the Brexit trade deal. In announcing the deal on Christmas Eve, Boris Johnson hailed it as a triumph for the sector. “For the first time since 1973, we will be an independent coastal state with full control of our waters,” he said. But in the past few weeks, UK fishers have talked of betrayal as they came up against new customs arrangements. Sales to European markets – which accounted for nearly half the UK fishing fleet’s total catch in 2019 – stalled, and the price of many species plummeted, forcing boats to tie up in harbour or land their catches in EU ports. Scottish fishers have landed their catches in Denmark in order to avoid bureaucracy, and many are selling less than 10% of their normal trade. Ian Perkes, a fish exporter based in Brixham in Devon, told NBC he had lost thousands of pounds in sales because of red tape. Delays have been a critical issue for highly perishable produce. One Welsh shellfish exporter told the BBC that a lorry containing nearly £50,000 of lobsters, prawns and crabs had been delayed by 30 hours en route to Spain. An extra complication for shellfish exporters is the EU’s requirement that “live bivalve molluscs” – including mussels, oysters, scallops and clams – can be imported from non-EU states only if they come from the highest-quality waters. This has become an issue since the UK left the EU. After UK fish exporters travelled to Westminster to protest, warning that their livelihoods were threatened, the government announced a £23m compensation scheme. One trade group described it as a “sticking plaster”. In 2018, there were about 12,000 fishers in the UK and the sector was worth £784m. Harriet Sherwood
Music International tours stopped with the pandemic, along with all live public performances, but Brexit now puts their return in question. The calendar of gigs, concerts and festivals was a financial motor for an industry that contributed £5.8bn to the economy in 2019. But new regulations and costs are prohibitive for emerging talent and for lower-paid orchestral musicians, according to many performers. Visas, work permits and instrument carnets required for EU countries mean more paperwork and costs each trip. The changes also affect the wider industry, which supports the income of roadies and sound and lighting engineers. Culture secretary Oliver Dowden held a crisis meeting with Sir Elton John last week. The singer and composer warned that if the situation were not resolved it would affect young people’s careers and “stunt their growth and their creativity”. Musicians’ unions called this weekend for new provisions for short-term work, customs and large touring vehicles. Their research shows that 44% of British musicians earn a substantial proportion of their income in the EU. Last month Sir Elton John, Ed Sheeran and Sir Simon Rattle were among famous signatories to an open letter signed by over 100 musicians , claiming the Brexit deal had “shamefully failed” the sector. Rattle is leaving his role as music director of the London Symphony Orchestra to return to Germany. 283,000 people also signed a petition for visa free travel for touring professionals. Ministers initially argued a “no visas” policy for musicians would be incompatible with the government’s promise to “take back control” of UK borders. The government has also since claimed that the EU turned down a British proposal to allow musicians to continue to tour with ease. The EU denies this, saying the British suggestion was not workable. Vanessa Thorpe Flowers Brexit is already starting to add to the costs and stress borne by Britain’s florists as they prepare millions of bouquets for Valentine’s Day. One of the country’s largest independent flower and plant wholesalers, Tom Brown Wholesale, says a range of factors, including Brexit, have pushed flower prices up by around 9% year on year. John Davidson, the firm’s finance director, says the sector is facing a perfect storm: “Covid has meant growers are producing less, the cost of freight has gone up and Brexit has created all sorts of logistical issues, with documentation for flowers and checks on plants. And that comes with costs attached.” Davidson adds that the cut-off times to purchase flowers from Holland are now earlier to allow for documentation to be processed. Plants face even longer delays because consignments need to be checked for pests and diseases. From April flowers will also need to be inspected before they can be loaded on lorries destined for the UK. “This may delay bringing flowers into the country,” adds Davidson. While there are zero tariffs on EU produce, flowers grown outside Europe face 8% tariffs. This is a big issue for the industry. Around 30% of 1.5 million stems of flowers Davidson’s company imports from Holland every month originate from outside the EU. “Most people think all the flowers are coming from Holland but really it is a hub with an auction. A lot of these flowers are coming from Africa and South America,” he says. “Some of that tariff would need to be passed on to florists and then on to customers. You can’t just ignore 8% and it’s come at a really bad time.” Tom Wall Bees Last year, Murray McGregor travelled to northern Italy to collect more than 1,000 packages of bees. It is a road trip he has been making every spring for many years. On his way back to Scotland he drops off pre-ordered packages to bee farmers at motorway service stations throughout England. But he won’t be making the trip this year. As the owner of Denrosa Apiaries in Perthshire, McGregor runs the largest bee-farming operation in the UK, with 4,500 hives and an annual turnover of £1m. The impact of Brexit, he says, is “quite significant”. “For any beekeeper with 200 hives or more, they have to import equipment from Europe because the cost of buying a fully assembled hive is less than the cost of just the wood in this country,” he says. “And if they export any honey it will be less competitive.” While the majority of the UK’s 25,000 beekeepers are hobbyists with a few hives in their garden or on an allotment, there are close on 500 commercial bee farmers, whose 72,000 hives pollinate fruits and crops in our orchards and fields and account for most of the 6,600 tonnes of honey produced each year in the UK. These bee farmers have been badly hit by Brexit. Many rely on imported bees from Italy and the Czech Republic to expand their business, or replenish hives that have died over winter (which can be as many as a third), but this trade, which brought in more than 2,000 packages of bees in 2020, has now been banned. In addition, most of their hives and other equipment come from Europe and the cost of materials has increased along with import costs and paperwork. And Scottish heather honey producers, who make most of their income from sales to Germany and Scandinavia, fear that export costs could make their produce 20% more expensive and price them out of the market. Although queen bees can still be imported from Europe, they are currently subject to “unworkable restrictions”, says the Bee Farmers Association. It sent a letter last month to environment secretary George Eustice, asking for clarity. Rob Nickless, BFA chairman, says: “The UK beekeeping industry needs answers now.” Alison Benjamin Farming Farmers have faced a “perfect storm” since the beginning of the year, with Covid infections in the industry crashing into new Brexit border bureaucracy. For meat exporters, the perishability of their product is an added complication. Last week the National Farmers’ Union and the National Pig Association revealed that, since 1 January, no cattle, sheep or goats have left the UK for mainland EU markets. The pig sector has been hit particularly hard. The NPA will meet the farming and fisheries minister, Victoria Prentis, on Tuesday to discuss what its chairman, Richard Lister, described as a “serious threat to our industry”. Higher costs due to new red tape, falling prices and a shrinking market mean most pig processors expect to make a loss in the first quarter of this year, Lister said in a letter to environment secretary George Eustice. Bureaucratic delays in the first weeks of 2021 led to pig exports dropping by 75% of normal volume. Farmers face the extra costs of feeding an estimated 100,000 pigs stuck in the UK. The NPA says its members have reported delays at ports as a result of new checks and forms, “making UK shipments unattractive to buyers in the EU, forcing processors to reject shipments and cancel future orders”. Farmers say that while the UK is phasing in new customs requirements for EU imports over six months, the EU has not reciprocated. Meanwhile there have been a number of Covid outbreaks at pork processing plants. Production was halted at Scotland’s biggest pork processing plant in Brechin two weeks ago after several workers tested positive for the virus. The National Sheep Association said its members have also been adversely affected since the UK left the EU, with new paperwork requirements costing £1.20 per lamb. Almost half a million people work directly in UK farming – about 97,000 in meat processing, almost two-thirds of them EU nationals.

2021-02-07T07:00:04Z,politics,Politics,The growing Brexit threat to Ireland,"The union jack flew proudly on Friday over the Victoria Orange Hall, a community centre in the Northern Irish port of Larne. Ferries arrived and trucks rolled off. In many ways it appeared to be business – and trade – as usual. But tensions have been high in recent days because of post-Brexit border issues. Across much of Northern Ireland, supermarkets are struggling to fill shelves because exporters from Great Britain were unprepared for new checks – so consignments have not arrived. Then 10 days ago the European commission waded in, in the clumsiest of manners, threatening to invoke the “last resort” article 16 clause of the Brexit withdrawal agreement so it could set up border checks to prevent the UK government using Northern Ireland as a back door route to secure EU supplies of the Covid-19 vaccine. All sides were enraged and the commission backed off. Opinion on the streets of Larne is divided as to what all this talk of land and sea borders means.
Two ladies out for a stroll, Ivy and Sandy, said there were “no bad vibes in the town” and that tensions over the Northern Ireland protocol – which the DUP now wants scrapped because it creates a border in the Irish Sea – would die down. But Joseph, in his late 60s, was more worried. There has been graffiti suggesting the unionists had been cheated. “We were sold a pup. “We were told to vote for this and were promised we would remain part of the UK, but we’re not part of the UK – how can we be if they can’t import food and goods from Scotland? How can they say there’s not a border in the Irish Sea when firms are having to fill out 80 pages of paperwork for whatever they’re shipping? “Some people are not telling the truth, and there is a strong feeling about it. There’s always ‘them’ in the background,” he said before heading off on his daily exercise round the town. On Wednesday at prime minister’s questions, the DUP’s Ian Paisley Jnr told Boris Johnson in a chilling intervention that “the protocol has betrayed us and has made us feel like foreigners in our own country”. He asked Johnson: “Will you legislate, if necessary, to remove the impediments to trade in Northern Ireland? Will you be a man of your word and allow businessmen in my constituency to bin the unnecessary documentation that you told us we could bin? Prime minister, be the Unionist we need you to be.”
Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, which represents all types of manufacturers in Northern Ireland, many of whom have been struggling with the new rules, says views on Brexit inevitably feed into wider historic divisions. “Everything in Northern Ireland is viewed through an identity filter. Unionism is fundamentally opposed to the protocol because it means that Northern Ireland is different to the rest of the UK whereas nationalism and the moderate middle ground is fundamentally opposed to Brexit and supportive of the protocol.” One security source predicted it would take strong leadership to undo the damage caused by the commission’s article 16 blunder. The source said the EU had always tried to occupy the moral high ground, insisting it would do every everything to protect the Good Friday agreement “and then they go and trigger 16, which blew everything out of the water. “How do you get back to a position where the adults in the room are acting in a way that brings more stability and not undermining what little stability there is.” The consequences of Brexit on the island of Ireland are – because of its history – uniquely politically charged. But just over a month after the UK left the EU, the economic effects of leaving are hitting people and their businesses equally hard across the whole country. The extra bureaucracy, customs checks and added costs of sending goods to the EU, and receiving them from the continent, have taken many by surprise. Farmers have been unable to export livestock to the continent since 1 January. Fishermen can’t sell fresh fish into the EU because it goes off before it can get there – despite the fact that fishing communities were told Brexit would be their salvation after decades of struggle and decline. The fashion industry warns of dire consequences because of VAT and other issues hitting their business; musicians and their crews say they can’t plan tours to the EU because of problems with work permits and visas. Even flowers from the Netherlands, it seems, could be more expensive this year on Valentine’s Day. With the pandemic and efforts to vaccinate an entire population dominating the news, the damage to the UK economy is not hitting headlines in the way it would in normal times. But the figures are startling and everyone seems to have a story about parcels delayed at borders. The Road Haulage Association has revealed to the Observer, after surveying its membership, that UK exports to the EU were down a staggering 68% in January compared to the same period in 2020. Richard Burnett, chief executive of the RHA says he is “very frustrated” because his organisation warned of the problems all of last year but the government did not listen sufficiently, and is still failing to do so now. Many hundreds of UK companies are now planning to move operations into the EU, so they can distribute their goods more easily within the single market. Some have halted all exports to the EU. The governments of several EU countries are seeking to lure British businesses with financial incentives. Kelly says that trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland has picked up again since early January but in part because exporters are choosing to go through NI to get goods to the Republic, whose imports from the UK are said to be down 60%. Companies in Northern Ireland are increasingly sourcing goods locally and from countries other than the UK. “The fundamental challenge here is that the UK’s position as a centre of distribution for these islands is greatly diminished by Brexit and people are choosing other routes so we would have a lot of manufacturers here who would now source from the EU and get things delivered direct,” Kelly says. Stability is threatened in Northern Ireland, UK exports to the EU have fallen off a cliff, many UK businesses are moving jobs and operations abroad, fishing communities feel betrayed. As one managing director of a small UK company, which has had to cease all exports to the EU put it: “We expected difficulties but the range of issues Brexit has created across the board for us and so many others is completely off the scale.”"
2021-02-06T21:00:52Z,politics,Politics,Fury at Gove as exports to EU slashed by 68% since Brexit,"The volume of exports going through British ports to the EU fell by a staggering 68% last month compared with January last year, mostly as a result of problems caused by Brexit, the Observer can reveal. The dramatic drop in the volume of traffic carried on ferries and through the Channel tunnel has been reported to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove by the Road Haulage Association after a survey of its international members. In a letter to Gove dated 1 February, the RHA’s chief executive, Richard Burnett, also told the minister he and his officials had repeatedly warned over several months of problems and called for measures to lessen difficulties – but had been largely ignored. In particular he had made clear throughout last year there was an urgent need to increase the number of customs agents to help firms with mountains of extra paperwork. The number now, around 10,000, is still about a fifth of what the RHA says is required to handle the massive increase in paperwork facing exporters. Burnett told the Observer that in addition to the 68% fall-off in exports, about 65%-75% of vehicles that had come over from the EU were going back empty because there were no goods for them to return with, due to hold-ups on the UK side, and because some UK companies had either temporarily or permanently halted exports to the EU. “I find it deeply frustrating and annoying that ministers have chosen not to listen to the industry and experts,” he said.
Contact with Gove had been limited and had achieved little over recent months. “Michael Gove is the master of extracting information from you and giving nothing back,” he said. “He responds on WhatsApp and says he got the letter but no written response comes. Pretty much every time we have written over the last six months he has not responded in writing. He tends to get officials to start working on things. But the responses are a complete waste of time because they don’t listen to what the issues were that we raised in the first place.” According to the House of Commons library, UK exports to the EU were £294bn in 2019 (43% of all UK exports) while UK imports from the EU were £374bn (52% of the total). The overwhelming majority of exports to the EU from the UK go through ports rather than by air. Richard Ballantyne, chief executive of the British Ports Association, said the 68% figure sounded “broadly in line” with his impressions of the drop-off in traffic. He said some but not all of the problems with extra paperwork that caused delays could be overcome in time, although he warned some businesses on both sides would look for new markets rather than try to deal with the added friction. Ballantyne also predicted a new set of difficulties in months to come as the infrastructure needed at the point when the UK introduces full import checks on goods from the EU on 1 July would not, in his view, be ready in time. This raised the prospect of a whole new set of issues affecting imports. As part of the Brexit arrangements, the government decided to offer a six-month grace period, meaning the full range of physical checks would not be needed on imports until July. Trade experts said part of the reason for the sharp fall in exports was the coincidence of Brexit and the pandemic. But several heads of trade bodies fear worse is to come. Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, the body for companies that move and store frozen and chilled foods, said: “As we look to April through to July what really worries me is we face a perfect storm. “We will have an economy looking to come out of lockdown at the same time as the UK is imposing a range of import controls on EU business that may be no more prepared than UK businesses have been – and possibly less so – and a supply chain that is incredibly reluctant to service the UK. The full Brexit crisis that we were predicting could well come into effect at that point.” In recent weeks hundreds of UK companies have decided either to halt exports to the EU or to set up warehouses or subsidiaries within the EU so they can distribute goods more easily. Ministers say most of the Brexit-relating issues facing businesses are “teething problems”, although Michael Gove has accepted that those affecting Northern Ireland are more serious. A government spokesperson said: “We have had intensive engagement with the road haulage industry for many months and are still facilitating a daily call with representative groups. “We do not recognise the figure provided on exports. Thanks to the hard work of hauliers and traders to prepare for change, disruption at the border has so far been minimal and freight movements are now close to normal levels, despite the Covid-19 pandemic. “We will continue to work constructively with the RHA as we adjust to our new relationship with the EU and seize the opportunities of Brexit.”"
2021-02-06T06:35:16Z,politics,Politics,US return to the world stage presents huge opportunity for Britain,"Joe Biden’s promise that the US is back on the world stage as an advocate of multilateralism holds huge opportunities for the UK so long as it steps up a gear diplomatically, uses its presidency of the G7 well and shifts its stance in the Middle East. In the short term, Biden’s promise to end support for offensive operations in Yemen has led to calls for the UK to suspend its arms sales to Saudi Arabia, including from the Conservative chair of the defence select committee, Tobias Ellwood, and the shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy. The devil will be in the detail as to what the US means by offensive, as opposed to defensive operations, but at the very least, the Biden decision, accompanied by the appointment of a new special envoy is an implied rebuke to the way in which diplomacy to end the conflict had ground to a near halt. The UK is the penholder on Yemen at the UN and the UN special envoy for Yemen, Marin Griffiths, is British, but simply to blame UK lethargy or Saudi intransigence solely for the failure to make progress on Yemen is to underestimate the difficulties diplomats have faced in bringing the many sides, including the Houthi rebels,to the negotiating table. Saudi Arabia may be deemed the culprit in initially intervening in a civil war in March 2015 that they thought would only take months to end after the Houthis had captured the capital, Sana’a. But the consensus is now that Riyadh would like the war to be brought to a close, and a power sharing government formed. The large number of missiles hurled across the border to Saudi Arabia by the Houthi forces however makes that harder. It remains to be seen if the US regards the Yemen civil war as a compartmentalised problem, or part of a wider rethink of US support for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, part of the Saudi-led coalition. One test will be whether the administration sticks by its pledge to reveal its intelligence on the murder of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia’s Ankara consulate. New governments start with big ambitions, and if the US could bring Saudi Arabia and Iran together to end their near 40-year race to the bottom that would be seismic. But much will depend on whether the Europeans, including the British, can help the US find a way back into the nuclear deal that Donald Trump left, and then into a wider discussion about Iran’s relations with its neighbours. The current forecasts in European capitals are gloomy, and Biden made no mention of Iran in his speech. Britain will however be delighted that Biden moved so clearly on Russia, set out a balanced approach to China and committed himself so forcefully on the climate crisis. The good fortune of the UK’s presidency of the G7 presents a lot of low hanging fruit on which the US and the UK can jointly graze. It is already noticeable that the UK is being hyperactive in organising joint G7 statements on issues such as the arrest of Alexei Navalny and the Myanmar coup. After a year in which the G7 under Trump was largely invisible, the UK can act as handmaiden to the return of multilateralism. Giving evidence to the defence select committee this week, Sir Kim Darroch the former UK ambassador, argued that the UK also now has specific policy opportunities. “Out of the EU it will be more straightforward for the UK to align with the US on Russia because there is always a temptation for Europeans to edge towards a more equidistant position between the US and Russia,” he suggested. Germany continued support for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, now opposed in the US, UK and France, looks vulnerable Equally on China, Biden gave a clear steer to Britain that he is not proposing in a full decoupling. Darroch summed it up: “We need to balance our need to challenge China on its trade practices, its military activities in the South China Sea and its human rights record, and wanting it as a partner on climate change. Getting those two working together is going to be a huge challenge”. He could have added the challenge is made harder given the strong anti-China mood on the backbenches. But it will not just be about policy; it will also be about commitment and style. In a Policy Exchange pamphlet this week, Ben Judah claimed the Washington embassy had been run down, and the UK was suffering an elite opinion crisis in the US. Judah said the Democrats view British influence as in a Brexit-induced decline and he partly laid this at the door of the British embassy’s communications strategy, At the defence select committee, Lord Darroch hit back, saying perceptions of Britain would largely depend on its economic performance. He also derided the advice he used to receive as ambassador. “We were getting almost daily communications advice from London on what we should be saying, mostly centred on the line ‘Brexit means Brexit’, and ‘Tell them that we will win the next meaningful vote’. “I and the embassy tried – I promise – exceptionally hard to present as positive a picture as possible, but against this background, it was, to understate matters, an uphill task. I think the idea that a different communications strategy would have turned this around and made the UK look great is, frankly, a bit of a fantasy.” But all sides seem to accept this is a turning point for Britain’s bilateral relationship. The US will lose Britain’s influence around the EU table, diminishing the breadth of the relationship, but that just requires the UK to work even harder to make itself useful to the US. The opportunity and the machinery is there, but it depends on a British political leadership to realise this."
2021-02-05T19:15:02Z,politics,Politics,‘Unbearable tension’: what have key Tories said about race?,"Boris Johnson’s senior adviser on ethnic minorities, Samuel Kasumu, wrote in a leaked letter of “unbearable” tension within Downing Street. Sources claim that the divisions centre on the way the government is trying to reset the debate around equality, and comments made by several individuals who have been promoted into key positions by Johnson. Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, told MPs in October: “Some schools have decided to openly support the anti-capitalist Black Lives Matter group, often fully aware that they have a statutory duty to be politically impartial. “We do not want teachers to teach their white pupils about white privilege and inherited racial guilt. Let me be clear that any school that teaches those elements of critical race theory as fact, or that promotes partisan political views such as defunding the police without offering a balanced treatment of opposing views, is breaking the law.” Tony Sewell, the newly appointed chair of the government’s commission on race and ethnic disparities, wrote in 2010: “What we now see in schools is children undermined by poor parenting, peer-group pressure and an inability to be responsible for their own behaviour. They are not subjects of institutional racism. They have failed their GCSEs because they did not do the homework, did not pay attention and were disrespectful to their teachers. Instead of challenging our children, we have given them the discourse of the victim – a sense that the world is against them and they cannot succeed.” Liz Truss, the minister for women and equalities, said in December that the equality debate should not be dominated by “protected characteristics” – age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation. “Too often, the equality debate has been dominated by a small number of unrepresentative voices, and by those who believe people are defined by their protected characteristic and not by their individual character. “Underlying this [approach] is the soft bigotry of low expectations, where people from certain backgrounds are never expected or considered able enough to reach high standards. “This diminishes individual humanity and dignity. Because when you choose on the basis of protected characteristics, you end up excluding people.” Munira Mirza, Boris Johnson’s race adviser, wrote in 2018 about the weaponisation of victimhood: “The common denominator with all these stories is the simplistic conclusions that we are supposed to draw. Men are beasts. Whites are oppressors. Britain is bad. “There are many other incidents of mistreatment or conflict in our society that never make headlines because they don’t feed these narratives. A trivial dispute between neighbours; an act of unkindness by a shopkeeper; a sick joke by a colleague – all bad but hardly worthy of general concern. Unless there is a ‘social justice’ angle that can be divined (or manufactured), no one else gets involved.”"
2021-02-05T19:00:20Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Cummings: Durham police reject dossier of evidence on lockdown journeys,"Durham police have rejected a 225-page dossier alleging that Dominic Cummings perverted the course of justice in his account of the lockdown journeys he made in the north-east of England at the height of the pandemic. After more than three months considering the allegations, which included claims of multiple breaches of the lockdown rules by Cummings and his wife, Mary Wakefield, the force has decided to take no further action. A former chief prosecutor for the north-west, Nazir Afzal, whose lawyers compiled the dossier, has vowed to carry on his legal fight, which includes launching a private prosecution against Cummings. “Justice takes time and I will carry on,” he said. Afzal’s dossier claimed that statements Cummings gave during a press conference in Downing Street’s rose garden on 25 May 2020 affected the course of justice, as they were made as Durham police’s investigation into his behaviour was already under way.
But the force has stood by its decision in May to take no further action after a three-day investigation. In a brief letter letter to Afzal’s lawyers, Durham’s deputy chief constable, Dave Orford, said: “We have considered all of the material provided. However, it does not change our decision from that outlined in our press release dated 28 May in respect of Mr Dominic Cummings and we take a similar view in relation to his wife Mary Wakefield.” That press release said Cummings may have breached lockdown rules by travelling to Barnard Castle on 12 April, but the force decided to take no further action and it made no finding on his decision to leave London for Durham. It also said there was “insufficient evidence” that Cummings travelled to Durham a second time on 19 April. In his rose garden statement, Cummings claimed he had evidence that proved he was in London that day. Boris Johnson told MPs that he had seen that evidence, but No 10 has refused repeated requests to release it. In August the Guardian and the Mirror revealed that four people had claimed seeing someone they believed to be Cummings in woods near Durham on the morning of 19 April. They included Dave and Clare Edwards, who gave statements to the police about the sighting at the same time Cummings was giving his rose garden statement. Afzal’s lawyers claimed the evidence they presented to the force, including new material from fresh witnesses, met the legal test for such a prosecution. Durham police disagreed. Orford’s letter said: “We do not consider the relevant tests are made out in relation to any potential offences raised within your submission. Therefore, Durham constabulary will be taking no further action.” In a statement, Afzal said Durham police’s decision was “hugely disappointing but not surprising”. He added: “It’s not clear from the letter that we received whether the views of the Crown Prosecution Service were sought at all. And you will know that we submitted a 225-page submission including new evidence, especially witness evidence, of an alleged third breach [the alleged trip on 19 April] that Mr Cummings has not previously revealed.” Discussing his options for possible broader action, Afzal said: “I am considering with my legal team what further avenues to pursue, because millions of you would want me to.” Asked if he was considering a private prosecution, Afzal said: “We shall explore all options and don’t rule out any.” He added: “We are nothing without the rule of law, and it applies to everybody or to nobody. When I learned that one of the architects of the rules that we all rightly had to comply [with] decided to ride a coach and horse through them, and that his political masters then decided to put a ring of steel around him, I had no choice but to do what I’ve done. “All the research tells us that that one act diminished public confidence in that lockdown. Justice takes time and I will carry on because you would want me to.” Cummings and Wakefield have been approached for comment."
2021-02-05T18:36:12Z,politics,Politics,"Equalities minister Kemi Badenoch must apologise or be sacked, says peer","Boris Johnson should force an equalities minister to apologise or sack her, the former head of Downing Street’s race unit has urged, amid a deepening row over “the politics of division”. Simon Woolley said the prime minister must intervene in the row over Kemi Badenoch, after a damning leaked letter sent by a No 10 adviser suggested she may have broken the ministerial code when she publicly criticised a journalist on social media. The special adviser, Samuel Kasumu, also complained of unbearable tension within Downing Street over race and said he considered resigning over fears that the Conservatives were pursuing a “politics steeped in division”. Following frantic interventions from ministers and senior aides including the vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi, Kasumu retracted his resignation on Thursday night. Lord Woolley, who was chair of the race disparity unit in Whitehall until July, said the government must respond to Kasumu’s concerns that Badenoch may have broken ministerial rules when she publicly criticised Nadine White, a HuffPost journalist. Woolley told the Guardian: “I hope that Samuel’s bravery in calling this out provokes a true leadership response. Unless Kemi Badenoch offers a fulsome apology to Nadine White, her position appears to be untenable.” Rather than respond to a journalistic inquiry, in which White asked via email why Badenoch had not appeared in a video featuring other cross-party black MPs encouraging uptake of the Covid-19 vaccine, the minister provoked an outcry by accusing the journalist on Twitter of “sowing distrust” and “making up claims”. Woolley, who also heads Operation Black Vote, said the prime minister must act decisively to regain the trust of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities and campaigners against racism. “This is a critical moment for the government,” he said. “A key black special adviser in No 10 Downing Street is deeply concerned about the politics of division. Samuel Kasumu is referring to the government’s strategy that pits poor white people against poor black people, for example, by rubbishing Black Lives Matter and arguing that class in the northern regions, a code for white working class, is a greater inequality than racism. “What Kasumu and others want is for the government to about-face and radically begin to acknowledge and deal with the deep-seated racial inequalities that have been laid bare by Covid-19, such as jobs, health and housing.” The minister for women and equalities, Liz Truss, gave a speech in December detailing how she would move focus away from “fashionable” issues of race and gender and towards economic inequalities. Kasumu, an entrepreneur who has worked as a political appointee for the government since being recruited under the premiership of Theresa May, offered his resignation to Johnson on Thursday morning. The behaviour of Badenoch, who used Twitter to publish emails from the HuffPost journalist, calling them “creepy and bizarre”, had been concerning, Kasumu wrote. In his resignation letter, Kasumu wrote that “more concerning than the act, was the lack of response internally”. “It was not OK or justifiable, but somehow nothing was said. I waited, and waited, for something from the senior leadership team to even point to an expected standard, but it did not materialise.” Badenoch has previously provoked controversy by saying it was illegal for schools to teach white privilege as uncontested fact, and by accusing the family of a 12-year-old boy arrested over a toy gun for “inflaming tensions” about police behaviour. No 10 initially defended Badenoch over her HuffPost response, but the BBC reported that the Cabinet Office was now understood to be looking into whether she had broken the ministerial code. On Friday afternoon the prime minister’s spokesperson denied that claim, saying: “There is no Cabinet Office investigation ongoing. The prime minister fully supports the important work the minister is doing to improve uptake of the vaccine amongst ethnic minority communities.” Kasumu said progress made by the Conservatives under David Cameron in 2015 in appealing to minority ethnic voters had been reversed. “I fear for what may become of the party in the future by choosing to pursue a politics steeped in division,” he wrote, adding: “The damage that is often caused by our actions is not much considered.” It is understood that tensions have been building within No 10 since Munira Mirza was asked in June to appoint members of the new government commission on racial inequalities. A key Johnson adviser, Mirza has previously cast doubt on the existence of institutional racism and condemned previous inquiries for fostering a “culture of grievance”. Tony Sewell, the commission’s chair, has in the past questioned the idea of institutional racism. He was forced to apologise in July for making homophobic comments after the former footballer Justin Fashanu disclosed he was gay in 1990. A Downing Street spokesperson said of Kasumu: “It would not be appropriate to comment on individual staff members. This government is committed to inclusion and bringing communities together, and is the most ethnically diverse in this country’s history. Last year we established a commission on race and ethnic disparities to examine and tackle inequality and discrimination wherever it is found. It is due to report shortly.”"
2021-02-05T17:41:20Z,politics,Politics,Plan to give enhanced maternity leave to top ministers sparks calls for wider reforms,"The government has been accused of ignoring the plight of millions of parents struggling with “inadequate” parental leave policies, while finding solutions for its own ministers. Trade unions, campaigners and business leaders have called for a “radical overhaul” of parenting policy in the UK, arguing that current parental leave provision is discriminatory and fails to help the poorest in society. The government announced plans to change the law to give cabinet ministers six months’ maternity leave on Thursday, in order to allow the attorney general, Suella Braverman, to keep her post after having her baby, but faced a backlash as it emerged that backbench MPs would be denied similar rights. On Friday Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) said parents across the UK, particularly mothers, were carrying the burden of the government’s failed policies. “The UK’s parental leave system is not fit for purpose, genuine flexible working is still unavailable to millions and quality childcare is hard to find and unaffordable for many,” she said. With the UK at the point of rebuilding its economy for a post-Covid world, ministers had to urgently strengthen rights and support for working parents or women’s equality could go into reverse, she added. TUC research found that the level of paid maternity leave for employed women in the UK (six weeks at 90% of average weekly earnings, 33 weeks at £151.20) is one of the lowest in Europe, ranking 22 out of 24 among European countries. Additionally, one in four fathers don’t qualify for two weeks’ paternity leave, paid at £151.20. Mothers who are on zero-hours contracts, self-employed or unemployed receive maternity allowance of £151.20 a week for 39 weeks; there is no equivalent for their partners. Only around three in seven families are eligible for shared parental leave (a policy introduced by the coalition government in 2015) and of those only about 1% to 4% have shared any leave at all, said Ros Bragg, director of Maternity Action. “We know that many pregnant women and new mothers have lost their jobs in the recession and many more are at significant risk,” she said. “It’s particularly important that women are not compelled to take leave for the entirety of a child’s first year purely because the system is so poorly designed.” But the government’s move to protect the job of its attorney general could be positive for millions of struggling parents, said Adrienne Burgess of the Fatherhood Institute. “I think the government is holding itself hostage to fortune – if it is going to push this through, how can they argue against reforming the parental leave system?” she said. Research has shown that women bore the brunt of extra childcare during the initial coronavirus lockdown and are being disproportionately affected by the economic fallout but there has also been a narrowing of the gender care gap, and an increase in the number of hours men are spending with their children. Campaigners including the TUC, the Fawcett Society, Working Families, the Fatherhood Institute and Maternity Action have called for non-transferable parental leave for fathers, a policy that has been taken up about 90% of the time in Sweden and Iceland. Catherine Gregory from Working Families said: “If the government is serious about improving parental leave for everyone – and not just a single cabinet minister – they should take action to improve leave entitlements for fathers and partners.” Some companies are already pushing ahead. Aviva offers six months’ paid leave for all parents, while Zurich recently saw a 20% increase in the number of female candidates applying for senior roles after offering flexible working for all jobs. Real change also requires a cultural shift, said Ann Francke, chief executive of the Chartered Management Institute, who also called for “a complete overhaul” of parenting policies post Covid. “A culture that respects an employee’s home demands and allows flexible working will go a long way towards boosting both trust and productivity,” she said. Sian Elliott, women’s equality policy officer at the TUC, said the government needed to make good on its promise to make flexible working the default, and provide affordable childcare to prevent women leaving the workforce. “The rest of the country needs the exact same measures as government ministers,” she said. A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesperson said the UK’s parental leave arrangements were “generous and flexible” and more generous than the EU requirement for 14 weeks of paid leave. “Our shared parental leave provision gives parents the choice and flexibility to combine work and childcare in a way that suits them and, as set out in our manifesto, the government is committed to making it easier for fathers to take paternity leave.”"
2021-02-05T17:16:57Z,politics,Politics,UK urged to follow US in restricting arms sales to Saudi Arabia,"Britain is under increasing pressure to restrict arms sales to Saudi Arabia after Joe Biden said the US would no longer sell munitions that could be used in Riyadh’s “offensive operations” in Yemen. Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chair of the defence select committee, called on the government to “follow suit and rethink military sales”, seven months after the British government restarted them following a high-profile court defeat. Ellwood, a former defence minister, said the UK needed to work with the new US administration in developing “a fresh strategy” to help end the six-year conflict, which has killed more than 100,000 Yemenis and displaced a further 8 million. A Saudi-led coalition has been engaged in an indiscriminate bombing campaign against Houthi rebels that has led to civilian casualties and multiple allegations of violations of international humanitarian law. The world’s biggest arms importer, Saudi Arabia has been supplied principally by the US, accounting for 73% of sales, and the UK, accounting for 13% between 2015 and 2019, according to the Stockholm Peace Research Institute. BAE Systems, the UK’s leading arms maker, supplied £15bn in systems and services to the Gulf kingdom over a five-year period to 2020, according to figures disclosed by the company in its annual reports. Emily Thornberry, the shadow international trade secretary, said Biden’s first major foreign policy speech on Thursday should prompt a rethink among British ministers. “For five years Labour has demanded the suspension of arms sales for use in Yemen and urged action to impose a ceasefire, open up humanitarian corridors and resume proper peace talks. For five years the Tories have refused. Now surely they must listen,” the MP said. However, government officials said Biden’s announcement was “a matter for the US government”. A spokesperson said the UK “takes its export responsibilities seriously and will continue to assess all export licences in accordance with strict licensing criteria”. One analyst said it was too early to determine whether Biden’s move would have any practical effect, but on a political level the UK was at risk of becoming increasingly isolated on arms sales to Saudi. Aniseh Bassiri Tabrizi, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, noted that the US move followed a similar decision by Italy at the end of January. “All this builds up pressure on the UK to reconsider its own position, but it is unclear if will be enough to force a change in policy,” she said. In 2019 a court case brought by arms trade campaigners forced the UK government to halt sales for a year, as judges held that ministers approving arms sales – including British components for Paveway missiles – had not properly assessed the risk of civilian casualties. But Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, approved the restarting of unrestricted arms sales in July, arguing there had been only “isolated breaches” of humanitarian law by Riyadh, compliance with which was partly paid for by British taxpayers. The kingdom’s air force is accused of being responsible for many of the estimated 8,750 civilian deaths in airstrikes. While the raids have slowed during 2020 because of the pandemic, the attacks continue, according to the Yemen Data Project. Last July at least seven children and two women were believed to have been killed in a suspected Saudi-led coalition airstrike in north-west Yemen, according to the UN’s humanitarian coordinator, Lise Grande. Charities also urged a British rethink in the wake of the US move. Pauline Checuti, of Oxfam, said: “For the sake of the millions of Yemenis enduring the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, it is time for the UK government to follow suit.”"
2021-02-05T14:25:43Z,politics,Politics,No 10 adviser on ethnic minorities nearly quit over ‘politics of division’,"The prime minister’s senior adviser on ethnic minorities considered resigning over fears the Conservative party was pursuing a “politics steeped in division”. Samuel Kasumu reportedly retracted his resignation letter, in which he said tensions in the government were at times unbearable, after talks with the vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi. In the letter to Boris Johnson, seen by the BBC, Kasumu also raised concerns about the conduct of Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, suggesting she may have broken the ministerial code when she publicly criticised a black journalist on social media. But Kasumu reportedly retracted the letter on Thursday night after talks with Zahawi. He was said to have remained in government to continue with efforts to overcome vaccine hesitancy among black, Asian and minority ethnic Britons, having written of his pride at his work on battling “misinformation and mistrust” surrounding the distribution of coronavirus vaccines. According to the BBC, Kasumu’s letter said that progress made by the Conservatives under David Cameron in 2015 in appealing to minority ethnic voters had been reversed. “I fear for what may become of the party in the future by choosing to pursue a politics steeped in division,” he wrote, adding: “The damage that is often caused by our actions is not much considered.” The behaviour of Badenoch, who used Twitter to publish emails from a HuffPost journalist, calling them “creepy and bizarre”, had been concerning, Kasumu wrote. The reporter had written to Badenoch asking for clarification as to why the minister had not appeared in a video promoting vaccine uptake. No 10 initially defended Badenoch, but the BBC reported that the Cabinet Office was now understood to be looking into whether she had broken the ministerial code. On Friday afternoon the prime minister’s spokesperson denied that claim, saying: “There is no Cabinet Office investigation ongoing. The PM fully supports the important work the minister is doing to improve uptake of the vaccine amongst ethnic minority communities.” Kasumu, in his letter, said he was concerned by the lack of response, writing: “It was not OK or justifiable, but somehow nothing was said. I waited, and waited, for something from the senior leadership team to even point to an expected standard, but it did not materialise.” Downing Street said: “It would not be appropriate to comment on individual staff members. This government is committed to inclusion and bringing communities together and is the most ethnically diverse in this country’s history. “Last year we established a commission on race and ethnic disparities to examine and tackle inequality and discrimination wherever it is found. It is due to report shortly.”"
2021-02-05T13:47:25Z,politics,Politics,Joanna Cherry sacking brings SNP trans rights row off Twitter and into the light,"Last Wednesday’s SNP Westminster group meeting was fraught, by all accounts, with MP after MP telling their leader, Ian Blackford, that they had had enough. Some were on the verge of tears, reporting lengthy phone calls persuading valued activists not to leave the party, while others raised angry exchanges and repeated threats to sue on social media. The context was the increasingly toxic row within the SNP over transgender law reform, and later that evening, the party leader, Nicola Sturgeon posted a video statement on Twitter in which she stated categorically that there was “zero tolerance” towards transphobia in her party. But the meeting’s focus was Joanna Cherry, admired cross-party for her legal challenges during the Brexit crisis, and who, only three years earlier, came within one vote of beating Blackford to his role. She is also an unrepentant champion of concerns around the erosion of women’s rights and one of Sturgeon’s fiercest internal critics. On Monday, Cherry was sacked from the party’s frontbench during a reshuffle that was press-released as “drawing on new talent”. But it has brought the SNP’s row over transgender matters off Twitter and into the light and risks further entrenching deep divisions within the party. A senior Westminster source insisted that Cherry’s relegation was not a direct result of her stance on transgender law reform: “She was turning out to be a really disruptive influence on the group and some folk [at the meeting] were visibly upset about her behaviour.” The Guardian understands that some form of no-confidence motion was being prepared by colleagues, and that Blackford “had to say: enough”. The reshuffle was “about a team of people who can work together”, they said. The source added that, while Cherry was valued as a highly effective Commons performer, she repeatedly clashed with colleagues and was seen as a bully. “She has a robust personality. Always quick to characterise herself as the victim, the victim of bullying. What she doesn’t see is she’s actually guilty of the same stuff herself.” A source close to Cherry suggested that the daily challenges of high-profile political life demanded a robust countenance, but insisted that accusations of bullying were “lies and classic deflection” from the “bullying, lies and smears” that she had faced from colleagues. Since her sacking, Cherry has received a torrent of abuse on social media, and on Thursday a man was charged in connection with alleged threats made against her after her sacking. Regardless of the briefings, there are plenty across the spectrum of opinion who see Cherry’s removal more plainly as the party leadership – and Nicola Sturgeon herself – neutering a political rival. “Anyone with an ounce of political knowledge can see that there was an agenda, regardless of whether you agree with the agenda or not,” said one prominent Glasgow activist who described themselves unequivocally as a Sturgeon supporter. Cherry has found herself quite unapologetically at the nexus of a series of debates that have challenged the SNP’s famed internal discipline and unity of purpose. Many Sturgeon supporters point to her interview with the Times on the eve of the SNP conference in November, in which she criticised Sturgeon’s leadership and referendum strategy, as evidence of Cherry’s repeated disloyalty. And she remains a prominent supporter of the former party leader Alex Salmond, amid intensifying allegations that officials close to Sturgeon tried to orchestrate government and police investigations into sexual misconduct allegations against him, which Sturgeon categorically denies. Indeed, one supporter this week suggested Cherry could now be in “pole position” to replace Sturgeon should those inquiries result in the first minister’s resignation. The same source close to Cherry said the sacking went well beyond a personality clash: “Ever since she challenged Blackford for Westminster leadership there has been a sustained campaign to undermine and marginalise her. This is because she won’t be quiet about women’s rights, she stuck up for Alex and she is critical on independence.” Party members who share Cherry’s stance on transgender matters pointed out that their inboxes had been similarly filled in recent days with members threatening to leave the party because of her sacking. Taken alongside Sturgeon’s video message, one prominent critic said there was “a real fear that people will use this as a tactic to wrongly smear people without evidence”. Cherry has repeatedly stressed that it is not transphobic to question the impact of self-identification (streamlining the process by which an individual can legally change gender) on women’s sex-based rights.
Another prominent activist who shares this stance said that Cherry’s removal from the frontbench would have a “chilling effect” on those who wanted to speak out: “Jo Cherry was a very loud warning.” She argued that recent overspill of the sex and gender debate into other areas of policymaking, including hate crime reform and rape victims’ access to medical examiners, was proof of growing concerns among the Holyrood group of MSPs. Some SNP MPs described a “palpable sense of relief” within the Westminster group this week, along with a degree of frustration that action had not been taken sooner. As one MP said: “The party has a hard-won reputation for being socially liberal, pro-equality, and any perception that our politicians are not has a terrible effect on younger supporters in particular, and with that comes the fear that they will go to the Greens at the next election.” The symbolism of Cherry’s removal will go some way to reassuring those concerned about transphobia, according to senior equalities activists, and represents “a green light” for action. But those activists also believe that Sturgeon’s video statement itself, while welcome, came “far too late”. James Mitchell, a professor of public policy at Edinburgh University who has studied the SNP extensively, contrasted Sturgeon’s apparent “intolerance of dissent” with a party that historically encouraged debate and participation. Acknowledging that all political parties are struggling with trans policy, Mitchell argued that the SNP leadership had failed to listen to those members who disagreed with them on policy and strategy but might be willing to accept these differences if they felt their voices had been heard. “This has created a deep, entrenched binary divide that no one is trying to bridge. The trouble is, when you create these camps other issues fall into them.”"
2021-02-04T18:14:42Z,politics,Politics,Free ports – or sleaze ports? Rishi Sunak's dream of tax-free zones about to become reality,"Five years ago a young, unknown MP wrote a pamphlet for a Thatcherite thinktank extolling the benefits of free ports. Now that Rishi Sunak is chancellor, his dream for Britain is – for good or ill – fast becoming reality. This week, alliances of port owners, businesses and local authorities must submit their bids to establish free ports, competing to set up zones exempt from normal tax and regulation. Proponents say free ports can attract investment to areas that have been left woefully short, bringing jobs and prosperity to deprived regions as part of the “levelling up” agenda, helping prioritise greener industry, and breathing new life into, say, the former Redcar steelworks site, or the Grimsby docks. But others fear the move signals the creation of “mini-tax havens” and a race to the bottom on regulation, keeping revenues from councils and the Treasury to line the pockets of business and landowners, with profits sent offshore rather than reinvested in the UK. Support is found predominantly among those who voted – and campaigned – to leave the EU; backers call it a Brexit dividend enabled by the final deal. The EU has started to clamp down on the 80-odd free zones within its jurisdiction, over tax evasion, corruption and crime concerns. Most of the big coastal ports, as well as some inland airports and accompanying industrial zones, are throwing their hats into the ring. In the north-east, the Conservative mayor of the Tees Valley combined authority, Ben Houchen, has championed a policy he says could create thousands of jobs in the region. Deprived areas will be given priority, and bids are expected from around England by Friday’s deadline – from Humberside to Liverpool and London to Bristol. The devolved governments in Wales and Scotland are expected to follow – with caveats – and invite bids at a later date.
Within designated zones, stretching up to 45km from ports, the government’s free ports prospectus describes how usual customs, planning and tax measures will not apply. Goods and components will, in effect, remain offshore, allowing, say, a new factory to be built, processing raw materials and components without customs paperwork or tariffs, to re-export as more valuable goods. For the first five to 10 years of that factory’s life, the government proposes, it would pay no stamp duty on its land or property purchase and enhanced tax breaks would be given for construction or machinery costs. Behind the zone’s fences – physical and virtual – business rates would be waived, and employers would not pay national insurance contributions for up to three years for staff members earning less than £25,000. The government says it will “ensure it has the power” to prevent access to national insurance relief for employers who abuse it, for example by dismissing staff after three years. Modelling by the consultancy Vivid Economics for a Teesside free port said the kind of package proposed could create up to 32,000 jobs and boost the regional economy by £2bn over the next 25 years, although “deadweight and displacement” – firms relocating rather than reinvesting – could cut those benefits in half. It projected that the Treasury would lose about 40% of £960m in tax and revenues due in Teesside if free port firms were subject to usual rules, although it argued that the zones would create enough investment to produce a net positive for the exchequer. However, the projection suggested that to be competitive with the likes of Singapore, the UK would need complete exemption from business rates and other taxes. Unsurprisingly, many people are alarmed. Paul Monaghan, chief executive of the Fair Tax Mark scheme, says: “These ‘sleaze ports’ are very much mini-tax havens domiciled within the UK. It’s going to leak out into the wider economy – it will result in a massively reduced contribution from business to the Treasury. Businesses which are rooted in communities wish to stay and play a part in society and pay fair tax – why should they be undercut by hot capital and flighty businesses that can exploit these zones?”
A Treasury spokesperson said: “The government is committed to combating abusive tax practices, such as avoidance and evasion – these have been a consideration throughout the design of the free ports tax offer.” Monaghan says the zones have proved magnets for illicit financial flows and criminal activity, adding: “One of the reasons for them existing is the absence of regulations and checks – it’s a consequence of what they are.” One of the world’s biggest free zones, Dubai’s Jebel Ali, has been identified by tobacco companies as a major source of contraband cigarettes, while the US last year blacklisted two aviation businesses in the zone for trading with Iranian airlines designated as supporting terrorism or as a threat to US national security.
Its operator, DP World, which runs the London Gateway and 70 other ports worldwide, is hoping to transform it into a free port. A spokesperson for DP World said customs officers in Dubai were “praised” by HMRC for helping to stop cigarettes entering the UK black market, adding: “DP World has operations on every continent and moves 10% of the world’s container trade. We have a zero-tolerance policy towards illicit activity anywhere in the world and work closely with the customs and taxation authorities.” Labour has attacked the principles of the scheme, although some MPs in affected constituencies have broken ranks. The SNP is no longer in outright opposition, with Scotland suggesting a middle way – “green ports”, linking tax incentives to sustainable business. Britain’s main maritime union, the RMT, says it supports green job creation but fears free ports could result in workers in some of the poorest communities signing away their rights. Its general secretary, Mick Cash, says: “Without strong employment rights, automatic trade union recognition and tax laws that make sure international owners of UK ports contribute, free ports are doomed to fail the communities they are designed to help.” Ports have moved to allay fears, with a joint declaration by the biggest owning groups – including Associated British Ports, DP World, Hutchison, PD Ports and Peel Ports – that the free ports would be environmentally, socially and economically sustainable and pledging that they “are not seeking to diminish or dilute employment rights”. The Treasury said “no part of the freeport policy would explicitly or implicitly affect” workers’ rights.
The contenders The government has said it will name the chosen free ports in England, likely a maximum of eight, in the spring. These ports are expected to bid: Thames A free zone that would cover London Gateway, opened in 2013 by DP World, and the older and smaller Tilbury, owned by Forth Ports. Backers say it could create 25,000 jobs along the deprived Thames Estuary region, with green investment at Ford Dagenham and in Thurrock. DP World is owned by the state of Dubai. Its chair, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, wields extraordinary power as commercial chief and regulator. He is chair of the Ports, Customs & Free Zone Corporation, a government department that includes the Dubai customs workforce, and leader of the Jebel Ali free zone authority, where companies can incorporate and operate untaxed. DP says the chair’s roles are “regularly audited” by the UAE government. Felixstowe-Harwich The Freeport East bid joins local authorities in Essex and Suffolk with two Hutchison-owned ports: Felixstowe, Britain’s biggest container port, and Harwich. As well as taking in major road and rail freight hubs, the free port would link to offshore wind and Cambridge University research programmes. Hutchison Ports Europe, part of the telecoms and infrastructure empire built by the Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, made headlines last year by hiring the former transport secretary Chris Grayling on £100,000 a year for seven hours’ work a week. Grayling has assured parliamentary standards committees he will not be advising on “post-Brexit opportunities” and is being kept away from the bid. Liverpool Liverpool city region combined authority has been leading a bid that would combine Peel Port’s Liverpool hub and its operations Manchester and Heysham in one big free zone. Peel says it is considering bids with regional stakeholders across all of its port locations, which include Great Yarmouth and Clydeport in Scotland. Peel Group, the parent company established and part-owned by an Isle of Man resident, John Whittaker, also has a large land and property division in the north-west. The increase in land value alone could produce a huge windfall for one of Britain’s biggest landowners. Bristol The bid is being led by the West of England combined authority. Boris Johnson visited Bristol in the autumn and declared the port a “strong contender”. A number of proposed inland “free port zones” are linked by road and or rail to Bristol port. The Bristol Port company is owned by Terence Mordaunt and David Ord, who bought the port from the city council in 1991. Between them, they have donated £1.9m to the Conservatives, £25,000 to Johnson’s leadership campaign and £50,000 to Vote Leave. Mordaunt chairs the climate sceptic Global Warming Policy Forum, whose trustees include the former Daily Telegraph editor Charles Moore."
2021-02-04T17:28:35Z,politics,Politics,UK Covid live: positive cases in England fall by 29% in a week â€“ as it happened,"Here the latest key developments at a glance: A government-backed study is being launched to determine whether people can be safely given different coronavirus vaccines for their first and second doses, with results expected “probably after the summe”, according to vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi. The UK reported 915 further deaths on Thursday, as well as 20,634 new infections, slightly up from Wednesday’s 19,202 new cases. Over the past seven days, infections in the UK have declined by 25,7%. Zahawi declined to give a date for when the first nine groups in the priority list will have received their vaccine. Previously, NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens has said the aim is for all over-50s and those at risk to be vaccinated by the end of April. Rob Paterson, chief executive of Best Western hotels, has criticised a lack of communication from the government over its plan to quarantine certain international arrivals in hotels, and said hotel bosses “to this day simply haven’t heard anything despite multiple offers”. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, will lay out the “operational plan” for hotel quarantines next week. “A significant return to normality” is on the cards once the most vulnerable groups have been vaccinated, Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) member professor Andrew Hayward said on Thursday, but Nadhim Zahawi told the Commons that the economny would only be reopened “very gradually”. Nadhim Zahawi told the Commons the UK government, despite having pre-purchased 300m coronavirus vaccine doses, was “nowhere near having enough supply” to send vaccines to poorer countries. The Welsh health minister, Vaughan Gething, said that there cannot be a “huge splurge of reopening” in the country despite Covid-19 rates falling since before Christmas. England’s infections fell by 29% in week to 27 January, as a total of 196,257 people tested positive for Covid-19 in England at least once in that week. Case rates in England have decreased in all age groups and are currently highest in those aged 30-39 years old, according to Public Health England. Around one in 10 major hospital trusts in England had no spare adult critical care beds last week, according to NHS England figures. A mutation of coronavirus initially detected in Liverpool has been found in Preston and West Lancashire, local health officials said on Thursday.

2021-02-04T14:39:51Z,politics,Politics,"UK leaders became too close to Trump, says ex-ambassador","British prime ministers have been absent from the world stage for the past four years while becoming too close to Donald Trump and his “pie in the sky promises” of a free trade deal, a former UK ambassador to Washington has said. Sir Peter Westmacott, who was ambassador from 2012 to 2016 and got to know many of Joe Biden’s foreign policy team when they were working for Barack Obama in that period, said the start of the new US administration gave Britain a chance for a diplomatic reset, so long as ministers “bring bread to the table”. The modus operandi of British foreign policy had been hamstrung in the Trump years, Westmacott told the Guardian in an interview. “Britain’s first instinct, especially when it does not know what to do, is to ask the Americans, but that was near impossible when US policy was being made by early hour tweet,” he said. “There were also huge gaps in the Trump administration either because places never got filled, people resigned or got fired, leaving Britain with no one to deal with. An awful lot of western policymaking went by default, and that meant the gap was filled by others that were able to make hay.” In his new memoir, They Call It Diplomacy, spanning 40 years in the Foreign Office, Westmacott claims the chance of a post-Brexit trade deal with the US had an impact across UK foreign policy, especially in the Middle East. “Trump’s promises that after Brexit the UK would benefit immediately from a tremendous new free trade agreement with the United States were pie in the sky. But they led Theresa May and her successor, Boris Johnson, to give top priority to aligning British policy with that of the Trump administration,” he wrote. “Even before the new president had taken over, May’s government turned its back on the Middle East peace process initiatives which had been developed in close partnership with the UK […] Britain also joined the Americans at the UN security council in tabling draft language on Yemen, placing the entire responsibility for the war on Iran and its Houthi proxies without mentioning the suffering caused by the bombing of civilian targets by the Saudi and Emirati air forces.” Westmacott said a UK reset with the US would not be simple. “The impressions I got from my friends in the old Obama administration that are now being recycled in the Biden team was that there was a pretty strong sense that Brexit was a mistake, mis-sold, not in America’s interest, and that they had not forgotten some of the more colourful language used by Johnson towards some Democratic politicians. Nor had they forgotten the sucking up to Donald Trump,” he told the Guardian. “Nevertheless, whether it is due to nimble diplomacy or the nature of the beast, Biden and Johnson have got off to a pretty good start. But Britain has to put bread on the table. It has got to make a contribution on the issues that the US cares about. On the Iran nuclear deal, for instance, we have diplomats on the ground, unlike the US. Iran fundamentally cares about only one thing, its survival, so I think a deal is doable. “On Yemen, perhaps I am naive, [but] we can help. I am sure Biden cares about this issue a lot more than Trump ever did. The UN envoy is a Brit and we have a historic responsibility to the Aden protectorate. “Similarly, we can have a role in devising a multilateral approach to China. The UK is waking up, like everyone else, and realising China requires a collective approach. And on Russia, for whatever reason, Trump was in awe of Putin and not prepared to stand up to him. Biden, by contrast, sees him as a threat to democracy through cyber-attacks and suchlike, and there we have invaluable expertise. Through Nato we may be able to show that the Brits have got something serious to offer in terms of calibrating a serious security strategy.” Westmacott said it was already clear that the UK was trying to be active as president of the G7. This contrasted with the previous four years when, he said, the main refrain from friends from Europe to Asia was “where have you gone?” He cautioned Johnson not to be tempted into trying to disrupt or even goad the EU, arguing it was not the kind of UK-EU relationship that the Biden team would want and was not in the UK national interest. He believes the UK foreign and security leaders overall have recognised that their leverage will be enhanced if they cooperate with the main European players, albeit initially on ad hoc basis. “With the world as unpredictable and unstable as it is, not least because of all the unpredictability and flip-flops in the US over the past four years, it is in the UK’s interests to re-establish working relationships on foreign policy with the other principal capitals of Europe,” he said. He sees the US and the UK’s joint recent absence as coinciding not just with China’s rise but also a realisation that China’s economic strength was not leading to political and social reform. “We need to think again, and make them realise they have got to play by the same rules as us,” he said. “They have certainly got a very big interest in the survival of the western economy that they want to dominate. They have got trillions of dollars of US debt, and they don’t want to destroy the west in the way that Putin does.”"
2021-02-04T13:14:12Z,politics,Politics,"Cancer drugs discarded because of Brexit red tape, MPs hear","A Welsh pharmaceutical company has been forced to throw out hundreds of packs of vital cancer treatments for EU patients because of Brexit red tape on exports, MPs have heard. The company, which has not been named, has now moved production to Dublin. Ian Price, the director of the Confederation of British Industry in Wales, said the “mountain of red tape” facing businesses because of Brexit was “terrifying” and had come as a real shock to companies. He told MPs on the Welsh affairs committee that the UK government needed to resume talks with the EU about a relaxation in the rules over medicine supplies because financial support would not help several pharma companies that are having difficulties trading with the EU. “One instance I’m aware of is that they’ve already moved the production of a particular item to Dublin – because they can’t in the time allowed continue to make it in Wales because it’s a time sensitive cancer drug that they were importing into Europe – sadly as a consequence of the arrangement of the deal. “It’s no good they’ve now got 200 or 300 consignments blocked somewhere in the system in Europe and they are having to be thrown,” he said. He was speaking as MPs on the Scottish affairs committee were told that the government had made “catastrophic decisions” on the fishing industry post-Brexit, one of which has led to a ban on live molluscs being traded. It has been “a dreadful first few weeks of trading … there’s no way of sugar coating it,” James Withers, the chief executive of Scotland Food & Drink told them. He was speaking just days after Politics Home revealed that the EU has told the UK shellfish industry that thousands of tonnes of oyster, mussel, clam, cockle and scallop exports were banned from the bloc indefinitely, spelling disaster for the Scottish fishing industry.
Elaine Whyte, executive secretary of the Clyde Fisherman’s Association, said the EU ban on live shellfish was a “massive issue” as it could mean “losing live markets entirely and permanently”. There must a “political intervention” to save UK businesses, she said. MPs on both committees heard of the fears that Brexit barriers would get worse in April when new health checks will be applied to all products of animal origin including meat, pet food, honey, milk or egg products with pre-notification of imports required by the authorities. It means more disruption to the supply chain for food and fish processing production, which relies on elements of ready meals, confectionary and processed food coming from the EU. “1 April is a concern for everybody and they haven’t yet come to terms with 1 January,” Price told MPs. Ian Davies, the head of UK Port Authorities at Stena Line, talked of the devastating impact of Brexit on British-Irish trade. Irish suppliers were bypassing the UK “landbridge” going direct to France or Belgium on new ferry routes laid on to allow truckers to avoid Dover. Although the route added €400 (£351) a load and took six hours longer, Irish suppliers had opted for “ease over cost” amid fears they could be “tripped up” by barriers in Dover. A reduction in traffic in the other direction had also hit Holyhead port where 30% of traffic to Dublin would normally be destined for Belfast. But there had been a “big deflection” with hauliers saying they are now opting to drive the length of the country to Scotland rather than face checks in Dublin port. Price said he had seen “horrific stories of transport price increases since Brexit with one firm, which moves “large capital equipment” to the EU, seeing its costs rise £250,000 in the first month."
2021-02-04T10:59:35Z,politics,Politics,Dublin and EU reject call to scrap Northern Ireland Brexit protocol,"The Brexit agreement’s Northern Ireland protocol will not be scrapped, the Irish government and the EU have said in an escalating row over the new trade barriers down the Irish Sea. The Democratic Unionist party leader, Arlene Foster, has called for the measure designed to keep the Irish land border open to be replaced, but Dublin is focused on easing problems with the post-Brexit trade deal that have caused disruption at Irish ports. The Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, told BBC Ulster “there is not going to be very dramatic change”, in the face of calls by the DUP for the protocol to be urgently axed. “We want the protocol to function in a way that works for everyone, north and south, on the island of Ireland,” he said. Foster hit back on the same programme, accusing Coveney of being “completely tone deaf to the concerns of unionism”. On Wednesday the European commission vice-president, Maroš Šefčovič, said the UK and EU had a “shared commitment to the proper implementation of the protocol”. He tweeted that this had been reiterated at a meeting with Michael Gove, Foster and Northern Ireland’s deputy first minister, Michelle O’Neill, on Wednesday night and they had agreed that “constructive solution-driven cooperation” was “essential to addressing outstanding issues”. Gove and Šefčovič will meet again next week. It is understood a specialised committee dedicated to the working out of the protocol will be established in the coming days to move those talkson, with a meeting of the UK-EU joint committee chaired by Gove and Šefčovič pencilled in for mid March. The effort to address the issues caused by the implementation of the protocol has been expedited by the aborted attempt by the EU to trigger article 16 of the protocol, which allows for the suspension of the arrangements in extreme circumstances. Boris Johnson and Gove have capitalised on the EU’s embarrassment over the move and threatened to trigger article 16 themselves in parliament and in a letter to Šefčovič on Tuesday. The UK is now demanding a two-year extension to the Brexit grace period for checks on trade but the EU made it clear last night it regarded article 16 as an ultimate on which it would not capitulate. Efforts to de-escalate the row will do little to assuage the DUP’s opposition to the protocol. Two days ago Foster, who is also Northern Ireland’s first minister, launched an official campaign to get the arrangements scrapped. At the same time she announced the party would be withdrawing from all engagements with the Irish government on matters relating to the protocol. While many have considered the move a reflection of the binary politics that often define Northern Ireland, consumers and businesses agree the protocol has caused upset across all communities. One shopper who contacted the Guardian on Wednesday said he had been unable to order goods, as he used to, from John Lewis or Currys. “It feels like we are being left behind, a victim of a Brexit we didn’t vote for in Northern Ireland. I’m not angry about any of this, I’m just worried that things are going to get harder and more expensive at a time when many people are already struggling,” he said. “I know the DUP (the people who voted for Brexit) are now upset at the outcome and are wanting to do something to ease these terrible supply issues, but it all feels a little too late.” The MLA for Belfast South, Matthew O’Toole ,of the Social Democratic and Labour party, criticised the DUP’s approach. “They are trying to amplify the issue of the Irish Sea border in a disembodied way, as if the Irish border existed in a sui generis way and could be got rid of without diplomatic consequence, political or economic consequence,” he said."
2021-02-03T22:27:54Z,politics,Politics,UK in 'constructive' talks with EU over Northern Ireland protocol,"Michael Gove and the European commission vice-president, Maroš Šefčovic, are to meet in London next week after a “constructive” discussion over problems with application of the Northern Ireland protocol. On Wednesday, the UK asked for a two-year transition period on the core elements to the protocol, including checks on food and delivery of online shopping entering the region from Great Britain. The timing of the request by Gove was seen as capitalising on the calamitous triggering of article 16 in the protocol by the EU last Friday as part of an attempt to block Covid vaccines getting into the UK. The move – intended to stop vaccines moving into Northern Ireland from the Republic – met with immediate criticism and was rescinded almost immediately. The virtual meeting on Wednesday evening, which was also attended by Northern Ireland’s first minister, Arlene Foster, and the deputy first minister, Michelle O’Neill, appears to have restored some calm in an escalating crisis that saw border officials taken off their Brexit duties in Belfast and Larne ports on Tuesday amid fears for staff safety. In a joint statement Gove and Šefčovic said: “After a constructive discussion amongst all parties [it was] concluded that the UK and the EU would immediately work intensively to find solutions to outstanding issues … [Gove and Šefčovič] will keep in close contact as this work progresses, and will meet again next week in London.” The meeting came after Boris Johnson accused the EU of appearing to “cast doubt” on the Good Friday agreement, with last week’s decision to invoke article 16. It is understood that a new specialised committee, mandated under the Brexit deal, will be quickly set up and will convene in the next two weeks to thrash out a solution. A signoff is expected at a meeting of the UK-EU joint committee, which Gove and Šefčovič pencilled in for mid-March.
Earlier, speaking at prime minister’s questions after a call with Foster, Johnson said: “It was most regrettable that the EU should seem to cast doubt on the Good Friday agreement, the principles of the peace process, by seeming to call for a border across the island of Ireland.” Johnson told MPs: “We will work to ensure that there are no such borders, we will respect the peace process and, indeed, no barriers down the Irish Sea and the principle of unfettered access across all parts of our United Kingdom is upheld.” Gove, in a strongly worded letter to Šefčovic, had demanded six major concessions to the Northern Ireland protocol including extensions on the current three-month grace period for checks on supermarket food supplies from Great Britain to Northern Ireland to 1 January 2023, and a “permanent solution” on chilled meats from GB. He is also seeking extension of the current temporary arrangements for parcel post from Great Britain to Northern Ireland for the same period to allow time for a “light touch permanent solution to be codified”. This will address dismay from consumers that they can no longer get goods from high street chains such as John Lewis or Currys delivered to Northern Ireland. The UK also wants a common travel area for pets, changes on steel quotas for the region and medicine supplies to continue as normal.
Gove said the UK wanted “urgent resolution” of the problems and that lengthy technical discussions, the hallmark of Brexit negotiations, were not acceptable. “What is required is political, not technical solutions,” he said. Gove implicitly warned that the UK could invoke article 16 unless its demands are met. “If it is not possible to agree a way forward in the way we propose, then the UK will consider using all instruments at its disposal.” While Šefčovic made clear earlier that there was no question of the protocol being scrapped, he agreed in the joint statement with Gove after the talks that “avoiding disruption to the everyday lives of the people of Northern Ireland” was vital as was “protecting the gains of the peace process” and “maintaining stability” in the region. Under the protocol in the Brexit withdrawal agreement designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, Northern Ireland effectively remains in the EU’s single market. The full EU customs code is also to be enforced across the Irish Sea on goods coming from the rest of the UK but its application to the letter has caused cross-community dismay in Northern Ireland. In the Commons, DUP MP Ian Paisley urged Johnson to “be the unionist we need you to be” by legislating if necessary to make sure goods can flow freely between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Paisley said the Northern Ireland protocol had “betrayed us, and has made us feel like foreigners in our own country”, and reminded Johnson that he had told businesses in Northern Ireland they could “bin” any paperwork they were asked to fill out after Brexit. Johnson promised to do everything he could to ensure trade flows freely, “whether legislatively or indeed by invoking article 16 of the protocol”. O’Neill said it was imperative that the protocol worked and “solutions must be found to support business … to ensure smooth trading operations”. She called for the urgent establishment of a new specialised committee and working group, mandated in the Brexit trade deal to work through implementation issues over the long term."
2021-02-03T19:43:19Z,politics,Politics,Prime minister's questions for the prime minister who doesn't do questions,"Fittingly enough, the Speaker began prime minister’s questions with a one-minute silence for Captain Sir Tom Moore and all those who have died of Covid-19. If only the silence had been extended for a further 43 minutes – having started by insisting that the session return from John Bercow’s extended director’s cut to a straightforward half-hour, Lindsay Hoyle is himself showing signs of mission creep – we might all have been better off. Right now, PMQs feels increasingly redundant. Even as a piece of weekly political theatre it is failing. There was a time when Keir Starmer regularly managed to get under Boris Johnson’s skin, but Boris has long since worked out that he can get by quite easily without answering any questions, and the Labour leader has yet to find a strategy for forcing him to do so. He needs to do so quickly as we have reached a point of stalemate that suits Johnson just fine. Starmer began with three questions that came nowhere close to resolving whether or not Sage had recommended mandatory quarantine for everyone arriving in the UK. The answer appeared to depend on your definitions; Sage might have said it would be a good idea, but did that count as a proper recommendation? Johnson rather thought not, as the variant virus that everyone but Dido Harding expected much preferred travelling business-class on direct flights but, just to be safe, he chose to muddy the waters first by talking about incoming freight and then implying that almost no one would have been vaccinated if the Labour leader had been in charge. It wasn’t true, but then the truth and the shape-shifting “world king” have never been particularly close acquaintances. Abandoning the coronavirus as a lost cause for the week, Starmer moved on to all those still living in buildings with dangerous cladding. Here Boris had equally little to say other than that no one should be left with unaffordable costs. He didn’t specify at what level affordable became unaffordable, nor could he explain why his government had done so little, more than three and a half years after the Grenfell Tower tragedy. Rather he just waffled on, before concluding with a general tirade against Keir that the Speaker had to cut short. The SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, momentarily thought he had Boris on the ropes by quoting a story that No 10 had known there had been a coronavirus outbreak at the vaccine plant in Livingston before he had visited it last week. But Johnson merely ignored him and said he was prime minister of the UK and he would go to places where and when he chose. So there. There’s something about the SNP that always brings out the child in Johnson. The most interesting exchange came with the DUP’s Ian Paisley. Although Johnson affects to be deeply troubled by the EU having briefly invoked article 16 last week, you get the feeling that secretly he’s thrilled. Because now he has carte blanche to do whatever he likes. To the extent that he sounded as if he couldn’t wait for an excuse to abandon the Northern Ireland protocol that he himself had negotiated little more than a year ago. There again, it’s quite possible that either Boris never fully understood what he had signed up to or that he never had any intention of abiding by it. Or perhaps both. The Downing Street press conference later in the afternoon started with Johnson again paying tribute to Moore. Almost as if the prime minister was trying to create an association between himself and the late soldier in people’s minds. Perhaps the prime minister has yet to learn the difference between selflessness and selfishness. Otherwise, this was a briefing at its most meta. One that existed only as dead air to be filled, rather than because there was anything much new to impart. Boris merely repeated that the remarkable milestone of 10m vaccinations had been reached, more or less re-committed himself – with a bit of wriggle room – to giving more information on the reopening of schools in the week of 15 February and promised that Matt Hancock would be providing further details on the so far imaginary plans for hotel quarantine the following day. What was most remarkable, though, was that – for almost the first time – Boris’s natural gung-ho optimism had given way to something rather more pragmatic. That he had discovered the hard way that the coronavirus couldn’t be pushed around and forced to fit with his government’s timetable. While being cautiously hopeful that the deaths were on a downward curve, for once he didn’t want to overpromise. Maybe time spent close to Chris Whitty hasn’t all been wasted. “We all knew [the virus] could surge in the autumn and winter months,” he said. At which point, some jaws dropped. After all, Boris had been the prime minister who had said the pandemic would be over by Christmas, had ignored the advice for a circuit-breaker in September, had done his utmost to facilitate a five-day Killathon over Christmas and had introduced a raft of measures to make sure the UK had a world-beating mortality rate. Still, better late than never, I suppose."
2021-02-03T18:53:32Z,politics,Politics,"UK Covid: all four nations past peak of current wave, says Whitty, as 10m in Britain vaccinated - as it happened","Prof Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser, has said all four nations of the UK have passed the peak of cases, hospitalisation and deaths. (See 5.54pm.) Boris Johnson has effectively ruled out bringing forward general school reopening in England. He has already said schools will reopen from 8 March, but the Scottish government’s decision yesterday to reopen schools, mostly for some primary pupils, from 22 February, has prompted some calls for a rethink in England. But, speaking at a press conference in No 10 alongside Whitty, Johnson defended his plans. (See 5.28pm.) He went on: What we don’t want to do, now that we are making progress with the vaccine rollout and we have got a timetable for the way ahead, we don’t want to be forced into reverse. We think this is the prudent and cautious approach. I think it is much better to stick to that. Scientists have also warned that bringing forward the reopening of schools in England would “a recipe for disaster” while prevalence of the virus remains high.
Johnson has said the government will give more detail about the next phase of the vaccination programme after 15 February, which is the deadline for everyone in the top four priority groups to have been offered a first dose. And he said on Monday 22 February he would be setting out a routemap for easing lockdown, with dates and a timetable. Whitty said he thought giving every adult in the UK two doses of vaccine by the end of August was “probably beyond what is possible”. It has been reportedly that privately ministers do think this is possible. (See 11.45am.) Johnson said Matt Hancock, the health secretary, will announce more details of the hotel quarantine plan in the Commons tomorrow. (See 5.23pm.) Britain needs an economic strategy for the next decade to match the ambition of the 1945 postwar recovery as the country emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic, the new head of the CBI said. Boris Johnson has defended visiting a Scottish vaccine plant despite a coronavirus outbreak at the site, saying “no one is going to stop me” visiting all parts of the UK. A parliamentary human rights committee has called on ministers to legislate against blanket bans on care home visits in England that relatives claim are causing deaths through loneliness and isolation. Britain has given a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine to more than 10 million people as public health experts called on ministers to target future vaccinations in hotspots where the disease is threatening to run out of control. MPs have called on Dido Harding, the head of NHS test and trace, to prove that the system substantially reduces the spread of coronavirus as efforts continue to contain more transmissible variants she claimed no one had seen coming. The work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, has said she is opposed to making one-off £500 or £1,000 universal credit payments in April in lieu of retaining the £20-a-week Covid top-up, warning that it could disincentivise claimants from taking a job. The UK government has asked the EU to agree to a two-year extension of the full implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol. The request was set out in a letter released as Boris Johnson told MPs that he wanted to see “no barriers down the Irish Sea and the principle of unfettered access across all parts of our United Kingdom ... upheld”. In response to a question at PMQs from the DUP’s Ian Paisley, Johnson also restated his threat to invoke article 16 of the protocol - an emergency break that would allow the UK to dis-apply parts of it. Johnson said he would do everything he could to ensure trade flows freely, “whether legislatively or indeed by invoking article 16 of the protocol”. That’s all from me for tonight. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It’s here."
2021-02-03T18:36:09Z,politics,Politics,Johnson defends 'reckless' visit to vaccine plant despite Covid outbreak,"Keir Starmer has admitted he “made a mistake” in a response to Boris Johnson at prime minister’s questions during a tense clash over Starmer’s previous comments on the European Medicines Agency. Labour rubbished claims from a Conservative MP that Starmer had challenged Johnson in the corridor after their debate in the House of Commons. Johnson has previously accused Starmer of wanting to take part in the EU’s vaccine procurement programme, a charge the Labour leader has fiercely denied, accusing the prime minister of being misleading. However, after a clash at PMQs on Wednesday, Starmer’s spokesperson issued an unusual apology from the Labour leader for a misunderstanding, though reiterating that the prime minister had previously been misleading. “On a number of occasions the prime minister has wrongly claimed that Labour wanted to join the EU’s vaccine programme,” Starmer’s spokesperson said. “That is inaccurate and the claim has been found to be untrue. “This afternoon during prime minister’s questions, Keir misheard the prime minister and assumed he was making the same false accusation again. Keir accepts that on this occasion the prime minister was referring to old comments about the European Medicines Agency, and Keir admits he was wrong and made a mistake in his response.” She added: “It’s not Labour policy to join either the European Medicines Agency or the EU vaccine programme. We have never called for the UK to be in the EU vaccine programme. We remain committed to working with the government to ensure we can be the first in the world to roll out the vaccine.” The Conservative MP Mark Francois, who made a point of order after PMQs reading out some pre-prepared comments quoting Starmer on the EMA, later claimed he had seen Starmer angrily confront Johnson in the lobbies after their exchange. The Labour MP Chris Matheson, who was with Starmer, said the description was untrue. “It’s absolute bollocks,” he said. “There was a brief chat and then Keir and I left together. Nothing more to it than that.” A Labour source: “They had a perfectly reasonable conversation, as they often do after PMQs.” During PMQs Johnson also faced an awkward moment where he defended visiting a Scottish vaccine plant despite a coronavirus outbreak at the site, saying “no one is going to stop me” visiting all parts of the UK.
The prime minister was criticised by Scottish leaders including the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, for his trip to Scotland last week at a time when only essential travel was permitted. The Daily Record reported that Johnson’s visit to the Valneva factory took place 24 hours after a public health investigation that found 14 coronavirus cases – about one in eight of the workforce. Valneva’s chief financial officer, David Lawrence, said Downing Street had been informed before the trip. Responding to the Scottish National party’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, in the Commons, Johnson denied any knowledge of the issue. Blackford said it was an “absolutely shocking error of judgment. Anyone can see that his campaign trip to Scotland was utterly, utterly reckless.” Blackford said No 10 had made a choice to proceed with the visit. “They knew the visit posed a risk … the prime minister put politics before public health. Why be so reckless?” Johnson said he had not been made aware of the outbreak “before or since” the visit to Valneva. “It is my job to visit every part of this country, nothing and no one is going to is going to stop me, and I am very, very proud of the record of the government in rolling out the vaccine,” he said."
2021-02-03T18:30:54Z,politics,Politics,Labour defends new strategy to focus on patriotism and union flag,"Labour has defended its renewed focus on British values and the union jack after a leaked strategy document was criticised by some within the party, saying Keir Starmer sees patriotism as wanting to improve the country. The leaked strategy document, seen by the Guardian, advised Labour to make “use of the [union] flag, veterans [and] dressing smartly” as part of a rebranding to help it win back the trust of disillusioned voters. It also reveals that voters could not describe what or who Labour stands for. The presentation suggests that displays of patriotism are needed to reinforce that the party has changed. One slide says: “Belonging needs to be reinforced through all messengers,” while another is headed “communicating Labour’s respect and commitment for the country can represent a change in the party’s body language”. The document has been criticised by a number of leftwing MPs, including former shadow cabinet ministers Clive Lewis and Richard Burgeon, who said it risked alienating young and BAME voters and lacked ambition and authenticity. However, some of the party’s former MPs defended the strategy, saying it showed the party wanted to rebuild trust. Gareth Snell, the former MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, said critics should realise how critical some of the issues were for some voters and that patriotism should not be conflated with xenophobia.
“I don’t think some of the criticism that came out last night that suggested that this is just a move towards nationalism is fair at all because there is a clear and distinct difference between patriotism and nationalism,” he said. “Clement Attlee and Denis Healey both wore uniforms and took pride in their country and no one would consider them nationalists. “But if we’re going to align ourselves with a more patriotic platform, it has to be more than skin-deep, it has to be properly understanding why is it that places like Stoke have a particular support base for the armed forces and traditional values. Why is it we care about certain things that are very different but not less relevant than the things that are cared about much more metropolitan areas? Our challenge is appealing to both of those groups, we cannot win without both.” Phil Wilson, the former MP for Sedgefield, tweeted that a Labour leader’s patriotism should be “a given, not a strategy.” A Labour spokesperson said Starmer was proud to be patriotic. “Keir wants to be prime minister of this country, because he wants to believe that a better future is possible for this country, where we can spread opportunities for everybody, we can rebuild our public services, we can create best businesses in the world, which are the envy of the world,” the spokesperson said. “You can call it whatever you want patriotism or whatever, but that’s what he stands for. The union flag represents a country that Labour wants to govern. And the country that Keir Starmer wants to be prime minister of, it is a symbol of the country we want to lead. “That is the patriotism that drives our movement. It is fighting for a better country.” Asked if Starmer agreed with views from voters in the document, prepared by the agency, his spokesperson said: “We’ve always said it is a long road to rebuild the party so we can win in 2024. We’re on that road.” Starmer’s spokesperson said the Labour leader disagreed with comments from Lewis, the former shadow defence secretary, that the party was pandering to the “nativist right”. “We don’t agree with that,” his spokesperson said. Richard Burgon, the former shadow justice secretary who is now a leading figure of the leftwing Socialist Campaign Group of MPs, said the strategy made for “sorry reading” and said the leadership should be bolder. “It’s the biggest public health crisis for a century the biggest economic crisis in 300 years,” he said. “Reading that thing you think, is this the best of the party can do in those circumstance? I thought it looked a bit desperate and suggests a worrying paucity of ideas.” He said he was concerned that the strategy was taking votes for granted from young people and BAME communities. “This is symptomatic of a strategy which goes chasing votes from groups who already have their own party – the Conservative party,” he said. “You end up with the worst of both worlds losing the support you have already got and not gaining new supporters in sufficient numbers.”"
2021-02-02T20:16:08Z,politics,Politics,DUP launch campaign to scrap Northern Ireland Brexit protocol,"The Democratic Unionist party has launched an official and coordinated campaign to get the Northern Ireland protocol scrapped from the Brexit agreement. It marks a rapid escalation of tensions with Boris Johnson who was swept to power on the back of an “oven ready” Brexit deal that included a trade barrier down the Irish sea the DUP opposed. In a statement, the Democratic Unionists vowed to actively oppose at every opportunity any negative measures, laws or bills that continue to flow from the protocol and which undermine Northern Ireland’s place in the UK internal market. And they put Dublin and London on notice that the party will not participate in any talks with the Irish government related to the protocol warning ominously that “north south relations will be impacted”. Using the slogan “restore our place in the UK internal market”, it said it will “work with other unionists to send a united message” to Johnson. It also vowed to “oppose any protocol related measures” in Stormont that undermine the internal market and would launch an e-petition with the ambition of securing enough signatures to force a debate on the issue in parliament.
DUP leader Arlene Foster will have a virtual meeting with the prime minister on Wednesday in addition to a conference call with the Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and the European commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič. Up to now Foster has largely been preoccupied by the Covid crisis at home leaving the anti-protocol protests to Westminster DUP MPs including Ian Paisley. But the EU’s decision on Friday to trigger, and quickly revoke, article 16 of the protocol to as part of a vaccines trade war has united and emboldened the Westminster and domestic leadership. The DUP statement claimed that the EU’s move revealed that its commitment to the Good Friday Agreement institutions were not borne out of political opportunism. Behind the scenes briefings have also been taking place with the European Research Group with individual MPs such as Sir Bernard Jenkins expressing great interest in the cause. The launch of their Brexit battle came at the end of a day when Michael Gove vowed to work with the EU to bring an end to some of the Brexit issues that have caused upset in the wider NI community including new rules on pet transport and plant imports from English garden centres. He also said he would address the looming end to a three month grace period for checks on certain goods including chilled meats such as British sausages and large supermarket consignments. “We do need to make sure that supermarkets and other traders can continue, as they are at the moment, to be able to supply consumers with the goods that they need.” Gove admitted damage had been done but said the backtracking on Article 16 showed they had simply “mucked up”. However the DUP maintains the EU’s move has caused lasting harm and “compounded the notion that the EU is playing fast and loose with Northern Ireland, attempting on the one hand to require the UK Government to enforce its obligations whilst being prepared to waive elements of the protocol when it suits the needs of the EU”. “This is unsustainable,” it said."
2021-02-02T20:01:50Z,politics,Politics,Women criticise release of private messages about Alex Salmond inquiry,"A group of women who discussed allegations of sexual assault by Alex Salmond have attacked the Crown Office and MSPs after their private messages about the case were released to the Scottish parliament. The women, understood to be Scottish National party figures, said releasing the texts could have “grave consequences” for future victims of alleged sexual violence if people feared their private correspondence could be disclosed. The messages were released last Friday to MSPs looking into the Scottish government’s botched investigation into claims Salmond had sexually harassed two officials after Holyrood issued an unprecedented legal order demanding they were disclosed. In a statement released by Rape Crisis Scotland, the small group of women said they were “deeply disappointed” the committee had asked for the messages, and questioned the conduct of some MSPs. “We have no doubt that members of the committee knew that vulnerable witnesses were involved when they made the request,” they said. “We are also deeply disturbed that the crown has felt it appropriate to break the trust we placed in it. Having been let down by the Crown Office, we feel this unnecessary act will have done serious damage to progress made over the last few years in sexual assault cases. “We urge the crown to consider the grave consequences of their actions, and are actively considering further options.” The committee’s convener, Linda Fabiani, made it clear there were no plans to publish the messages. She said: “These communications included numerous chains of private messages between different women in what we are clear were safe spaces … We will not publish any of these messages as we are clear that we will not do anything that may cause further unnecessary distress to any women.” Salmond was tried in March 2020 on 14 charges of sexual assault, including one of attempted rape, but acquitted of every charge after a jury trial at the high court in Edinburgh. He acknowledged having a “sleepy cuddle” with one complainant, and confirmed he apologised to her soon afterwards. He also said he had a consensual sexual encounter with another woman who accused him of attempted rape, but on a different day months earlier. Salmond has alleged that SNP officials and people close to Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, were involved in a conspiracy to bolster the police investigation and had pushed complainants into giving evidence – an allegation Sturgeon has repeatedly denied. A Holyrood source said the nine MSPs on the committee had unanimously agreed on Tuesday morning that the messages were private and would not be used in their investigation. They agreed, however, to press the Crown Office further, to ensure any relevant material is released to the committee. Sandy Brindley, the chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland, said: “I have read the messages: there’s nothing in them which is relevant to the committee remit or anything which is suggestive of a conspiracy. They show women supporting each other through a very difficult time.”"
2021-02-02T19:56:17Z,politics,Politics,Sir Simon Robey: the accidental banker adding George Osborne to the fold,"Sir Simon Robey had his career planned out. He wanted to become a professional opera singer and his dream was to sing on stage at the Royal Opera House, but he accidentally stumbled into investment banking. It’s a decision he occasionally regrets while singing in the shower in the morning. But Robey, 60, turned out to be a pretty good banker, and has been described as the City’s “trillion dollar man” for the cumulative size of the mega-deals he has worked on, including advising the Cadbury board on the sale of the 197-year-old chocolate company to America’s Kraft in 2010. His sought-after advice has earned him at least £137m in the last seven years alone. He is spending this lockdown at Bramfield Hall, a Grade II-listed, 16th-century country estate in Suffolk, which was owned by the Rabett family for 450 years until Robey spent a chunk of his bonus on it. It was at Bramfield that Robey, a lifelong Arsenal fan, this week signed up a new recruit for his boutique investment bank Robey Warshaw. His old friend and former chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne will become the only person to join the bank as a partner since Robey founded it with fellow investment banking superstars Simon Warshaw (an heir of the Molton Brown beauty empire) and Philip Apostolides in 2013. Osborne will be giving up his elective portfolio of roles, including editor-in-chief of the Evening Standard newspaper, but the new job is set to propel the former chancellor – best remembered for ushering in a decade of austerity and public spending cuts – even higher into the ranks of the top 1% of high earners. Robey Warshaw has paid out £207m in profits to partners over the last six years, according to accounts filed at Companies House. Most of the money has gone to Robey, who is understood to hold the biggest equity chunk in the partnership. The accounts show that the bank, which operates out of a townhouse on Grosvenor Square in Mayfair, turned over £255m in the six years to March 2020, but has not paid any tax. Robey Warshaw said it was not liable for tax because of its structure as a limited liability partnership, and that it is “the responsibility of the individual members to settle any liability arising from their share of partnership profits”. A spokesperson for the bank declined to state how much tax the partners had paid on their share of the profits, but said: “All Robey Warshaw partners are UK registered taxpayers and pay all taxes required under UK law.” “It’s all very cosy, isn’t it?” said Richard Burgon, a Labour MP and former economic secretary to the Treasury. He sees Osborne’s move as an example of the “revolving door” in British public life between government and the financial sector. “He [Osborne] was in charge of putting the banks in order after the financial crisis, but instead he embarked on the austerity drive that transferred wealth from the majority to the top 1%,” Burgon said. “Now he has got an incredibly lucrative job as a result, it is a reminder that the political elite runs our society in the interest of the economic elite.” Robey was adopted and grew up in Cambridge. He has described himself as “an odd child”. “Anorak, glasses, listening to classical music and watching birds. It was a fairly nerdy upbringing in Cambridge,” he told the Evening Standard. He boarded at Reed’s School, an independent private school in Cobham, Surrey, before winning a choral scholarship to read English at Magdalen College, Oxford. It was while performing in a cabaret at Oxford’s Randolph Hotel that he accidentally stumbled into banking. A so-called “milk round” presentation for the investment bank Lazard was taking place next door. He wandered in on a whim, and won a place as a graduate trainee. “When I joined Lazard in 1983, it was very English, very old-fashioned and a bit like being back at boarding school. We shared one computer, had long lunches and drank champagne after work,” he wrote in an FT magazine article celebrating 30 of “the City’s most influential people”. “Lots of things were wrong with this set-up: it was a bit clubby, male and public school.” As he progressed in his career and joined Morgan Stanley, where he worked for 25 years before starting out on his own, Robey became – to his own admission – a difficult and demanding boss. His colleagues once gave him a T-shirt with “Get This Right or I’ll Kill You” printed on it, which he proudly wore at the gym. He had uttered the words “half in jest” to a colleague during a deal in 1996. He now claims to have “mellowed a lot”. Robey has worked on some of the biggest deals in British, European and worldwide business. He advised Marks & Spencer on its defence against a takeover attempt by Sir Philip Green; helped AstraZeneca’s defence against a takeover by the US’s Pfizer; and worked with the London Stock Exchange on its aborted merger with Deutsche Börse. He was also involved in Halifax Bank of Scotland’s emergency merger with Lloyds TSB during the financial crisis in a deal hammered out in a three-bedroom flat in Mayfair. And he advised the Treasury on Bradford & Bingley’s nationalisation. Osborne is not the first person from politics that Robey has brought into banking. He recruited Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair’s former chief of staff, and Lord Heywood, the former cabinet secretary, during his time at Morgan Stanley. His love of opera has not left him, and he finally got to grace the Royal Opera House’s main stage when he became chairman in 2008. Soon after he took the job Robey appointed Lord Heywood’s wife, Suzanne, to the board. He stepped down himself soon after being knighted for services to music in 2016. Robey is married to Victoria, a former banker and the ex-wife of the incoming BBC chairman Richard Sharp. He has three children from a previous marriage, and is stepfather to Victoria’s three children. He still sings, but says he has to be “very drunk” to do so in public. But he did once take to the stage in a piano bar in the Swiss resort of Klosters. “He was fabulous,” a PR executive recalled. “Unfortunately the Swiss tourists didn’t realise that they were being sung to by one of the City’s best investment bankers.”"
2021-02-02T19:49:35Z,politics,Politics,Leak reveals Labour plan to focus on flag and patriotism to win back voters,"Labour must make “use of the [union] flag, veterans [and] dressing smartly” as part of a radical rebranding to help it win back the trust of disillusioned voters, according to a leaked internal strategy presentation. The presentation, which has been seen and heard by the Guardian, is aimed at what the party calls “foundation seats”, a new term for the “red wall” constituencies that handed Boris Johnson a landslide in 2019, and other seats it fears could also turn blue. It will be seen as a marker of how concerned Labour is about its electoral position. It reveals that voters could not describe what or who Labour stands for. While the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is rated by voters as the party’s biggest positive driver, concerns were voiced about him “sitting on the fence”. The strategy is yet to be shared with most MPs or staffers, and Labour party managers are understood to be preparing a redacted version because of its “sensitivity”. Some party officials who have seen the presentation are alarmed by the language, believing the leadership has not reckoned with the nationalistic sentiments it invokes. Presenting the strategy last month – including research on the party’s brand by agency Republic dating from September – the party’s head of research said voters were confused about “what we stand for, and what our purpose is, but also who we represent”. His slides featured comments from the focus groups such as: “I don’t know anything about the Labour party at the moment, they have been way too quiet” and “he [Starmer] needs to stop sitting on the fence”. Voters see this fog as deliberate and cynical, top officials have been told, proving that Starmer and his team are “not being forthright and honest … about where we want to be”. One Birmingham voter described Labour as “two different parties under one name”. An ex-Labour voter from Grimsby is quoted: “They are the voice of the students. They have left real people, taxpayers behind.” Labour’s new strategy is based on extensive focus groups from Watford to Grimsby conducted in September alongside nationwide polling. The findings are being briefed to some politicians and senior staffers now, and already appear to be shaping Labour’s communications and policy-making. The presentation suggests that displays of patriotism are needed to reinforce that the party has changed. One slide says: “Belonging needs to be reinforced through all messengers,” while another is headed “communicating Labour’s respect and commitment for the country can represent a change in the party’s body language”. Among the top recommendations is: “The use of the flag, veterans, dressing smartly at the war memorial etc give voters a sense of authentic values alignment.” Approached for a response, a senior Labour official said the language came from the agency’s research rather than their own phrasing. The bigger possible consequences of the left playing national-identity politics have concerned some staffers who have seen the presentation. One said: “I was just sat there replaying in my mind the storming of the Capitol [in Washington last month] and thinking: are you really so blind to what happens when you start pandering to the language and concerns of the right?” Clive Lewis, one of Labour’s leading ethnic-minority MPs, said: “The Tory party has absorbed Ukip and now Labour appears to be absorbing the language and symbols of the Tory party.” Lewis served as a soldier in Afghanistan but decried his party’s flag-waving. “It’s not patriotism; it’s Fatherland-ism. There’s a better way to build social cohesion than moving down the track of the nativist right.” In WhatsApp messages, sent within hours of one briefing, senior officials ordered: “Please prioritise the union jack header images, not the plain red ones.” Earlier this week Starmer presented a party-political broadcast beside a union flag and promising to “rebuild our country”. Red wall voters have also been targeted with a Facebook advert, which demands the Tories get tougher on border control, something which Labour emphasised in an opposition day debate on Monday. “Britain is locked down. But the borders are open. Any idea why?” the ad said, attracting criticism for language describing the hotel quarantine system that would more normally be used in xenophobic attacks on immigrants. The strategy warns the party to brace for a backlash from “Scots and younger remain voters”, especially ahead of the Holyrood elections in May. The strategy accepts that Labour has “excluded” and “ignored” once-core voters, which the presentation appears to blame on Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, under which the party is described as a “party of protest”, expressing “unpatriotic” sentiments, with “arrogance” and “idealism”. Last year’s election inquiry by party heavyweights such as Ed Miliband described the cause somewhat differently, concluding the loss of votes was a consequence of issues of alienation stretching back decades. Staffers are also concerned at the policy ideas presented to the focus groups, including 5,000 new police officers, a fund to invest in barren high streets and protecting local bus services. A staffer who sat through another presentation said: “I couldn’t remember any of those ideas half an hour later. They were that dull.” Labour said those policies had been chosen by an agency and as examples used to test voters’ priorities. A senior Labour official said that although the phrasing had been written by an external agency, senior figures agreed on the fundamentals and said it was intended to demonstrate internally the challenges facing the party. “Different parts of the Labour party have different opinions on what was got wrong and what wasn’t – this is broadly a reality check of what the public thinks of Labour.” The strategy also suggests the party fears Boris Johnson’s lasting “relatability” could maintain his popularity with the country. Attacks will focus on “incompetence” in tackling the Covid crisis and plan to focus next on the Tories’ “waste” and the sense they are “cavalier and self-interested”. The research also concludes that voters believe Labour is the party of “spend, spend, spend”, blamed on the leadership of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. The result, according to the heading on one slide, is: “No part of the brand is insulated from lack of economic credibility.” Whereas the public is said to care most about the economy, healthcare and Britain leaving the EU, in that order, it sees Labour politicians as sharing only one of those priorities – health – while the Tories are seen as caring most about Brexit and the economy. A Labour party spokesperson said the presentation consisted of conclusions reached by a third party rather than Labour officials. “This is a report by an external organisation from September 2020. It deals with pre-existing perceptions of the party. Keir [Starmer] and Angela [Rayner, deputy leader] have been very clear that Labour has a mountain to climb to win in 2024 but is on the right path.”"
2021-02-02T19:49:30Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer's patriot act risks turning off his core Labour voters,"The speaker’s tone is mild but to his audience the words are deeply alarming. It is early this January, and senior Labour officials are finding out exactly what the public thinks of them. It’s not kind. “We lack any form of identity,” says one of them. In voters’ minds, says this longstanding staffer who has devoted punishing days and nights to his cause, the party is defined by “wish-washyness”. The fog of confusion seems to reach all the way to the top. Almost a year into Keir Starmer’s leadership, this secret internal presentation suggests “his image lacks definition from other politicians”. While he scores vastly better than Jeremy Corbyn, lots of Britons find him less “relatable” than that son of Eton, Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson. So far the new leader’s policy of being not-Corbyn is having less success than he hoped – because Labour’s problems appear to go far deeper than just its previous leader. While Corbyn in 2019 clearly did not work, leading Labour to its biggest bulldozering since 1935, neither did Ed Miliband or Gordon Brown. All three men represented different strands of social democratic tradition. Even now, when the UK is cursed with one of the worst Covid death tolls in the developed world and economic devastation, the Conservatives still lead Labour in the polls. This is the backdrop that has led Starmer to consider wrapping himself in the union flag. It is a huge risk, make no mistake. The very people he wants to woo may see Labour’s new red, white and blue as so much spray paint. Here is Westminster’s arch-remainer now talking up the possibilities of Brexit; a human rights lawyer professing his love for the police and the army. As one staffer in Labour HQ who has seen the new strategy says: “They don’t believe any of this stuff; they’re saying whatever they think will get them votes.” In the era of authentocracy, there is no political sin more grave than being fake. Others believe Starmer’s office has got both language and symbols wrong. The North of Tyne mayor, Jamie Driscoll, may count as Labour’s most powerful politician in the north-east. He has seen the videos of his leader emoting in front of a union flag and says: “Up here, we talk about defending the north-east. Bringing up the union – well, that’s a reminder of the establishment down south, isn’t it?” The biggest risk of all, as acknowledged by the party strategists, is that Starmer’s patriot act will turn off those voters who Labour still believes it can rely on – the young and the ethnic minorities. And it may well drive away its last bastions of support in the increasingly independent-minded Scotland. One frontbencher representing a seat in the north-west says: “To get a majority in parliament Labour needs to win both Chipping Barnet and Bishop Auckland. At the moment, they’re just playing to Bishop Auckland.” A year ago, when Labour was holding its latest leadership contest, every candidate felt compelled to discuss the fragility of an electoral coalition that stretches from Walthamstow to Workington. This problem stretches back decades and since Brown’s leadership the way Labour has tried to get around it is by focusing its appeal along the lines of economics and class. Miliband had his “squeezed middle” to be won over by lower energy bills, while Corbyn tried to engender a sense of shared interests between the Uber driver and the university lecturer on a zero-hours contract. Any appeals to national identity have always looked as forced as a politician’s selfie on the doorstep. Starmer began his leadership in much the same vein, making 10 pledges to party members that were essentially continuity Corbynism. Yet he now appears to be moving away from the language of economics and policy to identity and values. “There’s no way he can do that flagwaving better than the likes of Nigel Farage,” says Driscoll. And so the biggest leftwing party in Europe could find itself in a very strange position. It could be accused of combining the electoral tactics of the right with the economics of the right, too. The party’s strategy calls for it to broadcast its “economic competence” and drop the associations with “spend, spend, spend”. This sounds like shorthand for dropping any attempt to be significantly different on tax and spend from the Tories. This may all work for Starmer and his team. Or it may be that in a choice between Coke and Diet, voters prefer the real thing – in which case it could well be jettisoned for the next new thing. But in the meantime it raises one question for all progressives in the UK: if the main party of the left seeks to walk like the right and talk like the right, then what precisely is the point of the main party of the left?"
2021-02-02T18:53:00Z,politics,Politics,Gove says rather more than intended after parliament finally unites over Europe | John Crace,"After years of division, who would have guessed that it would take the European commission to unite the entire House of Commons – not to mention the whole of Ireland – over Europe? Last Friday, the EU had what can only be described as a hallucinatory episode when it imagined that vaccine manufacturers were planning to start a major drug racketeering scam by smuggling their jabs across the border from the Republic into Northern Ireland and promptly invoked article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol. If only for a short while, as within hours that decision had been rescinded. “Trust has been eroded,” said Michael Gove, in answer to an urgent question from the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Louise Haigh. It’s quite something when the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has the moral high ground on matters of trust, but it was a measure of just how extreme the EU’s actions had been that no one thought to challenge Gove on his own track record of duplicity. Rather there was a general agreement from MPs of all parties that the EU had been totally out of order to unilaterally invoke article 16 before all other options had been explored. The EU had made a serious mistake, Haigh agreed, and now was the time for calm heads. Peace in Northern Ireland had been hard-won and was too important to be used as a political football. Several MPs who had been using Northern Ireland as a political football for years nodded their heads in agreement: the protocol must never again be undermined in this way. This was Gove slightly out of his element. Normally there’s nothing he likes more than telling people – usually with confected, passive-aggressive sincerity – how right they are to be on the same side of the argument as himself. Especially when they aren’t. But now he found himself obliged to be somewhat more genuine, as time and again he found himself praising MPs – both Europhiles and Eurosceptics – for their wisdom and foresight in seeing things from his point of view, while expressing his own regrets at the threats made against border control officers in Larne and Belfast. In the end, all this honest agreement rather got to Gove and he wound up saying rather more than he intended. Boris Johnson has always maintained that any difficulties with the movement of goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK had only ever been teething problems; but Gove suggested the problems were rather more intrinsic and there were issues that had been overlooked in everyone’s haste to get a deal signed off in such a short time frame. Gove even indicated that some grace periods would need to be extended: something the Northern Ireland minister, Brandon Lewis, had previously said was unthinkable. All of this was soluble, he insisted. Just leave it with him and his EU counterpart, Maroš Šefčovič, to work out. That didn’t sound wholly convincing – the EU triggering article 16 less than a month after the end of the transition period didn’t bode well for the future of the protocol – but no one had any better ideas so Gove was by and large left unchallenged. As was Matt Hancock who came to the chamber to give a coronavirus update that was pretty much a repeat of the No 10 press conference he had given the day before. I guess he wanted to make the most of 2 February being Groundhog Day. The vaccination programme was on schedule with 9.2 million jabs having been administered and urgent action was being taken to track down the contacts of the 11 cases of the South African variant that had been passed on through community transmission. Not that the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, and others didn’t try to pin Hancock down on matters of detail. Such as whether Sage had recommended a more aggressive hotel quarantine policy and when the South African variant was first identified. Rather it felt as if no one was in the mood for political point scoring right now; as if even most MPs needed a break from reminding the government of how its mishandling of the pandemic over the past year had caused so many, many unnecessary deaths. Maybe also there was a touch of fear in the chamber. That Covid-19 was a trickier disease than had been first thought and the vaccine might not be the get-out-of-jail card everyone hoped. These anxieties were largely kept contained though and there was more the sense that everyone was waiting for something to happen. Only they didn’t quite know what that something was. Then nobody does. Not even Hancock. Especially Matt Hancock."

Nicola Sturgeon has announced a phased return to school for Scotlandâ€™s youngest children, with nurseries and all primary pupils from P1 to P3 back in the classroom from 22 February. She also said her government would introduce a â€œmuch more comprehensiveâ€� quarantine policy than Englandâ€™s, introducing â€œmanaged quarantineâ€� for anyone arriving in Scotland, regardless of where they have come from. (See 3.50pm.) Oxford University has released research showing that a single dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has an efficacy rate of 76% after 22 days until 90 days. The research also suggests giving single doses of the vaccine could reduce transmission by 67%. (See 5.57pm.) Scientists have said evidence that the Kent variant of coronavirus, which is now the dominant one in the UK, is becoming more similar to the South African one is worrying. (See 12pm.) Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has said the testing is being boosted in parts of Bristol and Liverpool after â€œmutations of concernâ€� were found in the virus circulating there. (See 1.32pm.) The number of excess deaths in the UK has gone above 100,000, cementing the countryâ€™s position as one of the developed nations worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic. The UK government is to seek the lifting of unexpected Brexit controls in Northern Ireland, including checks on pets crossing the Irish Sea and a ban on British soil entering the region in potted plants from English garden suppliers. The great hope for drug treatments against Covid-19 â€“ the monoclonal antibodies â€“ are failing against variants of the virus, such as those that have emerged in South Africa and Brazil, scientists have found. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2021-02-02T18:01:34Z,politics,Politics,To hell with Brexit and Westminster,"I enjoyed Ben Fletcher’s vivid image of Dante’s fifth circle of hell for the post-Brexit channel crossings (Report, 31 January). There’s a big difference, though: in Dante the poor souls are suffering their torment as punishment for their own sins (intemperate anger), whereas at Dover the lorry drivers are enduring their misery because of the sins of others (and one hopes the drivers’ righteous anger would therefore not be considered sinful). But I wonder in what circle of hell Dante would place those who are responsible for the chaos. Presumably somewhere in the eighth – but is it among the fraudulent counsellors, or the falsifiers, or even the treacherous to country and cause? Martina Crowther-Menn Cambridge • To claim that “the last thing Britain needs is to fall apart in a fit of absence of mind” (Editorial, 28 January) is to ignore England’s uncompromising Brexit, forced through in an absence of mind.

2021-02-02T17:04:08Z,politics,Politics,UK to seek lifting of Brexit controls in Northern Ireland,"The UK government is to seek the lifting of unexpected Brexit controls in Northern Ireland, including checks on pets crossing the Irish Sea and a ban on British soil entering the region in potted plants from English garden suppliers. The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, said he would be writing to the European commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič on Tuesday, seeking urgent action on Brexit checks that were affecting the “daily life” of people in Northern Ireland. He told parliament he would be addressing the extension of the 1 April grace period on checks on chilled meats, including British sausages, and “everything from pet transport to the provision of plants and seeds to gardens in Northern Ireland, and the daily life of our fellow citizens does need to be protected”. The EU rules on soil and pets are designed to prevent diseases from entering the Republic of Ireland. The original Brexit plan was to draw up a list of goods “at risk” of going over the border but this did not materialise because of rows between negotiators and time constraints. Gove will also meet Northern Ireland’s first minister, Arlene Foster, the deputy first minister, Michelle O’Neill, and Šefčovič on Wednesday to discuss escalating tensions over Brexit in Northern Ireland. “All of these issues and more are ways in which the protocol is having an impact on people in Northern Ireland, which is not in the interests of Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom, or indeed good relations between US and the EU. Vice-president Maroš Šefčovič totally understands the need to resolve these issues. And with goodwill, I believe that we can [do so] speedily,” said Gove.
The meeting comes after all Northern Irish and EU officials were withdrawn from duties conducting physical checks on goods from Great Britain amid concerns over their safety after reports of “menacing behaviour” and graffiti threatening border officials and the former Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar. The threats have been widely condemned, with Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, describing them as “sinister and ugly”. “Obviously, we will be doing everything we possibly can to assist them to defuse the situation,” he said. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said they did not believe loyalist paramilitaries were involved in threats made to workers conducting post-Brexit trade checks, but that disgruntled individuals or small groups may be responsible, rather than the organised gangs that once instigated serious violence. Assistant chief constable Mark McEwan said: “We are concerned about the actions of a number of individuals and small groups. “We don’t believe that those actions are organised. But they do give us cause for concern.” Sammy Wilson, the Democratic Unionist party MP for East Antrim, said it appeared that one staff member may have been identified or followed home, raising deep concerns among the police and the security services. “It is not a case of just guarding the port. It is a case of real danger when they [staff] go home at night. Because it appears that that is what has been happening at present. They have been gathering intelligence about where people live etc,” he said. The outgoing Northern Ireland agriculture minister, Edwin Poots, has said the controls on the Irish Sea were “disproportionate” and had “certainly created a lot of tension in the community”. The parties in Belfast are sharply divided on EU withdrawal and the Northern Ireland protocol, which keeps the land border in Ireland open but imposes controls on the Irish Sea, and unexpected bans on soil and controls on pets have fuelled opposition in loyalist communities. The DUP MP for Belfast East, Gavin Robinson, told Gove that soil or pets from GB to NI had “zero risks” to the EU and should not have been part of the arrangements designed to stop fraud and smuggling into the Republic of Ireland. Gove pledged to redouble efforts on the workings of the protocol and urged the EU to follow suit. “The EU needs to work with us at speed, and with determination and resolve a series of outstanding issues with the protocol, he said. Gove was pressed by several MPs including Labour’s Hilary Benn and the Conservative MP Simon Hoare, the chair of the Northern Ireland affairs committee, to seek permanent solutions. “We have to make the protocol work and work well,” said Hoare. Louise Haigh, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said: “Calm is now needed and everyone has a responsibility to dial down the rhetoric and ensure the safety of people in Northern Ireland.”"
2021-02-01T20:11:27Z,politics,Politics,Hancock as surprised as anyone to find himself bearer of good news  | John Crace,"For months now, Matt Hancock has looked a beaten man every time he is forced to front a Downing Street coronavirus press conference – someone who knows the government has made a series of catastrophic mistakes in its handling of the pandemic and is fairly sure he is liable to be made the scapegoat when the reckoning comes. But on Monday, the health secretary was almost back to his pre-Covid self. Maybe not the full-on Tigger but a long way from the Door Matt he has become over the last half year. The change was subtle but it was noticeable – particularly in his use of language. Out had gone the continuous, monotone defeatism and back had come the occasional drift into the upbeat patter of a junior account manager at a PR agency. He and the UK were “powering ahead” together.
Just for once, Hancock had some relatively good news to tell. Not only in the rates of infections falling but in nearly a million vaccinations having been given over the past weekend, bringing the total of people to have had their first jab up to 9.2 million. It was also looking more than likely that the government would actually keep its promise of immunising everyone in the top four priority groups by 15 February. No one could quite tell who was most surprised by that: Matt or the rest of the country. Up till now, the only thing the UK had been “world-beating” in was the number of deaths. Now – to everyone’s, especially Boris Johnson’s, surprise – the UK appeared to be showing the rest of the world how to run a vaccination programme. Matt was feeling so good about himself and all the vaccinations – past, present and future – the UK had been able to acquire that he didn’t even feel the need to get much of a dig in at the EU’s article 16 brain fade that had assumed that Pfizer BioNTech were going to be operating a major smuggling route along the Northern Ireland border with the Republic of Ireland. Rather he merely congratulated himself again for having taken the necessary steps to protect everyone in the UK, while reminding everyone that the fight against the pandemic was a global effort in which we were playing a leading role and we would extend our largesse as and when. The only slightly tricky moment came with the news that of the 105 people with the South African variant, 11 had acquired the infection within the community. But somehow Hancock almost managed to spin this into a good news story by observing that if it hadn’t been for the UK’s genomic sequencing capacity, there was a fair chance that the rest of the world would yet to have realised that that the mutation had taken place. So the fact that these variants were popping up in the UK was just a sign of how far ahead of the game we really were. Not everyone was as convinced by the health secretary’s chipper demeanour as Hancock himself seemed to be. The questions ranged from whether the government ought to be taking more draconian measures to clamp down on the South African variant, whether the “second shot” supplies of the Pfizer BioNTech could be guaranteed and whether the vaccine was being fairly distributed across the country. But Matt was adamantly Panglossian. All was for the best in the best of all possible worlds. Yes, the pandemic had taken a terrible toll but now was not the moment to be concentrating on all the things that the UK had screwed up over the past 10 months, such as being too slow to lock down, the failure of track and trace and a failure to follow the scientific advice. Rather we should be celebrating – cautiously, he added – the fact that we had vaccinated more people than anyone else. Not least, because that we had done so had come as much as a surprise to him as it had the rest of the country. When Boris had said that the most vulnerable 15 million people would be immunised by the middle of February, Matt had quite naturally assumed that this was yet another prime ministerial promise that was bound to be broken. But now it was looking like a decent bet. As with most of Hancock’s press briefings, there were moments of confusion. At one moment he said there was more than enough vaccine to go round while minutes later he admitted the supply was bumpy. And neither he, nor the two scientists alongside him, seemed to agree on just how effective the vaccine was on the new variants or why unpaid carers were in a lower tier to paid ones. But for Matt, these were incidental details. Yes, things were still terrible, but it had felt like an age since he hadn’t had to explain yet another government fuck-up. “See you again soon,” he said breezily, as he brought the presser to a close, amazed that it had passed off so positively. Happy days, though God knows, there was bound to be more bad news coming his way before long. So he was going to enjoy this moment while he could. Call it respite care."
2021-02-01T19:41:06Z,politics,Politics,Joanna Cherry sacked from SNP frontbench at Westminster,"Joanna Cherry, one of Nicola Sturgeon’s fiercest internal critics, has been sacked from the Scottish National party’s frontbench at Westminster after a public feud with its former deputy leader last week. Cherry, an advocate and queen’s counsel, announced on Twitter that she had been sacked as the party’s spokesperson for home affairs in a reshuffle of the SNP’s Commons frontbench, and immediately hit out at her Westminster colleagues and party leadership over its strategy on independence. After implying that she would continue criticising party leaders from her new position on the party’s ruling national executive, Cherry tweeted: “Westminster is increasingly irrelevant to Scotland’s constitutional future and the SNP would do well to radically rethink our strategy.” She was elected to the national executive late last year as one of the most senior figures in a slate of SNP activists involved in the Common Weal group, many of them angry at Sturgeon’s cautious approach to staging a second referendum and critical of the first minister’s stance on transgender rights. Cherry, a supporter of “gender critical” campaigners, also has close links to the Women’s Pledge grouping of SNP activists who won seats on the national executive and other party committees. They argue that the Scottish government’s measures to strengthen the rights and protections for trans people have eroded rights for women. Cherry clashed last week with Kirsty Blackman, the SNP’s former deputy leader at Westminster, over the SNP’s policies on trans rights, in what many observers believe is a proxy war between supporters of Alex Salmond and Sturgeon loyalists. It was not the first time the two had disagreed on the subject on social media. Blackman, who quit as Commons deputy leader last year and is now an economy spokesperson, said on Twitter in December that trans people and their supporters were leaving the SNP because of Cherry’s behaviour and that of senior party figures, and said: “Things have moved on since the 80s.” Cherry responded that she had done nothing to set back the rights of trans people. The MP, herself a lesbian, accused Blackman of breaching the SNP’s code of conduct with her tweet, adding: “I’ll ignore the ageism as I wouldn’t expect a privileged young straight woman to know what it was like for lesbians in the 80s.” On Thursday night, Sturgeon broadcast a video on Twitter, in her role as SNP leader, insisting that transphobia had no place in her party. She confirmed that there had been a number of resignations by younger party members critical of the perception the Scottish government has been diluting pro-trans measures in recent legislation. Cherry was blocked last year from standing against Angus Robertson – the SNP’s former Westminster leader and a Sturgeon loyalist – to be the party’s candidate in Edinburgh Central for this May’s Holyrood elections, after the party’s then national executive passed a new rule. In a move widely seen as an attack on Cherry, it became a requirement for a sitting MP standing for Holyrood to post a £10,000 bond to cover the costs of a byelection in their vacated Westminster seat. The party also introduced a policy banning MPs sitting simultaneously as MSPs. Cherry said the bond was unaffordable, and did not stand for nomination. Internal conflict in the SNP has become far more intense after Salmond’s allegations that officials close to Sturgeon tried to orchestrate government and police investigations into sexual misconduct allegations against him. Officials working for Sturgeon and her husband, Peter Murrell, the chief executive of the SNP, have been accused by Salmond of secretly conspiring on WhatsApp to push one potential witness against him into testifying with allegations that Sturgeon has dismissed as unfounded. Murrell has denied on oath there was any such conspiracy, but on Monday evening refused a request to testify again before the Holyrood committee investigating the Scottish government’s botched investigation into two claims of sexual harassment against Salmond. Salmond has been invited to give evidence in person to the Holyrood committee on 7 February, with Sturgeon scheduled to appear the following week. The hearings are likely to have a critical bearing on the SNP’s May election campaign. On Monday night Cherry said she had contacted police after receiving “a vicious threat from a man to my personal safety”. She added: “The matter has been reported to Police Scotland and I’m somewhere safe. Thank you for all the lovely messages of support.” The MP was a prominent figure in the court battles in 2019 against the UK government’s Brexit policies, and particularly its failure to consult MPs, joining in the cross-party legal challenges orchestrated by Jolyon Maugham’s Good Law Project."
2021-02-01T19:37:26Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: Portsmouth port bosses accuse government of withholding cash,"The UK’s cattle- and horse-breeding businesses could be at risk because of a government decision to cut funding for a Brexit inspection post for livestock at Portsmouth harbour, the local port, council and MP have claimed. The local authority, which owns the port, has been left with a £7m shortfall for the facility, which will be necessary if it is to continue with the export and import of live animals after 1 July, when government border health checks come into force. A council report, due to be discussed by the city council on Tuesday, said it was the only facility planned in the UK for vets to approve the import of live animals for breeding rather than slaughter, a business worth £10m a year. “The country needs Portsmouth to build this vital trading infrastructure, but this short-sighted government continues to withhold the necessary funding,” said Stephen Morgan, the local MP and shadow armed forces minister. Mike Sellers, the director of Portsmouth International Port, said it was a further £5m short of cash for the main border control post, which will conduct health checks on food and goods of animal origin, and another £2m-£3m short on related projects. It applied for £32m to build the two facilities but was allocated £17.1m after a £200m port infrastructure fund created by the government in the autumn was oversubscribed. While other ports are privately owned, Portsmouth is in public ownership and the council will not seek to raise funds through local taxation. As a result, it has scrapped the plan for the live animal inspection post, something the National Farmers’ Union says could end the animal breeding business. “We’re only doing these infrastructure projects because the government are requiring us to do so at Portsmouth,” said Morgan. Sellers said: “About 9,000 racehorses come through the port every year as well as live animals for breeding purposes. But there is no business case to borrow funds.” He said the only solution was for the government to stump up funds. Morgan is also concerned about the shortfall in funding for the traffic-easing infrastructure, as the port’s position is so constrained it is only “13 lorries away from the M275” arterial route. “It’s a densely populated city with very few routes in and out of the city, so any sort of congestion as a result of infrastructure will have a devastating impact on Portsmouth levels of congestion and traffic flow in an area with high air pollution,” said Morgan. Brexit checks came into force on 1 January in the EU but are being phased in over six months by the UK to allow businesses to adapt, with the race now on to finish all border checkpoints. A report for the Portsmouth council cabinet meeting on Tuesday cites NFU statistics showing that 30,000 breeding animals (pigs, sheep and cattle) are exported every year through Portsmouth, with a similar number imported, and without the control posts in the city a reciprocal post will not be built in Cherbourg, the corresponding port in France. This will threaten high-value exports including thoroughbred stud farming. The NFU told the council: “The absence of BCP facilities in the EU-facing port [Cherbourg] will mean that UK farmers are unable to export high-value breeding material to the EU.” The report says the government’s infrastructure fund was “substantially oversubscribed” and after a “deep-dive meeting with consultants and Cabinet Office officials, all bids were cut”, including contingencies from 40% to 10%. Sellers said the “great irony” was that Portsmouth was considered important enough to the nation to be a Brexit contingency route for medicine supplies by the Department for Transport, but not good enough for normal business by the Cabinet Office. The government said the breeding sector was not wholly dependent on Portsmouth. It said infrastructure would normally be funded by the ports themselves and Portsmouth had received £17m from the fund. “A number of border control posts will be designated for live animal imports including Dover, Sevington (Eurotunnel) and Holyhead, which are the ports with the highest volumes of animal imports from the EU,” said a government spokesman. • This article was amended on 2 February 2021. Dover is not privately owned as stated in an earlier version, it is a trust port."

He is also paid £650,000 a year for working one day a week as an adviser to the fund manager Black Rock. It is unclear how much Osborne will be paid at Robey Warshaw, which has advised on some of the largest UK takeovers since it launched in 2013. However, filings at Companies House show that the highest paid partner at Robey Warshaw collected £10m in 2020 and £27.8m in 2019. Sir Simon Robey, a former Morgan Stanley banker, is understood to be the majority-partner who has earned at least £137m since founding the boutique investment bank. Osborne, 49, will join Robey and the other founding partners Simon Warshaw and Philip Apostolides. The Mayfair-based bank, which employs 13 people, made a profit of £17.9m last year. That was a 63% decline on 2019 profits of £48.4m, which works out at £3.7m per employee. Robey Warshaw said in its latest accounts that it paid no tax last year. “The partnership is not liable for any tax due on the profits for the year. It is therefore the responsibility of the individual members to settle any liability arising from their share of partnership profits,” the bank said in its Companies House filing. In a quote given to the Financial Times, Osborne said: “Robey Warshaw is the best of the best, advising great businesses on how to grow, and I’m proud to be joining this first-rate team.” The bank, which operates from offices on Grosvenor Square, said: “We believe that George will significantly enhance the advice we give to clients. He brings differentiated experience and expertise to our team from his leading roles in global finance over the past decade.” Charles Yardley, chief executive of the Evening Standard, said Osborne would be leaving his position as the paper’s editor-in-chief in March. “We thank him for everything he has helped the Evening Standard achieve over the last four years … We wish him well in his new role.” Responding to Osborne’s appointment, the former Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: “The revolving door between Tory government and the City has always been extremely lucrative. This latest example is a timely reminder that finance and the City have had a profitable pandemic.” The Labour MP Jon Trickett said: “It’s an unhealthy development that you can be chancellor of the exchequer, in charge of the banks one day trying to put right what the bankers did wrong, and then later in your career you’re working as a full-time banker. It shouldn’t happen.” Osborne role is expected to involve helping the bank’s clients, including British Gas owner Centrica, Vodafone and BP, as well as using his connections to drum up fresh business. The bank recently advised the London Stock Exchange Group on its $27bn (£19.8bn) purchase of Refinitiv, a data provider, from the private equity group Blackstone. Warshaw was previously a lead banker at UBS, while Apostolides used to work at Morgan Stanley with Robey. Osborne had built up a portfolio of nine jobs since leaving government in 2016, ranging from newspaper editing, fund management, teaching and advising the government on levelling up the north of England. He was appointed editor of the Evening Standard in 2017, but stepped aside to become editor-in-chief of the newspaper last summer. Osborne was succeeded at the title, which is owned by the Russian multimillionaire Evgeny Lebedev, by Emily Sheffield, a former deputy editor at Vogue. Sheffield’s sister Samantha is married to the former prime minister David Cameron, who along with Osborne oversaw the cuts in public spending during the coalition government of 2010-2015. Osborne will remain chair of the advisory board of Exor, which manages the Italian Agnelli family’s interest in Juventus and Ferrari. Osborne extended his property empire last year by buying a £1.6m five-bedroom Grade II-listed Georgian home in Bruton, a town in Somerset that has become popular with wealthy Londoners looking for a second home in the country."
2021-02-01T19:05:20Z,politics,Politics,UK Covid: Hancock says 'we need to come down hard' on South African variant after 105 cases identified - as it happened,"Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has confirmed that intensified testing is being deployed in eight postcode areas in England in a bid to stamp out the South African variant of coronavirus. He said 105 cases have been identified in the country, of which 11 have no link to international travel. These are particularly worrying because they suggest that this variant - which, like the Kent variant, seems more transmissible than the original - is now spreading generally through the community. Hancock said that â€œwe need to come down on it hardâ€�. He said there was no evidence that it was more deadly than the original version of coronavirus. But in practice a variant that spreads more easily does pose a greater threat, and, although the current vaccines that are available are effective against it, they do not seem to counter it quite as forcefully as they do the original version and the Kent variant now dominant in the UK. (See 3.25pm.) This is from my colleague Nicola Davis on the South African variant.
Hancock has said that more than half of people in their 70s have now been vaccinated. Speaking at the No 10 press conference he said in his opening statement: Iâ€™m so proud of the team, whoâ€™ve now vaccinated 9.2 million people across the UK, that includes 931,204 vaccinations just this weekend. And to put that into context â€“ thatâ€™s one in every 60 adults in the whole United Kingdom vaccinated in one single weekend. Itâ€™s a mammoth effort ... Weâ€™ve now vaccinated almost nine in 10 of all over 80s in the UK and now, as of today, weâ€™ve vaccinated over half of all people in their 70s. And, Iâ€™m delighted that I can tell you weâ€™ve visited every eligible care home with older residents in England, and offered vaccinations to all their residents and staff. But about half of staff at the UKâ€™s largest care home provider have not yet received a Covid vaccine, it has emerged. Boris Johnson has suggested that England will not return to a localised tier system of restrictions as Covid-19 infections and hospital admissions slow, saying the infectiousness of the new variant had made the system less workable. Britain has taken â€œa lot of risksâ€� in rolling out its speedy Covid vaccination programme, Franceâ€™s Europe minister, ClÃ©ment Beaune, said as officials in Brussels claimed the EU had â€œnothing to envyâ€� from nations such as the UK, the US and Israel. Ryanair has warned it is heading for an annual loss of nearly â‚¬1bn (Â£880m) as the budget airline struggles through the â€œmost challengingâ€™â€� year in its 35-year history. Labour has said it is â€œextraordinaryâ€� that millions of people could potentially still be living in homes clad in dangerously flammable material, as the party launched a parliamentary push for the government to take steps to help those affected. Downing Street has defended Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, after she publicly called a journalist â€œcreepy and bizarreâ€� for asking questions about a Covid vaccines video. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2021-02-01T14:43:42Z,politics,Politics,No 10 defends minister who criticised HuffPost journalist on Twitter,"Downing Street has defended a government minister who publicly called a journalist “creepy and bizarre” for asking questions about a Covid vaccines video. Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, accused the HuffPost journalist in a Twitter thread of “making up claims” and published screenshots of questions sent to her MP’s office and to a ministerial press office, naming the reporter, Nadine White, who then received a torrent of abuse, according to HuffPost. In her posts Badenoch said it was “creepy and bizarre to fixate on who didn’t participate in a video and demand they explain themselves”. Quizzed over Badenoch’s actions, Allegra Stratton, Boris Johnson’s press secretary, said Badenoch had “been civil to Nadine White”. Stratton was unable to guarantee that other journalists who send routine emails to departments would not see them publicised via Twitter, saying only that Downing Street did not object to media questions. “You know you can always come to Downing Street and we will treat your questions and your challenges, as we are doing now, as fair, and we will always try to get back to you, and give you decent answers.” White’s emails had asked why Badenoch did not appear in the video campaign intended to encourage the take-up of the coronavirus vaccine among black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. HuffPost had not published a story connected to the questions before Badenoch tweeted to say it was because she was involved in a vaccine trial herself. Stratton added: “She felt that questions about why she wasn’t in the video were not right when she was not in the video because she was taking part in a trial. This is a case of a misunderstanding between the two parties.” Asked why Badenoch responded by publicising the journalist’s name and questions, Stratton said: “You’ll have to get comment from Kemi herself in terms of Kemi’s motive.” Saying she had not talked to Johnson about the incident, Stratton appeared to defend Badenoch’s description of White’s actions as “creepy and bizarre”, saying: “I would go to the Cabinet Office and talk to Kemi Badenoch’s team. I believe that Kemi feels that she has grounds for those words.”"
2021-02-01T06:00:02Z,politics,Politics,UK government use of Henry VIII clauses to be challenged in court,"A government move to change state aid rules after Brexit without a vote in parliament is being challenged in court, with a legal campaign group warning the manoeuvre could lead to a similar lack of scrutiny in areas such as workers’ rights and environmental protections. The Good Law Project is seeking a judicial review of the decision to use so-called Henry VIII powers to get rid of EU rules on state aid, which were incorporated into UK legislation after Brexit. The powers, named after the 1539 law which allowed Henry VIII to rule by decree, permit ministers to amend or repeal laws without full scrutiny from parliament using so-called secondary legislation, primarily via something called a statutory instrument. These are normally used to tweak laws because of changing circumstances or gaps, and generally come into force without any parliamentary scrutiny or vote, unless this is specifically sought by MPs or peers. The Good Law Project is challenging the decision of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) over its move, under the Brexit withdrawal act, to remove EU state aid rules from British law using a statutory instrument. The legal argument seeking judicial review, seen by the Guardian, argues that the relevant part of the withdrawal act only allows the Henry VIII powers to be used for specific and limited purposes, adding: “It does not permit wide-ranging policy change, including the wholesale abolition of retained EU law.” The 23-page argument says this lack of parliamentary scrutiny “raises an important issue of constitutional law”. The Good Law Project has warned that without proper limiting of the use of such powers, then other EU rules in areas such as employment rights or environmental protections could be removed from UK law without MPs getting a say or a vote. Jolyon Maugham, the barrister who leads the project, said: “Ministers can now rewrite the rules on everything from your rights at work to environmental protections. “It is no exaggeration to state that any area of law previously touched on by the EU is now within the purview of government. Government is wresting power from parliament and giving it carte blanche to ministers to remake almost every aspect of national life.” BEIS is set to oppose the process. In a response to an initial letter notifying the government of the planned legal action, the government legal department said it believed the powers had been used correctly, and that the legal challenge “does not have a realistic prospect of success”. A BEIS spokesperson said the department could not comment on an ongoing legal process, adding: “There will be no reduction in workers’ rights and the new business secretary [Kwasi Kwarteng] has reiterated this multiple times.”"
2021-01-31T15:04:12Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer urged to back radical constitutional reform for UK,"Keir Starmer has been urged to support radical reforms to devolve power in the UK, including a federal parliament, a written constitution and significant new authority for England’s regions under plans initially drawn up for Jeremy Corbyn. A lengthy report commissioned by Corbyn recommends reorganising the UK as a federal state, overseen by a new “council of the union” and replacing the House of Lords with an elected senate, alongside substantial new financial and policy powers for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Senior figures within Labour, including Gordon Brown, centrists close to Starmer, and Corbyn allies such as the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell believe that Brexit, the impact of the Covid crisis on English regions and growing anger over underinvestment in the north of England have fuelled a stronger appetite for significant reform and are urging the Labour leader to support the plans. Some of the report’s recommendations echo proposals being floated by Brown, the former prime minister, who is advising Starmer on setting up a new constitutional commission due to be launched by Labour in early spring. “There’s a ferment going on at the moment,” McDonnell told the Guardian. “There’s a challenge to the way the British state is constitutionally organised coming from so many fronts.” Labour feels under pressure to propose ambitious new powers for Scotland to counter demands for a second independence referendum, which are intensifying in the run-up to May’s Holyrood elections. The 234-page report for Corbyn, overseen by the Labour peer Pauline Bryan, called Remaking the British State, proposes: A UK-wide constitutional convention bolstered by citizens’ assemblies to investigate options for reform. A written constitution that would greatly reduce the monarch’s powers. Replacing the Lords with a federal senate of the nations and English regions, able to veto some legislation and ratify international treaties. Giving the Scottish parliament, Welsh Senedd and Northern Irish executive permanent constitutional independence. More borrowing and policymaking powers for Holyrood, including over postgraduate immigration, alcohol taxation, drugs policy and social security. Significant devolution of policymaking and financial powers to English regions and councils, including borrowing. Starmer was due to launch Labour’s constitutional commission in January but that timetable was disrupted by the sudden resignation of Richard Leonard as Scottish Labour leader. His departure triggered a leadership contest that will finish in late February. The commission is expected to be launched soon after the new Scottish leader takes over; it is understood Brown wants it to be driven by citizens’ assemblies across the UK, tasked with tabling specific proposals for reform. In an article for the Guardian, Anas Sarwar, Scottish Labour’s constitution spokesperson and favourite to win the party’s leadership contest, agreed with the authors of the paper that new powers to control drugs misuse and Scotland-specific immigration rules should be considered. Senior Tories, led by Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, are considering an official review of the UK’s governance, driven partly by the surge in support for independence in Scotland and the political crises in northern England exposed by the Covid crisis. For the Tories, much hinges on whether the Scottish National party (SNP) wins a Holyrood majority in May. There are reports one option includes a royal commission on the UK’s post-Brexit structures and the constitution. Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, has already mooted new powers for Holyrood. In Wales, Mark Drakeford, the first minister, endorsed a pamphlet by Welsh Labour members in mid-January calling for federalism “based on the simple but profoundly radical proposition that the UK is a voluntary association of four nations, where sovereignty is dispersed amongst four democratically elected legislatures”. The pressure within Labour to respond to the SNP’s surge in popularity has again led to a split over its stance on a second referendum between the two rivals in the Scottish leadership contest.
Monica Lennon, a leftwinger backed by many Corbyn supporters, has called for Labour to accept Nicola Sturgeon will have a mandate to stage a referendum if the SNP wins a majority in May, but argues Labour should campaign for a third option, of maximum devolution, to be included. In his article for the Guardian, Sarwar rejected that strategy, arguing it was “deeply irresponsible” to consider staging a referendum during a pandemic and an economic crisis. Sarwar reopened a conflict with McDonnell by revealing he would ask Starmer to guarantee Scottish Labour had control over its policies on the constitution if he became Scottish leader, attacking the former shadow chancellor’s decision in August 2019 to “unilaterally” announce Labour was open to a second independence vote. McDonnell told the Guardian he believed that was “the right thing to say at the time”. He backed Lennon’s call for a third option if a referendum were held, saying: “We’ve got to stimulate the debate in a way in which people can really engage and feel that they can contribute, and they’re part of the decision-making process.”"
2021-01-31T12:01:36Z,politics,Politics,"Road freight between Britain and EU is down by a third, data shows","Road freight between Britain and the EU is down by more than a third year on year, data shows. Figures from Transporeon, an EU logistics data platform, suggest that the volume of goods moving between Great Britain and the EU was 38% lower in the third week of 2021 compared with the same week in 2020. The data also shows that hauliers are increasingly refusing to take loads to Britain as increased border controls caused by Brexit and coronavirus checks make those journeys less profitable. The rejection rate for loads destined for Great Britain from France was more than twice the average for the third quarter of 2020.
Transporeon’s CEO, Stephan Sieber, said “rejection rates are on the rise again and higher than normal and, on some lanes, every fifth contract load got rejected” last week. Hauliers are also charging more to take goods from mainland Europe to Great Britain. The spot rate for haulage from France to Britain in the third week of 2021 was 51% higher than the average for Q3 last year.
Sieber said that while his company’s data was focused on hauliers travelling to the UK, “there is evidence that the opposite direction is also facing significant challenges. We observe very high rejection rates from Great Britain to Germany and France. “This supports the anecdotal evidence of unprepared shippers, maxed-out bank guarantees for transit documents, and carriers preferring to go back to the continent empty.” The UK’s Road Haulage Association said “between 40 to 50% of trucks going back to the EU through the Dover short straits crossing are carrying nothing but fresh air – normally that level would be 15 to 18%”. The latest data on sea freight confirmed the picture painted by hauliers. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics show that visits by cargo and tanker ships in the third week of January were also lower than the same time last year, by about 20%."
2021-01-31T12:00:36Z,politics,Politics,Eight days for carrots to get to Belfast with complex Brexit checks,"It is day eight in a depot in Lymm just outside Warrington, Cheshire and a lorry carrying frozen carrots and mixed herbs is still waiting for clearance to board a ferry from Birkenhead to Belfast. Six separate customers, supermarkets and corner stores have other consignments on truck, all stuck in Lymm because the paperwork for a single pallet of carrots is missing key information. Hundreds of miles away in Lisburn in Northern Ireland, the haulage firm’s operations team have had no luck in persuading the British supplier that the carrots that were ordered on 27 December are now, in the third week in January, classed as an export and must be accompanied by a litany of documents and certificates before the trailer can be cleared to board the ferry at Birkenhead.
Another supplier on the lorry had been struggling with the documentation requiring it to supply what is known as an “inco term”, which determines who pays the duty in any tariff but also establishes a specific record as to who is the importer. But that was resolved on day seven. Then there was also the supplier who had provided a commodity code that was two digits short. A simple key stroke mistake could be difference between the lorry getting the red or the green light for entry to NI. “It took half a day yesterday for me to clear the supply chain. I’ve got one more issue to go,” says the visibly stressed operations man simultaneously dealing with a sheaf of about 30 documents for another order of mixed fish stuck in England. “It’s absolutely criminal what has been allowed to happen between these two islands that have traded with each other for so long,” says Peter Summerton, managing director of McCulla Refrigerated Transport, one of Northern Ireland’s biggest frozen and chilled food specialist haulage firms. Half a day at his yard and offices is to lift the lid on the complexities Brexit and checks down the Irish Sea have brought to many businesses in Northern Ireland. Under the Northern Ireland protocol, which was designed to obviate the need for infrastructure on the Irish border, all goods passing from GB to NI are subject to the EU customs code with sanitary and phyto sanitary (SPS) checks applied to 100% of food entering the region. But Summerton says: “The only thing the Northern Ireland protocol (NIP) protects is the single market.” Such is the dizzying array of new data that suppliers need to provide for transport across the Irish Sea that McCulla has devised its own “triage” crib sheet with a team of six new staff taking customers through a check list of 39 data fields to ensure flow of goods across the Irish Sea. Another 14 staff have been taken on to help with customs.
“Remember we are a haulage company,” says Summerton repeatedly as he talks of the regular spanners he has to remove from the haulage works. Out in the yard the issues he faces are plain to see. As drivers fill trailers with a vast array of pallets carrying everything from meatballs to vegan ready meals and halloumi cheese for supermarkets shelves, a Dutch driver rolls in with a delivery of frozen chicken. Martel Ten Dam left the Hook of Holland the day before, drove across England to Holyhead and cleared Dublin port “in five minutes” dropping off in Dundalk, Newry and Belfast before reaching McCulla’s in Lisburn. “He’s allowed in just like that because he has come from the EU to the EU, but we can’t get goods in from GB,” says Summerton. Overnight the company has been forced to turn itself into to “a data cleaning centre” as it cajoles and sometimes rows with customers to convince them of the new data they have to provide for goods going to NI. With a population of just 1.9 million, supplies are always going to be sent in mixed loads, or groupage, meaning entire lorry loads are at risk if one supplier gets one item wrong. Back at the new “customs” office Summerton has set up to deal with the protocol, the operations team have decided if they can’t get the last bit of data for the carrots the only option will be return them to the supplier, freeing the lorry to continue its journey to Belfast.
For McCulla, Brexit has been a double whammy with the Holyhead-Dublin port-Northern Ireland route also now snarled by the red tape facing all GB loads. Summerton has two lorries delayed in Dublin because of the words “drumsticks” and “eggs” appeared in the paperwork. They were given the all clear after it was clarified that the drumsticks were not chicken but Swizzels sweets and the eggs were Cadbury’s Creme Eggs. Last Wednesday Summerton spent the day before in Dublin port to see the procedures for himself with a high street supermarket boss trying to get five lorries containing dairy and other chilled and frozen food released from the port. It took from 11am to 8pm to sort it out. “I cannot be critical of anything in Dublin port. They went out of their way to help” he said, “but each conversation took about 45 minutes and you don’t get that on a helpline.” In a further complication for NI hauliers, those using Dublin port for access to Britain must also supply new paperwork for exporting, reducing the flexibility on ferry options needed for time or weather reasons. “If Ireland and the EU and the UK were serious about Northern Ireland having unfettered access to GB, then we need the same access through Dublin as through Belfast, Larne or Warrenpoint,” he says. One solution could be an “authorised drive-through point somewhere en route to Dublin on the Northern Ireland side where British officials could seal lorries certifying they were on “domestic” journeys via Dublin, he believes. Summerton is campaigning for the complexity of checks to be simplified and new easing measures have been promised by the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, in the coming days. The Cabinet Office said on Sunday night new guidance has now been issued to hauliers. But Summerton has taken some flak locally after he got involved with a briefing for the European Research Group and the shadow cabinet two weeks ago. He defends his right to seek further easements in the application of the protocol. “We are in logistics, not politics,” he says. He argues the government promised to avoid “disruption to lives and livelihoods in Northern Ireland” in its command paper in December yet, along with the EU, imposed import checks designed for the likes of China without even stress testing them. “They have transposed deep water sea container regulations on a just in time supply chain,” he says. “This is how Poland relates to Russia. This is not how Scotland should relate to Northern Ireland.”"
2021-01-31T12:00:36Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit 'teething problems' endemic and could ruin us, say UK businesses","It was billed as a deal that would secure tariff-free access to the EU, that “sunlit uplands” would follow initial disruption to trade. But one month since the Brexit trade deal came into force, businesses are warning that the “teething problems” Boris Johnson described in a visit to Scotland last week are in fact symptomatic of endemic disruption that will force many businesses to restructure and will mean the end of some British businesses altogether. “The last month has been like Dante’s fifth circle of hell” for importers and exporters unable to move supplies because of new red tape, said Ben Fletcher, the policy director of Make UK, which represents manufacturers across the UK. One internationally renowned car manufacturer had “1,000 cars sitting in their car park partially built because they could not get the parts in time,” said Fletcher. “They said this has never happened ever before.” A survey by Make UK of its members shows that 60% of companies that said there were ready for Brexit “now experience disruption” and are “also finding supply chains significantly impacted. “There is real anger and incredible frustration for people who either import or export that they are simply not able to move stuff. It is just incredibly difficult to get the paperwork right and there have been very low levels of support from government,” he added.
He was commenting as the Cabinet Office said the flow of cross-channel freight was much better than anticipated with just “2-3%” trucks turned away for not having the paperwork or Covid tests required, and no expectation now that the worst-case scenario it had modelled of 7,000 trucks queuing in Kent would be realised. But Shane Brennan, the chief executive of Cold Chain Federation, said traffic volumes were still down because of Brexit stockpiling. Warehouses were 85% full, down from 100% before Christmas, but still above the 60% usually seen in January. He urged the government to “stop using the lack of traffic on Kent roads as a metric of the success of Brexit and realise that the real test is ease of trading”. French authorities told government officials that “around 50%” of lorries crossing the channel were empty. One logistics company in Europe reports that some of its customers including one large car firm, was paying for trucks to return to the EU without cargo to ensure they were not delayed at the frontier and would therefore have time for a second or third delivery back to the UK each week. The biggest hit to business is the new rules of origin requirement, which will have a permanent impact on trade. Previously, Brexit goods coming from the EU did not need to be certified as made in Britain or made in the EU to be sold freely within the single market. But since January the provenance of all goods must be documented. A circuit board from Korea in a gadget assembled in Germany, metal from China in a bicycle made in Italy or textile from Morocco in a shirt made in Portugal could mean the difference between no tariff and a tariff that can range from 6.5% duty on plastics to 1.7% on vacuum cleaners, 12% on coats and 14% on bicycles. The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) says the issue has been compounded by a lack of notice and sheer lack of experience of customs officials on both sides of the border. “One port requires every document to be individually stamped. Another wants one stamp on a dozen pages fanned out and is turning people away if they haven’t done it that way,” said Dominic Goudie, its head of international policy. FDF says some fresh food exporters are facing an existential threat. Cross-channel deliveries that used to take “a couple of days are now taking five days”, killing the shelf life of produce such as British sausage, said Goudie. “They may have to sell frozen sausages in future but the question is: will people want to buy frozen sausages?” said Goudie. Make UK says even large businesses that spent two years preparing have been scuppered by rules of origin. They complain their EU suppliers were “unprepared” for Brexit and have not been able to supply an audit trail for all goods. Large exporters had some idea of what they were facing come 1 January, but they did not have the detail until the 1,400-page deal was published on 26 December. One factory in the automotive supply chain told Fletcher it could take it “two months” just to get the rules of origin data from suppliers. “People are starting to realise how hard it will be to build rules of origin into the existing trading rules. These are teething problems, but they are moving towards a structural problem,” added Fletcher. The Federation of Small Businesses boss, Mike Cherry, called on the government to issue “direct funding in the form of transition vouchers to aid operational adjustments”, and raised concerns about courier companies that have stopped taking goods from small suppliers that need health certificates. There are also industry concerns that the scale of the problems have yet to manifest themselves completely because of stockpiling. “Nobody can be ready for a change of this magnitude. There needs to be a dynamic and continuous conversation on easements and simplifications. The trade deal is like the green base of Lego that you put additional bricks on,” said Adam Marshall, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) director general. The Cabinet Office said Michael Gove had met trade representatives on Thursday and vowed to “pull out all the stops” to help business with weekly meetings of a new Brexit taskforce. It claimed that “overall businesses have adapted well to the changes” with the latest data showing less than 5% trucks were being turned away from Dover and other ports because of absence of the correct paperwork or of Covid test results. “We have got to get past Brexit as crisis management. This is our way of trading for the next 50 years. It’s permanent. This is Brexit,” said Brennan. The BCC has called on the UK and EU leaders to resume talks to help businesses on both sides of the channel struggling with the biggest disruption to trade since the single market was formed in 1993. • This article was amended on 1 February 2021. The 1,400-page Brexit trade deal was published on 26 December, not 26 January as stated in an earlier version."
2021-01-31T07:00:31Z,politics,Politics,"A year after Johnsonâ€™s swaggering Greenwich speech, 100,000 dead","It was announced last week, to nobody’s excitement, that Sir Kenneth Branagh will take the role of Boris Johnson in a Sky TV drama about the first weeks of the pandemic. If Branagh’s casting indicates that this is to be conceived as a Shakespearean tragedy, with Johnson in the lead, then it would seem doomed from the start. The classic tragic hero has just a single fatal character flaw that proves his undoing. With Johnson, where do you start? As an opening scene in that drama, it will, anyhow, be hard to beat the speech that the prime minister gave almost exactly a year ago – perhaps the last moment in which he fondly imagined that all the world lay before him. The speech, delivered in the grand surroundings of Christopher Wren’s Old Royal Naval College at Greenwich on 3 February 2020, set out his vision for a buccaneering global Britain, high on union flags and free trade. Johnson had not long returned from his post-election beach frolics in Mustique with Carrie Symonds. Brexit had finally been “done” in Parliament Square three nights earlier. No opposition troubled his horizon. Labour was leaderless; Farage pointless. Even Michael Gove, his limp-daggered Brutus, had been co-opted to the cause.
As he barrelled on to the stage at Greenwich therefore, ruffling his hair, shuffling his notes, his first act was to ask his carefully selected business audience – strictly no Remainer “gloomsters and doomsters” allowed – to raise their eyes to the vaulted ceiling and survey the mural above their heads. Sir James Thornhill’s baroque masterpiece, The Triumph of Liberty and Peace over Tyranny, depicted William III and Mary II enthroned after their own “Glorious Revolution” and surrounded, in Johnson’s eyes, by “well-fed nymphs and cupids and what have you”. This, said Johnson, sledgehammering the symbolism, marked “the settlement of a long and divisive political question about who gets to sit on the throne”. It was a moment of “supreme national self-confidence”, he suggested, with the UK “on the slipway” of global economic dominance. “Today, if we get it right, this can be another such moment.” Hubris works in mysterious ways. That speech will be remembered not, as Johnson hoped, for its rhetoric about unleashed British swagger, but for the fact that in the midst of it, in a throwaway phrase, there lurked the seed of all of his – and our – locked-down nightmares of the past year. In the days leading up to the Greenwich speech, Johnson had been pointedly silent on the virus that had by then escaped from Wuhan. A full month after it had been identified by the Chinese authorities, the Greenwich speech marked the first time the name of the disease officially passed his lips. Inevitably, it was employed not as a cautionary note, but as an irritating niggle to his vision of swash and buckle: “Global growth is itself anaemic and the decline in global poverty is beginning to slow,” Johnson said. “When [trade] barriers are going up, and when there is a risk that new diseases such as coronavirus will trigger a panic and a desire for market segregation that go beyond what is medically rational, to the point of doing real and unnecessary economic damage, then at that moment humanity needs some government, somewhere, that is willing at least to make the case powerfully for freedom of exchange.” There was to be no doubt which government would stand stubbornly oblivious to the risks of the virus, ignore the panic, and keep the market economy open at all costs. Britain, the prime minister cried, was “ready to take off its Clark Kent spectacles, leap into the phone booth and emerge with its cloak flowing as the supercharged champion” of economic freedom in any stand-off with public health restriction.
We have heard from the interchangeable cast of fawning ministers in the past week that “nobody could have worked harder” than Johnson in tackling the pandemic. But when historians – those pesky professional Captain Hindsights – come to lay out the evidence, they will find plenty that disagrees with that fantasy, starting with the Greenwich speech. The second excuse that Johnson’s courtiers have been told to peddle is that no one could have predicted any of what was to come. That is also not exactly true. The week before Johnson’s free-trade speech a report in The Lancet had assessed the lethal potential of the virus, and suggested it was comparable to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, which killed 50 million people. The concern was not confined to the experts. It is notable that on the Saturday before Johnson’s speech, the Daily Mail had devoted its front page not to the triumphalism of the previous night’s Brexit celebrations, for which it had so stridently campaigned, but to the threat to the UK posed by Covid-19: “How many more UK victims of virus?”. Johnson’s own former employer, the Daily Telegraph, counselled on 1 February that Britain must be prepared for the worst. “Pessimists might point out that the mortality for the new virus is considerably higher than for swine flu. When swine flu broke out in 2009, the NHS also had spare capacity, having enjoyed a decade of real-terms investment increases. Today, there is already a shortage of beds…” On the Thursday before Johnson’s set-piece in Greenwich, the World Health Organization had informed every nation that the virus had its highest risk rating – equivalent to that of Ebola and Sars – with 7,818 cases confirmed globally, in 19 countries. In response, on 31 January, even Donald Trump had restricted incoming flights from China. Johnson not only viewed the virus as a line in a Superman gag, but as an opportunity to prove that he was prepared for Britain to go it alone against the po-faced experts, keep the airports open with minimal screening and quarantine, not play by their rules. To prove the point, by the time of the Greenwich speech, he had already skipped the two Cobra meetings devoted to planning for any potential pandemic, leaving them to be chaired by the already hapless Matt Hancock. Over the course of the following weeks, he neglected to attend three more. Ten days after the Greenwich speech, he retreated to his grace-and-favour country retreat at Chevening for a fortnight, partly to finalise the terms of his divorce from Marina Wheeler, not long recovered from cancer, and to let his grown-up children in on the fact that he and Symonds were expecting a baby and had been secretly engaged. His aides were reportedly told to “keep briefing papers short” if they expected them to be read. It was almost March by the time Johnson re-emerged to stage-manage news of the pregnancy for the press.
It was in this context that he sat on breakfast-time sofas and vaguely floated the notion of herd immunity, before dismissing the tempting idea of “taking the virus on the chin”. On 3 March, the clear advice from Sage was that the government should “warn against greetings such as shaking hands and hugging”. Johnson, infamously, went out that day and told reporters: “I was at a hospital the other night where I think there were a few coronavirus patients and I shook hands with everybody, you will be pleased to know, and I continue to shake hands.” Johnson spent late March in isolation, along with most of his cabinet, and early April in intensive care. It has been claimed that those days in hospital changed Johnson from the John Bull-ish character he had presented at Greenwich into a more chastened figure; there is not much in his subsequent rhetoric – of world-beating this and moonshot that, and briefings that he was “battling the experts to save Christmas” – to support that idea. As he has toured the country for photo opportunities in hard hats and lab coats, it is hard to shake the belief that he still sees leadership as he saw it when he stared up at Thornhill’s ceiling – as a kind of costume drama in which he gets to star, a prep-school performance of 1066 and all that. He might have been advised to pay closer attention to the “well-fed nymphs” that he waved a hand at in Greenwich. They were not, as he seemed to envision them, decorative elements of classical totty, but depictions of the four virtues that enabled good governance: prudence, justice, temperance and fortitude. As the death toll last week passed the 100,000 predicted a year ago, we were invited by the government’s favoured newspapers to see Johnson as a “deeply sorry” head-bowed figure, in screen grabs of him reading from his notes. But whatever those headlines or Kenneth Branagh’s forthcoming depiction imagine, we should always keep in mind that this is not the prime minister’s tragedy, it’s the tragedy of the families of the 105,000 who have died, of the key workers who have risked their lives day after day, the millions who have seen jobs and plans and businesses capsized. We have all been cast as walk-ons in a drama which, from the very beginning, was partly, but fundamentally, of Johnson’s making – and one which will only properly end when he and his hammy troupe of chancers finally exit, stage right, no doubt still loudly pronouncing that nobody could have done more to keep us safe. Seven lessons learned Randomised trials are lifesavers Dexamethasone is a cheap steroid drug that has saved the lives of 650,000 severely ill Covid patients. Its effectiveness was revealed through the UK Recovery study, which compared treatments with usual NHS care alone in randomised trials. “Clinicians come up with all sorts of hypotheses about drugs,” says Martin Landray, joint founder of Recovery. “But you’ve got to test these hypotheses. For that you need large, randomised trials.” New diseases are a constant threat Covid-19 has again demonstrated that wild-animal trading, where species are mixed together in appalling, stressful circumstances, promotes disease transmission between species – and on to humans. “Unless we control long-distance trading in live animals, new diseases will appear again and again. That is a key lesson from this pandemic,” says James Wood, professor of veterinary medicine at Cambridge University. Genomic surveys are crucial Britain has played a key role in tracking the progress of Covid-19 across the globe, thanks to its prowess in gene-sequencing. “UK laboratories have carried out 48% of all the world’s genome sequencing of Covid-19,” says Professor Sir Mark Caulfield, of Genomics England. “That has been invaluable in pinpointing new strains and underlines the need for a global genomics network to track and beat this disease. That would be a lifeline.” People will accept inconvenience “Stay at home and protect the NHS” was a strong government message that the public accepted. Shops closed, car travel dropped by two thirds, while people provided food for the hungry and clapped for carers. “That trust was undermined by Dominic Cummings’s trip to Durham,” says psychologist Professor Dame Til Wykes, of King’s College London. “Yet most people still followed the rules because they knew they were for a good cause.” A fast response is critical A year ago the WHO warned the new disease represented a public health emergency. Australia, above, was one of the few countries to react quickly. “Crucially, those with past experience of coronaviruses like Sars did react and now look to be in a stronger position,” says Martin Hibberd of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “Discovering a new virus’s characteristics and having a clear strategy will be crucial in avoiding another pandemic.” The NHS must be properly funded Years of cuts to public health services left Britain ill-prepared for Covid-19 and were critical in allowing death rates to soar. “As the UK emerges from the pandemic it would be a tragic mistake to attempt to re-establish a status quo that was marked in England by a stagnation of health improvement that was the second-worst in Europe,” states a review led by Sir Michael Marmot of University College London. mRNA technology is here to stay Messenger RNA is used by our cells to direct protein manufacture. By learning how to hijack that process, Pfizer and Moderna made vaccines in record time. “We had been hearing about mRNA’s promise for years and suddenly it arrived,” says Professor Adam Finn of Bristol University. “This could be a game changer not just for vaccines but cancer care.” Robin McKie"
2021-01-31T06:00:29Z,politics,Politics,Success of vaccine rollout pushes Tories ahead of Labour in the polls,"The Conservatives have regained the lead against Labour in the latest Opinium poll for the Observer after a week in which the total number of deaths from Covid-19 passed 100,000. The figures – showing the Tories on 41%, up four percentage points compared with two weeks ago, and Labour down three points on 38% – are a blow to Labour and will raise questions about whether the party’s progress has stalled under Keir Starmer. With the country in its third lockdown and the death toll passing such a grim milestone, Labour MPs and activists would have hoped to be surging ahead of Boris Johnson and the Conservatives. Instead it appears that Labour has hit a wall, and that Boris Johnson and the Conservatives may be beginning to gain a “vaccine dividend” as the inoculation programme gathers pace and hopes rise of an end to the period of restrictions.
In a further boost to Tory morale, Johnson has narrowly returned to the lead when voters are asked who would be the best prime minister. Some 33% now select Johnson (up three points) while 29% think Keir Starmer would make the best PM (down three). In the poll the Liberal Democrats are on 7%, the SNP 5% and Plaid Cymru on 4%. In the initial stages of the pandemic in early spring last year Johnson and the Tories pulled way ahead of Labour as the country rallied behind the government in a time of crisis. But after the Tory lead over Labour peaked at 26 points in late March, Labour gradually clawed its way back after Starmer replaced Jeremy Corbyn as leader last April and Johnson and his ministers appeared to blunder in the fight to control Covid-19. By August the two main parties were neck and neck. Since then the lead has changed regularly between the two parties. While voters are still critical of the government’s overall response to the pandemic – 68% say Johnson and his ministers should have done more to stop the spread of coronavirus – the public’s view of how they have handled the vaccine rollout is far more favourable. Net approval of the government’s vaccine programme has shot up in the past fortnight: 60% now approve of its vaccine handling (up from 47% a fortnight ago), while only 15% disapprove (compared with 23% in our last poll). This raises the government’s net approval rating on the vaccine up from +24% to +45% in two weeks. Some 82% of those polled said they would take the vaccine if they were offered one, while 12% would not. Just over half (54%) backed including teachers on a list of priority occupations for the vaccine. The poll was conducted mostly before news of the row with the European Union over the supply of vaccines broke."
2021-01-30T15:20:51Z,politics,Politics,UK firms plan to shift across Channel after Brexit chaos,"Hundreds of UK companies could switch operations to countries inside the EU in what is threatening to become a dramatic exodus of investment and jobs caused by Brexit. The Observer can reveal that by 1 January this year some 500 businesses – mostly UK-owned, or UK-based with overseas owners – were already making inquiries about setting up branches, depots or warehouses in the Netherlands alone, for “Brexit-related reasons”. Since then the number of inquiries from UK companies has increased further. If companies switch all or parts of their operations to Europe it will mean the loss of jobs, economic activity and tax revenue at home. The figures have been compiled by government unit the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency, which said that while most of the firms were already based in the UK, a minority were new companies from the US and Asia which had investigated a UK move, but had decided against investing here because of Brexit. Lyne Biewinga, of the Netherlands British Chamber of Commerce, said she and her team had been working “night and day” on inquiries from UK companies in recent weeks. Meanwhile, in an interview with this newspaper, Austria’s economic affairs minister, Margarete Schramböck, said inquiries from UK companies about moving to her country – which had been high for several years – had increased threefold since 1 January. In 2019 and 2020, 50 UK-owned or UK-based firms established operations in Austria, according to the Austrian Business Agency. Twenty more had made inquiries in the last few weeks, when the UK left the single market and customs union for good. “We have a lot of companies approaching us to come to Austria. From the UK it is three times higher than before,” said Schramböck. “It is all different kind of companies. It is IT companies, companies interested in R&D who are searching for a location in the EU. We have a special programme to help them and that is good for us. It had already started prior to Brexit but it has increased since Brexit, especially for small- and medium-sized companies. “It is because they are not part of the European Union any more and they [now] have barriers. Even if there is a trade agreement they fear that the barriers will hinder them to do business inside the European Union. “It is always good to be close to your customer and in this case the European market is a single market, so if you want to sell to the European market you have to have an imprint there.”
The British Chamber of Commerce’s branch in Brussels said there had also been a number of inquiries from UK firms about setting up in Belgium. A leading UK manufacturer of cheddar cheese, Simon Spurrell, has announced he will be switching £1m of investment to France. Last week the Observer revealed that the Department for International Trade was advising UK businesses worried about the new burden of regulations, customs checks and added costs of transporting goods to the EU, to set up warehouses, depots or entire new operations there. Two managing directors of UK firms told the Observer they were setting up new European companies and would have to sack staff in this country and employ new staff in the EU. By moving back inside the single market, companies with large numbers of customers in the EU can transport goods in bulk, avoiding the charges on individual items that have afflicted couriers this year. They can also avoid the problem of VAT charges hitting their customers. While ministers have tried to dismiss business concerns about the new barriers to trade caused by the UK exit from the single market and customs union, the loss of jobs, investment and tax revenue is fast turning into a full-blown crisis. On Friday the leaders of Britain’s five largest business groups warned the government that firms faced “substantial difficulties” at UK ports since Brexit, with the prospect of a “significant loss of business” if the situation was allowed to continue. Biewinga added: “The number of companies searching for a base in the Netherlands has surged in recent months. We help a lot of companies to set up a separate business in the Netherlands to circumvent border issues and to get around extra charges, paperwork and additional taxes resulting from Brexit. From the Netherlands they can distribute their goods far more freely. “There are many reasons that businesses may choose to go to the Netherlands. The two countries share a 400-year-long trading relationship, are friends, political allies and North Sea neighbours. We are also geographically very close as well as fast digital connections and a good logistical infrastructure with Europe’s largest port, Rotterdam, as well as Schiphol airport in Amsterdam.” The Netherlands – like Austria – is offering a range of financial incentives to UK firms and expat workers. On Friday, in a letter to Conservative party supporters, international trade secretary Liz Truss said Brexit was going well and was a great opportunity to build global Britain. “We have taken back control of our trade to deliver jobs and prosperity across the UK,” she said. “Already seizing vast opportunities across the world with trade deals worth £885bn with 63 countries and the EU already agreed. “Having left the EU our ambitious trade strategy is at the heart of our vision for global Britain and in 2021 we are more than ready to seize our potential on the world stage.” The government said: “We are helping business seize the opportunities open to a fully independent global trading United Kingdom. Businesses across the country have adapted well to the changes to trading with the EU, and trade continues to flow smoothly, with no disruption at UK ports. “We are working closely with industry to get businesses tailored support to tackle any outstanding issues. We have set up export helplines, invested millions in the customs intermediaries market and developed the Brexit checker tool so businesses know exactly what they need to do.”"
2021-01-30T05:00:02Z,politics,Politics,"'Half-pregnant is not a concept': UK should decide who its allies are, says Macron","Emmanuel Macron has warned that Boris Johnson’s government has to decide who its allies are, insisting that “half-pregnant is not a concept”. “What politics does Great Britain wish to choose? It cannot be the best ally of the US, the best ally of the EU and the new Singapore … It has to choose a model,” the French president said, in an interview with the Guardian and a small group of other media. “But I have the impression the country’s leaders have sold all these models [to the people]. If it decides on a completely transatlantic policy then we [the EU] will need clarification, because there will be divergence on rules and access to markets.
“If it decides to be the new Singapore, which it has once suggested … well, I don’t know. It’s not for me to decide, but I would like good, peaceful relations. Our destinies are linked, our intellectual approach is linked, our researchers and industrials work together … I believe in a sovereign continent and nation states; I don’t believe in neo-nationalism. “I am for common ambition and a common destiny. I hope Boris Johnson is also on that path, because I think the British people are. We remain allies. History and geography don’t change, so I don’t think the British people have a different destiny to ours.” Asked about the cross-Channel blame game over not just vaccines, but Brexit and coronavirus controls, in which he is often personally named, Macron laughed off the personal attacks: “Whenever there’s a problem with the EU, the British just love to detest the French – and me – and say we are responsible. “I have accepted this role. Sometimes when there are tensions, I ask ‘Why me?’ – perhaps making me out to be more important than I am!” On a more serious note, he added: “I like your country a lot, but as I have already said, I think Brexit is an error. I respect the sovereignty of the people and the people voted, so it had to be done, but I think that vote was based on a lot of lies and now we see it has made things much more difficult in many ways.” Sitting in the ornate Salle des Fêtes at the Élysée Palace, under vast crystal chandeliers, Macron seemed preoccupied during the 90-minute meeting with a dozen journalists from US, Arab, European and UK media. An earlier rendezvous with the president before Christmas had been called off at the last minute after he was diagnosed with Covid-19. Élysée staff said the president and his wife, Brigitte, who also caught the coronavirus, were “fully recovered”. Macron spoke rapidly and without notes on a range of issues from French military intervention in the Sahel to conspiracy theories, France’s controversial law against religious separatism, and how France comes to terms with its colonial past. One possible reason for being distracted was that Macron is expected to make an announcement this weekend about further coronavirus restrictions in France, which is already under a 12-hour nightly curfew. He was asked if he would be announcing a third national lockdown to stop the spread of new highly contagious variants, as predicted. It was the only question he refused to answer. Macron said Europe will not block or ban exports of coronavirus vaccines but that they should be “controlled”, accusing AstraZeneca of a lack of transparency after the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company said it could not fulfil the whole of its contract with the EU. He also said the AstraZeneca vaccine, given approval by the EU regulator on Friday for use on all adults, appeared to be “quasi-ineffective” on people older than 65, though he acknowledged he had no figures or official information. The European Medicines Agency authorised the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine for use in all adult age groups on Friday, after German authorities had earlier recommended that its use be limited to people under 65 due to a lack of a data about efficacy in older groups. The vaccine’s developers and regulators in the UK have strongly defended its efficacy in all groups. • This article was amended on 30 January 2021. In the text and headline, an earlier version mistakenly attributed the phrase “half-friends is not a concept” to Emmanuel Macron, when he actually said “half-pregnant is not a concept”."

2021-01-29T14:06:39Z,politics,Politics,Brexit negotiator David Frost pulled away from national security role,"David Frost, who negotiated the Brexit deal on behalf of Boris Johnson, will no longer be given the plum role of national security adviser, the government has announced. Lord Frost’s appointment provoked a backlash from Conservatives including the former prime minister Theresa May because of his lack of relevant expertise. Johnson handpicked Frost to run the Brexit negotiations, replacing the career civil servant Ollie Robbins, who was regarded with suspicion by the Vote Leave veterans in Downing Street. Frost’s pugnacious style and flat rejection of anything more than a bare-bones Canada-style trade deal is regarded as crucial in shaping the eventual agreement. The prime minister gave him a peerage last year. Frost will now take on the role of Brexit and international policy representative – a job that appears to have been created for him. One Whitehall source said Frost’s new post was “the role he wants”. Johnson’s spokesperson rejected the idea that the move meant the prime minister did not trust Frost to be national security adviser, saying that Johnson had been “further considering the responsibilities” of officials following the trade deal with the EU. Labour said the switch in Frost’s role indicated “chaos and confusion” in Number 10. In his new role Frost will continue to work on foreign policy issues, the spokesperson said. He will not, however, have his role directly scrutinised by parliament. Frost is in the unusual position of being both a peer and a government special adviser, and will answer directly to Johnson. He is on leave of absence from the Lords. The prime minister said: “I am hugely grateful to Lord Frost for his herculean efforts in securing a deal with the EU, and I am thrilled that he has agreed to be my representative for Brexit and international policy as we seize the opportunities from our departure from the EU.”
Frost said: “I am delighted to take up this new role as the prime minister’s representative on Brexit and international policy. With a new agreement with the EU in place, we have huge opportunities to boost our wealth and define what we stand for as a country internationally, and I very much look forward to supporting the prime minister on this.” The key post of national security adviser will now be filled by Sir Stephen Lovegrove, the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Defence. Lovegrove has a background in the private sector but has also held a series of public sector roles, including chief executive of the Shareholder Executive, the body that managed taxpayers’ holdings in businesses. He was also a board member of the organising committee of the 2012 London Olympics, held when Johnson was mayor of London. Lovegrove is seen by civil service colleagues as a safe pair of hands who helped steer the Ministry of Defence through several crises over the past five years. Former colleagues said he had a strong grasp of the finances and a reliable political antenna, cancelling a personal trip to New York as it became increasingly clear that Gavin Williamson was likely to be sacked by Theresa May as defence secretary following a row about a leak from the national security council. His appointment restores the job to a civil servant – Frost was a political appointee – meaning it will be possible again for the national security director to act as the accounts officer for the £3.2bn intelligence agency budgets, a role that can only be handled by an official. As the MoD’s top official he will have “had oversight of several aspects of the secret state”, according to another former colleague, including the Trident nuclear deterrent, special forces and military intelligence. Downing St said Lovegrove was appointed without a competition. “It wasn’t required. The PM and cabinet secretary identified him as having the right skill set and experience,” a No10 source said. The national security adviser post was previously filled by Sir Mark Sedwill, who was simultaneously the cabinet secretary. When Sedwill took on the double role for May, it raised questions about whether the national security post was being taken seriously enough. May said last year when it was announced Frost would be appointed as national security adviser: “Why is the new national security adviser a political appointee with no proven expertise in national security?”"
2021-01-28T19:47:13Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson's Scotland trip proves essential to nobody | John Crace,"Nicola Sturgeon couldn’t have been more clear. If the lockdown rules prevented all but essential travel – she had banned herself from visiting a vaccination centre in Aberdeen – then it was completely out of order for the prime minister to make a day trip to Scotland to drop in on a testing laboratory in Glasgow and a vaccine production facility in Livingston. Except that secretly the Scottish first minister must have been delighted that Boris Johnson had found time in his diary to dress up in a lab coat, get in the way of a cluster of technicians as he emptied some boxes, and bump elbows with various members of the army. Not so much Captain Hindsight as General Chaos. Because every time Boris comes to Scotland, the poll ratings of the Scottish National party – or the Scottish Nationalist party, as Johnson insists on calling it – go up a few points. The last 20 opinion polls have shown a majority of Scots in favour of independence. As with Johnson’s previous trip to Scotland, this one had all been done on a need-to-know basis. There had been no itinerary released prior to his arrival, because the last thing that Boris wanted was a whole load of protesters turning up to line the route. The prime minister’s unusual mission was to go to Scotland to avoid meeting as many Scots as possible. If possible, he would go to three locations that had been pre-sanitised to make sure no one gave him a hard time, and get back to London relatively unscathed as soon as possible. And that’s more or less what he achieved. Johnson popped up for a series of pointless photo opportunities and his only moment of slight jeopardy was when he was forced to do the obligatory short interview for the TV news channels. Boris didn’t get off to the best of starts by talking about all the ways the rest of Great Britain had gone out of their way to help the Scots. But then he presumably saw one of his minders doing a throat-cutting gesture and was reminded that the reason he had come to Scotland was to highlight the mutual benefits of the union. So he then came up with something rather more placatory about how wonderful the Scots were. It didn’t sound completely convincing, but then Boris seldom does. Diplomacy and sincerity are not two of his strongest suits. Inevitably, the interview then moved on to Scottish demands for a second independence referendum. “People don’t want another referendum,” he declared, despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary. They were fed up with “pointless constitutional wrangling”. This from a man who had brought the UK to its knees with endless constitutional wrangling over Brexit and had taken Scotland out of the EU against the wishes of most of its inhabitants. Still, that was nothing compared with the hypocrisy of his insistence that he “believed in the power of doing things together”. At times like this you wonder whether Johnson takes everyone for fools, simply has no conscience, or no memory. Or all three. Boris has only ever believed in doing what was good for Boris. Collaboration is a one-way street for any narcissist. Johnson just had time to dodge questions on Desmond Swayne’s lockdown scepticism and “the teething problems” of his sellout of the Scottish fishing fleet before wrapping things up with a near incoherent summary of his day. I quote verbatim: “If [the vaccine is] approved by the MHRA then we will have 60m doses of it by the end of this year for the whole of the British people. And so it’s a success for Scotland. Uh, it’s a success for, uh, Britain and, uh, it’s a success for Britain because it is a success for Scotland. It’s a success for Scotland because it’s a success for Britain. “So, uh, I’m, uh, you know, it was very, very encouraging to see it. That’s, that’s … I may have done some other things as well while I have been here although I can’t immediately recollect what they are. It’s been an action-packed day and always a joy to see you.” This was the UK’s very own Cicero talking. Sturgeon must be counting down the days until Johnson makes his next essential visit to Scotland. Much more of this and indyref 2 will be in the bag."
2021-01-28T18:39:52Z,politics,Politics,UAE added to UKâ€™s growing travel ban list in blow to influencers,"British people including social media influencers flying home from Dubai could face a mandatory 10-day quarantine stay in a hotel, as the United Arab Emirates is being added to the UK’s growing travel ban list. The UAE, Burundi and Rwanda will join the 30 locations already on the so-called “red list” from 1pm on Friday, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, announced, in order to prevent the spread of the Covid variant that first emerged in South Africa. Under measures unveiled on Wednesday, those who are still able to return from countries on the travel ban list – British and Irish nationals, as well as those with UK residency rights – will be required to quarantine in hotels for 10 days on their arrival, without exception. But the hotel quarantine policy has not yet been implemented, with the government due to set out further details next week. It potentially leaves the door open for those who can return from banned countries beforehand to avoid the requirement – although they would still have to self-isolate at home for 10 days with their household. The home secretary, Priti Patel, used a statement detailing the hotel quarantine measures to the Commons on Wednesday to criticise influencers who have been posting pictures from overseas. “We see plenty of influencers on social media showing off about which parts of the world they are in, mainly in sunny parts of the world. Going on holiday is not an exemption and it is important that people stay at home,” she said. Some influencers in Dubai who have drawn scrutiny in recent weeks have tried to indicate that their overseas travel has been a necessary part of their work, including to appear in videos and paid-for endorsements. Under current UK Covid-19 restrictions, people must stay home and not leave to travel unless they have a legally permitted reason to do so, such as work. On Wednesday the government also announced that a new requirement would be introduced for people who wish to travel abroad to make a declaration stating why they need to do so, with the reason checked by carriers before departure. Police presence will be increased at ports and airports, and people will be fined if they are in breach of the stay-at-home regulations. Patel told the Commons: “Anyone who does not have a valid reason for travel will be directed to return home or they will face a fine.” On Thursday the prime minister’s official spokesperson echoed Patel’s stance on influencers. “She said yesterday that we see plenty of influencers on social media showing off where they are in the world – mainly sunny places,” he said. “Going on holiday is not an exemption and it is important that people stay home. We’ve been clear that people shouldn’t be leaving the UK for the purpose of holidays. We are asking people to stay home and only travel for absolutely essential reasons.” The curbs announced on Wednesday are on top of existing restrictions, which mean international arrivals, including those from countries not on the banned list, have to self-isolate for 10 days when they reach the UK and provide proof of a negative coronavirus test taken up to 72 hours before departure, although there are some exemptions for certain work-related trips. In England under the Test to Release scheme, those who have returned from countries not on the travel ban list can leave self-isolation earlier if they pay for a Covid test five full days after their arrival that returns a negative result. The UK travel ban list mainly covers countries in South America and southern Africa as well as Portugal and Cape Verde. The Department for Transport said that from 4am on Friday all arrivals from the UAE, Burundi and Rwanda would not be eligible for the Test to Release scheme and would have to self-isolate immediately with their households. There will also be a ban on direct passenger flights from UAE from 1pm on Friday. The DfT said: “British nationals currently in the UAE should make use of the commercial options available if they wish to return to the UK. Indirect commercial routes that will enable British and Irish nationals and residents to return to the UK continue to operate.”"

2021-01-28T16:19:19Z,politics,Politics,Man sentenced to community service for spitting at Jeremy Corbyn,"A man who spat in Jeremy Corbyn’s face while the former Labour leader was out cycling with his wife at the height of the first coronavirus lockdown has been sentenced to 80 hours of community service. Gerald Dore admitted assault by beating for spitting at Corbyn, and a public order offence for threatening Corbyn’s wife, Laura Alvarez. But he said the attack was not politically motivated. “I don’t know him,” Dore, 56, told Westminster magistrates court. “I didn’t dislike him, he was just in my way and I was trying to get home.” Corbyn was out cycling with Alvarez on the morning of 20 May last year when he was assaulted, the court heard. Matt Barrowcliffe, prosecuting, said the couple had stopped at the corner of Seven Sisters Road, north London, where Dore was waiting. The Islington North MP gestured at Dore to cross, but received a stream of obscenities in response. When Corbyn told him “there was no need for that sort of language”, Dore repeated the abuse. “He began shouting and swearing aggressively towards both parties before ultimately taking a step towards Mr Corbyn and spitting,” Barrowcliffe said. Dore also verbally abused Alvarez, and threatened her physically. In a statement read by Barrowcliffe, Corbyn said: “I was alarmed and distressed by the aggressive behaviour towards me, in particular spitting in my face.” Barrowcliffe said the assault was aggravated by Corbyn’s vulnerability as a person in the public eye. Dore, a former plumber, represented himself in court. He said he had chronic pain and mental health issues, and the court was told he had a lower culpability. “All I was trying to do was cross the road and he was in the way,” said Dore, who has previous convictions for assault. “I might have sprayed him,” he later added. The district judge Adrian Turner accepted that the assault was a chance encounter. He said: “To spit at someone is gross in any circumstance, but to do so at a time when the infections were running very high was very serious indeed.” Turner gave Dore an 18-month community order, which will include 80 hours of unpaid work, and ordered him to pay £250 in compensation – £150 to Corbyn and £100 to Alvarez. “This is going to hurt,” the judge said. Rob Hutchinson, a CPS prosecutor, said: “This successful prosecution should put no one in any doubt that we will take firm action against those who abuse others in this way and – in this case – our elected officials and their families, who should be able to go about their personal business without being put in fear.”"
2021-01-28T16:13:01Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson: stop endless talk about new Scottish referendum,"Boris Johnson has urged Scottish nationalists to stop “talking endlessly” about another independence referendum and concentrate instead on recovering from the Covid pandemic. Speaking during a tour of Covid vaccination projects in Scotland, the prime minister said Nicola Sturgeon had promised that the 2014 referendum had been a “once-in-a-generation event” and she should be held to that. He said the first minister’s quest for a second independence referendum after May’s Scottish elections was a “diversionary tactic” to distract attention from the SNP’s poor record on domestic policies. “It is also a fact that the SNP government hasn’t been notably successful on delivering good results on education or tackling drugs,” he said. “I don’t think that the right thing to do is to talk endlessly about another referendum when I think what the people of the country and the people of Scotland want in particular is to fight this pandemic. I don’t see the advantage of getting lost in pointless constitutional wrangling when after all we had a referendum not so very long ago.”
Johnson, facing intense pressure amid growing support for Scottish independence and the Scottish National party, said the UK government-funded programmes he visited on Thursday were proof the UK was an effective and successful partnership. Those included a Lighthouse laboratory processing Covid samples in Glasgow, a new mass vaccination centre set up by the Royal Scottish Dragoon Guards in Castlemilk in the city, and the Valneva vaccines factory in Livingston, which has been contracted by the UK government to supply up to 100m doses later this year. “This is a huge national effort as a result of investment by the UK government,” he said. “I believe very, very strongly we’re better off with the current arrangements. “I think people can be very, very proud of the achievements of Scottish science, of Scottish business and of Scotland, because they’re achieving astonishing things at the moment but I think they can also be proud of what Britain is achieving.” Johnson’s visit to Scotland was criticised on Wednesday by Sturgeon, who questioned whether it was justified and met the strict criteria for essential travel during the UK-wide lockdown.
She said: “We have a duty to lead by example, and if we are going to suggest that we don’t take these rules as seriously as we should it gets harder to convince other people.” Stuart McDonald, the SNP MP whose constituency includes the community centre in Castlemilk where Johnson visited British troops, said the prime minister should have stayed at home. “The prime minister’s visit to Castlemilk – a community his party has hit hard – was wrong. It’s right to thank the armed forces who have helped in the fight against Covid, but the best way to do it is to pay them properly, improve their conditions & better support their families,” McDonald tweeted. Keith Brown MSP, the Scottish National party’s deputy leader, said: “Clearly, Boris Johnson is rattled. By branding this campaign trip as ‘essential’, this is clearly a prime minister in panic, who knows the Tories are losing the argument on independence.” However, Keir Starmer, the UK Labour leader, told LBC it was “perfectly legitimate” for the prime minister to tour vaccination sites and check the strategy was working. Police Scotland also rejected complaints that Johnson had broken the Covid lockdown rules. The force said it was “a working visit in his official capacity as prime minister”. “He is the prime minister of the United Kingdom,” Starmer said. “It is important that he travels to see what’s going on, on the ground. I understand he is going to see a vaccine centre, going to talk to the NHS. I would expect the prime minister to do that, frankly.” With the Scottish National party on course for a majority in May’s Holyrood elections, the polls suggest voters have welcomed Sturgeon’s confident leadership during the pandemic and have deep-seated doubts about Johnson’s competence. Her personal ratings have soared while Johnson’s have continued to remain rock-bottom, and Sturgeon’s demands for a second independence referendum will be central to the SNP’s election campaign. While support for the Scottish Tories rose in the polls during Theresa May’s leadership to 27%, it has fallen since Johnson took over, to as low as 19%."
2021-01-28T15:55:36Z,politics,Politics,Sturgeon trans rights support prompts calls for reform,"Nicola Sturgeon has been challenged to include meaningful reform of gender recognition legislation in her party’s spring manifesto, after she made her strongest statement yet in support of transgender rights. Scotland’s first minister posted what she described as an unplanned and unscripted statement on Twitter late on Wednesday evening in response to reports of significant numbers of mainly younger people leaving the SNP because of the leadership’s perceived failure to tackle transphobia. Sturgeon said: “It grieves me deeply that you have reached this conclusion because you consider at this stage the SNP not to be a safe, tolerant or welcoming place for trans people. That is not acceptable to me.” Insisting that transphobia should be treated with the same “zero tolerance” that applies to racism or homophobia, Sturgeon added: “Yes we have differences of opinion on gender recognition reform, we should debate them openly and respectfully but no debate can be a cover for transphobia.” An increasingly toxic online environment has caused some younger people to question their commitment to the SNP in recent weeks, the Guardian understands. But after the posts, women’s groups that were formed to challenge transgender rights reform accused Sturgeon of failing to criticise online abuse of their own membership. A number of prominent LGBT activists told the Guardian there had been fears that the party’s commitment to gender recognition reform would be watered down in its manifesto for May’s Holyrood elections, but Sturgeon’s video message had given them some cause for optimism. Out for Independence, the official LGBT+ wing of the SNP, four of whose executive committee have resigned in protest over the past week, said the most important action to follow must be an overhaul of internal disciplinary procedures, which “have not been used to protect people where they should have been”. The Scottish Trans Alliance said: “We hope that [Sturgeon’s] words will be followed up by the meaningful actions she says she is determined they will be.” It called for those actions to include improving delivery of trans healthcare, with a priority of reducing waiting times, hate crime protection and reform of the Gender Recognition Act. Plans to allow people to officially change gender without a medical diagnosis by reforming the GRA were paused in Scotland at the beginning of the pandemic, and similar plans were dropped by the UK government last September. The Scottish proposals had attracted criticism from some feminist groups as well as from senior SNP politicians, including the finance secretary, Kate Forbes, and the MP Joanna Cherry, who has repeatedly challenged the party leadership over gender rights. Cherry won a coveted seat on the SNP’s national executive committee at the party’s conference last November. At the time, the Guardian reported on how a cohort of activists, councillors and MPs similarly critical of transgender rights policy were elected to the national executive to the shock of the SNP’s leadership. A number of prominent Sturgeon supporters believe some rebels are using the row over transgender rights to undermine her authority. While GRA reform has been paused, the row has since spilled over into other policy areas, including the reform of hate crime legislation. The Women’s Pledge Group, which was launched at the SNP’s October 2019 conference by MPs, MSPs and councillors with concerns about gender recognition reform, said they condemned abuse of all party members but added that “women have serious and valid concerns around their rights to privacy, dignity, safety and fairness”. The group said women raising such concerns had been labelled transphobic and hateful, highlighting the online abuse of Cherry, who is one of its founders. “Like the first minister, we believe debate should always be respectful, however some individuals oppose any sort of debate on these issues.”"
2021-01-28T12:53:04Z,politics,Politics,A rocky route to a Scottish independence referendum,"When the Scottish National party published its roadmap for a second independence referendum on Sunday, it confirmed what many anticipate will be a central plank of its manifesto for May’s Holyrood elections. If the party wins a majority, as polling indicates it will, and if Westminster ignores that electoral mandate and continues to refuse the necessary transfer of powers, Holyrood will legislate to hold a referendum regardless. There are three possible routes to another referendum on Scottish independence. As happened with the 2014 vote, a process previously described as the “gold standard” by Nicola Sturgeon, the UK government could grant a section 30 order under the Scotland Act, 1998, granting Holyrood the competence to legislate for it. The act, which set up the Scottish parliament, states that Holyrood can’t normally legislate on reserved matters, such as the union. But UK prime ministers, most recently Boris Johnson, have repeatedly refused this request. Another, highly unlikely, route would be a Catalan-style wild-cat vote, which Sturgeon herself has said she could not sanction and would likely result in a boycott by unionist parties with significant damage to Scotland’s international credibility at a moment when it would also be seeking to rejoin the EU. Thirdly, as the SNP proposed at the weekend, it could introduce a referendum bill to the Scottish parliament without a section 30 order, prompting an almost inevitable legal challenge to settle whether holding a referendum on the union counts as a reserved matter and is thus beyond Holyrood’s competence, likely to end up in the supreme court. This is the “Plan B” pushed by independence activists increasingly frustrated at Sturgeon’s more cautious approach. One of the first tests in this scenario is for the member in charge of the bill, who has to state in terms that the bill is within competence on introduction, putting the lord advocate, Scotland’s most senior law officer, under significant pressure to intervene. The Scottish parliament’s newly elected presiding officer would have to confirm in writing whether a bill was legally competent. A government is not obliged to withdraw or change legislation that the presiding officer declares incompetent – as happened once before with the continuity bill aimed at upholding EU laws in Scotland after Brexit, which also went to the supreme court. But a ruling of that type would be likely to bolster a legal challenge. Once a bill is passed by Holyrood, the Scottish and UK governments’ law officers have 28 days to state whether they accept or challenge it. That may put the lord advocate under more pressure. If they challenge its legality, it automatically goes to the UK supreme court for a ruling – a process invoked with the continuity bill, which was ruled unlawful on technical grounds. The job of the supreme court, then, is to test the scope of the reservation in the Scotland Act, explains Kenneth Armstrong, professor of European law at the University of Cambridge. “Is the Scottish parliament competent to legislate for a referendum on independence even while the union remains reserved? The structure of devolution is such that everything is devolved unless it is reserved so it follows that the court ought to interpret reservations narrowly, ” he said. While Armstrong’s instinct is that the prospects of success for the Scottish government at the supreme court are low, he adds the caveat that the breadth of reservations in the Scotland Act allow greater freedom of interpretation. A case currently at the court of session tests this precise proposition. The crowd-funded action brought by independence activist Martin Keating is seeking a declaration that the Scottish parliament does have the power to hold a legal referendum on independence. Aileen McHarg, professor of public law and human rights at the University of Durham, has been following the case with some interest, but believes there is a strong chance that the court will simply accept the procedural arguments that the action is premature and not relevant. She notes that, from an SNP perspective, the timing of this case is unhelpful. “Assuming the SNP win a majority in May they will be in a much stronger position,” she said. “But a mandate alone, though politically important, isn’t legally relevant. If a court decides that the Scottish government does have power to hold a referendum it will obviously create significant political momentum. But they would still need the UK government consent ultimately to leave the union.” She makes the crucial distinction between a legal referendum and a legally binding one. “The 2014 referendum was advisory only, as was the Brexit vote, but it was legally valid because of the section 30 order.” McHarg also highlights the gamble the SNP would be taking by pursuing their case in court: if they lost, holding a referendum would then be “a non-starter”. “You can’t force local authorities to cooperate, there would be no proper control of spending or the campaign, and a potential boycott by voters.” Indeed, pursuit of a referendum through the courts marks a significant shift for Sturgeon herself. In January 2020 she warned that such a legal challenge “might actually set us back”, and she continues to insist on the need to have a process that is “legal and legitimate”. Here lies the risk in seeking legal answers to a political question, says Prof Michael Keating, director of the Centre on Constitutional Change. “If the supreme court says you can have an advisory referendum it’s still not legally binding. So in that sense it’s not a legal question but about how it can be resolved politically and whether Westminster thinks it can hold out.”"
2021-01-28T12:20:20Z,politics,Politics,Samantha Cameron business hit by post-Brexit 'teething issues',"Samantha Cameron has said that her clothing business is being hampered by post-Brexit trading difficulties with European countries. In a her first solo interview with the BBC, Cameron said her fashion brand, Cefinn, had been hit by “teething issues” and the extra costs involved in selling products to Europe under the government’s trade deal with EU. Speaking to Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour, she said: “If you’re bringing goods into the country from outside the UK and then trying to sell them back into Europe, that currently is challenging and difficult.”
Echoing the current Brexit concerns of many small businesses about red tape and extra charges, Cameron said: “We really thought we’d done our prep and this … we weren’t expecting. So I think for bigger business, it’s fine. But if you’re small, it’s a challenge.” She said Brexit was thwarting her ambitions to expand her business into Europe. She said: “It [teething issues] does need to be looked at because otherwise we can’t grow our business. It is frustrating, the majority of our business is in the UK and we do a bit of business in America, but we did have a bit of EU business. And obviously you’d like to grow it, because it’s on your doorstep. But unless some of the expense and cost of doing that is looked at it will be challenging.” In an apparent swipe at government advisers who suggested that British businesses that export to the continent should set up separate companies inside the EU, Cameron said: “We can’t afford to have warehouses in Europe and that sort of thing.” She also urged the government to “talk to all businesses out there who are in a similar position to me”. Asked by Woman’s Hour’s new regular presenter, Emma Barnett, whether she had discussed the Brexit supply chain issues with her husband, Cameron said: “Yes definitely. Some of these things came up in the very last moments of negotiations. So you definitely deal with having this problem at work.” She also offered support to the current prime minister’s partner, Carrie Symonds, over media portrayals of her influence over Boris Johnson, following reports of an internal Downing Street feud in the autumn. Asked about claims that allies of Johnson’s former chief aide Dominic Cummings called Symonds “Princess Nut Nut”, Cameron said: “I don’t think she should have that kind of criticism laid at her door … The idea that it’s the wife somehow influencing them over and above what they think or what advice they’re getting from their team, I think it’s kind of demeaning for the prime minister.” She added: “I think that is very unfair to pick her [Symonds] out as having some kind of undue influence.” Asked for any advice she could pass on to Symonds, Cameron said: “I think you’ve got to find your own way. Do the things that you enjoy, do the things that you feel you’re good at. And be as supportive as you can to Boris.”"
2021-01-28T07:30:05Z,politics,Politics,"UK plan to build 24,000 homes faces legal challenge","A plan to build more than 20,000 homes in rural Oxfordshire, championed by secretary of state for housing Robert Jenrick, is facing a legal challenge from residents who say it is incompatible with the government’s legally binding commitments to tackle the climate emergency. Campaigners have issued a legal claim against South Oxfordshire district council’s decision to go ahead with the local plan – which sets out proposals to build 24,000 new homes in the area by 2035. Jenrick, is accused of “massive intervention” to push the scheme through after he ordered South Oxfordshire district council to go ahead with the development in March. Sue Roberts, director of Bioabundance which is taking the legal case, said: “This is the first time a local plan has ever been challenged because of our climate and ecological crisis. This pioneering action by Bioabundance is our last chance to put our environment before housebuilder profit in South Oxfordshire.” The legal challenge is the latest attempt to stop major infrastructure projects – from a new runway at Heathrow to Europe’s biggest gas fired power station – which campaigners argue fail to meet the government’s legally binding commitments to tackle the climate emergency. Both challenges have faced recent setbacks in the courts. Campaigners are challenging the Oxfordshire plan on the grounds that Jenrick’s intervention was inappropriate and that the proposed number of houses breaches the government’s legally binding commitment to hit net zero by 2050. Leigh Day solicitor Tom Short, who is representing Bioabundance, said the claimants were concerned about both “the manner in which the plan has been forced through under enormous pressure from the secretary of state, and the detrimental environmental impacts it will lead to.” “It is important that decisions of local authorities that have significant ramifications for the environment for years to come be taken in a free and fair manner, not dictated by central government as appears to have happened here,” he said. Many of the new houses would be built on the outskirts of Oxford, and there are also plans to develop an old airfield into a ‘new town’. Ian Ashley, director of Bioabundance, said: “The plan would destroy the countryside and a large part of the green belt around Oxford.” The proposals were originally developed by a Conservative led council that was replaced in May 2019 by a Lib Dem-Green coalition that had campaigned to end “over-development”. However, over a period of 21 months, the applicants say the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) put “severe pressure” on South Oxfordshire district council and threatened to withhold promised infrastructure funding for several other projects unless the local plan was adopted. Final approval was given at the South Oxfordshire district council in December. But some councillors who abstained said Jenrick’s “massive intervention” meant it was not a free vote. Roberts, who is also a local councillor, said there was no demand for new housing in the area. She argued the new developments would simply provide second homes, or international investment opportunities for the already wealthy, as well as worsening the climate crisis and “hastening the collapse of the natural world.” However, Caroline Newton, a Conservative member on South Oxfordshire district council said new homes were desperately needed. “There is a directly assessed need for houses in this area … we have got incredibly expensive house prices, first-time buyers are getting older and older and young families are being forced out of the area.” The MHCLG declined to comment. A spokesperson for South Oxfordshire district council said: “We can confirm we’ve received a challenge by Bioabundance to the council’s decision to adopt the Local Plan 2035. We will be responding accordingly but we can’t comment further at this stage as this is a legal matter.”"
2021-01-28T00:08:14Z,politics,Politics,Doctors call for better targeting of Covid vaccinations in UK,"The failure to take a more sophisticated approach to the Covid vaccination programme is leaving some of the most deprived and at-risk individuals, including ethnic minorities, unprotected, the head of the British Medical Association has warned. The UK government is aiming to offer everyone in the top four priority groups as set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) – everyone over the age of 70, care home residents, health and social care workers and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals – a first dose by 15 February. But Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA council chair, said no account had been taken of accompanying JCVI advice that states the programme should pay “due attention to mitigating health inequalities, such as might occur in relation to access to healthcare and ethnicity”.
He said: “We need to be much more sophisticated in making sure the vaccine rollout reaches the people who are at highest risk, beyond the simplistic tiers [priority groups]. “One thing we know is Covid-19 has exacerbated health inequalities. So one of the aims of the vaccination programme should be that in addition to the over-80s and the over-70s etc, there should be a parallel approach of the programme rollout to target health inequalities, especially in deprived communities, and as they apply to ethnic minorities.” Office for National Statistics data from the first wave showed people living in the poorest areas of England and Wales were twice as likely to die from Covid-19 as those in less deprived areas. According to Public Health England (PHE), people from ethnic minorities were up to twice as likely as white Britons to die from Covid. Many minority ethnic groups are more likely to live in deprived areas, in overcrowded housing, and to be in lower-paid, unstable work, often with a high degree of public contact. Preliminary findings by researchers at the University of Oxford’s DataLab and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine found black people and those in more deprived areas were less likely to receive the vaccine than others during the first weeks of distribution.
Nagpaul said: “Deprived communities do not sit easily in the JCVI tiers. For a start, they have fewer over-80s, because the life expectancy in the deprived communities is lower. So that means that what we’re seeing is a vaccination rollout that is vaccinating higher numbers of people in affluent areas because there are more over-80s and we’re seeing lower levels of vaccinations in deprived communities. “What we’re now finding is that, let’s say, a healthy white person of 73 years of age, who is actually not mixing with people, living in a rural area, will get their vaccine, which is fine. But a BAME [black, Asian or minority ethnic] 60-year-old who is in an overcrowded environment with other risk factors where you know that they’re at a high risk of death would not fit into that [prioritisation].” Nagpaul was speaking to the Guardian to mark the launch of the BMA’s national BAME forum, which he said would address “an NHS culture that works against BAME doctors”. He highlighted the fact that 28% of critical care Covid patients in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are BAME, according to the latest figures – twice the BAME representation in the general population in England and Wales. He said local authorities and public health teams should be able to identify their most vulnerable residents because the links between Covid, deprivation and ethnicity had long been known and in June PHE had called for action to address them. “There should already have been local plans in how to protect people who are at highest risk in deprived communities from Covid, and the vaccine rollout should have simply been part of that,” he said. Nagpaul’s intervention came as another study highlighted BAME health inequalities. The Strategy Unit, Nuffield Trust and the Health Foundation analysis, published in Lancet Regional Health – Europe, of 41 major A&E units in England between 11 March and 7 April 2020, during the first lockdown, calculated an average 51% drop in attendance but it was 63.5% for black Africans, 75.3% for Bangladeshis and 71.8% for Pakistanis, prompting fears of harms to health and widening of existing inequalities. The Department of Health and Social Care said: “[The JCVI] advised the immediate priority should be to prevent deaths and protect health and care staff, with old age deemed the single biggest factor determining mortality, and the NHS is now working at pace to vaccinate these groups. “Under the nine priority groups advised for phase one, those over 50 years of age and all adults in a medical risk group will be eligible for vaccination. Prioritisation of people with underlying health conditions will provide for greater vaccination of BAME communities who are disproportionately affected by such health conditions.”"
2021-01-27T23:59:05Z,politics,Politics,Review of UK workers' rights post-Brexit is axed in sudden U-turn,"A controversial review into how EU employment rights protections could be changed after Brexit is no longer going ahead, the business secretary has announced. In an interview with ITV’s Peston, Kwasi Kwarteng said: “So the review is no longer happening within the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). I made it very very clear to officials in the department that we’re not interested in watering down workers’ rights.” He added: “I can’t have been more clear about this on a number of occasions. I’ve said repeatedly that Brexit gives us the opportunity to have higher standards and a higher growth economy and that’s what officials in the department are 100% focused on.” The Guardian understands the consultation on employment rights was signed off by Kwasi Kwarteng’s predecessor Alok Sharma, who left after being given a full-time role leading preparations for the Cop26 climate conference. Initial media reports suggested the review would consider proposals including an end to the 48-hour maximum working week, changes to rules about breaks at work, removing overtime pay when calculating certain holiday pay entitlements, and getting rid of the current requirement for businesses to log information about daily working hours, to save on administration costs. The proposals met fierce criticism from Labour and the unions, but Kwarteng rejected the claims, tweeting: “We are not going to lower the standards of workers’ rights … We want to protect and enhance workers’ rights not row back on them.” However, speaking to MPs last week, the business secretary confirmed that his department was going ahead with the consultation with business leaders on EU employment rules, including the working time directive. He told the business, energy and industrial strategy committee: “I think the view was that we wanted to look at the whole range of issues relating to our EU membership and examine what we wanted to keep, if you like.” After the announcement of the review, the business secretary faced a backlash from the unions and Labour. Ed Miliband, the shadow business, energy and industry secretary, wrote for the Guardian: “The government has failed to bring in the employment bill that it promised would protect and enhance workers’ rights.” He added: “We have seen some workers feel unable to ensure their own safety, scared to raise complaints and compelled to come into the office despite the government’s instruction to work from home.” Kwarteng had also come under fire for his role in Britannia Unchained, a collection of essays that came out in 2012 by then Tory backbenchers who called for reduced worker protections. However, he told the BEIS committee last week that that was “a long time ago”."
2021-01-27T19:56:12Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson hopes schools in England will reopen from 8 March,"Boris Johnson signalled that England’s strict lockdown will continue for at least another five weeks, as he warned that 8 March was the earliest date on which schoolchildren could return to the classroom. When schools were closed to most pupils earlier this month, the prime minister said it would initially be until after the February half-term. But he announced to MPs on Wednesday that only by the middle of next month would the government have a clearer idea of the impact of the vaccine on the pandemic. “The first sign of normality starting to return should be pupils going back to their classrooms,” Johnson said. Unions warned that setting a target date of 8 March for schools to return could create false hope, with Mary Bousted from the National Education Union cautioning: “The prime minister may now be immune to the embarrassment of U-turns, but school leaders, teachers and support staff, not to mention families and students, are utterly exhausted by them.” Speaking after confirming plans to require British citizens returning from high-risk countries to quarantine, the prime minister promised that in the week of 22 February the government would set out a “gradual and phased approach towards easing the restrictions in a sustainable way”. “By then we will know much more about the effect of vaccines in preventing hospitalisations and deaths, using data from the UK but also other nations such as Israel. We will know how successful the current restrictions have been in driving down infections,” Johnson said. “We will also know how many people are still in hospital with Covid, which we simply can’t predict with certainty today. So we will then be in a better position to chart a course out of lockdown without risking a further surge that would overwhelm the NHS.” Another 1,725 people were reported on Wednesday to have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, bringing the total death toll by that measure to 101,887. 25,308 new infections were identified, down 13,597 on the same day last week. The government is expected to publish a “roadmap,” as it did during last year’s lockdown, setting out its criteria for reopening different sectors. The prime minister said the 8 March date was based on the thinking that if the NHS is successful in vaccinating the four most vulnerable groups by 15 February, these people will by then have had three weeks to develop immunity. He said he hoped “all schools will go back” on 8 March, suggesting the government may have moved away from a regional approach to lifting restrictions. “That’s the earliest we can do it, and it depends on lots of things going right,” he said. Johnson expressed sympathy “for parents and for carers who’ve spent so many months not only home schooling but meeting the myriad needs of their children from breakfast to bedtime”. He announced £300m in extra government funding for catchup teaching for children who have fallen behind, and promised families would continue to receive free school meals support until March. That is not expected to include food vouchers being issued during half-term, however. Instead, parents are expected to have to rely on the separate Covid winter grant scheme. Dr Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT teachers’ union, said: “Given previous experience, the announcement of arbitrary dates for schools to reopen to all pupils can be profoundly unhelpful to parents and to those working in schools. “However, a clear plan for how schools will be fully reopened whenever the lockdown restrictions are lifted remains a key question which the government must now work urgently and openly with the profession to address.” The closure of schools across England was announced on 4 January alongside the lockdown, just a day after they had been allowed to open across most of the country. Johnson made the latest schools announcement as part of a Covid update to the House of Commons, a day after official figures confirmed that more than 100,000 people have now died with the virus in the UK.
Challenged at Wednesday’s Downing Street press conference about whether he had made mistakes in his handling of the pandemic, the prime minister said: “Of course I take full responsibility for everything.” But he added: “What I would say humbly and respectfully to those who make criticisms of what the government and what our colleagues have been trying to do is that in situations like this, where you have such very, very brutal and difficult dilemmas there are no easy answers, and very often there are no good answers at all.” He said there would be a “full inquiry” into the pandemic; but he did not believe the time was right for that now, with the country still fighting to control the virus. Chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, stressed the continued prevalence of the virus, underlining the fact that cases and hospitalisations remain extremely high. The prime minister told MPs on Wednesday that the best way of honouring the memory of those who had died from Covid was to “persevere against this virus with ever greater resolve”. He announced that 6.8 million people have now been vaccinated: 13% of the adult population. Johnson also set out plans for passengers from the countries already facing the toughest travel restrictions to the UK to have to quarantine in government-provided accommodation at their own expense. “They will be met at the airport and transferred into quarantine,” he said. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, had earlier called for all teachers and school support staff to be vaccinated during the February half-term, to help expedite the reopening of schools.

2021-01-27T18:44:00Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson reserves right to carry on without learning anything | John Crace,"If not now, then when? With the UK having passed the unwanted “world-beating” milestone of 100,000 coronavirus deaths the previous day, it was inevitable that prime minister’s questions would be dominated by Keir Starmer asking what lessons Boris Johnson had learned about his government’s handling of the crisis. “I take full responsibility,” said a downbeat, almost abject Johnson. The few MPs inside the chamber did a quick double take. Boris had never previously shown any signs of taking responsibility for anything in either his private or public life, so why the personality transplant? Was it really possible that the man whose life had been devoted to the pursuit of his own hedonistic ambition might finally come clean about his own failings? Er … no. There would be a time for a reckoning but that moment had not yet come. Just as it had not come after any number of mistakes over the past 10 months. Too late to implement a first lockdown. Too timid to sack Dominic Cummings for the Durham safari. Too slow to put a working track-and-trace system in place. Too late to impose a second lockdown that had been recommended by government scientists. Too quick to send people back to work and eat out. Too slow to respond to the Covid variant. Too slow to impose tougher restrictions at Christmas. Too slow to initiate a third lockdown. The Labour leader could have gone on. Each mistake had cost lives, yet Johnson reserved the right to carry on without learning anything. Or taking responsibility for anything. Why learn lessons now when you can cram them all in together right at the end? Any inquiry could wait until after the vaccination programme had bought him some public goodwill. No matter how many more mistakes he made in the meantime; his run of bad luck had to end sooner or later. Yet again, satire had been undone by the reality. All that’s left for the sketch on days like this is a simple stenography service. This was Johnson at his most churlish and defensive. A childish refusal to even engage with the questions, let alone answer them. But then that’s the place to which he always psychologically retreats when he’s up against it. Rather than saying that Starmer’s idea of vaccinating teachers during the half-term break after the four most vulnerable groups had been inoculated was not backed up by medical advice, he bunkered down in his comfort zone of challenging Labour to say schools were safe. Which, of course, they aren’t. Otherwise they would all still be open. For a supposedly clever man, Boris can be remarkably dim. As he always does, Starmer chose to play it cool rather than go for all-out attack. One day he might surprise us all, go berserk and start yelling “I can’t take any more of this bullshit” – hell, he would only be voicing what most people watching PMQs are thinking – but he seems a long way off that yet. Rather he just makes his point and lets Johnson make a spectacle of himself. Which the prime minister duly did by accusing Starmer of playing party politics with the pandemic. As so often, he mistakes the guilt of others for his own. Johnson regards even the most gentle challenge as a life-threatening narcissistic wound. “The public just want us to come together,” Boris concluded. And in a way he was right. What the country really wants is for some Tory backbenchers to find a spine and admit that terrible mistakes have been made. That more than 100,000 dead is an unacceptable price to pay for a party leader whose entire life has just been a vanity project. Think about it. The equivalent of an entire small city wiped out and not a single ministerial resignation. Combat was resumed an hour later when Johnson gave a ministerial statement to update the Commons on the Covid pandemic. Finally there were to be some, as yet to be fully determined, hotel quarantine restrictions for arrivals from South Africa and South America – though far too late in the day for many – and, to no great surprise, schools now wouldn’t be reopening before 8 March at the earliest. He also promised a roadmap out of lockdown that no one believed for a second would work out as planned. Not least because Boris promised it would be open to revision, while still providing clarity. Go figure. In reply, Starmer rather went through the motions. All that could be said had been said long ago and he couldn’t force himself to rise to the challenge of finding new ways of getting Boris to take responsibility for his actions. So he merely repeated many of his lines from PMQs while throwing in the added observation that the prime minister’s claim to be balancing the nation’s health with the economy wasn’t working out so well. Except it was, as the scales were just about level. Along with the worst death rate in Europe, we’ve also got the worst economic figures. Something to be proud of, I suppose. Not that Johnson was that bothered. He’d got Starmer off his back for the second time in a day and he could now accept the plaudits of some of his more deluded backbenchers, such as Peter Bone, who thought that only Brexit could save the country from coronavirus. At times like these, Johnson is happy to get his kicks wherever he finds them."
2021-01-27T18:26:58Z,politics,Politics,"UK Covid: PM warns 8 March is earliest England's schools can go back, if it will not cause 'surge in disease' â€“ as it happened","Boris Johnson has confirmed that schools in England will not reopen for all pupils after the February half term - but he has set Monday 8 March as the date when pupils might go back. When he announced the lockdown at the start of January, he said he hoped that if the lockdown and the vaccination programme were effective, â€œwe can steadily move out of lockdown, reopening schools after the February half termâ€�. Today, in a statement to MPs, he said that the planned opening date had been set back â€“ meaning millions of parents face two more weeks of home schooling beyond the time originally implied. The new target date he set, 8 March, is one already identified as a deadline by the Covid Recovery Group, which represents lockdown-sceptic Tories; the CRG has been arguing that the lockdown should start lifting from this point because it marks three weeks after all 15 million people in the top four priority groups should have had their first dose of vaccine, and should therefore be well protected. In his statement Johnson did not say what other lockdown measures might be lifted from 8 March, but he said he would publish a plan for easing the lockdown in the week starting Monday 22 February, after the half-term recess. At a subsequent press conference, Johnson did stress that schools reopening on 8 March was only an aim, and that it was not guaranteed. He said: Iâ€™m hopeful, but thatâ€™s the earliest that we can do it and it depends on lots of things going right ... It also depends on us all now continuing, above all, to work together to drive down the incidents of the disease. The National Education Union has accused him of creating â€œfalse hopeâ€� about this date. (See 2.44pm.) Boris Johnson has confirmed that British citizens returning from high-risk countries must quarantine in hotels at their own expense, facing down calls from cabinet colleagues and scientists to extend the policy to all arrivals. Labour has called for the vaccine priority list to be written so that teachers and other key workers get vaccinated ahead of some over-50s. (See 12.49pm.) Johnson has said this would delay the lifting of lockdown. (See 1.50pm.) Britain is on a collision course with the EU over vaccine shortages after Brussels refused to accept that people in the UK have first claim on Oxford/AstraZeneca doses produced in local plants. Doctors have raised concerns about â€œworryingâ€� disparities in vaccine coverage in England amid signs black people and those in more deprived areas were less likely to receive the vaccine than others in the first weeks of rollout. Nicola Sturgeon has questioned whether Boris Johnsonâ€™s planned trip from London to Scotland on Thursday is â€œgenuinely essentialâ€�, suggesting his visit makes it harder to convince the public to stick to travel restrictions. Thatâ€™s all from me for tonight. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2021-01-27T18:19:54Z,politics,Politics,UK travellers to be questioned at border on reasons for going abroad,"UK travellers will be interrogated at the border on their reasons for going abroad, Boris Johnson has said, as he confirmed that British citizens returning from high-risk countries must quarantine in hotels at their own expense. The government is facing criticism from the Scottish and Welsh governments, as well as scientists, for rejecting a more comprehensive hotel quarantine system. They are warning that it could allow as yet unknown new variants to slip through the gaps. Speaking in the Commons, Johnson said no one should be travelling except for a narrow range of reasons. “I want to make clear that under the stay-at-home regulations it is illegal to leave home to travel abroad for leisure purposes and we will enforce this at ports and airports by asking people why they are leaving and instructing them to return home if they do not have a valid reason to travel,” he said. The home secretary, Priti Patel, said police would be deployed to interrogate travellers at borders and ports. “People should be staying at home, unless they have a valid reason to leave,” she said. “Going on a holiday is not a valid reason.” Patel used a statement in the Commons to criticise social media influencers who have posted pictures from Dubai. “Border Force have given me some examples where even at St Pancras people have been turning up with their skis. That is clearly not acceptable,” she said. “We see plenty of influencers on social media showing off about which parts of the world that they are in, mainly in sunny parts of the world. Going on holiday is not an exemption and it is important that people stay at home.” Johnson said the government had already banned all travel from 22 countries where there was a risk of known variants, including South Africa, Portugal and South American nations. “I can announce that we will require all such arrivals who cannot be refused entry to isolate in government-provided accommodation, such as hotels, for 10 days without exception,” the prime minister said. Those arrivals will be met at the airport and transported directly into quarantine facilities, which Johnson said would be established as quickly as possible.
Patel said a further requirement would be introduced so that anyone travelling must first make a declaration as to why they need to do so, which would be checked by carriers before departure. Those ordered to quarantine in hotels are likely to only include British citizens or permanent residents who must be allowed to enter. The policy is expected to take several weeks to implement. Patel said there would be no exceptions to the quarantine policy for those returning from high-risk countries. The Welsh government said it was concerned about the limited scope of the measures and it would examine its own options. “We have agreed on the need for a joint approach between the four nations of the UK and the Republic of Ireland to strengthen border health measures, in order to prevent the further spread of coronavirus,” a Welsh government spokesperson said. “However, we do not believe the approach as set out by the UK government goes far enough. Further discussions on the details of the proposals will take place as soon as possible.” Joanna Cherry, of the Scottish National party, said the Scottish government was not satisfied with the policy and she hoped the UK government would “listen to their representation”.
Scientists expressed some dismay at the policy. Prof Devi Sridhar, the chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, said there would still be major gaps in the UK’s defences. “It has to apply to all arrivals, or no countries. We know people will just transit and connect in other airports to avoid quarantine,” she said. “The UK tried this with screening from China last February and March, but the seeding came from Spain, Italy and France. We need to learn that lesson. It would be a shame for the UK to vaccinate a bulk of the population and just reimport a strain our vaccines aren’t as effective against.” Christina Pagel, a professor of operational research at University College London and a member of the Independent Sage group of experts, said the policy would be “enough to damage the economy but not nearly enough to be effective against Covid”. She said the policy ran the risk of importing an as yet unidentified new variant that might evade the current vaccines. “Firstly, we just don’t know who the high-risk countries are because most countries do not have the sophisticated sequencing capabilities you need to spot, track and analyse new variants,” she said. “If we work with the Republic of Ireland, we can control our borders for Covid as island nations. We should take advantage of this to do all we can to minimise the risks of new variants just as we are rolling out vaccination across the population. And instead we just aren’t.” ADS, the trade body representing the aerospace sector, said more specific support would be needed from the Treasury, even without the blanket measures. Its chief executive, Paul Everitt, said: “These latest measures to restrict international travel will worsen the severe downturn in aviation and deepen the crisis in the UK aerospace industry. “Sector-specific support must now be urgently delivered to ensure aerospace manufacturers and our supply chains can survive until these measures are lifted and demand returns.”
The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said the proposals would make little difference unless they were expanded. “Yet again the government is lurching from one crisis to another, devoid of strategy, and limiting hotel quarantining to only a limited number of countries, from which travel from non-UK residents was already banned, means that the home secretary’s proposals do not go anywhere near far enough,” he said. Thomas-Symonds said it was clear that Patel herself had privately favoured a more comprehensive approach. “The truth is the government is once again behind the curve,” he said."
2021-01-27T18:15:56Z,politics,Politics,Corbyn loses bid to force Labour to disclose documents about his suspension,"Jeremy Corbyn has lost a legal fight to force Labour to hand over documents before a possible high court challenge against his suspension from the parliamentary party. The former Labour leader’s lawyers believed the documents would help him show that an agreement to fully readmit him to the party following his suspension for downplaying antisemitism under his leadership had been reneged upon. Labour has denied in court that any such deal existed. In a ruling on Wednesday, the judge Lisa Sullivan dismissed Corbyn’s claim, saying he already had sufficient information upon which to decide whether or not to bring a case. During a hearing last week the Islington North MP’s lawyers accused his successor, Keir Starmer, of “inflammatory and disingenuous” attacks. Corbyn believes his suspension was handled unfairly and was the object of political interference. He was suspended in October after he rejected some of the damning findings of an Equality and Human Rights Commission report on Labour antisemitism, saying: “One antisemite is one too many, but the scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media.” The refusal to acknowledge the scale of the problem under his leadership caused a rift with Starmer, who felt his predecessor had undermined work to restore trust and confidence in Labour’s ability to tackle antisemitism. Corbyn was readmitted to the party by the national executive committee in November but Starmer ordered that the Labour whip be withheld until he apologised, which Corbyn has not done, effectively suspending him from the parliamentary party. At a hearing this month, Corbyn’s barrister Christopher Jacobs said the suspension was unlawful and in breach of contract, claiming that the MP needed “pre-action disclosure” before an “anticipated claim” against Labour. But Sullivan ruled: “Corbyn has sufficient material to make a decision on the merits of his case.” It is understood Corbyn expects to launch his main legal challenge soon, though court backlogs could mean it will be some time before the case is heard. The Guardian understands he is hoping to reach a compromise over his suspension in negotiations with Labour’s chief whip, Nick Brown. Corbyn’s initial suspension was for three months and is to be reviewed in February, though it remains conditional on the apology demanded by Starmer. A Labour party spokesperson welcomed Wednesday’s decision, adding: “It is regrettable that the court’s time and our members’ money was spent on this matter. We look forward to drawing a line under this matter and uniting our party ahead of a vital set of elections.” It is understood the party will seek to recover its costs from Corbyn."
2021-01-27T18:01:02Z,politics,Politics,Key questions PM must answer on his handling of Covid crisis,"Boris Johnson has said “we truly did everything we could” to minimise loss of life from coronavirus, and insisted he takes “full responsibility” for the government’s handling of the pandemic. But when an inquiry is eventually carried out into the past 12 torrid months, the prime minister will have to face a series of difficult questions about key decisions he made. Failure to grasp the gravity of the emerging crisis As news first began to trickle out of China, triggering the government’s pandemic planning, the prime minister left the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to chair the first five meetings of the emergency Cobra committee about the virus. After carrying out a fraught reshuffle of his cabinet, Johnson decamped to the taxpayer-owned mansion of Chevening, and did not chair his first Covid Cobra meeting until 2 March, just before the first confirmed UK death from the virus. Comforted by advisers who compared the challenge to tackling seasonal flu, he tended to play down the seriousness of the pandemic in its early days, insisting it was “business as usual”. Most memorably, he told a Downing Street briefing that he “shook hands with everybody” during a hospital visit in early March.
Keeping Britain’s borders open With the support of scientific advisers, Johnson took the decision to lift border restrictions on 13 March last year after evidence emerged that the virus was already circulating in the UK, despite a strict quarantine regime for arrivals from Wuhan, in China. At the time, the harsher approach adopted early on by countries such as Singapore and New Zealand, involving flight bans and quarantine, were regarded as extreme by ministers. But many analysts now believe closing the borders was an important precaution that helped these countries and others fare much better. Delaying lockdown last March Johnson announced a full-blown lockdown on 23 March last year, with little idea at the time that it would remain in place until July, with many children kept out of the classroom until September. He had edged towards the shutdown via a series of intermediate steps, including banning mass public events and exhorting the public to avoid unnecessary social interaction and to work from home where possible. Only when modelling carried out by Prof Neil Ferguson at Imperial College London suggested there could be up to 500,000 deaths if the virus was not brought under control, and amid growing signs that the public were taking matters into their own hands, did Johnson order the public to stay at home. Some public health experts now believe an earlier shutdown could have saved many thousands of lives. Not sacking Dominic Cummings after his Barnard Castle jaunt When it emerged that his top adviser had flouted lockdown rules by driving 300-plus miles to Durham, with a day trip to a local town thrown in, Johnson stuck by him resolutely. He told the public at a Downing Street press conference that his aide had acted “responsibly and legally”, in crisscrossing the country, ostensibly to seek childcare for his young son, and then to test his eyesight, at a time when the public were being urged to stay at home. His decision sparked an avalanche of angry emails to MPs and risked undermining public confidence in lockdown rules at a critical time. Outsourcing test and trace The former TalkTalk executive Dido Harding was brought in by Johnson and Matt Hancock to run the hugely costly test-and-trace system, which has relied heavily on private sector outsourcing and has not worked as effectively as hoped. Councils carrying out their own local contact-tracing operations have generally obtained better results than the call centres run by Serco and other providers, while management consultants have in some cases been paid £7,000 a day for their expertise in setting it up. Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, have declined to fix holes in the social safety net – including the paucity of statutory sick pay – that have created a strong financial disincentive for many people to self-isolate. Rejecting calls from Sage for a ‘circuit-breaker’ lockdown in September Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance gave the prime minister a briefing on 16 September setting out the dire risks of allowing the virus to run unchecked as cases increased into the autumn. Their colleagues on the Sage committee suggested a short “circuit-breaker” lockdown, perhaps over the October half-term. But Downing Street aides made clear at the time that Johnson considered it to be his role to weigh up scientific advice with other considerations, including the economic and social costs of a fresh lockdown. He therefore opted for a middle course, between the scientists’ proposal and the demands of many in his party to resist fresh restrictions: a beefed-up system of “tiers”, with tougher rules for the hardest-hit areas. In the event, as Whitty predicted when they were introduced, even the strictest, tier 3 rules did not do enough to restrain the virus, and a month-long lockdown was announced on 31 October. Resisting ‘cancelling Christmas’ A month before Christmas, the government agreed a plan with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland administrations that would allow up to three households to mix for a fixed five days over the festive period. Johnson then stuck resolutely by the plan, even as cases surged in London and Kent. Matt Hancock alerted the House of Commons to concerns about a new variant of the virus on 14 December, “which may be associated with the faster spread in the south-east of England”. When Keir Starmer called for tougher restrictions two days later, the prime minister accused him of wanting to “cancel Christmas”. It was another three days, after being warned of the increased transmissibility of the variant, before Johnson announced a travel ban and halted Christmas mixing across London and much of the south of England: but families in many parts of England were still able to meet and mingle for a day."
2021-01-27T17:59:30Z,politics,Politics,"Labour failing to win back enough Tory voters, officials warn","Just 4% of Conservative voters are switching to Labour almost a year into Keir Starmer’s leadership, polls suggest, and Labour insiders fear the party could lose a slew of council seats in May’s local elections. Labour officials have been briefing that a “standstill” result, where the party gains no seats and minimises losses, would be a good outcome. One source said internal party projections in March 2020, in the wake of Boris Johnson’s landslide general election victory, suggested the party would lose 400 council seats and lose control of some local authorities, including Plymouth, Amber Valley, and Harlow. Elections in May 2020 were subsequently cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. The party hopes it can avoid such big losses this May but it does not expect to make gains. “There are no sign in any of the polling we have seen that we are going to make any advances whatsoever,” a senior Labour source said. Of the constituencies that Labour lost to the Conservatives in 2019, 37 have council seats up for election this year. Shadow ministers have been warned that the party’s 20-point poll advance has come from cannibalising the Liberal Democrat vote, as that party languishes in single figures. “Put simply, we are winning back nowhere near enough Tory voters,” a senior source said. Strategists have also told shadow ministers that the party’s finances are in a perilous state – a situation that could worsen due to numerous court actions against the party. Starmer has been criticised by some on the left of the party for moderating some criticism of the government during the pandemic. Supporters are likely to want to see Labour make some gains at the expense of a party in government that has overseen one of the worst death tolls in Europe in the pandemic. Strategists’ internal verdict that the party is not doing enough to win back Conservative voters is likely to raise alarm among the party’s leftwingers, who have already rebelled on issues including defence. The 2021 elections are set to be the biggest in years. There are a number of key mayoral races, in London, the east Midlands, Bristol, and Tees Valley. Seats will be up for election in more than 140 county councils, district councils and unitary authorities, including 118 councils where this should have happened in 2020. There are also elections in the Scottish and Welsh parliaments. However, turnout is expected to be extremely low, given the pandemic and public uncertainty about whether the polls will even take place. Internal polling presented to the shadow cabinet two weeks ago suggested Labour will struggle to win the Tees Valley mayoral seat, now held by the Tory Ben Houchen, which had been seen as a bellwether for Labour’s resurrection in north-east England. The private research suggested the Conservatives could win with 66% of the first round of voting, a devastating result for Labour. Labour is more confident it may take the West of England mayoralty – covering parts of South Gloucestershire, and Bath and North East Somerset – from the Conservatives, in a sign of how the party’s voter base may be shifting towards the southern middle classes. There is also some slim hope of the party taking the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough mayoralty. Many of the council seats to be contested are in the areas that caused the most devastating blows for Labour in the 2019 election, when the Conservatives managed a huge sweep in the north of England in places held by Labour for many decades. Labour lost control of Bolsover district council in 2019 and the Tories also won the parliamentary seat. Labour expects the pattern to continue there. Council seats are also up for election in West Bromwich, where both parliamentary seats were taken by the Conservatives, including the seat of Labour’s former deputy leader Tom Watson. Labour expects to come third in the Scottish parliament elections, losing dozens of seats to the SNP. There are areas of deep concern in Wales too, particular in the north where Labour is defending areas that have turned Conservative in Westminster. It has to defend a number of slim majorities against Plaid Cymru."
2021-01-27T13:59:47Z,politics,Politics,"PM too slow to act throughout Covid pandemic, says Starmer","Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of being slow to implement a series of measures during the pandemic, as he piled pressure on the prime minister to explain why the UK’s official Covid-19 death toll had passed 100,000. Appearing at prime minister’s questions via video link from home, where he has been isolating, the Labour leader argued that Johnson had been slow on a number of issues throughout the crisis, including imposing lockdowns, providing PPE to frontline workers, protecting care homes, and getting test-and-trace efforts working. Starmer also pressed Johnson about plans to get children back in classrooms, calling on him to bring forward the vaccination of teachers and school staff so they can receive jabs once people in the first four priority categories have had theirs by mid-February. He said: “Yesterday we passed the tragic milestone of 100,000 Covid deaths in the United Kingdom. That’s not just a statistic. Behind every death is a grieving family, a mum, a dad, a sister, a brother, a friend, a colleague, a neighbour. “The question on everyone’s lips this morning is: why? The prime minister must have thought about that question a lot. So could he tell us why he thinks that the United Kingdom has ended up with a death toll of 100,000, the highest number in Europe?”
Johnson – who insisted his government “did everything we could” and was “deeply sorry for every life lost” when the figure was recorded on Tuesday – said he mourned “every death in this pandemic”. He said: “I and the government take full responsibility for all the actions I have taken, we’ve taken, during this pandemic to fight this disease. And, yes … there will indeed be a time when we must learn the lessons of… what has happened, reflect on them and prepare.” He added: “I don’t think that moment is now, when we are in the throes of fighting this wave of the new variant, when 37,000 people are struggling with Covid in our hospitals, and I think what the country wants is for us to come together as a parliament and … as politicians and to work to keep the virus under control… as we are, and to continue to roll out the fastest vaccination programme in Europe.” Starmer continued to press Johnson for an answer on why the UK had a Covid death toll higher than almost anywhere else in the world. He said: “The problem with the prime minister avoiding the question of ‘why?’ is that vital lessons won’t be learned.
“The reality is this: the prime minister was slow into the first lockdown last March, he was slow in getting protective equipment to the frontline, slow to protect our care homes, slow on testing and tracing, slow into the second lockdown in the autumn, slow to change the Christmas mixing rules, slow again into this third lockdown, delaying 13 days from 22 of December before implementing it. And I fear that he still hasn’t learned that lesson.” Turning his attention towards efforts to get children back in schools, Starmer said: “Everybody agrees that reopening our schools should be a national priority but that requires a plan and the prime minister hasn’t got a plan. So, as a first step, does he agree with me that once the first four categories of the most vulnerable have been vaccinated by mid-February he should bring forward the vaccination of key workers and use the window of the February half-term to vaccinate all teachers and all school staff?” The top four categories in the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation’s priority list include all those 70 and over, the clinically extremely vulnerable, residents in care homes for older people and their carers, as well as frontline health and social care workers. Categories five to nine cover those aged 50 and over, as well as people aged 16-64 with underlying health conditions putting them at risk of serious disease. Responding to Starmer – who described the February half-term as a “fantastic opportunity” to vaccinate school teachers and staff – Johnson said all teachers in priority groups one to nine would be vaccinated “as a matter of priority”. But Starmer said he was “none the wiser” as to whether the prime minister agreed with him on the point."
2021-01-26T20:08:09Z,politics,Politics,Former Tory MP's posting as UK ambassador to Cuba raises fresh cronyism claims,"Boris Johnson’s government has been accused of fostering a culture of cronyism after the appointment of a former Conservative MP as ambassador to Cuba. George Hollingbery, the former minister and MP until 2019, was announced on Tuesday as the UK’s new “man in Havana”, a post usually taken by experienced diplomats. Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union, which represents Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) staff, said the appointment was evidence that the government is sacrificing the art of diplomacy to hand jobs to political friends.
“Sir George Hollingbery’s appointment, with little obvious relevant expertise and no competition, once again suggests that to this government, who you know is more important than what you know. “Ambassadorial posts are key to securing the UK’s interests abroad. Political appointments undermine the country’s longer-term interests, as they will almost inevitably change with a change in government,” he said. Penman said the UK should not follow the US practice of encouraging political appointments, which damage diplomatic relations. “As we’re witnessing in the United States at this moment, more than 200 key ambassadorial roles need to be filled as part of around 4,000 civil service posts that have to be appointed by the new administration,” he said. Hollingbery, a former close ally of Theresa May, was a minister in the department of trade when he stood down from parliament in 2019. After entering parliament, he was a parliamentary private secretary to May in the home office and No 10, and a lord commissioner to the Treasury. Before entering parliament, he was the deputy leader of Winchester council and developed a veterinary chain which he sold to the firm Pets at Home. Welcoming the new ambassador, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said: “Sir George Hollingbery brings a wealth of experience to the role, including from his time as a trade minister.” Jolyon Maugham, the director of the Good Law Project, which has launched legal action against the government over the handing of Covid contracts to “VIPs”, said: “Perhaps he is a good chap but he doesn’t have any obvious qualifications for the role. Treating these posts as political gifts can’t serve the national interest – and it must be pretty dispiriting for talented and hard-working Foreign Office staff.” The government has faced criticism for making major Coronavirus-related appointments without proper process. Dido Harding, whose husband is the Conservative MP John Penrose, who is close to Johnson, is now the head of test and trace. Kate Bingham, whose husband is the minister Jesse Norman, who was at Eton with Johnson, was appointed in May as the chair of the UK vaccine taskforce. She stood down from the role at the end of 2020. Retired Labour MPs were also given plum diplomatic roles under Tony Blair. Paul Boateng, the former Labour minister, was the UK’s ambassador to South Africa from 2005. Helen Liddell became the high commissioner to Australia in the same year, and was followed in the role by Valerie Amos. Under the Conservatives, Ed Llewellyn, David Cameron’s former chief of staff, was given the role of ambassador to France. A government source said: “The FDA’s criticism is nothing but pointless political posturing.” An FCDO spokesperson said: “Sir George has a wealth of international and government experience that he will bring to this role, including from his time as trade minister. It is not unusual to make political appointments in the diplomatic service.”"
2021-01-26T18:55:12Z,politics,Politics,"UK Covid: Johnson 'sorry for every life lost' and takes 'full responsibility' as death toll passes 100,000 â€“ as it happened","UK government death toll surpasses 100,000 after 1,631 new fatalities reportedThe UK reported 20,089 new coronavirus infections on Tuesday, compared to Mondayâ€™s 22,195. A further 1,631 deaths were reported, up from Mondayâ€™s 592. The governmentâ€™s overall death toll now stands at 100,162. Boris Johnson has insisted his government â€œdid everything we couldâ€� to limit coronavirus deaths and expressed sorrow after the total UK death toll exceeded 100,000 on nearly every metric, but refused to discuss the reasons why it might be so high. Downing Street sought to play down any potential row over the EUâ€™s threat to potentially restrict vaccine exports to the UK, saying ministers do not foresee likely disruption to UK vaccine supplies. Health minister Matt Hancock said protectionism was not the right approach after an EU proposal to restrict the exports of shots. Teachers, police and people with learning disabilities will need to be considered for the next round of Covid-19 vaccinations, said NHS chief Sir Simon Stevens. The governmentâ€™s proposed mandatory hotel quarantine measures for travellers arriving from high-risk countries could wipe out nearly Â£548m a day from the UK economy in lost travel, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC). The Scottish government continues to come under fire for its slow pace of vaccine rollout, as UK government sources confirm that Scotland has been supplied with nearly one million doses, yet under half a million Scots have so far received their first dose. Home secretary Priti Patel claimed in the Commons that the UK Border Force is now conducting â€œ100% compliance checksâ€� on whether people arriving in the country are following quarantine orders. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, rebuffed calls from MPs for more details on future coronavirus support packages, but said further economic help was coming The NHS England boss, Sir Simon Stevens, told the the health and social care committee that the governmentâ€™s pledge to â€œlevel upâ€� across the country should include efforts to eliminate health inequalities. There are now more than 6 million people in the UK who have had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine as efforts to speed up the inoculations process continue to intensify. But as more of those in the highest risk age groups get their jabs, there are growing concerns in government about the rates of vaccine hesitancy in some black and minority ethnic communities. The number of children of key workers attending school in England last week has declined slightly, according to official government statistics, after head teachers expressed safety concerns about high numbers of pupils attending during the current lockdown. More than 23,000 UK workers at supermarket Lidl are to get a Â£200 bonus in recognition of their hard work during the pandemic. Health officials are concerned the West Midlands could soon overtake London to become the region with the highest Covid-19 case rate in the country. National infection rates have fallen by 24% in the past seven days, while the West Midlands has recorded a much slower decline of just 8%. The German government has challenged reports of a lower-than-expected efficacy rate of the AstraZeneca vaccine for older people, while reiterating concerns about the British-Swedish pharmaceutical giantâ€™s data reporting. The UKâ€™s unemployment rate hit its highest in nearly five years in the three months to November.The Office for National Statistics said the unemployment rate rose to 5% in the three months to the end of November â€“ representing more than 1.7 million people â€“ from 4.9% in the three months to the end of October, reaching the highest level since April 2016. Unemployment was 4% in February before the pandemic struck. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the second week of January had highest Covid deaths in England and Wales since April.

2021-01-26T14:32:15Z,politics,Politics,EU citizens offered financial incentives to leave UK,"EU citizens are being offered financial incentives to leave the UK, the Guardian has learned, months before the deadline to apply for settled status. From 1 January EU citizens have quietly been added to the government’s voluntary returns scheme where financial support is offered as an encouragement to return to their country of origin. Payments can include flights and up to £2,000 resettlement money. The scheme is designed to help some migrants in the UK to leave voluntarily. People working to help vulnerable EU citizens in the UK said the offer of money to return home contradicted the government’s claim that it was doing everything it could to encourage people to register for settled status. The deadline for Europeans living in the UK to apply for the EU settlement scheme (EUSS) is 30 June.
Benjamin Morgan, who runs the EU homeless rights project at the Public Interest Law Centre, said: “It is clear from our casework that some of the most vulnerable EU citizens are yet to resolve their status. Barriers to application and delays in Home Office decision-making remain significant factors. “This mixed messaging around settled status on the one hand and voluntary returns on the other, seriously undermines the government’s claim that the rights of vulnerable Europeans will be protected after Brexit.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Some people may choose not to obtain status under EUSS and may not wish to remain in the UK after the deadline. That is why we have written to stakeholders to inform them that EEA nationals who wish to leave the UK may now be eligible for support to help them do so under the voluntary returns scheme.” The news came as research from the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JWCI) warned that thousands of European key workers risked losing their legal right to remain in the UK. The report, titled When the Clapping Stops: EU Care Workers After Brexit, warns that thousands of European citizens currently fulfilling key worker roles in the care sector, as well as those working in construction, manufacturing and agriculture, are at risk of losing their legal status and face removal from the UK. Of 295 care workers surveyed by the charity, one in seven were unsure what EUSS was, one in three had not heard about it before being in touch with JCWI, and one in three did not know there was a deadline for the settlement scheme, nor when it was. Most of the surveys were conducted between January and March last year. “If even a tiny fraction of the estimated EEA+ (EU, EEA and Swiss) residents are unable to apply in time, tens of thousands will lose their status overnight,” the report states. “Without urgent action, the care sector is likely to be devastated,” it adds. The report calls for the immediate lifting of the deadline for applying to the EUSS, for European citizens to be automatically granted settled status, and for an end to “hostile environment” policies. It states that workers in industries with poor conditions, low pay and insecure contracts such as care, construction and agriculture are particularly at risk of slipping through the cracks in the scheme. Those unable to apply on time will be subject to measures including detention and removal and could be criminalised for working, renting accommodation or driving a car. Chai Patel, of JCWI, said: “Our research scares me because the people we talked to were far less vulnerable than other groups hidden in exploitative working conditions, who no one has been able to reach to ask questions. Despite warnings from us and many other experts, the Home Office is burying its head in the sand about this just like they did with Windrush and making excuses instead of finding solutions.” JCWI is not the only organisation to warn that some might slip through the net. The Migration Observatory has expressed concern that some groups are at risk of being unregistered by the 30 June deadline. The immigration minister, Kevin Foster, said the JCWI report presented “an incredibly misleading picture of the EU settlement scheme” as it relied on “a small survey of less than 300 people conducted a year ago”. “Since then millions of applications have been received by the scheme,” he said. “We have now had almost 4.9m applications to the hugely successful EU settlement scheme. There is now less than six months before the 30 June 2021 deadline and I would encourage all those eligible to apply now to secure their rights under UK law. A wide range of support is available online and over the telephone if you need it and we are funding 72 organisations across the UK to ensure no one gets left behind.”"
2021-01-25T20:09:53Z,politics,Politics,Thérèse Coffey's Zoom walkout leaves even Piers Morgan lost for words,"Thérèse Coffey is normally a glass half-full kind of minister. Sent out to do the media round on Monday morning, she even managed to claim to LBC’s Nick Ferrari that getting just 1,868 young people – out of a targeted 120,000 – starting roles on the government’s kickstarter scheme had “actually been a huge success”. I hate to think what a massive failure might look like. But even the work and pensions secretary struggled when she came up against Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid on ITV’s Good Morning Britain. Having first delivered the classic line that “the best way to tackle this virus is to avoid contracting it in the first place” – no shit – Coffey made the elementary error of giving a direct answer to a direct question. Other ministers have gone to great lengths to appear totally mystified and avoid saying why the UK has the highest coronavirus death rate in the world, but Coffey just jumped straight in. It was because we had an ageing population and an obesity crisis. So it was basically our own fault and we had it coming. We were living far too long and eating far too much. If only we had all died younger or half-starved to death, then all of this could have been avoided. The humanity in her response was touching. Morgan couldn’t believe his luck. So what you’re saying, he observed, was that we Brits were basically too old and too fat. Whereupon the minister completely lost it and accused Morgan of being insulting for repeating back what she had just said. Only Coffey wouldn’t have it. Apparently there was no link between an ageing population and people getting old and a population getting obese and being fat. Or maybe she was just irritated with herself for failing to mention a succession of failures in government policy that had considerably boosted the mortality rate. Whichever it was, Thérèse spent the next two minutes trying to distance herself from ever having brought up “old” and “fat”. Morgan was just trying to twist her words. What she had meant by ageing was an important boom in senior living. And by obese she had meant that under the Tories there was no longer anyone going hungry; it was just a coincidence that the poorest people tended to have the worst diets. Realising that what she had hoped would be an easy interview had turned into a car crash, Coffey just reached for the off switch on her Zoom call. It’s one way of terminating an interview, I suppose. If not one generally found in the politician’s handbook. Time’s up, got to go, she said desperately before her screen went dead. “Wow,” Morgan commented. Wow indeed. It’s not often that the TV presenter is lost for words. It had been eight months since Coffey had last been on GMB. Don’t hold your breath for another appearance in the next eight months. How Coffey must wish she was sometimes let loose in No 10 as Matt Hancock had a rather more comfortable time when fronting the Downing Street press conference. Largely because he had nothing new to say and because he was able to ignore any questions that felt remotely tricky. Rather he – along with the deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, and Public Health England’s Susan Hopkins – eased their way through the 45-minute session as if it was a cosy fireside chat. A few harsh reminders that the virus was far from beaten and that people still needed to obey the rules, interspersed with the good news that more than 6.5m vaccinations had been given and that the early evidence was that the vaccine was effective against the UK variant. This was the ideal gig for the health secretary. Normally he’s sent out when there’s a crisis of some sort going on. But now we’ve got so used to every day being near enough a crisis, that when things stay more or less the same and the death and hospitalisation figures are slightly lower then it’s cause for celebration in No 10. Even though the numbers would have been considered completely terrifying if anyone had mentioned them as a possibility even a month ago. Disaster has become the new normal, so when things are no worse than they were the day before it almost feels as if a corner has been turned. And over the course of the pandemic, Door Matt has become quite accomplished at sounding reassuring yet resolute. Or maybe our expectations of him and other ministers have become so low we now mistake mediocrity for comfort. It also helps when no one actually asks any tricky questions. Had Hancock been asked the killer Coffey question of why the UK has the highest global death figures then he might have struggled. Instead he was asked when the lockdown restrictions might be lifted – though no one mentioned schools – and was quite easily able to point out that rather depended when deaths, hospitalisations, variants and vaccines co-aligned. It appears the rate of infection is no longer part of the equation. He also hinted that he was in favour of quarantine hotels for all arrivals – not just for those from areas with known variants, without having either to specify how many beds they expected to need or why the government had taken so long to come round to this idea. In fact, by the end, Door Matt even looked as if he was rather enjoying the press briefing. For the rest of us, it had been three-quarters of an hour of our lives we would never get back. Still, there are days when even Hancock gets an even break. And as Coffey will tell you, there are advantages to being dull."
2021-01-25T18:19:50Z,politics,Politics,Hancock stresses need for caution at borders; cases fall to lowest daily level for a month – as it happened,"Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has hinted that the government will impose tough new hotel quarantine rules for people arriving in the UK. For some days ministers have been discussing plans for people arriving in the UK to be forced to quarantine in hotels, but there has been disagreement about whether the new conditions should just apply to people visiting from countries where the Covid risk is particularly high, or whether they should apply more broadly. Asked if he favoured the hotel quarantine rules applying to all arrivals, Hancock said the â€œprecautionary principleâ€� should apply - implying he favoured stricter rather than looser rules. He said: I think it is incredibly important that we are cautious at the border ... It is important that we protect from new variants should they have vaccine evasion. And it is also reasonable to take a precautionary principle to protect this country whilst we work on the science and the analysis of the different variants that are discovered around the world. Earlier Boris Johnson also hinted that he favoured more comprehensive rather than more limited restrictions, saying the policy should provide â€œthe maximum possible protection against reinfection from abroadâ€�. (See 11.49am.) Ministers are expected to take a decision tomorrow. The UK has recorded the lowest number of new Covid cases for more than a month, although the number of people on mechanical ventilation in hospital with the illness has hit a record high. (See 4.36pm.) Schools in England are not expected to start fully reopening until at least early March, Downing Street has indicated, as Tory MPs and childrenâ€™s advocates pressurised Boris Johnson to set out a timetable for the process. Workers who are regularly exposed to coronavirus through their job, including care home workers and nurses, are more likely to die from the virus than people in other professions, according to fresh analysis. Brendan Clarke-Smith, a 40-year-old Conservative MP who received the coronavirus vaccine after spending an afternoon volunteering at a local hospital, has said this happened because there were some left-over doses, which would have otherwise gone to waste. The vaccine manufacturer Moderna has started work on a booster for its Covid jab to improve protection against a new variant of coronavirus first detected in South Africa. The Covid vaccine is failing to reach thousands of elderly people who receive care in their own homes, because they are too frail to travel to vaccination centres or fear infection if they do, a care provider has said. The UK is at risk of becoming a failed state and breaking up unless there are deep reforms of the way the country is governed, the former prime minister Gordon Brown has said. Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, has said his party would boycott a Scottish independence referendum set up without the approval of Westminster. The Labour partyâ€™s lawyers have written to the director of public prosecutions alleging that Shaun Bailey, the Conservative partyâ€™s candidate for London mayor, used fraud to influence upcoming elections by publishing leaflets headed with fake City Hall insignia. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2021-01-25T15:29:03Z,politics,Politics,Kwasi Kwarteng: has all the right credentials – but can get into trouble,"Acquaintances of Kwasi Kwarteng, the recently appointed secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, are wondering why it took him 10 years to become the first black British Conservative to run his own government department. On paper, Kwarteng already had the necessary attributes when he arrived in parliament in 2010. An Eton scholarship, a Cambridge PhD, a City career and a string of books on history and politics that brandished his rightwing and intellectual credentials. But former colleagues have said he also has a Boris Johnson-like tendency towards impulsiveness and free-thinking that occasionally gets him into trouble. The MP for Spelthorne failed to disguise his contempt for David Cameron’s touchy-feely approach, which put his career on hold while his peers flourished, and he has occasionally wooed a warlord and oil barons when others might have walked away. One former minister said it would be tough for Kwarteng, a free marketeer, to join a government in the midst of the biggest economic intervention since the war. “Kwasi has a huge and quick brain, but he is also restless. He will flourish if he can knuckle down and subdue what he really thinks. But that is a big if.” Kwarteng, 45, who is of Ghanaian heritage, was born in Waltham Forest, east London. He was sent away to boarding school by his economist father and barrister mother at the age of eight. At Eton he was seen by fellow pupils as an earnest and thoughtful boy who on occasions was seen discussing TS Eliot with fellow pupils. Although trained as a serious historian at Trinity – and part of a winning University Challenge team on television in 1995, when he famously muttered “fuck” while trying to recall an answer – in parliament he transformed into a professional politician whose eyes were firmly on government. But he faltered after falling foul of Cameron and George Osborne. In 2013 he advocated cutting the VAT rate to 15%, funded by adding the charge to children’s clothes and food, reportedly upsetting Downing Street. Then he criticised the chancellor’s Help to Buy housing scheme. One colleague said he could not help himself. “Kwasi really did not rate their politics or their intellect. And they were a little intimidated by him,” he said. In 2012, he and other Brexiters from the parliamentary newcomers – Priti Patel, Dominic Raab, Liz Truss and Chris Skidmore – published Britannia Unchained: Global Lessons for Growth and Prosperity, which included a passage seen as evidence he was ready to take on the unions over workers’ rights. “The British are among the worst idlers in the world. We work among the lowest hours, we retire early and our productivity is poor,” it said. He clocked up many air miles on fact-finding missions paid for by Tory donors and foreign governments. Kwarteng defended the principle of visiting foreign autocratic regimes, saying it offered a greater chance of influencing their behaviour than “shouting from the sidelines without ever setting foot in these places”. In January 2017, Kwarteng argued in favour of the UK and the US backing Field Marshall Khalifa Haftar, the Libyan warlord, and dropping support for the Government of National Accord (GNA), noting that Haftar controlled much of the country’s oil. “Such a move would not strictly conform to the ideals of ‘democratic state building’ but it might provide a stable government to give Libya some control of its borders,” he wrote in the Evening Standard. Three months later, Kwarteng was photographed shaking the hand of Haftar after being flown to Libya by the Conservative Middle East Forum. Haftar is now being sued in the US for $50m (£36.6m), accused of war crimes including starvation sieges that forced families to eat grass and tree bark to survive. Kwarteng accepted funds from fossil fuel investors and advisers during the last general election campaign. The Guardian has previously disclosed that these included £7,500 from IPGL, a holding company with a 40% stake in Cluff Energy Africa, a London-based company that prospects for oil in west Africa. IPGL is owned by the former Conservative party treasurer Michael Spencer. Kwarteng also received £4,000 from Majid Jafar, the chief executive of Crescent Petroleum, a privately held company with oil and gas operations in the Middle East. Jafar was a contemporary of Kwarteng at Eton. At the time, a spokesperson for Kwarteng said there was no conflict of interest and that all donations were in line with the ministerial code. Kwarteng has built up a reputation for being good company among senior Conservatives and has dated several senior party women, including the former home secretary Amber Rudd. He married Harriet Edwards, a City solicitor, in 2019. Kwarteng lunched Brexiters at the Carlton Club, where he would reportedly enjoy a bottle of the house bordeaux. The diarist Sasha Swire, wife of the former MP Hugo Swire, described him as “essentially an academic; he is enthusiastic and bombastic, and barely draws breath.” Kwarteng consistently backed Johnson to become leader and was rewarded with a job as energy minister in 2017, and so he will already know some of the workings of his department. For clues at to what he might do in office, Britannia Unchained said that in Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea “a combination of private enterprise and effective government policy has enabled economic growth rates which we can only dream about in the west.” In one of his first acts as business secretary, Kwarteng told MPs last week that he was reviewing how EU employment rights protections could be changed after Brexit. He said the plan was to maintain “a really good high standard for workers in high employment and a high-wage economy. That’s what I’m focusing on. And so the idea that we’re trying to whittle down standards, that’s not at all plausible or true.”"
2021-01-25T14:44:54Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson’s lockdown slip-up contradicts the official line,"The news that the prime minister is looking at easing some restrictions by mid-February came as a surprise to many reporters – and to No 10. The slip by Boris Johnson went against what insiders have been briefing for many weeks: that the easing of restrictions is a long way off and that this time there will be extreme caution. “The one to four [most vulnerable] groups are going to be vaccinated by 15 February. Before then we will be looking at the potential of relaxing some measures,” he said. Aides have underlined to reporters that Johnson’s comments were misinterpreted – “looking at” only means the government will be starting to make decisions, and that nothing will change before the 15 February review point. Less generously, it was a bit of a tongue twist from Johnson. Government sources have underlined again and again that nothing will be eased until ministers are certain the vaccine programme is advanced enough to allow it. Put simply, they do not want to countenance the possibility of a fourth lockdown or to pull students back out of the classroom once they return. When England unlocks, it will be for good.
“All you will hear every day from any cabinet minister is caution,” one senior cabinet source says. “Every day journalists want to write a new story about unlocking. At the moment there is nothing to say.” Johnson’s tone has markedly changed during this lockdown, with the prime minister far more willing to see off lockdown sceptics. It is not quite true that there are no plans at all – tentative roadmaps are being drawn up in Whitehall that would begin to ease restrictions in March, perhaps some sports or non-essential shops. This time, the prime minister has made a public commitment that the first thing to reopen will be schools and he will face massive pressure from his backbenchers to make that so. It is still possible that some pupils may return in a phased way after February half-term – Johnson was emphatic that journalists should “not assume” it will be Easter. But all of those plans are very much in pencil – though it looks like this week will be critical to examine the direction of the data, as Gavin Williamson has promised schools will be given at least a fortnight’s notice. There will be more and more pressure on Johnson, who likes to please, to set out the path. Conservative MPs are starting to clamour to see that roadmap – and the clamour will become a roar as the 15 February deadline approaches. The ambition of “lockdown until there are no more lockdowns” is straightforward, but there are obvious threats. The most dangerous is that there is a new variant that is resistant to the current vaccine – either one that develops in the UK which remains a distinct possibility given the amount of virus still in circulation in the UK. Or it could be one imported from abroad.
Though scientists are confident that the current vaccines could be tweaked to provide protection against a new strain, it would significantly set back the jabs programme. The fear of a new variant abroad is the key driver for the UK to re-examine its border policy – and why cabinet ministers such as Priti Patel and Matt Hancock are pushing for a blanket strategy of quarantining all travellers. Rishi Sunak, who has been the driver behind many decisions to keep the economy as open as possible, is also in favour of a harder approach – though the chancellor wants to see a specific plan for how the hotel quarantine measures will end before he gives it his firm backing in the cabinet meeting on Tuesday. The vaccination programme is the UK’s most precious asset. It is in the Treasury’s interests to also make sure the strategy of “the lockdown to end all lockdowns” works. There are many who will say this strategy comes a year too late."
2021-01-25T13:45:04Z,politics,Politics,English schools not expected to start fully reopening until at least March,"Schools in England are not expected to start fully reopening until at least early March, Downing Street has indicated, as Tory MPs and children’s advocates pressurised Boris Johnson to set out a timetable for the process. The government has promised to reassess lockdown measures on 15 February, and Johnson’s spokesperson said this would be the point at which the evidence would be examined to see if any easing could take place. The spokesperson also reaffirmed Gavin Williamson’s pledge to give schools at least two weeks’ notice of reopening, meaning it would be March before the process could begin. The comments came after the prime minister said he would examine “the potential of relaxing some measures” connected to lockdown once the top four categories of vulnerable adults had had their first Covid-19 vaccination, due to happen by mid-February. “It has always been our intention to ease restrictions when we can from that point on the 15th, and schools are obviously our top priority,” Johnson’s spokesperson said. “We will undertake the review on the 15th. Then we will set out what happens post the 15th.” Asked whether the two-week notice period was confirmed, he said: “You’ve got what Gavin Williamson said yesterday about ensuring we give a two-week heads-up before we can open schools.” Earlier on Monday, the 70-strong Covid Recovery Group (CRG) of Conservative MPs said ministers must set out a timetable for the process. The children’s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, said that while she accepted that the high coronavirus infection rates made reopening schools difficult, more clarity was needed and there seemed to be a “slight sense of defeatism” over the issue. On Sunday the health secretary, Matt Hancock, refused to commit to either mid-February, after the half-term break, or after Easter as a point for schools to reopen fully. Mark Harper, the former chief whip who now chairs the CRG, reiterated the group’s call for reopening efforts to begin three weeks after the top four priority groups for the coronavirus vaccine have received their first dose. “It seems to us [that] at that point you need to start bringing the economy back to life, and the first thing that needs to be reopened are our schools,” Harper told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “All we’re asking for at this point is for the government to set out that sort of plan, based on milestones, based on evidence, so that school leaders, parents, children, have some hope and know what to expect.” Harper said the government could expect dissent from MPs if it did not take this action. “Set that plan out, and enable us to debate that plan in parliament. I would love the government to set a plan out. I’m not trying to second-guess the government. But if the government doesn’t come forward with a plan, it can’t be surprised if other people will fill the vacuum.” Robert Halfon, who chairs the Commons education select committee and has been an influential voice on the issue, said urgent action was needed. He told Times Radio: “We need to get our teachers and support staff vaccinated. That will make a big difference. But I’m hugely worried about the impact on mental health, on educational attainment, on safeguarding, the longer we keep our schools closed.” Longfield said the long and repeated closures of schools since March had brought about a huge rise in mental health issues among children, with one in six now experiencing problems, and had also widened attainment gaps. “We’re looking at children with sleep disruption, who have lost the ability to cope, who are fearful about their future,” she told Today. “This is a very serious issue for those children, and for their families.” She said families “will need hope and clarity about what comes next”, and she called for a robust Covid testing system for schools, and the possible use of vaccinations. “There is a sort of slight sense of defeatism in the air,” she said of the government’s attitude, arguing that unions and local councils meanwhile believed they could get at least some classes back before too long. “It can be done, and I think that’s what parents need to know now,” she said. “I would like a slide on every No 10 briefing to show progress back to school, to keep parents and children informed.”"
2021-01-25T13:33:17Z,politics,Politics,Scottish Tories would boycott unofficial independence referendum,"Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, has said his party would boycott a Scottish independence referendum set up without the approval of Westminster. Ross said Scottish National party proposals for Holyrood to empower itself to stage a fresh referendum if Nicola Sturgeon’s party wins a majority in May’s election should not be seen as credible or legitimate. He urged Labour and the Liberal Democrats to reject any attempt by the SNP to sidestep the current legal arrangements. Under the Scotland Act 1998, Holyrood can only hold an official referendum after being granted a section 30 order by Westminster. Ross said on Monday that Sturgeon had until now promised she would only support a fresh vote on that basis; it was the process in the 2014 referendum, and one she had described as the “gold standard”. Describing any other route as a “wildcat referendum”, Ross said: “Anything that constitutes [an] unofficial referendum should be boycotted. It shouldn’t be given any credibility. It is again a divisive tactic by the SNP to split our country apart.” He added: “I would take no part in that. And I would hope anyone – not just unionist supporters – but people who support democracy, should not take part in these wildcat, unofficial referendums. “So, yes, I would make that plea to Scottish Labour, the Scottish Liberal Democrats and anyone who believes in democracy in Scotland.” Sturgeon told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that if the SNP won a majority in May’s elections, based on a manifesto commitment to hold a referendum, her party would have a clear democratic mandate. “The polls now show that a majority of people in Scotland want independence,” she said. “If the SNP win the Scottish election in a few months’ time on proposition of giving the people that choice, then what democrat could rightly stand in the way of that?” The SNP published a pre-election blueprint at the weekend proposing that if Westminster ignored the election result and continued to refuse a section 30 order, Holyrood would legislate to hold an indicative referendum itself. This policy, which is likely to trigger legal challenges that would end up in the UK supreme court, is expected to be central to the SNP’s May election manifesto and adds to pressure on the Tories and Labour to offer an alternative. Many Labour MSPs believe the party should support a referendum if the SNP wins a majority – a position rejected by Keir Starmer and the Scottish Labour party’s leadership. Both parties are edging towards proposing a UK-wide constitutional convention or commission but have so far failed to set out their proposals in detail. The former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown added to that pressure on Monday by urging Boris Johnson to set up a constitutional commission to investigate wholesale changes to the UK’s structures. Writing in the Telegraph, he said: “I believe the choice is now between a reformed state and a failed state. [It] is indeed Scotland where dissatisfaction is so deep that it threatens the end of the United Kingdom.” The dispute raises significant questions about the legality of holding a referendum without a section 30 order. Holyrood’s presiding officer would rule on whether the bill was competent; ministers could push it through without that endorsement but then would face a legal challenge in the supreme court. Using public funds to draft the legislation and stage one could also be beyond the Scottish government’s powers Rona Mackay, an SNP MSP, said Ross’s boycott calls were “Trumpian”. She said: “Opposition parties have a right to oppose independence – but they certainly do not have a right to deny the Scottish people the chance to determine their own future. “The Tories are utterly terrified of the verdict of the people, but this Trump-like attempt to deny the results of free and fair elections will not stand.”"
2021-01-25T11:49:56Z,politics,Politics,Labour writes to CPS over 'fraudulent' Tory London mayoral leaflets,"The Labour party’s lawyers have written to the director of public prosecutions alleging that Shaun Bailey, the Conservative party’s candidate for London mayor, used fraud to influence upcoming elections by publishing leaflets headed with fake City Hall insignia. Bailey’s campaign last month drew cross-party condemnation for the leaflets, which said Londoners’ council taxes would rise “if you do not take action” and vote against the incumbent mayor, Sadiq Khan. The leaflets did not explicitly mention the Conservative party. Labour’s complaint called the leaflets a “fraudulent device” to gain undue influence, as described by the 1983 Representation of the People Act. Under the act, Max Hill, the director of public prosecutions, is responsible for making inquiries into potential offences. The London mayoral election has been scheduled for May 2021, a year later than initially planned because of the coronavirus pandemic. Khan is the strong favourite to win. Shaun Bailey’s campaign has faced repeated criticism for its tactics during the long build-up to the mayoral election. In November the campaign published leaflets and a website labelled as “Transport for London bailout facts”, which contained attacks on Khan’s policies, before the “City Hall” leaflets. In both cases the campaign materials did not explicitly mention the Conservative party, only including the legally required reference to Shaun Bailey at the bottom, and the address of the Conservative party’s campaign headquarters. Labour’s lawyers, the London-based firm Edwards Duthie Shamash, wrote that the “City Hall” leaflets were “preventing the free exercise of the franchise of electors”. The letter, dated 21 January and seen by the Guardian, said Bailey’s leaflets were an “attempt to attract the reader’s attention with the pretence that it is issued from the headquarters of the London mayor and the Greater London Authority, such that it is an official communication from a public authority with powers of taxation”. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said: “The Conservative party must immediately apologise for the actions of their London mayoral campaign and demonstrate that they are committed to following the law.” Labour has also written to the British Polling Council, the association of pollsters, calling for the Conservative party to publish evidence for a claim made in a separate email newsletter that “a majority of voters now believe Shaun Bailey will do a better job as mayor” than Khan. The newsletter said the claim was based on “our latest internal polling”, but most publicly available polling has shown leads of 20 points or more for Khan. Karen Buck, the Labour MP who chairs Khan’s re-election campaign, asked the council to try to identify the source of the polling. Members of the body have committed to publishing underlying polling data. Bailey’s campaign has struggled to cut through during the extended campaign. The Conservatives argue that Khan mismanaged Transport for London’s finances before it required a government bailout during the pandemic and blame him for delays to Crossrail. However, Bailey has faced criticism for comments made before he was a candidate that appeared to suggest that poorer people could not be trusted with money, and for suggesting homeless people would have enough money to save £5,000 for a house deposit. A spokesman for Bailey’s campaign said: “We published our leaflet because Londoners have a right to know when their mayor is planning to hike council tax. The government have repeatedly said that Sadiq Khan does not have to raise council tax to fund TfL. So this is Sadiq Khan’s decision – and his alone.” The Crown Prosecution Service confirmed it had received the letter but declined to comment further."
2021-01-25T08:57:48Z,politics,Politics,"UK at risk of becoming failed state, says Gordon Brown","The UK is at risk of becoming a failed state and breaking up unless there are deep reforms of the way the country is governed, the former prime minister Gordon Brown has said. “I believe the choice is now between a reformed state and a failed state,” Brown wrote in the Daily Telegraph. “It is indeed Scotland where dissatisfaction is so deep that it threatens the end of the United Kingdom.” Brown, who was chancellor of the exchequer for 10 years from 1997 and became prime minister in 2007, said many Britons were disillusioned with the way the country was governed by and in the interests of a London-centric elite. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday morning, he accused Boris Johnson and his government of being out of touch. He said: “I do think Boris Johnson has not quite understood how deep the resentment is, how the lack of trust is causing him a problem, a problem about his acceptability in different parts of the country.” On Sunday, polls carried out in the four nations of the UK showed that a majority of voters thought Scotland was likely to be independent within the next 10 years. In Scotland, the poll found that 49% of people backed independence compared with 44% opposed – a margin of 52% to 48% if undecideds are excluded. Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, promised a new referendum on independence if the Scottish National party won another majority in elections to the Scottish parliament in May. Brown said Sturgeon and her party viewed the future of the country “in terms of a battle between Scotland and the rest of the UK” and claimed that Scots were more interested in action to solve social problems than independence. The coronavirus pandemic had exposed divisions between different parts of the UK, Brown said. “You’ve got not only the Scottish first minister but you’ve got the regional mayors saying they are not consulted and listened to, you’ve got the Welsh first minister saying their letters are not even replied to by Boris Johnson, you’ve got no mechanism, no forum for coordinating the regions and nations, and I think that the public are fed up.” Brown called for fundamental constitutional changes led by a “commission on democracy” that would “review the way the whole United Kingdom is governed”. He suggested setting up citizens’ assemblies in the regions of the UK, telling Today: “You can’t have the elites talking to the elites, you have got to involve the people in what you are talking about, and they have got views now on how the pandemic was dealt with, how the recession has been dealt with.” A Sunday Times poll found that 47% of people in Northern Ireland still wanted to remain in the UK, 42% were in favour of a united Ireland, and 11% were undecided. When asked if they supported a referendum on a united Ireland within the next five years, 51% said yes and 44% no. In Wales, where support for independence has been weakest, 23% backed leaving the UK and 31% supported holding a referendum. Brown wrote in the Telegraph: “No country can have national integration without political inclusion, and the commission might start by learning from the experience of countries like Australia, Canada, Germany and America where, partly because of British influence in times past, second chambers are senates of their regions, and minorities who can easily be outvoted are guaranteed a stronger voice.”"
2021-01-25T07:18:59Z,politics,Politics,Coronavirus vaccine: councils to get £23m to encourage high-risk groups to have jab,"The government will provide £23m in funding to dozens of councils in England to help fight misinformation around coronavirus vaccines and to encourage uptake of the jab among more high-risk communities. Councils with plans to contact people from minority ethnic backgrounds, older people and disabled people have been chosen for the financial support, as these groups have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic and are more likely to be dealing with its long-term effects. A number of experts and politicians recently called for people in high-risk minority ethnic groups to be prioritised for immunisation, and for them to be targeted by publicity campaigns aimed at tackling vaccine scepticism. There are concerns about vaccine uptake within some groups, after research showed up to 72% of black people said they were unlikely or very unlikely to have the jab. Meanwhile, a number of BAME community leaders have taken action in the fight against vaccine hesitancy, with Qari Asim, the chair of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, and a number of other Muslim leaders telling the Guardian they had started a campaign to encourage BAME communities to get vaccinated. Their activism has included hundreds of mosques recently using Friday prayers to spread coronavirus awareness and combat myths around vaccinations. Local councils and voluntary organisations will use a community champions schemes to communicate accurate health information, using outreach techniques such as helplines, school programmes and workplace engagement. They will also phone people in at-risk groups, as well as hosting training sessions to help people provide information and advice in an effort to expand networks of local champions. Community champions schemes are in place across various parts of England. The backing of local leaders and advocates to “communicate public health messages with credibility and impact” was one of a number of recommendations issued by the government’s Race Disparity Unit (RDU) advisory group in October.
The funding will also go towards supporting outreach campaigns working with Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities, the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, said. Jenrick warned in a statement that “false information about Covid-19 vaccines could cost lives”, and he said the central government money would allow local authorities and community groups to build on their existing campaigns to provide people with accurate information. The vaccine deployment minister, Nadhim Zahawi, said: “We want all communities to take up the offer of a free vaccine.” He said he had been working alongside faith and community leaders to “ensure those who may be at higher risk of harm from this virus know how they can benefit from a vaccine”. According to Office for National Statistics figures up to late July, the Covid death rate for black African men in England and Wales was 62 per 100,000, compared with 12 per 100,000 for white men. The rate for men from Bangladeshi backgrounds was 61 per 100,000."
2021-01-25T07:00:08Z,politics,Politics,More than 2m people could use postal votes in Scotland elections,"Scottish electoral officials believe upwards of 2 million people could use postal votes if Holyrood elections take place in May, to avoid using polling stations during the Covid pandemic. Scotland’s councils and electoral bodies have said the parliamentary election on 6 May could be held safely if the pandemic remains under control, but senior officials have told the Guardian it will present significant and costly logistical challenges. Polling by the Electoral Commission, the UK’s elections regulator, has found that up to 68% of Scotland’s 4 million voters could opt for postal votes – nearly four times the normal number, adding significantly to the cost of staging it.
Scotland’s political parties are planning to promote postal voting heavily among their supporters and target voters in the next few weeks to minimise the risk from the pandemic and mitigate the impact on turnout. It is understood the UK Labour party is considering a similar campaign for the English council, mayoral and police and crime commissioner elections, borrowing the “vote early” slogan used in the recent US elections. Both the UK and Scottish governments say publicly all elections planned across England, Wales and Scotland can be held as scheduled on 6 May, but privately doubts are being voiced about whether it will be possible. Some council leaders are worried about the significant costs and health risks of staging an election, and have asked the umbrella body for the country’s 32 councils, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, to assess whether it can be safely carried out. Many council officials work from home, greatly increasing the organisational challenges of organising 2m postal votes, and those of running the election as a whole. A number of Labour politicians have called for the Holyrood elections to be postponed, arguing the uncertainties of the pandemic, the costs and logistics, and the risks that voter turnout could be heavily affected if some areas are hit by fresh Covid outbreaks. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, said on Friday the election could still be safely held and pointed to the recent US elections successfully taking place. New legislation allows the Holyrood election to be held over two days, for the count to take longer or for a six-month delay, if necessary. Scotland’s rate of Covid deaths and hospitalisations during the latest wave has been the lowest of all four UK nations, but in a subtle shift of tone, Sturgeon acknowledged on Friday that changes or postponement could be necessary.
As a contingency plan, the Scottish parliament’s official dissolution has been postponed until 5 May to allow MSPs to reconvene for an emergency session if the Covid crisis means changes to the election are needed. Normally, Holyrood would be dissolved in late March. “If there’s any change made to the timing of the election or to the rules of conduct, it’s really important that those are not decisions for the government of the day alone, it would be a cross-party decision and one that involves [Holyrood’s] presiding officer as well,” Sturgeon said. Two opinion polls of Scottish voters carried out by the Electoral Commission since last August found that while 77% of voters could use polling stations if the right safety measures were in place, 23% would prefer a postal vote. That is in addition to the 18% of electors who usually vote by post. Of voters who use polling stations, 61% said they would switch to a postal ballot if they were encouraged to do so, increasing the total number who could register for an absentee vote to about 2.7 million people. It has alarmed council officials. It would mean registering 2 million extra voters for absentee ballots, checking their identities, and then printing, posting and validating their ballots. The Electoral Commission believes 3-5% of those votes could be spoilt by voters incorrectly filling out the forms, potentially invalidating up to 135,000 votes."
2021-01-25T00:01:06Z,politics,Politics,Uncertainty over 12-week Covid jab interval intensifies as UK rollout expands,"Experts have called for greater clarity about the monitoring in place to assess the 12-week dosing interval for Covid vaccines, as the UK’s vaccination programme ramps up. According to government data released on Sunday, a total of 6,353,321 people in the UK have received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine. A further slew of vaccination centres are due to open on Monday to speed up delivery of the jabs. These include at the Crick Institute in London, the Blackpool Winter Gardens, Lancaster town hall, Bath racecourse and the Black Country Living Museum, where scenes for the TV show Peaky Blinders were filmed. “These 33 new major vaccine centres will bolster our existing network and enable the NHS to protect as many people as possible in the coming weeks,” said the vaccine minister, Nadhim Zahawi. However, there is continued controversy about the government’s decision to increase the interval between the two doses of the jabs to up to 12 weeks in an effort to offer protection to as many people as possible. While there is some evidence from trials that a 12-week gap does not reduce the efficacy of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, Pfizer has said it has no data on whether protection after the first dose is sustained beyond three weeks. The British Medical Association is among those voicing concerns, saying the gap between doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab should be reduced to six weeks. But others have defended the shift towards a longer interval, saying it is evidence-based and is the best option once the risks and benefits are weighed up. Prof Anthony Harnden, of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said the committee believed the approach was the right way forward. “Hopefully not only will this strategy get more people immunised and protect the vulnerable elderly and save thousands and thousands of lives, it may in the end give protection to the population as a whole,” he told Sky News on Sunday. Harnden added that data from the Moderna vaccine, which is based on a similar approach to the Pfizer/BioNTech jab, produced 90% immunity in participants two months after receiving one dose. The comment could be a reference to a JCVI document that showed the efficacy of the Moderna jab reached 80% among almost 1,000 people followed up between one and 108 days after their first dose, and just over 90% when assessing Covid cases at least 14 days after the first jab. However, the document urged caution. “There appears to be some protection against Covid-19 disease following one dose; however, these data do not provide sufficient information about longer term protection beyond 28 days after a single dose,” it stated. The British Society for Immunology (BSI) said that while it accepted the rationale for the 12-week dosing interval in the current circumstances, there needed to be greater clarity about how the potential effect of this interval was being assessed, noting that while Public Health England had published a Covid-19 vaccine surveillance strategy, details about how the immune response is to be monitored remained unclear. “We are assured studies are ongoing, but whether they are the types of studies as a body of immunologists we’d like to see there is still a question mark,” said Dr Doug Brown, the CEO of the BSI, adding that such studies were important in order to explore how best to use the vaccines now and in the future. Others have gone further, calling for large randomised control trials to be set up to explore how different dosing schedules might affect issues ranging from the long-term effect on Covid-related hospital cases to the potential impact on long Covid. While the UK’s vaccination programme continues to expand, concerns have been raised that distribution around the country is far from equal. According to figures from NHS England, the Midlands has so far delivered more than a million first doses of Covid jabs – the first region to do so – with the north-east and Yorkshire hot on its heels with 905,794 first doses administered. However, London continues to lag behind all other regions, having delivering just 586,559 first doses so far. Last week the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, told the Guardian that “the government’s original distribution formula meant that London missed out on its early fair share of the vaccine”. However, despite Khan saying Zahawi had promised supply and distribution would increase, the Department of Health and Social Care later cast doubt on plans to change the distribution formula. “Vaccines are being distributed fairly across the UK – including London – to ensure the most vulnerable are immunised first, and all GPs will continue to receive deliveries as planned,” it said."
2021-01-24T12:14:12Z,politics,Politics,Sturgeon: SNP will hold Scottish independence vote if it wins in May,"Nicola Sturgeon has said she will hold an advisory referendum on independence if her Scottish National party wins a majority in May’s Holyrood elections, regardless of whether Westminster consents to the move. Her party is setting out an 11-point roadmap for taking forward another vote, which was to be presented to members of the SNP’s national assembly on Sunday. Scotland’s first minister told BBC One’s Andrew Marr show on Sunday morning: “I want to have a legal referendum, that’s what I’m going to seek the authority of the Scottish people for in May and if they give me that authority that’s what I intend to do: to have a legal referendum to give people the right to choose. That’s democracy. It’s not about what I want or what Boris Johnson wants.” Signalling a new approach, which moves beyond the current impasse of Johnson’s repeated refusal to countenance a second vote, the roadmap states that if the SNP takes office after May, it will request from the UK government a section 30 order, which under the Scotland Act 1998 allows Holyrood to pass laws normally reserved to Westminster. The document states that “there could be no moral or democratic justification for denying that request” and that if the UK government did adopt such a position it would be “unsustainable both at home and abroad”. It adds that if agreement were not forthcoming from Westminster, the SNP government would introduce and pass a bill allowing a “legal referendum” to take place after the pandemic, and would “vigorously oppose” any legal challenge from the UK government. Four-nation polling for the Sunday Times has found that a majority of voters in Scotland and Northern Ireland want referendums on the breakup of Britain. Sturgeon told Marr: “The polls now show that a majority of people in Scotland want independence. If the SNP win the Scottish election in a few months’ time on proposition of giving the people that choice, then what democrat could rightly stand in the way of that?” The plan has been welcomed by those within the SNP who have pushed for an alternative strategy on independence, rather than relying on Westminster permission to go ahead with a second vote. Some believe it would be possible for Holyrood to hold a consultative referendum without overreaching its powers. Asked by Marr about the ongoing Holyrood inquiry into her government’s handling of sexual harassment complaints against the former first minister Alex Salmond, Sturgeon insisted she did not mislead the Scottish parliament as her predecessor has suggested. She said: “There are false conspiracy theories being spun about this … by Alex Salmond, by people around him, you can draw your own conclusions about that … but what is forgotten in all of that are the women who brought forward these complaints. “At the time I became aware of this I tried hard not to interfere with what was going on and not to do anything that would see these swept aside. The Scottish government made mistakes in the investigation of that and that’s part of the subject of the inquiry, but I didn’t collude with Alex Salmond and I didn’t conspire against him.” Later on Sunday, a spokeswoman for Salmond responded: “The two inquiries under way are into why Nicola Sturgeon’s government acted unlawfully. Alex has submitted his evidence as requested and the parliamentary committee is now challenging the Crown Office to produce some of the text messages which they believe are being suppressed. The evidence, if published, will speak for itself.”"
2021-01-24T11:55:25Z,politics,Politics,UK vaccine adviser says delay of Covid second dose will save lives,"A representative of the UK’s vaccine advisory committee has defended its decision to delay giving people a second dose, saying it will “save many lives”, as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, warned lifting restrictions was “a long, long way off”. Prof Anthony Harnden, of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said the evidence was still in favour of delaying the dose, after a small Israeli study on people over the age of 60 suggested a first dose gave just 33% protection from coronavirus. The JCVI has suggested doses should be given 12 weeks apart in order to give the maximum number of people some protection while supplies are limited. Pfizer, which manufactures one of the vaccines being administered in the UK and is also the provider of vaccines in Israel, has said it has tested its vaccine’s full efficacy only when the two doses were given up to 21 days apart. Meanwhile, ministers are preparing to announce tough new border measures to stop new variants of coronavirus from abroad scuppering the advances of the UK’s vaccination programme. Reports suggest they may stop short of requiring all travellers to quarantine in government facilities. Speaking on BBC One’s Andrew Marr show, Israel’s health minister, Yuli Edelstein, said there had been debates within his ministry about delaying the second dose. “I’ll be very honest, we had debates about it in the ministry. And we decided to follow the instructions given by Pfizer. There were different opinions on that in Israel too. But as we have very little information at that stage … So we decided to stick to the instructions we get from Pfizer. “We are just at the beginning of the [vaccination] campaign. We do see cases of people that after getting the first dose still get sick with the coronavirus. At the same time there are some encouraging signs of less severe diseases, less people hospitalised after the first dose, so at this stage it’s very difficult to say. We really hope that we will have better information in the near future.” Edelstein said his country would look to vaccinate “very high numbers, probably to 80%,” before the country would consider it had herd immunity and restrictions would be lifted. Harnden, the deputy chair of the JCVI, said the committee was examining the Israeli data in detail but the picture was not definitive. Speaking to Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Harnden said it had concluded in the case of the Pfizer vaccine that there was “no real evidence that a second dose gave you substantially longer and better protection … We do believe you should have a second dose but we do believe that that can be delayed.” He said of the Oxford vaccine that “it may be that the longer you leave the second dose, the better protection you have”. He added: “The Israeli data is preliminary data. It does involve PCR testing, which is of course asymptomatic cases as well as symptomatic cases. They have not followed up for more than three weeks and the statistical methods they used are not clear.” Harnden said the committee still believed a delayed second dose would “save many lives nationally”, saying the UK would begin to see a decline in hospital admissions and deaths a few weeks after the first four priority groups had been offered their first dose of the vaccine. Hancock reiterated that there was “a high degree of confidence” that delaying the second dose would save more lives. “In a situation where there is a limited supply … you want to get as many people to have as much protection as possible as quickly as possible.” Three-quarters of all those over 80 in the UK have been vaccinated, the health secretary announced.
He told Ridge the government was a “long, long, long way” from being able to lift coronavirus lockdown restrictions in England, and he refused to commit to schoolchildren being back in class by Easter. “We have got to look at the data, we have got to look at the impact of the vaccination programme,” he said. The government is expecting to meet to discuss new border measures on Monday, as fears grow about the spread of new variants. Hancock said there were 77 known cases of the South African variant in the UK, all linked to travel, and nine cases linked to one of the Brazilian variants. “The new variant I really worry about is the one that is out there that hasn’t been spotted,” he told Sky News. “There’s probably those elsewhere that simply haven’t been picked up because the country doesn’t have that genomic sequencing service.”
Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, said Labour had been “pushing the government to take tougher measures at the border since last spring”. She said: “Scientists tell us that there are a number of countries where these strains are emerging that just simply do not have the capacity to map what is happening. So it’s not just countries who have identified the strains of the virus we ought to be careful about, actually what we’re likely to be seeing, even if we haven’t identified it, is strains emerging all over the world. “On Monday we’ve got this delayed announcement yet again delayed. We would fully expect the government to bring in tougher quarantine measures, we would expect them to roll out a proper testing strategy and we would expect them as well to start checking up on the people who are quarantining.”"
2021-01-24T09:15:41Z,politics,Politics,English council chiefs back postponement of May local elections,"A further postponement to this year’s local elections, in the wake of the continuing difficulties caused by the Covid pandemic, is backed by the vast majority of senior council figures across England, the Observer can reveal. Only 11% of the senior officials dealing with the forthcoming elections believe they should go ahead in May as planned, despite the government’s determination to press ahead. More than two-thirds (69%) believe the huge set of elections should now take place in the autumn, according to the most comprehensive survey of council chief executives, leaders and officers in charge of organising elections to be conducted on the issue. A further 14% called for a shorter delay to the summer and 6% backed a postponement beyond this autumn, according to the analysis by the Local Government Information Unit (LGIU). Of the more than 350 officials who responded, two-thirds said they were “very concerned” about holding elections in May. Difficulty recruiting and training electoral workers, complications in ensuring safety of polling stations and concerns that voters worried about Covid-19 may be disenfranchised are among the concerns expressed by those drawing up local election plans. One Conservative council leader said: “It will be a grave error not to act early and announce a delay now.” Another Tory council leader said: “Go for the end of July or October: don’t tempt fate with May, only to have to call them off. I am really concerned about vulnerable candidates.” The postponement of 2020’s local elections in England has meant this year’s were to be the biggest in years. They include county councils, district councils, unitary authorities, mayoral races, police and crime commissioners, and the London assembly. Elections also take place for the parliaments in Scotland and Wales. Decisions over those elections are controlled by their respective devolved governments. The Scottish government has said it is still planning for elections to go ahead, but has emergency powers to delay or to hold polling over more than a day. The Welsh government has said that it intends to proceed in May, but that “significant uncertainty” around the pandemic means a delay may be needed. Boris Johnson has backed holding elections in May but has suggested he is keeping the decision under review. However, it is understood that the serious concerns among councils about the practicalities of proceeding with the poll have been made clear to Robert Jenrick, the housing, communities and local government secretary. Four-fifths of those surveyed by the LGIU (80%) were concerned about their ability to recruit and train electoral workers, with fewer volunteers likely to come forward. Difficulties in obtaining polling and count venues have also emerged, while the usual use of schools as polling stations is also proving contentious. Some traditional polling venues are also being used as vaccination centres. “We will not get all the staff we need and we will be lucky to get the venues for polling and/or counting,” said one electoral administrator. “You can throw as much PPE at the polls as you like, if people do not want to volunteer to work, we can’t run the elections.” Some insiders expressed concern about the democratic problems created by a further delay. After elections were delayed last May, some councillors and mayors will have exceeded their original mandate by 18 months if voting is delayed until autumn. Some local councillors have already stood down in their area because they could not serve beyond the scheduled end of their tenures last year. Jonathan Carr-West, the chief executive of the LGIU, said: “Local government is committed to democracy, but the overwhelming view from councils is that it is no longer possible to hold safe and open elections in May. The logistical challenges are formidable and there’s a real risk that we effectively disenfranchise millions of people who do not feel safe going to the polls. “The worst scenario of all would be for government to push ahead only to have to make a U-turn late in the day, when councils will already have spent a fortune in money and time preparing. Better to take a bold decision now to delay the elections and use the additional time to ensure they can be run safely. Such measures should include the vaccination of poll workers and an expansion of postal voting. Public confidence in elections is an essential foundation of our democracy – once lost, it takes years to rebuild. That risk is not worth taking.” • This article was amended on 28 January 2021 to refer to the Scottish and Welsh “parliaments”, not “assemblies” as an earlier version said."
2021-01-23T19:00:24Z,politics,Politics,'A Brexit nightmare': the British businesses being pushed to breaking point,"Christophe Fricker lectures in German at the University of Bristol and adores living in England. He was born in Germany but his anglophilia became so strong after moving here that he wrote a book called 111 Gründe, England zu lieben (“111 Reasons to Love England”) in 2018. He selected the gardens of Cornwall, the National Portrait Gallery, the way the English use collective nouns for groups of animals (herds, packs, and so on) and their fascination with murder cases in his varied list of reasons for loving this country. But since 1 January, Fricker has been reminded that there are also worrying things about life in England – and being outside the EU is now chief among them. Having run short of copies of his book to distribute to friends, Fricker contacted his publishers in Berlin a few days ago to ask them to ship over some more. The company was keen to help but said that, as a result of new rules, regulations and costs resulting from Brexit, it had decided not to export any more books to the UK at all, not even 111 Reasons to Love England. For someone born in Germany but who had come to feel very much part of his adopted homeland, it was a jolt – a small but powerful demonstration of what living outside the European club of nations will really mean. “If you erect barriers, then people are going to be affected on both sides of them,” Fricker says. “The promise from those who supported Brexit was that nothing was going to change afterwards. That was obviously ludicrous. “My concern is not so much about my book, but that if there are problems with cross-border trade, it becomes more difficult for small businesses to operate – in this case to trade cultural goods – so the business will all go to huge companies like Amazon.” Less than a month after the UK finally left the European single market and customs union – amid claims from Boris Johnson that its people and its businesses were now free to live and trade as they wished – UK companies that export to the EU, and EU ones that send goods here, are beginning to realise that the reverse is true. And so are their customers. It is not just British fishing crews who now cry betrayal, as they find themselves unable to sell their fresh fish into EU markets because of delays at ports. Nor is it the famous musicians who warned in the Times last week that visa restrictions will endanger the EU touring ability and livelihoods of many performers and crews across the already hard-hit creative sector, who will suffer most. Rather, it is millions of hard-working people running, and employed in, less romantic and exotic small businesses who are feeling utterly let down and wondering if their companies will even survive. Take Andrew Moss, who is managing director of a small company called Horizon, based in Ely, Cambridgeshire. He employs 37 people and sells packaging and point-of-sale marketing displays in this country, and also exports to the EU. His annual turnover is around £3.5m. He describes his company as part of the “engine room” of the British economy – one of the almost 6 million UK small businesses (defined as those employing less than 50 people) – that account for most of the UK’s GDP. The last three weeks, he says, have been a living nightmare. “Soft Brexit – there is no such thing. This is horrific,” he says. “We celebrated the Brexit deal with champagne over Christmas but when we woke up and realised that this car crash was happening, we thought, oh my God!”
The problems he has encountered since 1 January are many, including more forms and several extra Brexit-related charges for exporting into the EU that will eat into profit margins. For small firms, the extra costs hit proportionately harder as every small consignment attracts a charge. But over the past three weeks he – like others – has had to confront another huge, potentially existential, problem resulting from Brexit that came out of the blue, and in a dark moment made him think of shutting the company down a fortnight ago. He discovered from customers in Europe that they were being asked by couriers to pay VAT upfront on the goods he was sending to them – as a condition, in effect, of getting customs clearance – and the customers, unsurprisingly, were refusing. Previously, when the UK was in the EU and during the transition period, Moss and other small businesses did not charge VAT on customers in other EU countries. But EU rules on third countries dictate that VAT must now be paid before goods are received from the UK. Moss could not believe what was happening. Loyal customers were being told to pay around 20% extra on top of the quoted price for his goods before they could get hold of them. Of course, if this continued, they would look elsewhere for cheaper suppliers. What could he and other business managers do? Moss had three options – and none would be easy. First, he could bite the bullet and pay the VAT himself on behalf of customers in the EU. But this would mean running at a huge loss and was not possible for the long term. Second, he could stop all exports to the EU – but this would reduce the size of his business overnight and mean that years of hard work finding customers abroad had been for nothing. Or third, he could set up and register a company in the EU, ship all his goods out once a week to avoid the delays and individual Brexit-related payments, and distribute his goods from there. The European branch of his company could then pay the VAT and claim it back from the government of whichever EU member state it was based in. To Moss, this looked the best option, albeit one that would involve short-term costs and effort. As he pondered what course to take, Moss contacted his local MP, Lucy Frazer, warning her that if no help was offered he would have to “sack lots of people”. Frazer put him in touch with a civil servant in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) who knew nothing whatsoever about the VAT problem. “It was a complete surprise to him,” said Moss. But the civil servant did refer him on to a senior trade adviser in the Department for International Trade.
“This guy talked complete sense,” said Moss. “What I said to him was, have I got another choice [other than to set up a company abroad]? He confirmed that he couldn’t see another way. He told me that what I was thinking of doing was the right thing, that he could see no other option. He did not see this as a teething problem. He said he had to be careful what he said, but he was very clear.” Moss has moved fast, and in the past fortnight has settled on a two-part strategy. In the short term, to keep his customers happy, he will pay the VAT bills himself, writing big cheques every week. But as he can’t afford to do that for long, he has decided to establish his own company in the EU – Horizon Europe – in the Netherlands. He has identified a site and hopes it will be ready for use in six weeks. But he knows it will mean downsizing at home and laying people off. “If I have got to recruit two people in Holland, and let two people go here, that hurts,” he says. “I have been in touch with other companies in the last week that have exactly the same issues. It will be affecting thousands of companies.” Moss is, indeed, far from alone. Geoffrey Betts is managing director of Stewart Superior, a company in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, which deals in office supplies. He too has decided to set up a new company in the Netherlands, for the same reasons. “When the government said it had secured free trade it was obvious it was nothing of the sort,” says Betts. VAT problems, new charges on moving goods and more bureaucracy all added up to an “administrative nightmare” which left him with no choice. The only way to avoid the Brexit barriers was to operate inside them, to move back into the single market. “If you don’t, you are screwed in so many ways,” he says. Betts also talked to trade advisers from the Department for International Trade, who gave the same advice as they gave to Moss. “The adviser I spoke to said it was a can of worms, and he thought that would be the best move,” says Betts. “It is all going to be hugely damaging to the UK economy because if we can’t move our goods across Europe without all this palaver, a lot of companies will be in very serious trouble. Someone needs to sort this out in government – and quickly.” Others have adopted different but equally drastic ways out. Gyr King is chief executive of a company called King & McGaw based on the south coast at Newhaven. It has a turnover of £8m-£10m, selling framed fine art prints online to the public, and to big museums in the UK and abroad. Over recent days, King has decided to stop – or, as he puts it, “switch off” – all sales to the EU because of post-Brexit shipping delays, new administration charges and VAT demands. It all amounts, he says, to a “disaster”. In King’s view, there are two types of problem that Brexit has foisted on businesses. “One is that shippers’ systems are in disarray,” he says. “There is confusion about the forms they have to fill out, which leads to delays. The shippers are not delivering in anything like the timescale they were before. We have got customers waiting for packages that were shipped before Christmas, and these problems may or may not be resolved, we don’t know.
“Then there are more fundamental issues, including additional charges that exporters now face, VAT charge points, and rules of origin, where there does not seem to be an easy solution. A significant amount of what we sell at the moment will not be possible to ship because the customers will not pay for these extra costs.” There is yet another problem, he says, coming in the other direction. “We are hit both ways. We are not receiving the raw materials from the EU that we normally do because of similar problems the other side. So the whole thing has become blocked.” Everywhere, different problems are hitting different businesses. UK businesses importing from the EU are also reporting having to pay additional VAT. Last Wednesday, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, appeared before a parliamentary select committee and faced questions about how trade between Northern Ireland and the UK was functioning post-Brexit.
The Democratic Unionist MP Ian Paisley told him that the first 20 days of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain since the Brexit deal had been an “unmitigated disaster”, and that he knew of companies in Northern Ireland which were losing £100,000 a week because of border delays and extra checks at the ports. He was speaking to the same Brandon Lewis who had tweeted on 1 January that there would be no new border checks. “There is no ‘Irish Sea Border’,” Lewis said then. “As we have seen today, the important preparations the Govt and businesses have taken to prepare for the end of the Transition Period are keeping goods flowing freely around the country, including between GB and NI.” During the committee hearing, Lewis again seemed partly in denial, suggesting that problems with trade to Northern Ireland had as much to do with Covid-19 as Brexit. For entrepreneurs such as Moss, this is just part of a pattern in which Tory politicians who backed Brexit never told the truth about it. As he contemplates setting up his new operation in the Netherlands – investing his money in the same single market that the government has just torn his country out of – all Moss wants is honesty. “After everything, I just want somebody to tell me [admit] that Brexit is not about making Britain great again, not about empowering us, not about giving us back our sovereignty. Brexit is about the engine room of Britain investing significantly in Europe.” • This article was amended on 24 January 2021 to correct the spelling of Christophe Fricker’s surname.

2021-01-23T19:00:24Z,politics,Politics,"Move to EU to avoid Brexit costs, firms told","British businesses that export to the continent are being encouraged by government trade advisers to set up separate companies inside the EU in order to get around extra charges, paperwork and taxes resulting from Brexit, the Observer can reveal. In an extraordinary twist to the Brexit saga, UK small businesses are being told by advisers working for the Department for International Trade (DIT) that the best way to circumvent border issues and VAT problems that have been piling up since 1 January is to register new firms within the EU single market, from where they can distribute their goods far more freely. The heads of two UK businesses that have been beset by Brexit-related problems have told the Observer that, following advice from experts at the Department for International Trade, they have already decided to register new companies in the EU in the next few weeks, and they knew of many others in similar positions. Other companies have also said they too were advised by government officials to register operations in the EU but had not yet made decisions. Andrew Moss, who runs Horizon Retail Marketing Solutions, based in Ely, Cambridgeshire, which sells packaging and point-of-sale marketing displays in the UK and to EU customers, is registering a European company Horizon Europe in the Netherlands in the next few weeks, on the advice of a senior government adviser. This will mean laying off a small number of staff here and taking on people in the Netherlands. Referring to discussions with a senior DIT adviser on trade, Moss said: “This guy talked complete sense. What I said to him was, have I got another choice [other than to set up a company abroad]? He confirmed that he couldn’t see another way. He told me that what I was thinking of doing was the right thing, that he could see no other option. He did not see this as a teething problem. He said he had to be careful what he said, but he was very clear.” Moss said it was now clear that Brexit was not about winning back control from the EU but investing in it to survive. Geoffrey Betts, managing director of Stewart Superior Ltd, a company in Marlow, Bucks, which sells office supplies to UK and continental customers, said he had also decided to set up a company in the Netherlands for the same reasons. He had also spoken to an official at the Department for International Trade before making his decision and received the same advice. “When the government said it had secured free trade, it was obvious it was nothing of the sort,” said Betts. VAT issues, new charges on moving goods and more bureaucracy all added up to an “administrative nightmare”, he said. By moving operations into the EU and shipping out large consignments from the UK to their new European operations, the businesses can not only avoid cross-border delays and costs on every single small consignment they send, but can also defuse VAT problems that are currently hitting them and their European customers hard. The spokesperson from the Department for International Trade said: “This is not government policy, the Cabinet Office have issued clear guidance, available at gov.uk/transition, and we encourage all businesses to follow that guidance. We are ensuring all officials are properly conveying this information.” Yesterday, as the impact of leaving the single market and customs union on 1 January became ever more clear, the Financial Times reported that the cost of a £12 bottle of wine in UK shops could rise by up to £1.50 a bottle because of the extra bureaucracy and charges affecting imports.
In a further blow to the government’s idea of “global Britain” after Brexit, the chances of signing a swift UK/US trade deal also appeared to be ebbing away after President Joe Biden’s nominee for Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, made clear the president had other more pressing domestic economic priorities than international trade deals. Rachel Reeves, shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said: “Once again we see this government’s sheer incompetence and lack of planning holding British businesses back and slowing our economic recovery. “They’ve got to get a grip on this now and stop leaving our businesses out in the cold.”"
2021-01-23T13:05:06Z,politics,Politics,Welsh Tory leader quits after drinking during Covid alcohol ban,"The leader of the Conservatives in the Welsh parliament has quit after he was seen drinking in the Senedd during a pub alcohol ban. Paul Davies insisted he had not broken any rules but that the fallout from the news meant “I simply cannot continue in my post”. His colleague and chief whip, Darren Millar, also said he was stepping down. They were among politicians seen drinking four days after pubs in Wales were banned from serving alcohol. The incident triggered an investigation in the Senedd, which found that five people, four of whom were members, were involved in a possible breach of Covid regulations. In a statement, Davies said he was “truly sorry” for his actions, acknowledging that they had “damaged the trust and respect I had built up over 14 years in the Welsh parliament with my colleagues and the wider Conservative party but more importantly with the people of Wales”. He said he believed his actions were becoming a distraction from holding the Welsh government to account and he would resign with immediate effect. Davies said the group had consumed “some alcohol with a meal we heated up in a microwave, which was a couple of glasses of wine on the Tuesday and a beer on the Wednesday. I broke no actual Covid-19 regulations.” He added: “We did not have to be escorted out of the building as some reports have suggested.” He said the Conservative group in the Welsh parliament had initially resisted his decision to resign. “Yesterday I indicated to the Conservative group in the Welsh parliament that I wished to resign, but they urged me to reflect further, and we agreed to meet again on Monday,” he said. “However, for the sake of my party, my health and my own conscience, I simply cannot continue in post.” In a statement, Millar said “social distancing was maintained throughout these working dinners” and it “simply did not occur to either me, my colleagues or the catering team that the arrangements may have been inappropriate”. Millar, who has been the MS for Clwyd West since 2007, said that while he had been told he did not breach coronavirus regulations, he was “very sorry” for his actions, “especially given the impact of the tough restrictions that people and businesses are enduring”. “For this reason, and given that Paul Davies has resigned as Welsh Conservative group leader in the Senedd, I have decided to step down from my frontbench role in the Welsh parliament,” he said. “I am cooperating fully with ongoing investigations and will continue to do so.” He added that he wanted to apologise to his family, colleagues and constituents for any embarrassment caused from media reports of the incident. It comes as Public Health Wales announced a further 1,079 cases of coronavirus had been recorded in the country, taking the total number of confirmed cases to 186,915. The health body reported 27 further deaths, raising the country’s coronavirus death toll since the start of the pandemic to 4,486."
2021-01-23T08:28:21Z,politics,Politics,"Cheshire cheesemaker says business left with Â£250,000 'Brexit hole'","A commercial cheesemaker in Cheshire has been left with a £250,000 Brexit hole in his business as a direct result of the UK’s departure from the EU on 1 January. Simon Spurrell said he has lost 20% of his sales overnight after discovering he needed to provide a £180 health certificate on retail orders to consumers in the EU, including those buying personal gift packs of his award-winning wax-wrapped cheese worth £25 or £30. He says he had hoped to take part in the “sunny uplands” promised by the government post-Brexit but has instead seen the viability of his online retail come to a “dead stop”. “Our business had high hopes of continued growth in the EU market, after seeing the avoidance of the no-deal and announcement of a free trade deal. “What has only become clear in the last week is that our successful B2C [business to consumer] online sales to EU consumers is now impossible to operate,” he said. To save his business he will now have to switch a £1m investment he was planning to make in a new distribution centre in Macclesfield to the EU, with the loss of 20 jobs and tax revenue to the UK. “It is a real shame because that means I’m now going to invest in France, provide French employment, and then contribute to the EU tax system, which was pretty much going against the whole reason that we were meant to be leaving.” As small businesses up and down the country come to terms with the new and complex export red tape, Spurrell explained that he thought he was fully prepared for Brexit and had consulted with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the National Farmers’ Union along the way. He knew he would need customs declarations and health certificates signed off by vets to get his cheese into the EU after 1 January, and has successfully been getting pallets of the product across the Channel to wholesale customers. But what he had not anticipated was the requirement for health certificates to accompany online orders from private customers. “It’s as if someone forgot to negotiate this part of the deal, they forgot that there needed to be an exemption or allowance for the direct consumer sales. “We ship to the USA, Canada, Norway, etc, all non-EU countries; we have never had a problem with at all. It is an oversight in the agreement that does not affect EU producers at all, but is a dead stop for all UK producers selling into the EU via online sales,” he added. In an indication that neither the EU or the UK had time to translate the trade deal into practical guidance for business, Defra said it was continuing to “engage with the European commission and the EU member states to ensure that we share a common understanding of the EU’s export rules and how they should apply”. Defra said it had worked hard to ensure UK businesses were not disadvantaged by the deal and that the farming and food minister Victoria Prentis would now be in contact with Spurrell and Defra officials to discuss further. It also revealed that the number of vets or food-competent certifying officers now trained to issue the European health certificates had risen “from 600 to 1,500 and this number continues to grow”. Sabine Weyand, the director general of trade at the European commission and Michel Barnier’s former deputy in the withdrawal agreement negotiations, posted a tweet in English saying “help us to help you”, with a link to a page on the EU’s Access2Markets website explaining “how to report a trade barrier”. Spurrell’s Cheshire cheese company in Macclesfield and Hartington Creamery in Derbyshire turn over more than £4.3m a year and employ 25 people, and he planned to double staff numbers with a new fulfilment centre in March. “I would be looking to employ another 20 people on top of the 25 we have now,” he said. “So, a substantial investment which we now have to review. I am still shell shocked by what has happened.” Spurrell said he voted remain but had come to accept Brexit. “I am a positive person and always make the best of a bad situation and we thought, ‘Right, well let’s get used to this, let’s go with it. Let’s take on Europe from the UK,’ and that’s what we tried to do until 4 January when it was just every parcel was coming back,” he said. His experience is being repeated right across the country with courier companies refusing to take small packages of animal or food originated products. John Arbon Textiles in Devon was told by its courier company that its knitting wool, spun from local sheep fibres, would no longer be accepted with hauliers now trying to mitigate the risk of one package in their van or lorry causing their entire load to be delayed because they are missing a health certificate. A government spokesperson said “there is extensive advice available to support businesses as they adjust to the new arrangements” and it was “vital” that traders ensured they had the correct paperwork for exports."
2021-01-22T19:20:29Z,politics,Politics,Scottish parliament orders prosecutors to release Salmond leak evidence,"The Scottish parliament has ordered the country’s prosecution service to release key evidence in the Alex Salmond affair, in a dramatic escalation of a battle over the non-disclosure of legal papers. In an unprecedented move, Holyrood issued an enforcement notice on the Crown Office instructing it to release private messages from senior Scottish National party officials and documents about the leak of allegations that Salmond had sexually harassed two civil servants – allegations he denies. The notice, under section 23 of the Scotland Act 1998, follows months of stalemate involving the Scottish government, the Crown Office and Salmond himself and a special Holyrood committee set up to investigate the government’s botched handling of an internal inquiry into the allegations against him. The letter from Holyrood’s chief executive and clerk, David McGill, has given the Crown Office, headed by the lord advocate, James Wolffe, seven days to comply. Linda Fabiani, a Scottish National party MSP who chairs the committee, said: “This is a step that hasn’t been taken lightly, and is a first for this parliament, but which the committee felt was needed as it continues its vital work.” Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s acting leader, said: “At every turn, the SNP government has sought to hide vital material from the committee in a vain effort to leave it a toothless entity; a talking-shop without power. Enough is enough – the secrecy must end.” The documents cover WhatsApp messages sent or received by Sue Ruddick, the SNP’s chief operating officer, and ministers, officials and special advisers in the Scottish government between August 2018, when news of the government investigation into Salmond was leaked, and January 2019. That month Salmond won a judicial review ordering the government to quash the findings of its internal inquiry. However, he was then arrested and charged with 14 offences, chiefly involving alleged sexual assaults and attempted rapes. In March 2020, Salmond was acquitted of all charges, following a two-week jury trial. Leaks of messages sent by Peter Murrell, the SNP’s chief executive and Nicola Sturgeon’s husband, implied he wanted to put the police under pressure to pursue Salmond – an allegation Murrell has denied. Salmond alleges the messages involving Ruddick suggest collusion. Sturgeon has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing by the party or her officials. Salmond too has been accused by committee members of stalling. After refusing two successive requests to give evidence, citing health and legal concerns, the committee told him on Friday he must appear by 5 February. The committee has also again written to the Scottish government, asking it to finally release its legal advice on its prospects for winning the judicial review, after ministers and the lord advocate refused to comply with two Holyrood votes requesting the disclosure. Documents released to the committee disclose the government’s external counsel threatened to quit after senior civil servants suggested they would not admit defeat in the case. The government was later ordered to repay £516,000 worth of legal fees to Salmond, in addition to its own legal costs of some £60,000. Murdo Fraser, a Conservative MSP on the committee, said: “The committee has consistently been blocked from performing its remit by SNP ministers. The level of obstruction has been extraordinary.” The Crown Office said it would respond to the request “in early course” but that it had already told the committee there were potential legal constraints on releasing the material. Crown counsel “must consider whether producing [the] documents sought would be contrary to the public interest”, a spokesperson said."
2021-01-22T15:45:22Z,politics,Politics,Netherlands to supply medical cannabis until July despite Brexit ban,"The mother of a nine-year-old boy with a severe and rare form of epilepsy who was told Brexit would end the supply of a life-changing cannabis medicine that saved her son’s life has been given a six-month reprieve. Hannah Deacon said she was hugely grateful after being given the lifeline by the Dutch government, which has sanctioned continued supply of the medicines despite a Brexit ban on fulfilling prescriptions from the UK. She received a letter on Thursday from the Department of Health to inform her that the government in the Netherlands, where the medicine was created, had “confirmed that they will allow continued supply of Bedrocan oil against UK prescriptions for existing patients until 1 July 2021”. “I cried when I read it. I sat and cried. I was told online and I was quite surprised to be honest. I’ve spent the last two weeks terrified that Alfie’s seizures will recur because of the fact that we could not get any more Bedrolite [Bedrocan]. I didn’t feel that the Department of Health took it seriously enough to keep that medicine supply line safe so I was very angry about that, and very upset,” she said. Her campaign to save her son Alfie Dingley’s life in 2017 led to a change in the law enabling the medicine, which has helped him become seizure-free after years of 150 seizures a week, to be prescribed in the UK.
The life-saving breakthrough came after a meeting between Deacon and the minister for public health, Jo Churchill, was set up after publicity surrounding her case in the Guardian and the BBC. She had been given just two weeks’ notice by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) that due to the end of the transition period, “prescriptions issued in the UK can no longer be lawfully dispensed in an EU member state”, leaving her desperately frightened about her son’s future. “I spoke to this minister about three times … I do feel she is empathic and I do think she understands and I am grateful, but the fight is not over,” she said, as the Dutch decision only gives her a six-month lifeline.
There are 41 other families in the UK with children in similar conditions treated by the same medicine, and only one other has been able to get a prescription on the NHS, which costs £2,000 a month. “There is still huge problems so this is a small victory and my son is safe and that’s what matters to me, but at the same point I’m very acutely aware that there’s many other people still suffering,” she said. “Giving these families an NHS prescription would save the NHS millions of pounds if you think about how much intensive care treatment costs. “Some of them have children on palliative care before they started Bedrolite and now they are not, but these families should have the right to just enjoy their children, rather than having to worry every month where the money’s coming from,” said Deacon. She said she was determined to keep the pressure up on Churchill to find a permanent solution for everyone affected. A Department of Health spokesperson confirmed an agreement had been struck with the Dutch government “on the supply of Bedrocan oil to UK patients, which will bring relief to the families who depend on these medicines. “We are grateful to the Dutch government for working with us closely and quickly on this solution, which will last until 1 July. We are exploring more permanent solutions to ensure people who need these treatments can continue to access them.”"
2021-01-22T15:16:01Z,politics,Politics,Labour calls for more customs agents to cope with Brexit red tape,"The government must quadruple the number of customs agents in the UK to ensure businesses struggling with mountains of Brexit red tape do not “buckle” under the strain, Labour has said in a letter to Michael Gove. The shadow chancellor for the duchy of Lancaster, Rachel Reeves, put it to Gove that industry figures showing that only 12,000 customs agents have been trained fell far short of the 50,000 the government accepted last February would be necessary to cope with Brexit. “Can you please … inform me what the government is doing to address this shortfall as swiftly as possible, so that businesses don’t have to deal with even more disruption?” she wrote. Reeves’ letter comes as hauliers, freight forwarders and existing customs agents say businesses are struggling with the new trading regime. Customs agents are the private operators who are contracted to do the paperwork for businesses and are separate to the army of officials recruited by HMRC to check the documents are in order. Last February, Gove told the Commons he would stand by his pledge to recruit the estimated 50,000 agents needed within six months. But in December, Bloomberg reported (£) that the £84m fund to train the agents was running dry despite the need for them at the end of the Brexit transition period. “What steps are the government taking to address this, and how will it support businesses as they grapple with huge amounts of new red tape and disruption?” Reeves wrote. “It is in the interests of us all for British business to thrive under the new UK-EU trading relationship. As hauliers and the industries they support buckle under unprecedented red tape through no fault of their own, they need a plan of practical support from the government urgently.” In the past, the government has estimated 147,000 businesses who trade internationally have no prior experience of customs because they have only sold goods to EU states. Several businesses told the Guardian they have had to wait days for a response from HMRC to customs queries. Others have told how businesses went into Brexit with little clue as to how complicated the new customs declarations, regulatory and transit certification and VAT rules would be. Colin Jeffries, a freight forwarder, said it was “absolute carnage”, with customers not knowing what they needed to do to trade and EU hauliers rejecting UK deliveries because of new requirements for financial guarantees for lorry-loads of goods. A Conservative party source said: “Rachel Reeves is being misleading, because as she knows the government made no such promise. Labour under Sir Keir Starmer spent the last four years seeking to overturn the 2016 referendum result, and trying to block Brexit, opposing our plans to take back control of our borders and arguing we were spending too much money on preparations.”"
2021-01-22T11:13:26Z,politics,Politics,Sunak has little choice but delay plans to reduce budget deficit,"It is hardly surprising that Rishi Sunak is uncomfortable about the amount of money the government is borrowing. No chancellor would be relaxed about presiding over a budget deficit that has already hit £270bn in the first nine months of the current financial year and is on course to hit £400bn – or about 20% of national output – by March. There have been years when the UK has borrowed as much as it will in 2020-21, but only in wartime. In peacetime, what has happened since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic is unprecedented. Sunak’s problem is that there is not much he can do about the government’s spiralling deficit – or at least not without hindering the economy’s chances of recovery once curbs on activity are eased. When it comes to deciding when and how restrictions will be eased the chancellor will be just one – albeit important – voice around the cabinet table. All the signs so far suggest that the government will be much more cautious about opening up the economy than it was last year after the first wave of the pandemic. That clearly has consequences. As the latest Office for National Statistics figures show, a tightening of the rules as December wore on resulted in a less than bumper Christmas for retailers: sales volumes rose by only 0.3% after a 4.1% drop in November. And, with the enforced closure of non-essential retail stores, the January figures are likely to be even worse. A breakdown of the public finances data shows that the big change over the past year has been the increase in public spending rather than the fall in tax revenue. The budget deficit was £28bn higher in December than it was in December 2019, of which £26bn was the result of rising central government spending. The current indefinite closure of large chunks of the economy means that the bill for the furlough scheme – just under £5bn in December – will rise.
Budget day is 3 March but Sunak will have to decide what is in his package of measures by the middle of next month, so it can be costed by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. By then it is unlikely that many – or perhaps any – of the lockdown restrictions will have been lifted, so it would be a colossal gamble to announce an immediate withdrawal of support, no matter how uncomfortable the size of the deficit makes him feel. An alternative – and much less risky – approach would be to announce plans to reduce the deficit on 3 March but delay the actual measures until 2022. Sunak would not be the first chancellor to heed the words of Saint Augustine: Lord make me chaste, but not yet."
2021-01-22T08:33:31Z,politics,Politics,Ministers consider paying £500 to everyone with Covid in England,"Ministers are considering paying £500 to everyone in England who tests positive for Covid-19, in a dramatic overhaul of the self-isolation support scheme, the Guardian can reveal. The proposed change is thought necessary because government polling found only 17% of people with symptoms are coming forward to get a test, owing to fears that a positive result could stop people from working. The universal payment is the “preferred position” of Matt Hancock’s Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and would cost up to £453m a week, 12 times the cost of the current system, according to an official policy paper seen by the Guardian. The 16-page document, dated 19 January and marked “Official Sensitive”, also proposes that police should be given access to health data for the first time to crack down on quarantine breaches.
Another recommendation is ending the £500 one-off payments to close contacts of infected people and instead rolling out nationwide self-testing, so that those who test negative can return to work. The revamped self-isolation support scheme was drawn up by Hancock’s team to be considered by the government’s coronavirus operations committee, chaired by Michael Gove, which is expected to meet on Friday. The UK recorded another 1,290 deaths on Thursday and 37,892 new positive cases, and there is uncertainty about whether the current restrictions will do enough to bring the pandemic under control. Boris Johnson pointedly refused to be drawn on when lockdown measures could be lifted, raising fears that the regime may not ease for months. Financial support for people who need to self-isolate is critical to the government’s coronavirus strategy because the disease will continue to spread unless infectious people and their close contacts go into quarantine for 10 days. However, there have been concerns that the scheme unveiled by the prime minister four months ago is excluding many people who cannot afford to self-isolate, meaning they are torn between losing earnings or spreading the disease. The overhaul has been prompted by Cabinet Office polling indicating that only 17% of people with symptoms are coming forward for testing, according to the policy paper. It said: “Wanting to avoid self-isolation is now the single biggest reported barrier to requesting a test.” A separate survey carried out for the DHSC, discussed in the report, found that only one in four people reported compliance with self-isolation, with 15% going to work as normal. At present only those on a low income who cannot work from home and receive one of seven means-tested benefits are eligible for the £500 test-and-trace support payment (TTSP), excluding many small business owners, sole traders, self-employed workers and parents whose children have been told to self-isolate. Councils are given an additional pot of “discretionary” funding, but figures released by Labour this week showed that three-quarters of applicants were being rejected. An official review of the scheme has concluded that it excludes too many people, has created a “postcode lottery” around England, and that only one in four of those eligible have received financial support – about 50,000 people in total – because the application process is too complex. It proposes four options to expand the programme. The most generous is paying £500 to anyone who tests positive. The report says: “Anyone who tested positive for Covid-19, irrespective of their age, employment status or ability to work from home, would be eligible for TTSP. This would be straightforward for local authorities to administer, though it would lead to significantly greater volumes of applications than under the current scheme.” Describing the universal payment as “the preferred DHSC position,” officials estimate it would cost up to £453m a week if there were 60,000 cases a day – 12 times the current cost of £36.5m a week. It would cost £340m a week if there were 45,000 infections a day, as at present.
A second option is paying the lump sum to those who test positive and cannot work from home, costing up to £244m a week. The third option is paying those earning less than £26,495 a year or on means-tested benefits, at a cost of £122m a week. The fourth proposal is keeping the current system but “significantly” expanding the discretionary funding to councils. The policy paper says “a more radical approach” would be paying people their usual earnings instead of a £500 lump sump, but it would be difficult to assess the earnings of those on zero-hours contracts, agency workers and the self-employed and therefore that option is not recommended. The proposal to end £500 payments to the close contacts of infected people and instead introduce regular nationwide at-home lateral flow testing would save the government £79m a week if cases were at 60,000 a day, according to the report. However, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has cautioned against using self-tests as a “green light” to avoid self-isolation. Any nationwide scheme would need to be clinically approved. Another proposed change likely to be controversial is to give individuals’ health data to the police to prove that someone has tested positive for Covid-19, making it easier for them to be prosecuted. In October, it emerged that police could request information about whether someone was supposed to be self-isolating, but “no testing data or health data”. The official paper says the current enforcement approach is “difficult to implement” and that police should be given health data to distinguish between people who have tested positive and those required to self-isolate because they are a contact.
It adds: “Contrary to previous assurances given to the public, this will mean sharing health data (ie an indication of who has tested positive for Covid-19) with the police if someone is reported to have breached their legal duty, but this is considered a necessary and proportionate measure – and data-sharing agreements will provide that the information is not used for any other purposes.” On Friday morning, the environment secretary, George Eustice, told Sky News the plan was “under review”. “We do need people, if they are asked to self-isolate because they have been contacted through our test and trace, we do need them to self-isolate,” he said. “No decisions have been made on this. But this is a dynamic, fast-moving situation with the pandemic.” A DHSC spokesperson said they would not comment on leaks, but said: “We are in one of the toughest moments of this pandemic and it is incumbent on all of us to help protect the NHS by staying at home and following the rules. “All local authorities costs for administering the test-and-trace support payment scheme are covered by the government, and each authority is empowered to make discretionary payments outside of the scheme. Fifty million pounds was invested when the scheme launched, and we are providing a further £20m to help support people on low incomes who need to self-isolate. “We also recognise the impact of the pandemic on people’s mental health and wellbeing which is why mental health services have remained open throughout the pandemic.”"
2021-01-21T20:24:30Z,politics,Politics,Two helpings of Priti Patel is pretty much no help at all | John Crace,"Boris Johnson spoils us. Up until last week, the home secretary had been kept away from the Downing Street press conferences since a disastrous appearance last May. Now we get Priti Patel twice in two weeks. But then the prime minister didn’t have a lot of choice, given that he clearly didn’t fancy taking Thursday night’s himself. Matt Hancock is self-isolating, Dominic Raab appears to have taken a vow of silence, and Gavin Williamson had all but handed in his resignation letter during a car crash series of interviews during the morning media round. Then perhaps Patel wasn’t such a bad choice after all. Not because she had anything very important to say, but precisely because she didn’t. Few politicians match her ability to fill dead air with a series of disconnected sentences that leave most people none the wiser by the time she comes to a stop. Ideal for a press briefing with minimal news content that has to be extended to 40 minutes to keep up appearances. The home secretary did more or less just fine when she was reading from her prepared statement. Nearly 5 million people had been vaccinated so far, she wanted to counter disinformation that the vaccine wasn’t safe, 1,290 people had been reported dead in 24 hours, the NHS was under pressure and she was bringing in a new fine of £800 for the minority of people who insisted on still having house parties. Patel made it sound as if the few people breaking the rules were entirely responsible for the pandemic rather than any mistakes on the government’s part. She then handed over to Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, and Dr Vin Diwakar, NHS England regional medical director for London, who pretty much repeated what she had already said with a few examples thrown in. So far so good. It all began to unravel a bit when the questions began. The BBC’s Vicki Young wanted to know if England was likely to extend its lockdown as Northern Ireland had just done and whether the home secretary was pleased that Boris had finally got round to her way of thinking on enforcing stricter border controls for visitors from other countries. Patel could sense danger and she activated her default setting of mindless filler. We were in the middle of a terrible pandemic. The vaccine was a good thing. It was far too early to say when the lockdown would end, even though the government had actually promised a review in the middle of February that everyone had always known was absurdly optimistic and had only been been introduced as a possibility to keep the Coronavirus Research Group headbangers vaguely onside. It also appeared to have slipped Patel’s mind that earlier this week – perhaps anticipating a messy and damaging public inquiry – she had knifed Johnson in the back by claiming she had wanted stricter border controls back in March but had been overruled by the prime minister. So she ignored that bit of the question and went back on to repeat. We were in the middle of a terrible pandemic. The vaccine was a good thing. It was far too early to say when the lockdown would end etc etc. The home secretary did much the same when asked whether people should think about booking summer holidays. We were in the middle of a terrible pandemic. The vaccine was a good thing. It was far too early to say when the lockdown would end and people should be concentrating on staying home rather than thinking of travelling. And by the way the emergency services were doing an excellent job.
To break things up, and perhaps because even she realised that she didn’t have anything more to say, Patel regularly invited further contributions from Hewitt and Diwakar but they didn’t have much to add to what they had already said. Beyond Hewitt asking the government to get the police higher up the vaccination priority list and Diwakar saying that the NHS was under such strain that he couldn’t conceive of planning more than two weeks in advance at the moment. So the idea of people booking summer holidays was a massive category error.
There was time for Patel to dismiss quarantine hotels as “speculative” – if the home secretary doesn’t know what government policy is, then who does? – and to brand vaccine queue-jumpers as “morally reprehensible” but she came unstuck right at the end when asked why the UK had the worst death rate, and whether the government’s own actions had been a major factor in this. Unlike at the weekend when she had tried to argue that other countries counted dead people differently, Priti Vacant went back to her customary diversionary tactics of semi-coherent rambling. We were in the middle of a terrible pandemic. The vaccine was a good thing. It was far too early to say when the lockdown would end. Every death was a tragedy. Perhaps the repetition was a comfort to her, but most listeners had nodded off by the time she closed with the assertion that at all times the government had been guided by the science. There are many scientists – including an increasingly vocal Patrick Vallance – who would beg to differ. But for Patel it was job done: a press conference that had contributed little to public understanding. Onwards and sideways."

Priti Patel, the home secretary, has announced new Â£800 fines for people who attend house parties in breach of lockdown rules. Speaking at the No 10 press conference, she said: Next week we will be introducing a new Â£800 fine for those attending house parties, which will double for each repeat offence to a maximum level of Â£6,400. These fines will apply to those who attend illegal gatherings of more than 15 people in homes. The science is clear: such irresponsible behaviour poses a significant threat to public - not only to those in attendance, but also to the wonderful police officers who attend to shut down these events. The power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland has decided to extend its lockdown until 5 March. At a news conference Arlene Foster, the first minister, said: The executive today has reviewed the current restrictions and agreed that they remain an appropriate and necessary response to the serious and imminent threat posed by Covid-19. Following a detailed outline from health highlighting continuing pressures on hospitals and intensive care units and the emergence of highly-transmissible variants the executive has agreed that the restrictions will be extended for four weeks until March 5 2021. Glastonbury 2021 is officially cancelled, the festivalâ€™s organisers have announced. The UK vaccination programme has recorded its best day so far, with 363,508 people vaccinate, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has said.
A year of the Covid-19 pandemic has wiped out a decade of progress in reducing unemployment in Britainâ€™s industrial heartlands and left the jobless rate higher than after the financial meltdown of the late 2000s, a report has found. A mandatory requirement that electronic tags be worn by international arrivals for up to 10 days to ensure they abided by Covid-19 quarantine restrictions was an option explored by the Home Office under controversial plans, the Guardian has learned. Covid outbreaks are slowing delivery of the vaccine to some care homes in England as GPs postpone jabs in infected facilities, the Guardian has learnt.

2021-01-21T16:09:15Z,politics,Politics,No 10 takes relaxed view as Biden removes Churchill bust from Oval Office,"Downing Street has said it is up to Joe Biden how he decorates the Oval Office, after it was reported that a bust of Winston Churchill, lent by the UK government, has been removed. “The Oval Office is the president’s private office, and it’s up to the president to decorate it as he wishes,” Boris Johnson’s official spokesman said, adding: “We’re in no doubt about the importance President Biden places on the UK-US relationship, and the prime minister looks forward to having that close relationship with him.” Johnson’s relaxed attitude is in marked contrast to his criticism of Barack Obama, when the former president moved the Churchill bust aside. Writing in the Sun in 2016, Johnson, then London mayor, and the author of a Churchill biography, called Obama’s decision a “snub,” suggesting it may have been because of “the part-Kenyan president’s ancestral dislike of the British empire”. A bust of Mexican American labour rights leader Cesar Chavez was visible in pictures of Biden signing executive orders on Wednesday. The prime minister, who was referred to by Donald Trump when he was president as “Britain Trump”, is keen to strike up a strong working relationship with the socially liberal Biden, who the government hopes will attend the G7 meeting in Cornwall in June. Johnson’s spokesman was forced to field a string of questions about whether Johnson is “woke”, after the shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, described Biden as a “woke guy,” referring to his support for Black Lives Matter and trans rights. Asked about her comments on Wednesday, Johnson appeared uncomfortable, before remarking that there was, “nothing wrong with being woke”. When the prime minister’s spokesman was asked whether Johnson would consider himself “woke”, he said: “You would have to define that, but you’ve got the PM’s views on what he believes, and specifically on his agenda to level up across the country, and ensure that everybody has the opportunity to succeed.” The Conservatives believe publicly rejecting socially liberal policies such as the removal of historic statues with colonial connections will help them to score points over Labour. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, has said he will legislate to prevent historic statues being removed, “at the hand of the flash mob” or by a “cultural committee of town hall militants and woke worthies”.
Johnson’s remarks about Obama, made during the buildup to the Brexit referendum, caused a furore. It subsequently emerged that Obama had simply moved the bust of the wartime leader – a loan from the UK government – to a spot in his personal residence. When Theresa May rushed to Washington in early 2017 to be the first world leader to visit Trump in the White House, he swept her into the Oval Office to show that Churchill had been restored to prominence."
2021-01-21T15:47:11Z,politics,Politics,"Crisps lorry held up for two days by Northern Irish Brexit checks, MPs told","A lorryload of potato crisps destined for a Northern Ireland supermarket was held up for two days because of Brexit checks, MPs have been told. The Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin made the claim at the Commons public accounts committee (PAC) as the Labour party was told of the “disastrous” impact of the Northern Ireland protocol. Hauliers told the shadow chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, Rachel Reeves, that Northern Irish Brexit checks had caused shortages of food, deliveries of equipment to the NHS and farm machinery, despite claims by Boris Johnson it was all going “smoothly”. However, officials told the PAC that Brexit operations were running much better than anticipated in Dover with no holdups on the Kent roads and 200 lorries turned away over a two-day period. Emma Churchill, the head of the government border and protocol group, said 636 drivers had been fined £300 in on-the-spot penalties over the past three weeks over the new Kent access permit required to get into the county in order to cross the Channel. She was speaking as research by the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply found that 60% of firms reported delays to shipments going from the EU to Britain. The data around port operations comes amid tales of behind-the-scenes chaos, job losses and financial burdens in Northern Ireland appearing overnight because of Brexit. “A lorryload of potato crisps was held up for two days because the haulier couldn’t prove the potatoes … had not been imported into the UK from somewhere else,” Jenkin told the committee. An ardent supporter of Brexit, he said the “whole point of the protocol was to prevent goods at risk of entering the Republic of Ireland”, not to check items that would remain in Northern Ireland. “This is ridiculous, this isn’t a threat to the single market. There is no purpose in applying the union customs code to these goods,” he said. At issue is the overnight introduction of EU rules on goods travelling to Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Richard Burnett, the chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, said the income of Northern Ireland hauliers and freight companies had dropped an estimated £20m since 1 January. “These are not teething problems. These are structural problems,” he said in response to a statement by the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, that many of the problems would be ironed out during the six-month grace period. Uel Nesbitt, who runs a freight transport operation in Northern Ireland, said politicians in Westminster did not have a clue. He said the choke points were not the ports, whether Belfast or Dover, but the ports and distribution centres where goods were not even getting on to lorries because paperwork was not in order. “People are not listening to us. If it’s coming from the top that it’s all fine, that’s what they think. We had the prime minister saying yesterday things are all sweet and dandy. Well he hasn’t got a scooby doo of what’s going on. Come up here, Boris Johnson, and see for yourself because it is a complete car crash,” said Nesbitt.
Hauliers in Northern Ireland are urging the UK government to try to renegotiate the interpretation of the protocol. Burnett said extending the grace period, as some have suggested, was just “kicking the problem down the road”. One haulier, John Esler, told the Labour briefing that the overnight change had been devastating. His income has dropped 40% in the past three weeks. “Northern Ireland did not vote for Brexit. I did not vote for Brexit. But I suspect our current secretary of state did, Michael Gove did, Boris Johnson most certainly did – but they ignore us. “If we do not get help, it will be P45s by Easter. It is as blunt as that.” Others blamed the two false starts for Brexit, claiming that meant British companies had not got ready for the Northern Ireland protocol which had been agreed a year before the trade deal. A government spokesman said: “We are aware of specific issues related to moving mixed food loads, known as groupage, and new guidance is coming soon, following a successful trial with industry.”"
2021-01-21T12:48:31Z,politics,Politics,4.6m people in UK given Covid vaccine amid pressures for tougher lockdown,"The UK has now given doses of the coronavirus vaccine to 4.6 million people, Matt Hancock has said, as he came under pressure to consider tougher restrictions given concerns that cases of the virus may not be falling. Answering an urgent question in the Commons, the health secretary said more than 5m doses had been given, also counting more than 400,000 second injections. “This virus is a lethal threat to us all and, as we respond through this huge endeavour, let’s all take comfort in the fact we’re giving 200 vaccinations every minute,” said Hancock, who was appearing from home, as he is self-isolating after being alerted by the test-and-trace app this week. Of older care home residents, 63% had now been vaccinated, he added. But Hancock was pressed on possible new restrictions after an Imperial College London study based on swab tests from more than 142,000 people across England between 6 and 15 January suggested that while new infections may have fallen recently they could be stable or even growing slightly. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary who now chairs the Commons health select committee, asked whether the UK should enforce new arrivals to the country to quarantine in hotels, end mixing outside households and bubbles, and follow Germany in mandating full protective filter masks in shops and on public transport. Hancock said: “We have looked at the question of PPE with respect to the new variant and the clinical advice I’ve received is the current guidelines are right and appropriate.” Speaking for Labour, the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, sought updates on whether it was known if newer variants of the virus, such as that identified in South Africa, could hamper the efficacy of vaccines. Hancock said the “early indications are that the new variant is dealt with by the vaccine just as much as the old variant”. Ashworth pressed Hancock on the Imperial survey, calling it “alarming”, and asking why, given infections were so high in London, the capital and the east of England seemed to be lagging in vaccination numbers. “Yesterday the prime minister referred to ‘constraints in supply’,” Ashworth said. “What are these constraints, what guarantees has he got from manufacturers that they will be resolved, and by when?” Hancock replied only that he had acknowledged supply could limit the vaccination programme, and that there was at time “a lumpy supply schedule”. He said: “The manufacturers are working incredibly hard to deliver the supply as fast as possible, and I pay tribute to them and their work, but it is challenging and therefore it isn’t possible to give certainty as far out as many GPs and those delivering on the ground would like – because the worst thing would be to give false certainty.”"
2021-01-21T12:47:48Z,politics,Politics,Firm linked to Tory donor Lord Ashcroft wins £350m Covid contract,"A company linked to the Conservative party donor and former treasurer Lord Ashcroft has been awarded a contract worth £350m by the government to provide laboratory staff for the Covid-19 testing operation. The contract, awarded to Medacs Healthcare plc, which has an ongoing contractual “framework agreement” with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and provides locum doctors, nurses and other staff to the NHS, is one of the largest awarded to any company throughout the pandemic. Medacs Healthcare plc is owned by the Impellam Group, a company chaired by Lord Ashcroft, which provides staff for healthcare and a range of industries in the UK and other countries, including India, Australia and New Zealand. In its most recent annual report, for 2019, Impellam declared global revenues of £2.25bn, saying it was the largest provider of locum doctors to the NHS and “the largest supplier of specialist healthcare managed services outside of the US”. Ashcroft is the non-executive chairman of the Impellam Group, which owns Medacs, and he personally owned more than half of Impellam’s shares until 2010. He transferred a majority of shares from his personal ownership in April 2010 to Lombard Trust, which now owns 56%. According to the announcement made by Impellam at the time, Ashcroft’s children and grandchildren were the Lombard Trust beneficiaries. The DHSC contract with Medacs, which started on 18 December, is for the provision of “laboratory worker personnel for the NHS test and trace programme”. It is stipulated to run for two years, with the maximum payable, depending on demand for Medacs’ staff, £350,402,831. Medacs is an existing contractor to the NHS under a framework agreement agreed in 2015, which runs until 7 February this year. The agreement approves 64 suppliers, including Medacs, to provide doctors, nurses and other staff to the NHS. Framework agreements enable the government to carry out due diligence on suppliers in advance, enabling individual contracts to be agreed without a competitive tender each time. The government has spent billions of pounds during the pandemic under existing framework agreements or emergency regulations that have waived the requirement for competitive tenders. Questions have grown about the connections some companies awarded contracts have had with the Conservative party. Ashcroft has longstanding connections with the party; a former treasurer and deputy chairman, he donated more than £11m to the Tories up to 2010. He then paused his financial support, but resumed again recently, contributing £100,000 last year to the Tory candidate for the London mayoral election, Shaun Bailey. Made a life peer in 2000, Ashcroft was the subject of a political storm when he confirmed that he was still a “non-dom,” meaning his permanent home was not in the UK, so he did not pay UK tax on overseas earnings. He remained in the House of Lords until 2015, then resigned his seat, but kept his peerage. Ashcroft’s spokesman said that he was not involved in the negotiation of Medacs Healthcare’s £350m contract with the DHSC, and did not know about it until after it had been awarded. The spokesman declined to answer any questions about Lombard Trust, or Ashcroft’s current residency arrangements, saying they are irrelevant to the award of the DHSC contract to Medacs Healthcare. Elizabeth David-Barrett, professor of governance and integrity at the University of Sussex, said it was good practice for the government to have framework agreements with companies, and they could ensure good value for the public. However, she argued that improved processes were needed to manage the perception of potential conflicts of interest. “The public has good reason to ask whether the current system for regulating conflicts of interest is fit for purpose,” she said. “We can ask whether a major Conservative party donor should be able to benefit from winning business from a Conservative government, and the government should provide clear assurances that those connections played no part in any contract award.” Impellam said the company “has not benefited from any connections that any non-executive may hold,” and that the value of the contract includes wages of scientific and support staff who will be delivering the services. “The non-executive directors do not have any involvement in the award of contracts or the operational, day-to-day management of the company.” A DHSC spokesperson said that the framework agreement was concluded with Medacs Healthcare after a full open market competition, saying: “Proper due diligence is carried out on all government contracts.” The DHSC’s contract with Medacs was first reported by openDemocracy and the non-profit investigations organisation, The Citizens."
2021-01-20T17:56:32Z,politics,Politics,Johnson's moment of truth offers gnomic relief in sub-par PMQs | John Crace,"Maybe everyone knew that all eyes were on Washington. Both to watch out for any last-minute hissy fits or dodgy pardons from Donald Trump and to follow the inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Or maybe Keir Starmer has finally got fed up with never having his questions answered by Boris Johnson and has given up trying. Whichever it was, this was one of the more low-key and least satisfying prime minister’s questions. Even the tech seemed to be having a day off in sympathy. The SNP leader, Ian Blackford, had his second question delayed as his Zoom connection died. The Tory MP Nicola Richards couldn’t work out how to unmute herself, and by the time she did, she was unable to hear what was going on in the chamber. She wasn’t missing much. Neil O’Brien couldn’t work out how to switch off his phone, and the sound of children shouting could be picked up on at least two other remote questions. These were the biggest dramas of the day, missed only by the increasingly affected Desmond Swayne, who appeared to remain unconscious for most of the session. Starmer started promisingly by reminding Boris, who had only bothered to mention Biden, that the inauguration of Harris as the first woman – and a woman of colour at that – as vice-president was an equally historic moment. He then went on to challenge Johnson on the number of criminal investigations that had been put in jeopardy and how many files on convicted criminals had been deleted after the cock-up with the police national computer 10 days ago. “We don’t know,” said Boris, in what may have been one of his first honest and truthful answers he had ever given at PMQs. A rare moment, which on another day might have drawn greater surprise. Still, Keir persisted with a further three questions to demand exact figures on the data lost – something over 400,000 files – and a time when the data would be restored. Manually, if necessary. “That depends on how long it takes,” Johnson replied. Gnomic, certainly, but possibly only the second time he had given an honest and truthful answer. He didn’t know much about the progress of the data loss and didn’t really seem that bothered by it. His main expression was one of surprise that Starmer was making such a big deal over something he regarded as fairly trivial. You got the feeling that Starmer would have happily gone on about the police national computer system for much longer – these things probably matter more to a former head of the Crown Prosecution Service – but he belatedly switched to comments the home secretary had made the night before. Apparently, Priti Patel – clearly wanting to get her defence in early for any forthcoming inquiry – had said she had called for all borders to be closed last March, but had been overruled by the prime minister. A decision that might have cost tens of thousands of lives. Ah, said Johnson. He couldn’t remember Labour calling for borders to be shut back in March – carefully ignoring the fact that Starmer didn’t become leader of the party till April, and that the scientific data wasn’t widely shared with the opposition – and he announced proudly that the UK now had some of the strictest border controls. What he forgot to mention was that these new controls had only just come into operation this month and that it had been his natural instinct throughout the pandemic to do as little as possible. By now, though, Starmer had used up his six questions and was wondering why he hadn’t put his time to better use by asking why the UK had the highest coronavirus death rate in the world, how much supply of the vaccine we actually had, and why the rollout was so slow in some parts of the country. So Boris was free to do what he always does at the end: abuse the Labour leader for being “Captain Hindsight” and a “weathervane”. So much for the “kind and civil” language Johnson had been talking up on Monday. Allegra Stratton, the prime minister’s spokesperson, later excused Boris on the grounds that his words were not “unpleasant” but a “description”. Just think of the accurate descriptions Starmer would now be free to use, if he wanted to lower the tone. Sometimes you just long for him to shake off his leash and say what he really thinks. A mess. A shambles. A liar. A narcissistic charlatan. Pathologically unfaithful. And that’s all before we get on to his mishandling of the pandemic crisis. That would certainly liven up PMQs. Blackford dragged up Theresa May’s Daily Mail article in which she had accused Johnson of abandoning the UK’s right to the moral high ground of global politics by threatening to abandon the international aid budget, but Boris pretty much ignored this. Moral questions have never unduly detained him, not even ones of genocide, as he sidestepped his government’s refusal to adopt the Lords’ amendment to the trade bill that specifically addressed this issue. People just had to trust him to do the right thing, he said. Even though most people have learned never to take Johnson at his word. No one looked bothered when the session ended. It had been a sub-par performance all round, something that always plays to Johnson’s strengths. But for the rest of the afternoon all eyes would be on the US, where integrity and decency were making a welcome comeback. It would be nice to think the same could happen here one day."

Downing Street has ruled out changing the vaccine priority list to give the police priority ahead of the over-50s - an idea floated by Patel this morning. (See 2.47pm.)

2021-01-20T13:45:52Z,politics,Politics,'Absolute carnage': EU hauliers reject UK jobs over Brexit rules,"A British freight company director with more than 20 years’ experience has told how EU hauliers and transport companies are turning their backs on UK business because they are being asked to provide tens of thousands of pounds in guarantees to cover VAT or potential tariffs on arrival in Britain. The financial guarantee requirement did not exist before Brexit and EU transport companies who previously provided a shipping service for small and medium-sized firms have decided they do not want the extra financial burden, according to Colin Jeffries, who runs Key Cargo International in Manchester. “We’ve got people that are trying to bring textiles in from Italy but we are being told there is no haulage availability on that. Nobody’s willing to touch anything because of these guarantees. In Poland, we’re trying to get masks in for PPE in the workplace and we can’t get anyone to bring them over.” Jeffries, who has been in the freight forwarding business for 24 years, said his business nearly came to a standstill last week because of the sudden trade barriers erected on 1 January. He said it was “absolute carnage out there” trying to get EU hauliers to come to Britain, because they underestimated the gravity of the financial guarantees, known as T1s, that now apply to goods being exported to the UK. A truck with a £200,000 cargo would need cash or a T1 financial guarantee document for £40,000 in VAT alone, he said, a significant burden for transport companies with multiple trucks going to the UK.
Before Brexit these guarantees were not required for goods coming from the EU. “Many agents who are completing T1s have run out of guarantee funds, which they need to have in place,” he added. He spoke as data showed that an increasing number of freight groups rejected contracts to move goods from France to Britain in the second week of January. Transporeon, a German software company that works with 100,000 logistics service providers, said freight forwarders had rejected jobs to move goods from Germany, Italy and Poland into Britain. In the second week of January the rejection rate for transport to the UK was up 168% on the third quarter of 2020 and had doubled in the first calendar week of the year. Jeffries said one of the problems was how complicated exporting to the UK had become. While goods could sail through British ports before Brexit, now EU suppliers, like the UK exporters, had to provide a panoply of paperwork before export in addition to the T1 financial guarantee. Apart from the customs declaration and the T1 financial guarantee they have to provide a Rex (registered exporter system) document to certify the origin of the product, which will determine whether tariffs will apply on entry to the UK or whether they are subject to preferential treatment. Jeffries also hit out at the government for its repeated refrain to businesses instructing them to go to freight forwarders or customs agents to prepare them for Brexit. “They haven’t issued freight forwarders with a magic book,” he said. “A lot of people think we have inside knowledge because the government says go to a freight forwarder or customs agent. But we haven’t been given any insight. We are researching this like everyone else and like everyone you can only gain access to some systems from 1 January so you had no time to test systems until it went live.”"
2021-01-20T13:43:20Z,politics,Politics,Priti Patel says she wanted UK borders shut last March,"The home secretary, Priti Patel, is at the centre of a fresh row after saying the UK’s borders should have been closed earlier, claiming she had been an advocate of shutting them at the start of the Covid pandemic last March. In comments that seemed to put her at odds with Downing Street, which only last week announced a tightening of borders, Patel said she was in favour of clamping down on travel 10 months ago. The remarks put Boris Johnson under pressure at prime minister’s questions, with Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, asking why he did not take Patel’s advice at the time. Last week Johnson announced the suspension of travel corridors to “protect against the risk of as yet unidentified new strains”. Anyone flying into the UK is required to show proof of a negative Covid test before setting off. International arrivals have to quarantine for 10 days unless they test negative after five days. In comments first reported by the Guido Fawkes website and made a day after the new policy came into effect, Patel said she had been an advocate of tightening borders at the start of the pandemic. Patel reportedly told the Conservative Friends of India group during a Zoom call on Tuesday: “On ‘should we have closed our borders earlier?’, the answer is yes, I was an advocate [of] closing them last March.” Travel corridors allowing arrivals from certain destinations with low rates of Covid-19 to avoid quarantine were introduced in July last year, the month after the government moved to implement quarantine restrictions on international arrivals. There have been frequent changes to the corridors in recent months, with countries dropped from the list as infection rates have fluctuated. At PMQs, Starmer said the government was not disputing Patel’s version of events, asking: “Why did the prime minister overrule the home secretary?” Johnson ignored the question, saying only that the UK had “introduced one of the toughest border regimes in the world”. The PM added: “I’m delighted that he now praises the home secretary.”
Starmer asked the same question again, which Johnson avoided for a second time. Last March the Daily Telegraph reported that Patel and Johnson were embroiled in a row over closing borders, with the prime minister said to have refused a plea from the home secretary to halt flights to the UK. Responding to Patel’s latest comments, the shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said: “This is a shocking admission from the home secretary about the government’s failure to secure the UK’s borders against Covid. “Priti Patel’s admission, coupled with the complete lack of strategy for testing of travellers, means that the government has left our doors open to the virus and worrying mutations. Ministers now need to urgently review and overhaul border policy, whilst taking responsibility for the huge damage their incompetence has done to our national safety and security.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We have strong measures in place at the border, which are vital as we roll out the vaccine.” In a damning report last year, MPs concluded that the government’s failure to impose special border measures in the run-up to the first Covid lockdown was “a serious mistake” that significantly increased the pace and scale of the epidemic. From late January to mid-March 2020, the UK introduced a series of travel measures, including quarantining 273 people mainly from Wuhan, as well as issuing non-mandatory guidance to self-isolate for 14 days to travellers coming from designated high-risk countries. The list of locations, which was incrementally expanded, included China, Iran and Italy by mid-March. But it was withdrawn on 13 March without a reason being given and there were no border measures in place for almost three months until 8 June, according to the report published in August by the Commons’ home affairs committee. In the 10 days between the withdrawal of guidance and the introduction of lockdown on 23 March, the report stated, evidence suggested that thousands of new infections were brought in from Europe. “It is highly likely that this contributed to the rapid increase in the spread of the virus in mid-March and to the overall scale of the outbreak in the UK,” they concluded. Responding to Patel’s latest comments, Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the home affairs committee which produced the report, said: “I have been raising the issue of the UK’s weak border measures with the home secretary and the government repeatedly since last March and up until now everyone has defended the decisions made at the start of the pandemic not to have stricter border and quarantine measures in place.”"
2021-01-20T07:00:13Z,politics,Politics,Furious Kent residents step up fight over Brexit lorry park,"Residents of a village near Dover have mounted what they describe as a “David and Goliath” battle to try to reverse government plans to turn fields at the ends of their gardens into a giant Brexit customs clearance site for 1,200 lorries. The local Anglican priest and former president of the chamber of commerce accused the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, and the transport minister, Rachel Maclean, of a “clear abuse of power” over the lack of notice and consultation over the consequences of their plans. With less than two weeks to go before the end of an official 21-day engagement process, they staged a socially-distanced protest at the fields destined to become the White Cliffs inland border facility. They are demanding the government to “relocate to a safer site”. One pensioner was almost in tears over the prospect of hundreds of HGVs driving beyond his fence in a 37-hectare plot of agricultural land.
He complained the plans were hatched “behind closed doors” and only conveyed to residents on New Year’s Eve despite the devastation they will bring to their lives. “I think they way they have handled it is unethical, immoral and unprincipled,” said Peter Sherred, a self-supporting Anglican priest who has lived in the village for the past 25 years officiating at numerous local churches.
“The disgraceful thing about all of this was there was absolutely no consultation whatsoever with people in the local area or the residents who are going to be most affected, to whom these plans came as a complete shock. “We were told that at some stage in January we would be involved in an engagement process, where we would have been able to express our views, but I have to say I find that somewhat meaningless because as you can see they are already have machines in the land, they have created an access route to the land and yet they say it will not be approved until after the engagement. “I can’t see them backtracking on this project. This is a fait accompli,” he said. In an official submission to the Department for Transport he and his wife say: “The manner of proceeding has involved a clear abuse of power by departments involved [DfT and Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government] including the secretaries of state, under secretaries of state and officials”. The DfT says in its notice about the site, published last week, that the site will only be used for five years and says it will take feedback submitted by 3 February into account. “The White Cliffs inland border facility proposals are planned for temporary use and are designed to ensure that there are no significant or long-term environmental effects,” it said. But none of the locals can see the site being restored to something suitable in 2025.
Sarah Gleave, the coordinator for the Green party for Dover and Deal, has been leading the campaign to get the plans reversed along with Guston parish council members. She said the site was a result of “lazy, ignorant planning by London”. “Obviously we must have inland clearance sites but this is the wrong location,” she added. The site is one of 10 inland border facilities the government has either opened, is building, or is planning to deal with the full suite of customs, tariffs and duties checks that will be operation from July this year. Maclean wrote to locals on New Year’s Eve to notify them of the purchase of the land and the site. But Sherred and residents say they got a second shock last week when the department wrote to them with a more detailed outline for the site, which showed an exit route for lorries sited along a cycle and bus route proposed by the local council as part of a pre-existing regeneration programme.
“Mentally it is getting to me with Covid and everything else and now this. I just wanted to retire peacefully,” said a visibly distraught Kieron Jaynes, 70, as he explained how hundreds of HGVs were now going to skirt the garden in the rural home he bought more than 20 years ago. Dover born and bred, he has lived in his house for 22 years, and invested in the community through a business employing 35 people. Jaynes doesn’t want conflict or headlines and suggests one solution is the government, which purchased the site at the end of last year under emergency legislation, instead use the land for a visitor attraction for the coachloads that visit nearby Dover Castle and the cyclists and runners who use this town hinterland for its green credentials. The town has “such enormous history” over the centuries and yet has nothing for tourists, not even toilets at the castle, just a walk away from his house.
Neighbour Mick Palmer, 78, and his family are also suffering and his wife has become ill with anxiety and depression since the plans were revealed three weeks ago. “It is a travesty to say it’s a consultation. They’ve already got the bulldozers in,” he said. A DfT spokesperson said it was engaging with the local community and had extended the time period for residents to submit views from two weeks, their legal requirement, to three. • This article was amended on 25 January 2021 to remove a reference to Betteshanger Park that incorrectly said the area was flat and had been “paved over”."
2021-01-20T06:00:12Z,politics,Politics,Johnson's 'levelling up' council criticised as most members based in London,"A business council set up by Boris Johnson to rebuild the UK after Covid has been criticised for being too London-centric and treating most of the country with “contempt” after it emerged that all but five council members are based in or near the English capital. Just one of the 30 Build Back Better Council members is based in the north of England, two are in the Midlands, one in Cambridge and one in Scotland. None work for firms headquartered in Wales or Northern Ireland. Twenty-two are in London and three in commuter towns within 25 miles of the capital. Announcing the council on Monday, Johnson said it would “level up opportunity for people and businesses across the UK”. He promised it would “provide an important forum for frank feedback on our recovery plans”. But the geographic makeup of the council was criticised for drawing almost exclusively from firms based in London or the commuter belt of the capital. Nick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle city council, said: “So much for levelling up. We’re the only city with an A rating for our CDP assessment (demonstrating our ambition and plan for net zero by 2030), we’ve created thousands of jobs in the city over the last decade, we’ve won national praise for our work on tackling homelessness, we’ve broken all our housebuilding targets and we’re the first city to have all care home residents vaccinated against Covid. But the government doesn’t think they have anything to learn from us.” Frank McKenna from UnitedCity, a pressure group set up to help businesses in Greater Manchester recover from the pandemic, said: “The one thing the government should have learnt from the last nine months, surely, is that we can’t have a one-size-fits-all-approach to rebuilding our economy.” McKenna, who also heads Downtown in Business, which brings together firms in the north of England and the West Midlands, said it wasn’t too late to broaden the council’s membership. “Even at this stage I would say to Boris Johnson and his colleagues: this just looks daft … At worst it looks like the north of England has been forgotten and is being treated with contempt again.” Henri Murison, the director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership thinktank, said: “A large part of the British business community, including a number of its most significant firms, is here – not least most of its major supermarkets. It is vital that discussions about key business priorities reflect that.” A government spokesperson defended the appointments, saying: “The Build Back Better Council members have significant operations across the UK, employing tens of thousands of people in factories, R&D campuses, shops and forecourts across the Midlands and the north of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. “Council members were selected because of their long-term commitment to the UK economy and their combined capability to increase business investment, get the economy moving and create jobs across the entire country.” The council members include senior executives from companies including Google, Heathrow Airport, British Airways and Unilever. Outside London and the commuter belt there is the chief executive of Siemens, based in Manchester; the chief executives of Jaguar Land Rover and Severn Trent, both in Coventry; Sir Ian Wood of the engineering consultancy Wood in Aberdeen, and Poppy Gustafsson from the cyber-security firm Darktrace in Cambridge. The three companies within 25 miles of the capital are in Slough, Brentwood in Middlesex and Welwyn Garden City."
2021-01-20T06:00:12Z,politics,Politics,"'Woke guy' Joe Biden is an inspiration for Labour, says Lisa Nandy","Joe Biden won the US presidency as a “woke guy” who proudly defended trans rights and Black Lives Matter but also set the agenda on economic recovery, the shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, has said as Labour seeks to build new alliances with the Democrats. In a Guardian interview ahead of the 78-year-old president’s inauguration, Nandy said the Democrats were looking to her party as a dependable partner and that Labour would seek to use the relationship to improve UK interests damaged by Boris Johnson. “On every occasion he’s managed to trash our reputation as a country that is reliable, dependable and values-driven,” she said. Nandy had been due to attend Biden’s inauguration on Wednesday but pulled out once England entered its third Covid lockdown. She hinted that Biden was an inspiration for how a Labour leader could win without compromising on progressive values and being drawn into culture wars. “Joe Biden – he’s a woke guy, he appointed an amazingly strong woman of colour who is also pro-choice as his running mate, he mentioned the trans community in his victory speech, he stood up for the Black Lives Matter protesters, he spoke out about the policing of that movement, and he’s never shied away from standing up for his values,” Nandy said. “People know exactly who he is. And he equally won’t be diverted off course when he wants to talk about the economy, when he wants to talk about Covid.” Nandy said it was clear Biden had not healed US divisions but his victory was “a source of hope for a lot of progressive parties around the world”. She said she believed UK voters would not be drawn easily into febrile conspiracy-fuelled politics and that the US election showed there was a “ceiling” for the amount of disruptive politics that voters would tolerate in a pandemic. “They want a government that they can trust to actually get a grip, not just on the health crisis but on the economic fallout which is already affecting people across this country and across America.” However, she drew parallels between the US and the UK Conservative party’s efforts to stoke tensions, referencing the Charlottesville protests where white supremacists were given some endorsement by the president. “Two years later we had the prime minister here trying to start a culture war over a statue of Churchill and also exactly the same pattern of behaviour in relation to trans rights … In 2019, No 10 was polling the red walls to see if it could start a culture war in northern towns over LGBT rights.” Nandy said she was aware the launch of two explicitly rightwing TV channels, one under Rupert Murdoch and another fronted by Andrew Neil, were targeted at constituencies like hers in Wigan, with a strapline of “being for the underserved and unheard … which is a deliberate targeting of voters in constituencies like mine where you’ve had 40 years of economic decline and repeated attempts by the far right to get a foothold”. While Labour wants to explore the Democrats’ electoral strategy, she said the party could more importantly act as a channel for improving UK relations with the Biden administration. “I wouldn’t underestimate how deep the strength of feeling about Boris Johnson goes, particularly with members of the administration who previously served under President Obama,” she said. Nandy said the UK public should not underestimate senior Democrats’ private disdain for Johnson, which has been heightened by concerns over Brexit and Northern Ireland. She said the Biden administration had communicated ways to repair relations, including a major push from the UK ahead of the G7 and Cop26 climate summit to persuade Australia and India to make binding climate targets, as well as taking a firmer stance on Russia and disinformation. Nandy said it was her understanding from conversations with Democrats that Alok Sharma’s appointment as full-time president of Cop26 was a “direct request from the US” as a demonstration of seriousness. She said it was not just Johnson’s perceived closeness to Trump, who dubbed his UK counterpart “Britain Trump”, but actions taken by the UK in recent months. “I think the Democrats feel, in the conversations we’ve had with them, that it’s not clear what Britain wants out of the special relationship any more,” she said. “They are genuinely quite baffled about why the British government took cooperation on military, security, defence and foreign policy off the table in negotiations with the EU,” she said. “The great strategic value of Britain to the United States is that we have a close relationship with both the US and the EU on those matters.” Russia and the spread of disinformation are another key target for Nandy where there is a wedge between the UK and the Biden administration. The intelligence and security committee report, published six months ago, has seen none of its 15 recommendations implemented by government. “We’ve got great big gaping holes in our defences,” Nandy said. “The City of London still operates as a haven for dark money that sustains the regime that Dominic Raab is railing against. Yet nothing has been done – that’s heard both in Russia and in the US.” Nandy said she would back sanctions against key Russian figures named by dissident leader Alexei Navalny, imprisoned this week in Moscow following a poisoning attempt blamed on the Kremlin. “In the end, if you don’t clean up the corrupt networks and dirty money, then you continue to sustain the regime that Alexei Navalny has spent his entire life fighting against,” Nandy said."
2021-01-20T00:32:28Z,politics,Politics,Theresa May accuses Boris Johnson of 'abandoning global leadership',"Theresa May has accused Boris Johnson of abandoning Britain’s “position of global moral leadership”, in her most unrestrained attack on her successor yet. Writing in the Daily Mail ahead of President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration, the former prime minister had stern words about both the outgoing US president, Donald Trump, and her successor. May said that, in her view, Johnson has failed to honour British values by threatening to break international law during Brexit trade negotiations and backing out of the foreign aid target, writing that these two manoeuvres had not “raised our credibility in the eyes of the world”. “Threatening to break international law by going back on a treaty we had just signed and abandoning our position of global moral leadership as the only major economy to meet both the 2% defence spending target and the 0.7% international aid target were not actions which raised our credibility in the eyes of the world,” she wrote. In her article, May appeared to remind Johnson that he needed to live up to “our values” to have any aspirations for a truly “Global Britain” to play a key role on the international political stage, and urged him to adopt compromise. “We have been sliding towards absolutism in international affairs: if you are not 100% for me, you must be 100% against me,” she said. “Compromise is seen as a dirty word.” “We must reject a scene in which a few strongmen face off against each other and instead bring people together in a common cause. But to lead we must live up to our values.” May and Johnson have clashed repeatedly in the Commons over the past year and a half, particularly over Brexit talks involving Northern Ireland and the Good Friday agreement. Likening the storming of the US Capitol to “attacks on our own democratic institutions” such as the murder of PC Keith Palmer, who died during the 2017 Westminster terror attack, May condemned Trump for having “whipped up” a violent mob and described the election of a “decent” Biden as the next US president as a “golden opportunity” for Britain to become a force for good in the world again. “What happened in Washington was not the act of a lone extremist or a secretive cell, but an assault by a partisan mob whipped up by an elected president. I know from experience that leaving power is not easy – especially when you feel that there is more you want to do.” May was the first foreign leader to meet Trump in the White House in 2017. • This article was amended on 20 January 2021. An earlier version said Theresa May “was the first foreign head of state to meet Trump in the White House in 2016”. The UK prime minister is the head of government, not the head of state; and the meeting took place in January 2017. These errors have been corrected."
2021-01-20T00:01:05Z,politics,Politics,MPs demand answers over lack of Covid support for self-employed,"Parliament’s spending watchdog has called on the government to explain and fix issues with the tax system that have denied whole groups of freelancers and self-employed workers financial support during the coronavirus pandemic. The powerful cross-party public accounts committee (PAC) said some of the workforce had “not had a penny” from the government’s multibillion-pound support schemes despite repeat lockdowns blocking many from work, while some large companies had received taxpayer support and paid dividends to shareholders and high salaries to executives. It said “quirks in the tax system” and problems with HM Revenue and Customs’ computer systems had allowed people to fall through the cracks in the support schemes and made it more difficult for the tax authority to identify fraud. Campaigners have warned that about 3 million taxpayers – 10% of the UK workforce – have fallen through gaps in the support system and have received no help since the start of the pandemic almost a year ago, with self-employed workers and freelancers among the most likely to be excluded. Demanding answers from officials, the group of MPs said HMRC should, within six weeks, publish an explanation of why it cannot help those freelancers and other groups that have been excluded from receiving any support, and set out steps it can take to overcome those obstacles. The report comes amid growing pressure on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to refresh the government’s emergency support schemes as the UK economy edges closer to a double-dip recession during the second wave of the pandemic.
The PAC said it was concerned that some self-employed taxpayers may have moved on to company payrolls because of the government’s IR 35 tax rules – aimed at stopping tax dodging by disguising employment through so-called personal service companies – but had not been classed as employed at the right time to be eligible for emergency support. It also said it was common in some sectors – such as TV, film and the wider creative industries – for freelancers to work on a series of short-term employment contracts with gaps in between, which could mean they miss-out on financial support. The government has spent more than £46bn subsidising the wages of almost 10m jobs since the pandemic began through the furlough scheme, which has been extended until the end of April. More than 2m claims worth more than £18bn have been paid out through the similar self-employed income support scheme. Warning that people were still falling through the cracks, the PAC report said that HMRC was coming under strain as it attempted to upgrade its IT systems, handle increased demand during the pandemic, and adapt to the UK’s post-Brexit customs regime. The report warned the tax authority it was spending too much time patching-up out-of-date and potentially risky computer systems rather than modernising them, with these old systems making it tougher for HMRC to provide reliable and timely data. Meg Hillier, the chair of the PAC, said: “As public spending balloons to unprecedented levels in response to the pandemic, out-of-date tax systems are one of the barriers to getting help to a significant number of struggling taxpayers who should be entitled to support. And the system is going to struggle, and in many cases fail, to capture or deal with those wrongly claiming it.”"
2021-01-19T19:13:12Z,politics,Politics,Senior Welsh Tory and Labour figures apologise for drinks event,"Three senior politicians including the Conservative leader in Wales, Paul Davies, have apologised over a drinks event in a Welsh parliament building at a time when pubs were banned from serving alcohol on their premises under Covid laws. Davies, along with the Tory chief whip in the Senedd, Darren Millar, and the party’s chief of staff in Wales, Paul Smith, said they had broken the spirit of the rules and were “profoundly sorry”. Alun Davies, a former Labour Welsh government minister, also said he was “very sorry” and has been suspended from the Senedd Labour group. A ban on the sale, supply and consumption of alcohol in licensed premises came into force in Wales on 4 December. Four days later, on 8 December, a group of Senedd members and staff allegedly drank alcohol in the Ty Hywel building in Cardiff Bay. A spokesman for the Senedd commission said: “We are aware of an incident on the Senedd estate last month which may have been contrary to public health regulations in force at the time. “The Senedd commission takes the public health regulations in Wales very seriously and is currently investigating the matter in order to establish an accurate account of what took place and to determine whether action may be required.” A joint statement from Paul Davies, Millar and Smith said: “We are profoundly sorry for our actions. While we did not break the rules, we recognise that what was part of a day’s work would not be seen to be following the spirit of them, especially given the tough time the country has been going through.” A spokesperson for the Senedd Labour group said: “A member has been suspended from the privileges of Senedd Labour group membership while an investigation takes place into this alleged incident.” Alun Davies said: “I am very sorry if my actions have given the impression that I am in any way not committed to upholding the regulations, which I have consistently supported throughout the last year. “For context, the purpose of this meeting from my perspective was to seek to persuade the Welsh Conservatives to support my proposal for a Welsh Hearts Bill” [to improve the outcomes for people who suffer cardiac arrests]. This is part of my work across political parties on this issue. “The Senedd commission has already confirmed to me that I did not breach the coronavirus regulations on the consumption of either food or alcohol that were in force at that time. I have also confirmed to the commission that the regulations on the number of people present and on social distancing were not breached either. I look forward to the commission’s final conclusions on this matter.” It is understood the alcohol was not bought on the premises and was not served by catering staff. A spokesman for the catering company CH&CO Group, which offers catering and hospitality services at the Senedd, said: “We are aware of an alleged breach of public health regulations at the Senedd estate. “As caterers, we take our responsibilities and obligations to restrictions and public health regulations across the UK very seriously. We are currently undertaking a full investigation into this matter.” The Welsh government’s minister for mental health, Eluned Morgan, has written to the Welsh Conservatives asking them to suspend its members involved while the incident is investigated. A spokesperson for South Wales police said: “South Wales police is aware of an internal investigation being conducted by the Senedd Commission into an incident on the Senedd estate last month. “If the matter is referred to police, an investigation will be undertaken if suspected breaches of the public health regulations are identified.”"
2021-01-19T19:06:56Z,politics,Politics,UK proves world-beating at Covid deaths and prioritising profit | John Crace,"On the day that the UK took pole position in the number of deaths per capita in the coronavirus pandemic – I’m not sure that’s what the prime minister had in mind when he described the country as world-beating – one of the biggest political stories was whether Boris Johnson treated himself to power naps during the course of his working day. Allegra Stratton, the prime minister’s press spokesperson, insisted that the rumours were untrue but stopped short of saying they were “completely” untrue. So maybe Boris just likes to spend a lot of time wide awake with his eyes closed. But if Johnson had been planning on a quick snooze, he couldn’t have chosen a better moment than the SNP’s Peter Wishart’s urgent question on visa restrictions for musicians wanting to tour the EU post Brexit. Not because there was anything inconsequential about the matter, but because in Caroline Dinenage, a junior minister at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, the Tories have a natural barbiturate. Someone far better suited to reading audiobooks for insomniacs than her chosen career in parliament. It’s not just the monotone with which she delivers her sentences, it’s the absence of content. Rather she just bores everyone into submission by repeating the same things over and over again – something which in Westminster is regarded as a highly prized asset – so no one comes away any the wiser from an hour spent in her company. Her main thrust was that the UK had offered the EU a great deal for touring musicians but that the EU had turned it down and offered an unacceptable deal instead. Wishart and many others shook their heads in disbelief. Their understanding – along with the Musicians’ Union – was it had been the EU which had offered the good deal of a 90-day free travel period and that the UK had turned it down. “Absolutely not,” Dinenage said, while refusing to give any details and insisting that the EU had been telling lies about what it had proposed. Eventually Labour’s Kevin Brennan and others begged her to publish the full correspondence between the UK and the EU so parliament could make up its own mind about who was telling the truth. Now Dinenage became uncharacteristically coy, saying she would have to ask her superiors at several other departments for permission. Something she made sound as difficult as a breach of the Official Secrets Act. You have to remember, she mumbled, that the country had just voted for parliament to take back control over its laws and borders so now was not the time to do anything that might benefit the EU. Or the UK for that matter. Next up came the consideration of the Lords’ amendments to the trade bill. Or rather, the outright rejection of all the amendments by the government’s mouthpiece, junior trade secretary, Greg Hands, whose main objection to everything was that the executive hadn’t gone out of its way to take back control only to allow MPs to have their say. It had been bad enough in the old days when MEPs had been allowed to have a voice on EU trade policy. So why throw away all the advantages gained by giving UK democratically elected representatives the chance to mess things up? What was needed was a bit more trust. The UK had promised not to get involved in any deals that might trade away the NHS or risk online harms to children, so it would be helpful if MPs just took the government at its word rather than seek to cause trouble through greater scrutiny. But the key amendment was the one on genocide, with many Tories concerned that the government might turn a blind eye to the treatment of the Uighurs in its keenness to come to a deal with China. “We don’t have a free trade deal with China,” Hands declared triumphantly. So there was nothing genocidal to be considered. And even if there was, we shouldn’t trust the British high courts to decide what regimes had or hadn’t committed human rights abuses, not least because they may taker a harsher view than the compromised international criminal court. It should be the government that decided the ethics of trade deals, not some unelected UK judges. It wasn’t that far away from declaring the British judiciary to be enemies of the people yet again. Tory MP Nusrat Ghani interrupted to say that was why she had tabled another amendment giving parliament the right to vote on any deal in the event the courts had found our trading partners guilty of genocide. Hands looked genuinely surprised. This was the first he had heard of it. Well that’s odd, said Iain Duncan Smith, unusually finding himself on the side of the angels, because he had given the department a copy of the amendment a week ago and it had mysteriously found its way on to the day’s order paper. It was a staggering admission of ignorance and complacency but Hands did his best to cover his embarrassment by saying that nobody cared more about human rights than he did, but the damage was done. Several other Tories, as well as all opposition MPs, spoke out in favour of the amendment but Hands wasn’t in the mood for listening. His hands were over his ears. Given a choice of conscience or profit, the latter won out every time. That’s what will make the UK world-beating again. That and the death stats."

2021-01-19T14:43:59Z,politics,Politics,Business secretary confirms post-Brexit review of UK workers' rights,"The business secretary has confirmed his department is reviewing how EU employment rights protections could be changed after Brexit, while insisting they will not be watered down. The Guardian understands a consultation on employment rights was signed off by Kwasi Kwarteng’s predecessor Alok Sharma, who left after being given a full-time role leading preparations for the Cop26 climate conference. Insiders say the consultation is ready to launch and has been circulated among some select business leaders. Following reports last week that the government was examining EU rules such as the working time directive, which sets a maximum 48-hour week, ministers said they were not eroding protections. But speaking to the business, energy and industrial strategy committee on Tuesday, Kwarteng confirmed his department was carrying out a consultation with business leaders on EU employment rules, including the working time directive. Asked by the committee chair, Labour’s Darren Jones, to outline the review, Kwarteng confirmed it was happening. “I think the view was that we wanted to look at the whole range of issues relating to our EU membership and examine what we wanted to keep, if you like,” he said. However, he added, the plan was to maintain “a really good high standard for workers in high employment and a high-wage economy. That’s what I’m focusing on. And so the idea that we’re trying to whittle down standards, that’s not at all plausible or true.” On the working time directive, Kwarteng said a number of EU countries had opted out of it, adding: “So, even by just following that we are way above the average European standard. And I want to maintain that, I think we can be a high-wage, high-employment economy and a very successful economy. And that’s what we should be aiming for.” However, just five countries have an opt-out of the time directive that applies to all sectors – and the UK is one of the five. Eleven other countries have limited opt-outs for specific sectors, mostly applying to doctors and medical staff. Asked about his role in Britannia Unchained, a 2012 collection of essays by then Tory backbenchers calling for reduced worker protections, Kwarteng told the committee that was “a long time ago”. He said: “We are absolutely looking at safeguarding employment rights. I know there’s been stories in the newspapers that there’s going to be some sort of bonfire of rights. This could not be further from the truth.” According to the report in the Financial Times, proposals in the review also cover rules about breaks at work, and removing overtime pay when calculating certain holiday pay entitlements. Another proposal would be to get rid of the requirement for businesses to log information about daily working hours, to save on administration costs. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, said Kwarteng had “let the cat out of the bag” after initially dismissing media reports. “A government committed to maintaining existing protections would not be reviewing whether they should be unpicked. This exposes that the government’s priorities for Britain are totally wrong,” he said. “Neither workers nor business want ministers to take a wrecking ball to the hard-won rights of working people and families.”"
2021-01-18T21:25:20Z,politics,Politics,PM tells business chiefs Covid jab is UK's best way out of recession,"Boris Johnson has told business leaders that efficient delivery of the coronavirus vaccine is Britain’s best economic recovery tool as he promised a sustainable fightback from the worst recession in 300 years. The prime minister chaired the first meeting of a new business council designed to coordinate the government’s economic response to Covid-19 with leaders from the country’s biggest companies. Aiming to reassure business leaders that the government remained committed to kickstarting the economy as soon as possible, Johnson told the executives from 30 major firms – including GlaxoSmithKline, British Airways and HSBC – that the government was looking ahead to the economic recovery and the business landscape after Brexit. The prime minister said it was important for the government and businesses to work together to rebuild the virus-stricken economy, and that he would support job creation, upgrade Britain’s infrastructure, and launch a “green industrial revolution” to help the country “build back better” from the pandemic.
Despite recent border disruption and intense frustration among business leaders over the government’s handling of Brexit, Johnson told the first meeting of the “build back better council” that British industry had opportunities to seize from leaving the EU. Johnson had been reported in 2018 to have said, “Fuck business” when questioned about the sector’s concerns over a potential no-deal departure. Sources attending the meeting said the government was in “sales mode” in a bid to strengthen relations with company bosses that had become increasingly tattered in recent years. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who also attended the meeting, told the leaders that effectively distributing the vaccine was the most important economic policy. Although no “big bang” removal of lockdown restrictions was expected, the chancellor suggested that vaccination would help to build a platform for a strong economic recovery in the second half of the year. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, the trade secretary, Liz Truss, and the vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi, also attended the meeting, which included representatives from firms from sectors of the economy including finance, energy, technology and hospitality. Johnson told those present that with the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow this November and G7 summit in Cornwall in June, Britain had the potential to develop an influential voice in shaping a green recovery from the pandemic. However, green groups said there was a telling lack of environmental leadership at the event despite its high-profile billing. Attendees included the chief executives of oil and gas group BP and of Heathrow, Britain’s largest airport. “Boris Johnson’s ‘build back better council’ looks more like a polluters’ club,” said John Sauven, Greenpeace’s executive director. “It’s packed with some of Britain’s most polluting industries and investors, and green leadership is conspicuous by its absence. “We can’t build back better by relying on the same old industries that are fuelling climate chaos and the destruction of nature. It’s high time the government stopped favouring the usual vested interests and gave its full support to the businesses building a cleaner, healthier, safer future.” Connor Schwartz, climate lead at Friends of the Earth, said the government should be discussing green policies such as scrapping multi-billion-pound investment in road schemes and boosting investment in green technologies.
“This is a far cry from just two months ago, when the prime minister announced the need for a green industrial revolution,” he said. “Instead of listening to fossil fuel companies and airports, the government should turn their ear to the majority of the public who want climate change prioritised in the economic recovery to coronavirus.”"
2021-01-18T20:30:36Z,politics,Politics,Lawyers for Corbyn accuse Starmer of 'disingenuous' attack,"Lawyers for Jeremy Corbyn have accused the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, of making “inflammatory and disingenuous” attacks on his predecessor following a row over the party’s handling of antisemitism. At a high court hearing on Monday, Corbyn’s lawyers said documents would help prove there was a deal with Starmer’s office to readmit him to the party, and Corbyn’s suspension “went behind an agreement to reinstate” him to Labour “at all levels”. Corbyn’s barrister, Christopher Jacobs, told the hearing: “The disclosure will enable my client to plead that there was procedural unfairness, and breach of a duty to act in good faith.” He said Corbyn’s treatment by the party had been “grossly unfair”.
Corbyn was initially suspended from Labour in October, when he said the scale of antisemitism in the party had been “dramatically overstated”, in the wake of a damning report by the equalities watchdog. In November Corbyn was readmitted by the national executive committee, but Starmer ordered the Labour whip be withheld until he apologised. Corbyn has not done so, but did issue a clarifying statement saying it was not his intention to “tolerate antisemitism or belittle concerns about it”. In court, Jacobs accused Starmer of “resiling from a settled agreement, and going behind a final decision of the NEC”. He cited a speech Starmer gave to the Jewish Labour Movement conference on 29 November, in which he said Corbyn’s reaction to the watchdog’s report was “as bad as you could get”. Jacobs said: “We say that is an inflammatory statement and is disingenuous because of the NEC outcome.”
Jacobs also said there was an “inference” from media remarks made by the Labour MP Margaret Hodge that she agreed to stay a member of the party only if Corbyn was suspended. Only the party minutes and copies of any emails from Hodge to Starmer’s office would prove whether such a deal had been made, Jacobs said. “We need the records.” The Labour party’s barrister, Rachel Crasnow QC, dismissed the application, saying the matter was a “straightforward contractual dispute” that did not require pre-release of any documents. Crasnow also disputed there had been any agreement to readmit Corbyn to the party while suspending the whip. Crasnow argued in written submissions that Corbyn’s “purpose of obtaining early disclosure from the party is to advance a political, rather than a legal, position”. The judge, Lisa Sullivan, said she would give her ruling on Corbyn’s application “as soon as I can”."
2021-01-18T20:23:32Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson kindly and civilly abstains on helping the poorest | John Crace,"The prime minister appears to have had a personality transplant. There are those of us who remember Boris Johnson driving a JCB with “Get Brexit Done” on the front of the digger through a polystyrene wall marked “Gridlock” during the last general election. Others may recall him waving fish or a cheque for £350m made out to the NHS in the Brexit referendum campaign. Then there was the zip-wire, along with too many other attention-seeking photo opportunities to mention. In fact, it’s often felt as if Johnson’s entire political career has been built on one childish stunt after another. Some may also remember Johnson abusing his opponents. During the Brexit debate he frequently accused remainers of collusion, surrender and general acts of treachery. Only last week he was called out by the Speaker for calling Keir Starmer hypocritical. But enough is apparently enough. Boris has now officially distanced himself from the political stunt. According to Allegra Stratton, the prime minister’s spokesperson, Boris has also undergone a damascene conversion on language. He now believes that our politics should be conducted in a “kind and civil” manner. So no doubt we can look forward to Johnson unreservedly apologising to Starmer for all the insults he has thrown at the Labour leader over the past nine months and to treating him with some of the respect and civility Starmer has shown him. At least these were the reasons Downing Street dredged up for the Tories washing their hands of the opposition day debate on maintaining the £20 increase in universal credit. According to Boris, Labour was guilty of a low-rent stunt aimed at unnecessarily worrying the public by calling for a debate on this issue. And because some Labour supporters had been angry on Twitter about the worst-off being further impoverished, Johnson was urging all Tory MPs to abstain in the non-binding vote. Only a cynic could imagine that asking his MPs – some from badly-hit “red wall” constituencies who might be tempted to vote with the opposition – to vote for a £20-a-week cut would not be a great look and that abstaining was the least bad political outcome. Indeed, some might even call abstention a stunt had not Boris already assured us that kind of behaviour was a thing of the past. We were at Tory politics Year Zero. With the outcome not in doubt and only a handful of MPs in the chamber, the debate itself felt particularly low-key. Opening for the opposition, the shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, was keen to point out that calling for the £20 UC uplift to be maintained was not a stunt but a lifeline for many of the poorest families. What would be a stunt would be to introduce a one-off payment of £500 or £1,000 as that would not be available to the 800,000 or more people expected to lose their jobs in the coming year. Reynolds was also keen to offer an olive branch to the government benches. He wasn’t going to characterise them all as heartless bastards – that would not be kind, civil or helpful – especially as he knew that many of them secretly (and not so secretly) agreed with Labour on this, so he was just making a plea to the deluded and the misguided to have a rethink. And yes, Labour would ideally get rid of UC and replace it with a fairer welfare system, but as it wasn’t in a position to effect that change it was calling for the least bad option. There was no sign of the work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, in the chamber – something Reynolds attributed to the fact that she was one of the many Tories whose idea of kindness and civility was to extend the £20 uplift for another year at least to see the country through the worst of the pandemic. So it was left to junior minister Will Quince to make the case for the government. He tried to look chipper and upbeat, but his optimism rang hollow. His job was merely to get through the session relatively unscathed. The government had been doing a great job in helping people out already, he said, but the way to get people out of poverty was through work, not benefits. That was why he was so pleased to have recruited 125 mentors to help people find jobs. He was also at pains to point out that the chancellor’s £20 increase had only ever been temporary and that come April there could be more than enough work for everyone – I’m not sure what he knows that every other economic forecaster doesn’t. It would be wrong for Rishi Sunak to act too soon by giving people certainty about their finances, when they were all about to become millionaires anyway. Giving the extra £20 would only make people feel bad about themselves. Labour, SNP and DUP backbenchers all pretty much restated Reynolds’s case, many of them citing emails from constituents about how the £20 had made the difference between survival and the food bank. As indeed did some Tory MPs, such as Stephen Crabb and Simon Fell, who felt that, although the government had done a good job in supporting the least well-off during the pandemic, now was not the kind or civil time to withdraw that help. They seemed to have less faith in the coming economic miracle than many of their colleagues, some of whom were profoundly unbothered about how the country was going to pay for its £280bn bailout fund but desperate to know where the £6bn to pay for the £20 increase in UC was coming from. Never let it be said MPs don’t sweat the small stuff. The vote though was never in doubt, meaningless as it was. Though everyone suspected there would be a U-turn on this by the government sometime between now and the next budget. And when it was announced, there would be no great celebratory stunt from Johnson about how much he single-handedly was doing to support the country. Rather he would kindly and civilly thank the opposition for showing him the error of his ways."

2021-01-18T19:16:48Z,politics,Politics,Treasury minister downplays need for immediate tax rises,"A Treasury minister has downplayed the need for immediate tax rises to tackle record levels of government borrowing caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Jesse Norman said a rapid economic recovery from the worst recession for more than three centuries could help ministers avoid increasing the tax take in response to record borrowing levels. Answering questions from the Commons Treasury committee amid mounting speculation that the March budget could be used to increase taxes, he told MPs: “It’s not absolutely obvious therefore that there may be any future need for consolidation, depending on the view you take of taxes. “Of course we may end up with a somewhat delayed but nevertheless very pronounced bounce. There are features of the economy which would suggest that could be quite significant, if you look at the level of household savings, for example, and data like that.” The comments follow weekend newspaper reports that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is preparing to raise taxes in the 3 March budget in order to bring down record levels of government borrowing. Sunak has warned that “hard choices” must be made to fix the public finances, and used his spending review in November to freeze public-sector pay and cut the overseas aid budget. The UK’s budget deficit – the gap between spending and tax income plus other receipts – is on track to reach at least £394bn for the financial year ending in March, amid a rise in emergency spending during the crisis and collapse in tax receipts. The national debt – the sum total of every deficit – has risen to more than £2tn, equivalent to more than 100% of national output. However, major tax increases might well provoke a swift Tory backlash. The chancellor has also been urged by leading economists to take advantage of record low borrowing costs and to steer clear of raising taxes or launching a renewed austerity drive to allow a sustainable economic recovery to take hold. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said £40bn in tax increases may be necessary in future to put the public finances back on a sustainable footing. Downplaying the need for immediate action, Norman said the Treasury was still focusing on stabilising Britain’s economy amid elevated levels of Covid infections and tough government restrictions. “We [need to] stabilise the economy and try to keep things moving forward before we can start thinking about the wider framework of policy. Although, as I’ve said, the chancellor does expect to think in terms of strong and sustainable public finances,” he said. Mel Stride, chair of the Treasury committee, said: “I take away from this that it’s not a done deal that there will be tax rises. There are possibilities out there in terms of our recovery that might see us avoid what probably a lot of people are expecting. That remains to be seen.” • This article was amended on 19 January 2021 to clarify the definition of budget deficit to include other receipts."
2021-01-18T18:52:54Z,politics,Politics,Matt Hancock cautions against booking holidays abroad,"People should plan for a “great British summer”, the health secretary has said, suggesting that holidays abroad may not be a given as he revealed he has booked his own break in Cornwall. Matt Hancock’s comments come after the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, suggested it was “too early” for Britons to book summer breaks overseas. Asked if people should book a trip abroad, Hancock said: “I’m going to Cornwall. And I have said before I think we’re going to have a great British summer. But we’ve got a lot of work to do between now and then. “What we can do is see the line of sight to vaccinating everybody by September and anything before that would be a bonus. As the foreign secretary said yesterday, we’re driving this as fast as we possibly can.” Speaking at the Downing Street press conference, Hancock said admissions to hospital on Monday were the highest they had been throughout the pandemic, with one Covid patient currently admitted to hospital in the UK every 30 seconds. The latest government statistics show there are 37,475 people in UK hospitals and Hancock said the NHS “is under significant pressure in all parts of the country”. He said it was more vital than ever that people continued to stay at home and respect the restrictions. “Don’t blow it now, we’re on the route out with protecting the most vulnerable,” he said. “We’re getting the virus under control. Together, I know that we can do it. And we’ve got to stick at it, and especially with our plans for all adults in the UK to be offered a Covid vaccine by September.” The health secretary also did not rule out changing the law to protect medics from charges of “unlawful killing” should the NHS be forced into situations where doctors had to choose which patients to save. “I know that this is a very serious concern,” Hancock said. “I’m very glad to say that we are not in a position where doctors have to make those sorts of choices. And I very much hope that we don’t get in that situation and that everybody can get the treatment they deserve.” He said he had been given clear advice that it was “not necessary at this point to change the law on this on this matter” but it would be kept under review. “I take very serious questions of this nature,” he said. “That is not the situation now, and the data show that we are getting this under control. But that requires you to act by staying at home, unless you have one of the reasons set out very clearly as to why you can leave whether it’s for exercise, or if you can’t work from home.”"
2021-01-18T17:36:36Z,politics,Politics,Seafood lorries travel to Westminster for protest against Brexit red tape,"Fishing lorries from Scotland and Devon have descended on Westminster to stage a protest against the Brexit red tape they say is either delaying or ruining exports of their fresh shellfish to the EU. Trucks with slogans including “Brexit carnage” and “Incompetent government destroying shellfish industry” parked metres from Downing Street on Monday, but they stopped short of carrying out their threat last week to dump fresh fish close to No 10. “We strongly feel the system could potentially collapse,” said Gary Hodgson, a director of Venture Seafoods, which exports live and processed crabs and lobsters to the EU. “Boris Johnson needs to be honest with us, with himself and with the British public about the problems for the industry,” he told Reuters.
One operator, he said, needed 400 pages of export documentation last week to enter Europe. David Rosie at DR Collin & Son, which employs 200 people, used to send one or two lorries a night to France carrying live crab, lobster and langoustine worth about £150,000. He said he had not exported a single box this year. Fishers, he said, “lost their livelihoods in the turn of a clock” when Britain left the EU’s orbit on New Year’s Eve. Johnson has said he “understands the frustrations” of businesses exporting to Europe and pledged that any business experiencing difficulty exporting to the EU “through no fault of their own” would be compensated from a £23m fund that was being set up. He claimed that one of the current problems impacting exports of fish was Covid curbs. “Unfortunately, the demand in restaurants on the continent for UK fish has not been what it was before the pandemic,” Johnson told Sky News.
Exports of fresh fish and seafood have been severely disrupted by delays since the UK’s transition period ended on 31 December with full customs declarations, guarantees over rules of origin and health certificates required for every consignment. Food exporters have been hit badly as they also require a health certificate. In addition, any haulier with a mixed load, or “groupage”, can be held up if just one box on the trailer does not have the right paperwork. The resulting red tape from Brexit has prompted some importers to pay extra for empty trucks to cross the Channel in order to guarantee supplies can get into the country, one EU logistics company said. The company, which did not want to be named, said it had about 50 trucks delivering cargo every week from the EU to the UK, but they were returning empty as importers in key industries such as the motor sector were willing to cough up to ensure smooth passage. “Companies are willing to pay the price for the trucks to go back empty because it’s cheaper than being stuck in a lorry park for four or five days,” said the source. “We charge €400 to €600 a day, so it’s cheaper for companies to pay for the trailer to go back empty and then get another delivery back into the truck. It’s stupid at the end of the day but that is Brexit. “If they have a delivery coming from Belgium or Germany they would prefer the truck to go back and get a second or third delivery,” they added. “The UK is already the laughing stock of Europe with Brexit, but I have to say, and I don’t enjoy saying this, we are making a lot of money out of it,” said the source. The Haulage Association has said “something has to give” over the behind-the-scenes chaos. “The government is dodging bullet after bullet. If it were not for Covid this is a disaster that would be on the front page every day,” said Rod McKenzie, policy director.
Even with the correct paperwork one driver claimed he was issued with an on-the-spot £300 fine because it had taken so long for customs paperwork to be checked as his 24-hour “Kent access permit”, required for all international truck drivers crossing the Channel, had expired. The Department for Transport said that if a driver’s permit has expired, they should get a new one free of charge on the government’s website."
2021-01-18T17:27:17Z,politics,Politics,'A multiple pile-up in the fog': wine agent's fury at Brexit red tape,"A major British wine agent has described how his business is facing its biggest threat in 30 years because the government did not think through Brexit. Daniel Lambert who imports up to 2m bottles of wine a year for 300 retailers including supermarkets, said he is unable to import wine from the EU because of the complex and unworkable HM Revenue and Customs system, which requires companies to work out one of 10,000 different combinations to describe the product they want to import. â€œWe were a pretty good little business, we were doing quite well, until Brexit came along,â€� he said. â€œWhile we knew Brexit would be a car crash we did not know it was going to be a multiple pile-up in the fog with fatalities,â€� he tweeted in a thread over the weekend that has resonated with thousands on Twitter.
â€œHM Revenue and Customs are being as helpful as they can be, but itâ€™s not their fault they are civil servants. This is the governmentâ€™s fault and they donâ€™t give a shit about business. Boris Johnson said â€˜fuck businessâ€™ and this is exactly what they are doing,â€� he said. â€œWe knew they would screw it up, so Iâ€™m not surprised. Iâ€™m just disappointed,â€� he told the Guardian. Lambert, who is temporarily unable to import wine from the EU, said he would survive, but that ultimately consumers will lose out because there will still be a mountain of paperwork â€“ even if the initial problems were sorted out. â€œWine per bottle on retail will increase by at least Â£1 per bottle for mass market products; for niche small batch wines you are looking at Â£1.50 or even Â£2.00 on the bottle prices. Thereâ€™s another of those Brexit â€˜dividendsâ€™,â€� he said. Lambert started his business in Bridgend in 1992 and said this was the biggest threat he had faced, leading him to consider leaving the country when his children complete their education. His was one of the many businesses that thought they were fully prepared, taking detailed steps to mitigate against the worst possible scenario, a no-deal Brexit, five months ago. He went as far as setting up a bonded warehouse system to enable all the customs and duties paperwork to be done in house rather than on the border where they would face impediments in a no-deal scenario. â€œIt was very complicated to get to that point and in fact HMRC told us they were surprised at how prepared we were. â€œBy 9 December we had, as far as we were concerned, done everything we needed to do. â€œNow I literally cannot bring wine in from the EU,â€� he said. At the heart of the issue is a complex piece of paperwork, called Chief, that was used for imports from non-EU countries before Brexit. â€œNow you would think that government would want to make using Chief as easy as possible as now there are millions of businesses having to use it,â€� said Lambert. â€œWrong, this is the only HMRC system where there is no number to call. Just an email with a five-day turn around. Remember that when government say they are doing all they can to help, â€œ said Lambert. His company was familiar with the system as it had for years imported wines from places such as the US and Australia. The system worked for him â€œlike clockworkâ€� until Brexit hit. It requires him to answer 64 questions just to import a bottle of wine and can easily go wrong when it comes to matching a commodity code and a customs procedure code (CPC) as that varies according to the type of wine and its alcohol strength. â€œIf I remember correctly, Chief has 10,000 different combinations depending on what type of import youâ€™re doing, depending on the commodity code itself. So you have to get the combination between the commodity code and the CPC code exactly right, otherwise [it] wonâ€™t allow the declaration to happen, the system wonâ€™t give you the green light,â€� he said. Lambert said the system is â€œantiquatedâ€� and so complex even companies like his that are used to using Chief have come a cropper with next to zero meaningful help from HMRC. â€œI originally put a query into HMRC on 4 January to ask whatâ€™s the CPC code for this [a particular wine] and they said it depends on your declaration, after five days. That was the answer. Well thatâ€™s not really helping is it?â€� â€¢ [Note added 25 January 2021] HMRC told us after publication that it had a dedicated helpline for imports and exports. The number is 0300 322 9434. Businesses can also speak to an adviser online."
2021-01-18T06:00:21Z,politics,Politics,New No 10 team take on Cummings' legacy of chaos and acrimony,"A subtle signal was sent across Whitehall last week when Tom Scholar, once identified by aides loyal to Dominic Cummings as on the notorious “shit list” of senior civil servants, was reappointed as permanent secretary to the Treasury. It appeared that the war once waged against opinionated mandarins was over, and the threats of a revolution had left the building with Boris Johnson’s senior aide. The prime minister now has a new machine, most notably in his chief of staff, Dan Rosenfield, and his press secretary, Allegra Stratton, who plan to give his No 10 tenure a reset. Senior sources said they hoped it would mean a period of reasonable continuity and far less stories about different internal restructures. “It makes a change to have the weekend papers mercifully free of the fascinating ways Cabinet Office rooms are being reorganised,” one MP joked.
Johnson’s boosterism, and Matt Hancock’s, have led to a multitude of issues, including impossible targets being set – as well as a combative approach from the No 10 operation that sought never to give in to press criticism, but which ended up in embarrassing U-turns. Those days are far from over, but there is now a concerted attempt at diplomacy with MPs to try to predict issues before they arise, as well as heavily caveating targets as Johnson did in his press appearances this week about the vaccine rollout. Stratton held a briefing call with Conservative MPs this week, and though a number lined up to berate the government for falling into “bear traps” set by Labour and urged the comms operation to get better at rebuttal, the mood after was optimistic. “It was very good, she was extremely impressive,” said one senior MP. The relaunch has hardly gone without a hitch, because Johnson himself is the root of many of the issues. The prime minister was deeply personally reluctant to cancel the proposed Christmas mixing and so aides dutifully briefed straight after a crisis meeting with the devolved administrations that the prime minister had saved Christmas. But within days the picture was so desperate Johnson had no alternative but to change course. The same pattern followed with schools: it was Johnson who personally held out to keep them open until his chief scientists said they would raise the Covid alert to its highest level, meaning the NHS was under serious threat. Cummings’ big ideas for reform of the civil service and the machinery of government have been a key casualty of his departure. He promised to make it smaller, more nimble, less London-centric and open to “weirdos and misfits”, and cracked down hard on special advisers, making them report directly to him.
One of those named on the “shit list”, Sir Philip Rutnam, resigned after a series of briefings to the media claimed he had obstructed and undermined several home secretaries. He claims he was forced out after standing up to Patel for bullying Home Office staff. In all, five senior civil servants have resigned, and Rutnam is claiming constructive dismissal, but Cummings’ critics say that beyond instilling a fear and resentment, little changed in the structures of the civil service and his reforms to recruitment policies have fallen flat. The five replacements are predominantly from the same backgrounds as their predecessors, there has been no major overhaul of No 10’s structures and recruitment policies have continued much as they were before Johnson’s election. Some within Whitehall say Cummings can claim some credit for arguing that Whitehall offices should move out of London – a proposal that appears to be coming to fruition, with plans for a new northern campus for the Treasury. But Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants and “Spads”, said there was little evidence there would be much – if any – legacy of the Cummings period at No 10.
“For all the talk of reform, the reality felt more like a culture war based on preconceived ideas, rather than a genuine attempt to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the civil service to implement meaningful reform. Chaos and acrimony do not lead to better government, it is not an effective way to lead. Whether those lessons will be learned by No 10, only time will tell.” Johnson still feels strongly about improving government delivery; aides say he has been particularly frustrated in recent days by some of the bureaucratic hurdles around vaccine distribution. Sir Michael Barber, who ran the prime minister’s delivery unit under Tony Blair, has been brought back into Downing Street to oversee a rapid review of government delivery. Insiders are expecting some changes in the Downing Street policy unit, which one described as “shambolic – but mainly because we have no policy”. Other projects spearheaded by Cummings are still alive but are being revised – including his most important personal priority pre-Covid, which was the creation of a “high risk, high reward” research agency modelled on the US’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (Arpa), with a budget of £800m over five years. Cummings felt so passionately about the project that his WhatsApp profile had the slogan “Get Brexit Done then Arpa”. The project was meant to launch last year but no green paper has been forthcoming. Cummings is said to have spent his notice period continuing to work on plans for the government’s mass testing programme, Operation Moonshot. Although Whitehall never calls it so, the programme is still very much alive – though plans to test millions of schoolchildren for coronavirus every week appear to be in disarray after the UK regulator refused to formally approve the daily testing of pupils in England. Another big gamble – a planning algorithm to set targets for new housing – is being radically revised after a Tory revolt. The departure of Johnson’s former senior adviser Lee Cain has also prompted rumours another project is in its death throes – the long-delayed televised Downing Street briefings, to be fronted by Stratton. They were touted to start in October, then January and now postponed until at least the end of lockdown, though No 10 says they will go ahead.
“I would be astonished if they go ahead in the same form,” said one senior Tory source. “The timing has just never seemed right when what people need to hear is from the prime minister, not someone they’ve never heard of. “And the communications team who are now running No 10 are the ones who have been most sceptical about the briefings. Tough restrictions will be needed for a while, then soon as you know it, it’s the summer – can they really continue if they have to delay beyond recess?” Government sources say both Stratton and the director of communications, James Slack, are still fully committed to the briefings – and have the added imperative of having built a £2m broadcast studio. Any rumours of their demise are “total and complete bollocks”, according to one senior source. Another acknowledged there remained some opposition. “Of course there are people who don’t want it to happen – we are dealing with Whitehall and it is a conservative beast but we will get there,” the source said."
2021-01-18T00:07:27Z,politics,Politics,MSP Monica Lennon joins Anas Sarwar in race to lead Scottish Labour,"Monica Lennon, the MSP who led the successful campaign for Scotland to become the first country to provide free, universal access to period products, has announced her aim to be the next leader of Scottish Labour, challenging Anas Sarwar for the position. Confirming her intention to replace Richard Leonard, who resigned last Thursday, just hours before the midnight deadline for potential candidates, Lennon, who is currently her party’s health spokesperson, requires support from at least four of the party’s MSPs or its sole Scottish MP by midday on Tuesday to be formally nominated. Before her declaration, Sarwar, the centrist MSP who was recently made Scottish Labour’s constitution spokesman and who lost to Leonard in the last leadership contest in 2017, was the only candidate. He announced his own plans to run in the Observer, and has already secured nominations from eight Holyrood colleagues. Making her announcement on Twitter, Lennon – who was first elected to Holyrood in 2016 and enjoys strong grassroots support – wrote: “Following discussions with party members, I have decided to put my name forward to lead the Scottish Labour party. Our members deserve to have their say about the best way to take forward our vision for a fairer and more equal Scotland.” The election of Scottish Labour’s fifth leader in a decade comes after Leonard stood down, suggesting speculation about his leadership had become “a distraction”. Many in the party were taken by surprise at the timing of his decision, with Labour trailing the Scottish National party by at least 35 points in opinion polls and at risk of losing a dozen or more seats in May’s Scottish parliament elections. Leonard is believed to have made his decision after losing the confidence of trade union allies, including his own union, GMB Scotland. He narrowly survived a short-lived rebellion over his leadership by fellow MSPs last September. Writing for the Observer, Sarwar said that he had gained a new perspective on party politics and decided “we spend too much time highlighting our differences, rather than focusing on what unites us”. He went on: “I firmly believe we cannot go back to society as it was before the pandemic – insecure work, hollowed-out public services, an underfunded health service, and the constant focus on another independence referendum when there’s far more important things we need to be dealing with.” Before Lennon’s announcement, several Scottish Labour sources said that an unopposed coronation would not serve any new leader who would require a mandate to take the radical action required to overhaul the party’s fortunes. On Saturday, the party’s executive agreed to a condensed timescale for any contest, with the Holyrood elections less than four months away. A new leader is due to be in place by the end of February."
2021-01-17T17:33:25Z,politics,Politics,Tories' London mayoral candidate criticised for comments that 'attack working class families',"The Conservatives’ London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey has been accused of an “attack on working class families”, after comments emerged in which he appeared to suggest that poor people cannot be trusted with money. Bailey is running against the Labour incumbent, Sadiq Khan, in May’s election, which was delayed for a year by the Covid pandemic. A YouGov poll in November suggested Khan has a 21-point lead over his rival. Bailey has already been criticised for a series of controversial comments, including suggesting homeless Londoners could save up a £5,000 deposit for a mortgage. Giving evidence to a House of Commons select committee in 2011, Bailey said: “The key thing about poverty and poor people is that poverty is as much about mindset as it is about money. If you give poor people lots of money, they buy things, and not always what they need; they buy what they want.” The remarks were made when Bailey was an ambassador for David Cameron’s ‘big society’ volunteering initiative. Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said: “This is a disgusting attack on working class families, which reveals the true colours of the Conservative candidate for mayor of London”. In a 2005 pamphlet for the thinktank the Centre for Policy Studies, Bailey had previously claimed that “a culture of dependency rules the working class”, and “this liberal agenda hasn’t benefited the working class. The working class look to rules. The rules are important to them. Take away the rules and they are left in limbo.” He was also criticised last week when he claimed in an interview with Inside Housing magazine that his plans for affordable housing would help homeless people trapped in temporary accommodation because they could save up the necessary £5,000 deposit and secure a mortgage. “I don’t think the £5,000 will [be a problem],” he said. “The mortgage application thing might be a bit tougher … they could save for it, yeah.” Pressed by the interviewer on whether he was suggesting a homeless family in bed and breakfast accommodation could afford a deposit, Bailey replied: “Not all of them, but some people could. A full proportion of people could.” In response to Rayner’s criticism of his 2011 comments, Bailey said: “I grew up in a council house. I was raised by a single mum. I’ve been poor and I’ve been homeless. I’m proud of my working-class roots. “The only attack is coming from City Hall, where Sadiq Khan is raising council tax on working-class families by 10%. Something even Keir Starmer called absurd.” In a recent speech, Starmer called on the government to provide more funding to local authorities to prevent them from having to impose council tax increases at a time when people can ill afford it."
2021-01-17T15:37:12Z,politics,Politics,Corbyn to campaign against Murdoch's News UK TV channel,"Jeremy Corbyn has pledged to campaign against the arrival of Rupert Murdoch’s News UK television channel as he launched his Peace and Justice Project at an online rally. A more “just, free and accountable” media is one of four causes Corbyn is encouraging his supporters to back. He also urged them to help with organising direct support in communities, such as food banks; campaign for a green new deal; and press the government to speed up the delivery of Covid vaccines in developing countries.
“So many of the ideas we need to make the 2020s better than the 2010s were developed in and around the Labour party in recent years, by outstanding thinkers, but more importantly by demands of our movements, and the skills, knowledge and needs of the communities affected,” Corbyn said. “We will build on these policies, taking them further, adapting them to the post-pandemic world, so that our movement can turn the dial towards peace and justice.” Corbyn was readmitted to the Labour party in November, after being suspended over remarks he made when the Equality and Human Rights Commission published its critical report on the party’s handling of antisemitism. But his successor as leader, Keir Starmer, declined to restore the Labour whip to Corbyn, who now sits as an independent MP. The broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, gave the go-ahead last month to Murdoch’s right-leaning news channel, which is expected to be on air for four to five hours a night. It is expected to compete with Andrew Neil’s GB News, with the pair racing to be the first on air. Corbyn repeatedly criticised the role of the media in public life during his time as leader of the opposition. He was ridiculed in some of Murdoch’s newspapers, with the Sun’s front page on election day in 2017 urging its readers: “Don’t chuck Britain in the Cor-bin.” Corbyn gave a lecture at the Edinburgh television festival in 2018 calling for a taxpayer-owned British Digital Corporation to offset the power of multinational corporations in the media, though the policy never found its way into Labour’s manifesto. His digital rally also featured Greece’s former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and the Labour MP for Coventry South, Zarah Sultana. The new initiative will not be signing up members but Corbyn hopes to play a convening role in bringing together activists, trade unions and other leftwing groups. Setting out the aims of his new political venture, he appeared to take a sideswipe at his successor, saying: “If you refuse to argue for your side, our opponents win by default.” Some of Corbyn’s allies believe Starmer has not been sufficiently robust in attacking Boris Johnson’s government – and fear backsliding from some of the radical policies set out in the 2019 general election manifesto. Starmer has adopted the slogan “a new leadership” to differentiate his tenure from Corbyn’s four-and-a-half-year period at the top of the party."
2021-01-17T12:44:19Z,politics,Politics,"Make May elections in England more Covid-safe, Labour urges","Labour has urged ministers to make May’s elections in England more Covid-secure, after the emergence of a Cabinet Office document that warned the pandemic could severely hamper the process and put millions off voting. The paper raises the possibility that even if coronavirus infection levels are relatively low, it could be difficult to attract enough election staff, and that safety fears may “disenfranchise large proportions of [the] community”. Labour is calling for safeguards such as the possibility of spreading voting over several days, or having an all-postal vote, options that have been prepared for elections to the Scottish parliament, also due to take place on 6 May.
The Cabinet Office said the elections document dated from May 2020, and that the scenarios were part of a planning exercise, rather than predictions. Election officials have already said that the English elections will be logistically complicated, not least because they comprise two sets of votes – this year’s, and those postponed from May 2020. There will also be ballots to elect the London mayor and assembly, a series of other mayors, and police and crime commissioners (PCCs), with some voters facing up to seven separate ballots. Although they will be protected by plastic screens, there are concerns about attracting enough volunteer election staff – especially given that many tend to be older – and about finding venues. The May 2020 Cabinet Office document, seen by the Guardian, sets out two hypothetical scenarios. In the first, even though the Covid outbreak has been largely contained, the double set of elections causes “significant challenges for administration and supply”.
The other scenario theorises some limited social distancing measures, even as “overall normality is returning”. Under this, the document posits staff shortages due to redeployment of council officers, home working, and health worries for at-risk staff, plus a greatly increased number of postal votes. It also sets out the idea that social media posts “inciting fear of continued spread of Covid-19 threaten to disenfranchise large proportions of [the] community”. Cat Smith, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, said it was “deeply concerning that ministers have failed to introduce new voting methods used across the world to ensure polls can go ahead safely”. She said: “Labour has consistently called for safer voting methods to be introduced, including voting over multiple days and all-postal voting. Ministers have had many months to make the necessary changes to protect our democratic process, but instead they are treating these elections like business as usual.” While the government has said it will set out its plans for the elections in England soon, there is currently no provision for changes such as spreading the vote over several days. Each UK nation organises its own elections. Scotland and Wales are holding elections on the same day for their parliaments, and for PCCs in Wales. There are no elections in Northern Ireland this year.
The Scottish parliament passed legislation in late 2020 allowing for May’s Holyrood election to be held over two days, for vote counting to take longer, for an all-postal vote election, or even to delay the election if it seen as too unsafe to stage on 6 May. Political parties are likely to put heavy emphasis on postal voting to ensure voters are not put off casting ballots in polling stations, but Scotland’s election management board says polling stations will be safe. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said the elections document set out “hypothetical, made-up scenarios used in a planning exercise by officials back in May 2020. The document clearly states that the scenarios are not predictions.” They said: “Last week, the government set out its action plan to roll out vaccines at pace. We are working closely with the electoral sector, public health bodies and political parties to identify and resolve challenges in the successful delivery of the polls this May. We will set out this detailed planning in due course.”"
2021-01-17T10:57:48Z,politics,Politics,"Arrivals in UK could be asked to stay in quarantine hotels, Raab says","People arriving in the UK could be asked to stay in quarantine hotels under plans being considered by ministers to try to deal with the spread of the pandemic, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has said. Raab said the government had “considered all of the possibilities” when asked about reports in the Sunday Times that ministers have ordered plans to be drawn up for the creation of quarantine hotels for arrivals in Britain. The report says the quarantine hotels, modelled on New Zealand’s policy of “directed isolation”, could use GPS and facial-recognition technology to ensure that people are staying isolated. Raab told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “We will consider all the measures in the round. In terms of enforcement, we are going to be strengthening the checks at the border – so when people come in, to make sure that they have filled out the passenger location form, that they have got that negative test that they have to vouch for before they get on the flight. “Also, because the effect of abolishing or suspending the travel corridors is that people go into quarantine and self-isolation for 10 days, we’re making sure that Public Health England checks to make sure people are adhering to those rules. “As well as changing the rules, we are also making sure that we beef up the capacity to make those checks.” Raab dismissed claims that the government had been too slow in setting up border measures to prevent the importation of new coronavirus variants. He told the Andrew Marr show: “I don’t accept that we have been too slow in this – we are broadly the same pace in terms of Canada and Germany.” Raab said the government target was to have delivered the first dose of the vaccine to 17 million people by spring, when restrictions could be lifted. However, he said that the English lockdown was unlikely to be lifted for the whole country at once, with a return to the tier system. “I think it’s right to say that we won’t do it all in one big bang as we phase out the national lockdown and people end up phasing through the tiered approach. We want to make sure that we can do it in a safe and simple way.”
He said the government would take advice on the easing of restrictions and publish its “exit plan” in due course. Raab would not be drawn on a Sunday Telegraph article reporting that civil servants believed the vaccination rollout could be speeded up to vaccinate all over-18s in Britain by the end of June, but said he was “quietly confident” that the government would meet this target by September. “When I look at the numbers, I think people just want to hear what the real facts are with this. We’ve vaccinated now over 3 million. If you take the UK compared to other countries around Europe, we’ve got double the vaccination rate of the next leading country, Denmark.” He refused to guarantee that all those who had received the first dose would receive the second within 12 weeks, amid concerns about vaccine supplies. “I think if we follow the roadmap and the supply chains that we have set out, along with the backup that we’ve got because we’ve got the volume of doses – 360 million – and we’ve also got seven suppliers, we ought to be able to deliver on that.
“But of course right the way through this pandemic, we’ve had to adapt to all sorts of different things. So we are just focused on making sure we deliver on the roadmap that we’ve got,” Raab said, adding that people get a “very high” level of protection after receiving one dose of a vaccine. The foreign secretary said people should not go on holiday as he warned that the NHS is “on the cusp”. “I think right now people should be staying at home unless it is absolutely necessary, so, no, they shouldn’t be going on holiday – I don’t think that is appropriate,” he told Sky. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said he would “look at” the option of quarantine hotels for passengers returning from abroad. Reynolds told Sky’s Ridge on Sunday: “If that is the most effective way to tackle that, I’d look at that. I’m not sure necessarily it is the case.”"
2021-01-17T10:30:02Z,politics,Politics,Media’s libertarian Covid sceptics under fire from senior Tory,"A vice-chair of the Tory party on Sunday launched a savage attack on prominent Conservative libertarians in the media who have persistently played down the dangers of Covid-19, arguing that they “have a hell of a lot to answer for”.
Neil O’Brien, the MP for Harborough, accuses prominent Tory-supporting journalists of making things up and repeatedly peddling claims that have been disproved. His increasingly heated disagreements with right-wing figures including Toby Young, Allison Pearson and Julia Hartley-Brewer has been building on Twitter over recent days. It mirrors splits among Tory MPs who are themselves deeply divided over how serious the virus is and the need for draconian lockdowns. But writing in the Observer O’Brien goes further, calling the group “the guilty men (and women) of the media” who must themselves be held to account for putting people at risk. He adds: “The truth is, the Covid sceptics aren’t really sceptics at all. They engage in motivated reasoning; make stuff up, and double down on claims that have been disproved. They’re powerful figures in the media, not used to being questioned. But the truth is, they have a hell of lot to answer for.” O’Brien says that from the beginning of the pandemic these media figures underplayed the dangers of Covid-19, then wrongly predicted that the virus was disappearing and by late last summerthen denied there would be a major second wave. Recently, O’Brien writes, they have shifted their arguments again. Now, “with the new variant exploding, and TV news showing ambulances queuing outside hospitals and wards full of people gasping for breath, the story had to change again. Yes, people were now dying. But not in unusual numbers. “On 4 January this year Julia Hartley-Brewer reassured us: ‘The virus kills. It just isn’t causing excess deaths anymore.’ This was rather difficult to square with the Office for National Statistics saying there were excess deaths, and that 2020 had seen the largest increase in deaths in a single year in England and Wales since 1940.” The MP’s clashes with the controversial journalist Young have created particular interest on Twitter. Last Thursday O’Brien tweeted that Young had excised his previous tweets because they had proved to be so wide of the mark on Covid-19. On the same day press regulator Ipso ruled that the Daily Telegraph must publish a correction over a column written by Young in July 2020 containing “inaccurate and misleading information” where he claimed the common cold could provide “natural immunity” to Covid and London was probably approaching herd immunity. “As the UK tragically hits a record number of Covid-19 deaths, Covid-sceptic-in-chief @toadmeister appears to have deleted all his tweets from last year,” O’Brien wrote. Young responded saying he did so because of attacks on intolerant critics of his views: “In fact, I installed an app last week that deletes all tweets more than a week old,” he explained. “This was in response to Twitter’s increasing intolerance of people who challenge liberal orthodoxies including Covid orthodoxy.” Earlier this month Boris Johnson faced another Tory revolt over legislation that placed the country in a third national lockdown as Covid-sceptic MPs on the backbenches made their feelings known. Some 12 Tory and 4 DUP members opposed the legislation. While the rebellion was much smaller than in previous votes – 55 Tory MPs opposed toughening up restrictions in a vote in December – Boris Johnson knows that serious differences of opinion remain that have to be managed. Last week in a message to fellow Tories in the Covid Recovery Group (CRG), which comprises around 70 MPs wary of lockdown measures, Tory MP Steve Baker said the government’s Covid strategy raised questions about the prime minister’s leadership. Baker told fellow MPs it was “imperative you equip the chief whip today with your opinion that debate will become about the PM’s leadership if the government does not set out a clear plan for when our full freedoms will be restored, with a guarantee that this strategy will not be used again next winter”. After his comments created another social media storm Baker later tweeted his complete support for Johnson writing: “What this country needs is the complete success of Boris Johnson, with his excellent EU deal, a successful vaccination programme and a #Road2Recovery back to freedom. I am clear Boris is the only person to lead us out of these difficulties and I support him in that endeavour.”"
2021-01-17T07:30:10Z,politics,Politics,Revealed: Tory MPs and commentators who joined banned app Parler,"At least 14 Conservative MPs, including several ministers, cabinet minister Michael Gove and a number of prominent Tory commentators joined Parler, the social media platform favoured by the far right that was forced offline last week for hosting threats of violence and racist slurs. Parler was taken offline after Amazon Web Services pulled the plug last Sunday, saying violent posts and racist threats connected to the recent attack on the US Capitol violated its terms. Analysts from the London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) said that Parler had become a platform where the ideas of mainstream Conservative MPs coalesced with those of extremists. Milo Comerford, senior policy manager at ISD, said: “By positioning themselves as a safe haven for free speech and an alternative to the alleged ‘liberal bias’ of social media giants such as Facebook and Twitter, platforms like Parler attracted a motley crew of ultra-libertarians, violent extremists and conspiracy theorists, as well as more mainstream ‘free speech fundamentalists.’” At least nine of the Tory MPs on Parler joined the platform in an apparent show of support for free speech following Donald Trump’s clashes with Twitter over remarks he made following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota last year.
The social media giant warned that one of Trump’s tweets “glorified violence”, the first time it had applied such a warning on any public figure’s tweets. Twitter’s row with Trump prompted a campaign by American rightwing voices to move en masse to Parler, which encouraged Trump followers to join on 15 June with a declaration for internet independence. Days later, Foreign Office minister James Cleverly along with Brexiter Steve Baker MP and Ben Bradley MP, who was recently accused of linking free school meals with “crack dens”, joined Parler. Far-right provocateur Katie Hopkins joined on the same day, after her Twitter account was permanently suspended. Hopkins, who on Thursday joined Ukip in time for the party’s leadership contest, owned Parler’s largest UK account with 435,000 followers when it was taken offline. Other Tory MPs to join Parler on the same day as Hopkins include Mark Jenkinson, who last year alleged that food parcels were sold or traded for drugs in his Cumbrian constituency without offering any proof, and trade minister Ranil Jayawardena.
Health minister Nadine Dorries joined Parler on 21 June. Dorries had weeks earlier been reprimanded by Downing Street for sharing a video from a far-right Twitter account that falsely claimed Keir Starmer blocked the prosecution of grooming gang members when he led the Crown Prosecution Service. The most prolific Tory MP on the site was Bradley who sent 52 “parleys” and had more than 12,000 followers. Gove sent at least 26 parleys and had more than 5,000 followers. There is no evidence any Conservative MP posted anything untoward or what might be considered extremist or far right. Some of the accounts had been hardly used and some of those activated in June 2020 appear to have been set up only to support the free speech protest. Other notable Conservative figures on the site include pro-Brexit campaigner Darren Grimes. In June he told his followers on Parler that “it’s about time we fought back against big tech’s assault on free speech, free expression and freedom of association”. Comerford added: “Platforms like Parler must be understood as part of a broad online extremist ecosystem, ranging from mainstream social media platforms, imageboard sites like the chans, to encrypted-messenger apps like Telegram, all of which play roles in helping extremists to mobilise, organise and propagandise.” • This article was amended on 16 January 2021 to remove the statement that Maria Caulfield was on Parler. There is a fake account in the MP’s name on the site."
2021-01-17T06:45:09Z,politics,Politics,"Shock Brexit charges are hurting us, say small British businesses","Government ministers describe the post-Brexit headaches that British exporters have suffered since 1 January as mere “teething problems”. But Alex Paul, who jointly runs a successful family business that features in the Department for International Trade’s list of national “export champions”, disagrees. And he wants the real story to be told. Two weeks into the supposed golden era of global Britain, Paul and many other British entrepreneurs, large and small, are running into very serious problems. UK fish exporters are unable to sell into European markets because of delays at borders and complain that Boris Johnson and others misled them about Brexit. Leading supermarket chains are warning ministers of food shortages in Northern Ireland because of new border rules and bureaucracy. And small UK companies such as Paul’s, which thrived as part of the EU single market, are saying they may have no future at all in exporting into continental Europe because of the crippling new costs. Paul is a director of Leon Paul, based in Hendon, north London, which employs 50 people. It is a niche business, which has been in his family since it was set up in 1921. It designs and manufactures equipment for the Olympic sport of sword fencing. But in many ways it is typical of tens of thousands of small companies that sold some of their goods at home and some abroad, and enjoyed seamless access to the border-free EU market for decades. “Previously the business of sending orders direct to customers in Europe was very straightforward,” he says. “You put something in a box, sent it off with a courier and it got to the customer in a day or two days without any friction, just like sending something within this country.” Almost a third of Leon Paul’s £7m annual turnover is to customers in EU countries. On average each order to the EU has been worth about £200. But the European export side of the business is now looking increasingly unsustainable.
“We did everything we could to prepare for Brexit and are part of the DTI’s export champion community,” says Paul. But since 1 January, his firm – like other UK exporters – has been hit by three new charges. And four days ago the firm discovered another one that his customers in the EU will have to pay on receiving the goods. “As far as I can see, currently, companies like ours in the UK are not going to be able to do ‘end sales’ to customers in the EU any more. Particularly, small orders for anything under £100 will be completely impossible,” says Paul. The new export levies, which he says will amount to £160,000 a year for Leon Paul, are first, a “Brexit charge”, as the couriers are calling it, an export fee of £4.50 for every parcel shipped to the EU to cover costs of extra administration and form filling that couriers must carry out. Second, there is a “deferment account fee” of £5 per parcel that covers couriers’ costs of pre-paying import charges in the destination country; and third, a “disbursement charge” which is set at different levels in each EU country with a minimum of about €14 per parcel, or calculated as a percentage of the value of the goods, whichever is the higher, plus VAT in the destination country. This covers the costs of the tax authority in the recipient country inspecting and processing the parcels. For the past fortnight Paul has been trying to work out how to absorb the extra costs. But he is struggling to see an easy way. “Jobs lost will be lost here,” he says. “That is the reality. All of these fees will come straight off profit margins. “We might save some of the increased costs of doing business in Europe by setting up a warehouse there – and thereby avoid paying charges on every consignment – but we would have to make redundancies in our warehouse here and reduce the size of the business footprint in the UK. We are of course a relatively small business but all exporters will be hit with similar charges.” Were it not for Covid-19, such stories would be dominating the news. Privately ministers know things will get worse. Behind the scenes civil servants in Whitehall are letting it be known that there is little that can be done because the exhaustively negotiated trade deal is largely set in stone. “There is the potential to make some changes if both sides agree – that is in the deal,” said one leader of a UK business organisation. “But there is not much goodwill in the EU to help British business now. Business people like us can ask for more talks with the EU but optimism that we will get anywhere is in short supply.”
On Wednesday the Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis will appear before the all-party Northern Ireland select committee. He is sure to be grilled on why Boris Johnson and he both insisted there would be no such problems. On 1 January Lewis tweeted: “There is no ‘Irish Sea Border’. As we have seen today, the important preparations the Govt and businesses have taken to prepare for the end of the Transition Period are keeping goods flowing freely around the country, including between GB and NI.” As discontent grows ministers are also being warned that Scottish fishing vessels will begin heading in larger numbers to Denmark to land their catches from this week as a result of the bureaucracy created by the Brexit deal. An increase in boats making a two-day round trip to Danish ports has already been detected as trawlers face slumping prices in Scottish ports as a result of difficulties in selling on their catches to the EU in time. Industry figures are already demanding compensation for the businesses that are being hit as a result of the disruption. “It’s not just something you do at the drop of a hat, it’s a couple of days round trip,” said Elspeth Macdonald, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation. “But it does at least give the vessels a decent chance of getting a decent price. Talking to some of the folks in our association, they suggest there would be an increased number of vessels that would probably do that next week. Clearly, that has an impact on the businesses this side, in terms of the auction markets and the processors. “The prime minister has said he recognised that businesses are being affected by these problems and that there would be compensation for businesses affected. While obviously we want the problems to be resolved, it’s really important that those businesses that have lost significant amounts of money – fishing businesses and processing businesses – are able to be compensated for the losses because they have been significant. And we want to see the details of that scheme come forward as quickly as we can.”"
2021-01-17T06:00:08Z,politics,Politics,Proud to be English: How we can shape a progressive patriotism,"Towards the end of his 1930s masterpiece, English Journey, JB Priestley writes of “memories reaching from West Bromwich to Blackburn, Jarrow to Middlesbrough, darkly crowding in on me”. The suffering witnessed by the author during the Great Depression, he explains, turned him into a Little Englander: “That little sounds the right note of affection. It is little England I love. And I considered how much I disliked Big Englanders, whom I saw as red-faced, staring loud fellows, wanting to go and boss everybody about all over the world. Patriots to a man. I wish their patriotism would begin at home.” The writer lived up to the spirit of his prose. The Common Wealth party, in which Priestley was a leading figure, was highly influential in the formation of the postwar welfare state. But it would be very unusual to hear such warm talk about England on today’s left. In Labour circles, the language of nationhood, when used by the English, engenders at best suspicion and more often outright hostility. Brexit, an overwhelmingly English project, only deepened a conviction that rising nationalism in the United Kingdom’s largest country is a much darker affair than its Scottish equivalent. Xenophobia, nostalgia for empire and cultural authoritarianism are judged to be its trademarks. But if progressives are not, paradoxically, to find themselves on the wrong side of history, it might be time for the left to undertake its own English journey. English identity has become a fundamental feature of Britain’s politics . The editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, is completing a book entitled Who Are We Now? Stories of Modern England. In March, the Oxford University Press will publish an academic study entitled Englishness: the political force shaping Britain. The zeitgeist is moving, and England’s left-leaning politicians need to catch up. In Priestley’s time, as far as the English were concerned, England was synonymous with Britain. Big Englanders didn’t need to waste time on clearer definitions. The whole world knew who they were. This fuzziness lasted well into the postwar period. Crowd footage from the 1966 World Cup final at Wembley shows the terraces replete with Union Jacks. For citizens of the overwhelmingly dominant nation in the United Kingdom, pride in England and pride in Britain simply overlapped.
A red, white and blue thread links the nationalism of Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage to this tradition. But the end of Empire and the rise of globalisation, followed by Scottish and Welsh devolution in the 1990s, chipped away at the foundations of what has been called “Anglo-Britain”. Scottish nationalism and the fallout from Brexit seem likely to bury it for ever. In May, assuming elections go ahead, the SNP is likely to regain an overall majority in Holyrood. Turbo-charged by pro-EU sentiment, popular enthusiasm for IndyRef2 may become irresistible. The Brexit trade deal places Northern Ireland firmly in the EU’s orbit. Even in Wales, there has been a surge in support for independence over the past year. A smaller England, post-imperial, post-EU and possibly post-UK, is taking shape. Interviewed by Andrew Marr last week, the academic Ailsa Henderson, co-author of Englishness and a director of the Future of England Survey, testified to a frustrated popular desire for politicians to treat “England as England”. John Denham, the former Labour MP and now director of the Centre for English Identity and Politics, has written that “political Englishness” has been around for 20 years or so. Ignoring it, or disparaging it, contributed to the widespread rejection, in 2016, of a wider European identity. Brexit, at one level at least, was surely the revenge of a repressed or unacknowledged emotional attachment to England, but Labour continues to steer clear of the subject. In his speech last month on devolution and the future of the United Kingdom, Sir Keir Starmer referred to Scotland on 24 occasions. England was mentioned just four times. The Labour leader pledged to devolve power away from Westminster to council leaders, mayors and regions. But the idea of “England as England” remains too neuralgic to broach. As the academic and former Labour MP David Marquand wrote in the New Statesman in 2016: “the notion that the English have to decide who they are and who they want to be” is treated either as a “backward-looking fantasy” or “romantically archaic”. The derision heaped on Rebecca Long-Bailey’s somewhat sketchy formula of “progressive patriotism”, floated during last year’s Labour leadership elections, reveals the depth of distrust. More developed visions of how the left might change its relationship with England are out there waiting to be discussed. The writer and campaigner Anthony Barnett has made a compelling case for an English parliament as part of a remade, federal, equitable and regenerated UK. “The paradox,” Barnett has written, “is that England has to discard Anglo-Britain and become itself in order for the union to survive.” Jon Cruddas, the head of the Labour Party’s policy review under Ed Miliband, has argued that Labour, a party with a distinguished 20th-century history of nation-building and bridging social divides, can wrest the idea of Englishness from the right. “The English,” said Cruddas in 2014, “are independent-minded, sometimes conservative in sentiment, but also radical in outlook. But they feel powerless to shape the future of their country.” Cruddas’s policy review proposed the formation of an English Labour party. Nothing came of it.
Something needs to give. If the English left never bothers to engage with Englishness, its emotional reality becomes the de facto preserve of the right. Fears of pandering to nativism and legitimising nostalgia for a monocultural past are understandable. Memories of the rise of the National Front in the 1970s, and more recently the English Defence League, are still fresh. But what England is and can become need not be imprisoned within the embittered horizon of white English nationalism. The recent Small Axe films by Steve McQueen, exploring black experience across generations, were a landmark moment in the narration of the national story, seven decades after the Windrush arrived in Tilbury Docks. Half a century on from that World Cup triumph against West Germany, the England manager, Gareth Southgate, has championed the “modern England” that his diverse, talented team embodies. One of its members, Marcus Rashford, has become a national hero for his contributions off the pitch.
In parts of the left, there is an unattractive blind spot that misses the importance of collective attachment to an inherited landscape, both physical and emotional. That landscape is not immutable but it shapes a sense of belonging and context. For many Leave voters, particularly those who have traditionally voted Labour, the emotional landscape of “England” has offered a way to express communal values neglected during 30 years of excessive individualism, licensed by both left and right. The SNP in Scotland, steered by Alex Salmond to the left of Labour, understood this, successfully fusing social democratic values with national pride. Where Scotland led, its large southern neighbour can follow. England has a greater level of inter-regional inequality than any other large, industrialised country. A renewed sense of English nationhood can be part of a politics of social justice, greater de-centralisation of power and a re-set relationship with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But to get there, the left must lose its inhibitions and find a way to talk about building a proud, democratic, inclusive “Little England”."
2021-01-16T22:00:43Z,politics,Politics,Anas Sarwar:  ‘I’ll rebuild Labour party in Scotland’,"Anas Sarwar, a 37-year-old former dentist and member of the Scottish parliament, sets out his stall today to become Labour’s next leader in Scotland as he says the cause of equality – not independence – should be top of the political agenda. Sarwar missed out in the race for the leadership four years ago to Richard Leonard, who resigned last week after failing to challenge the SNP as the dominant force in Scottish politics. Writing online in the Observer, the son of former Glasgow Labour MP Mohammad Sarwar and an early frontrunner says his task is to “rebuild” Labour north of the border after recent electoral humiliations. It finished fifth in the 2019 European elections and fourth in the general election later that year in terms of the number of seats won. His fellow MSP Monica Lennon, Labour’s health spokesperson at Holyrood, is seen as another likely candidate. With the campaigns for May’s Holyrood elections due to start in March, Labour sources say they hope to have a new leader in place by the end of February. Sarwar says internal wrangling must be replaced by a sense of united purpose. “Over the past few years, I have gained a new perspective on our politics and realised that the things we argue about mean little to people’s lives. We spend too much time highlighting our differences, rather than focusing on what unites us.” He says life cannot not be the same after Covid-19, and that the focus must be on advancing equality in society rather than the cause of taking Scotland out of the union. “I firmly believe we cannot go back to society as it was before the pandemic – insecure work, hollowed- out public services, an underfunded health service, and the constant focus on another independence referendum when there’s far more important things we need to be dealing with.” He adds: “Scottish Labour can compete again if we offer a positive alternative – a plan to heal our wounds, to reunite our people and to rebuild our country.” He cites his own personal experiences growing up in Glasgow and facing racism, saying they have taught him about the need to speak up and act against prejudice. “Speaking out against the racism I’ve faced was the hardest thing I’ve done in politics. My family faced death threats as a result. But I’ve used that experience to spend my time in our communities working on what unites us and bringing people together – I have listened and I have learnt. “I want to bring that same approach to our Labour movement so that we can rebuild our party and rebuild our country.” Leonard resigned last Thursday, throwing Labour into turmoil just months before the crucial Scottish elections – which the SNP hope will demonstrate increased support for independence – are due to take place. In a statement Leonard, who was from the party’s left and an ally of former leader Jeremy Corbyn, said after having failed to re-establish Labour as a threat to the SNP he had “come to the conclusion it is in the best interests of the party” to step aside."
2021-01-16T21:00:42Z,politics,Politics,Firms accused of putting workers’ lives at risk by bending lockdown trading rules,"Irresponsible firms are exploiting looser lockdown regulations to bring thousands of non-essential workers into sometimes busy workplaces, with little chance of enforcement action by the nation’s safety watchdog. Analysis by the Observer shows that no enforcement notices have been served on companies by Health and Safety Executive (HSE) inspectors for Covid safety breaches since the country went into the latest lockdown, despite being contacted 2,945 times about workplace safety issues between 6 and 14 January. Overall, just 0.1% of the nearly 97,000 Covid safety cases dealt with by the agency during the pandemic appear to have resulted in an improvement or prohibition safety notice, with not a single company prosecuted for Covid-related breaches of safety laws. This comes as the latest Public Health England surveillance data suggests workplace infections surged as people returned to work in January. The number of coronavirus outbreaks in workplaces rose by almost 70% in the first week of the national lockdown, with 175 Covid case clusters reported in English workplaces, not including care homes, hospitals and schools. New polling carried out by the TUC shows that fewer than half of workers are in workplaces with Covid-secure risk assessments. In the past week, the government has focused attention on the failure of some people to stick to social distancing rules, from the release of a video of police approaching an individual in a parked car to an advert warning that “grabbing a coffee can kill”. But experts and unions have warned that unsafe workplaces may be playing a bigger role in fuelling the pandemic. “If the government is upping enforcement, ministers should start with employers who break Covid safety rules,” said TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady. She called for big increases in resources for the HSE to stop rogue employers getting away with putting staff at risk. Non-essential shops are supposed to be shut and most workers are expected to work from home to reduce the transmission of the virus, but unlike the first national lockdown all businesses are allowed to provide click and collect services in England. This contrasts with Scotland, where non-essential retailers were on Saturday banned from allowing customers to pick up goods ordered online. Shop assistant Mike Richards, who works in a luxury fashion store in the centre of Birmingham, was furloughed during the first national lockdown in March but ordered to come into work last week to make sales calls alongside his colleagues under the guise of click and collect. “We got an email out of the blue saying, ‘You’ve got to get back into the store to sell.’ This is a luxury fashion brand – how can it be essential?”
Richards (not his real name) had to travel by train into work and was told to call clients who had previously bought luxury handbags. “There were eight of us in the store that day. We were masked up but there was hardly any socially distancing,” he said. “Every single facet of what we’re doing could be done in the comfort of our own homes. But we’re being forced to go in. It’s an irresponsible act, for the sake of a little bit of profit for a multibillion-pound company.” He added that staff had been given letters in case they were stopped by the police on the way to work. “It says, ‘We are carrying out duties of click and collect and home deliveries.’ Nowhere does it say, ‘This person is in the store selling’, which is what we are actually doing.” Professor Susan Michie, who sits on one of the government’s Sage subcommittees, said people were being needlessly driven into workplaces amid a raging pandemic, which has pushed the NHS to the brink in many parts of the country. “Every day I get contacted by distraught people who are being forced into workplaces, which they feel are completely unsafe. They are having to choose between the risk of serious illness or death and losing their job – not to mention the risk of spreading the virus on the way to and from work.” She added that click and collect services were providing transmission routes for Covid. “They should all be shut down unless absolutely essential,” said Michie. As well as clamping down on click and collect abuses, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, also placed a legal obligation on employers to ensure people can work from home wherever possible. This contrasts with England, where businesses only have to facilitate working from home. Administrator Sandra Jackson, who works for a small vehicle supplier in Essex, was ordered to come in last week, even though there has been an outbreak of coronavirus, with just over a third of the workforce testing positive in December and January. “I worked from home for one day and then I got a message saying, ‘This isn’t working. We won’t allow you to work from home.’ I’m absolutely furious about it.” Tradespeople in England are still allowed to carry out all types of work in people’s homes. Electrician Stuart Collins has been ordered to install smart meters in multiple homes every day. “If people had lost supply or if it was a new connection, I would have no issue whatsoever,” he said. “But exchanging existing meters for smart meters is not essential. All we are doing is assisting this virus to spread. They are putting financial gain ahead of people’s lives.” Professor Stephen Reicher, who advises both the UK and Scottish government, called on UK ministers to follow Sturgeon’s lead. “People have got to have the right to work at home if they can,” he said. “These are not wild and woolly ideas. They’re happening in Scotland. They could be very easily done. But the UK government seems to want to keep its head in the sand.” Michie said more businesses were being allowed trade in England and more workers were going into workplaces because the government’s lockdown rules were so broad that almost any businesses could claim to be essential. “The government has effectively handed responsibility to employers to say whether they are essential or not,” she said.
The HSE said it had scaled up its proactive work to check, support and advise businesses on public health guidance. It added that it had carried out more than 32,000 site visits during the pandemic. “Inspectors continue to be out and about, putting employers on the spot and checking that they are complying with health and safety law. Our role in contributing to the national response to reduce Covid-19 transmissions and support economic recovery has been widely recognised,” said a spokesperson. A government spokesperson said: “The law is clear that people can only leave the home to work if they cannot reasonably work from home. We have worked with trade unions, businesses and medical experts to produce comprehensive Covid-secure guidance so that businesses permitted to remain open can do so in a way that is as safe as possible for workers and customers.”"
2021-01-16T20:00:40Z,politics,Politics,"Close coffee shops and nurseries during lockdown, voters say in new poll","Most people now believe takeaway coffee shops, cafes and children’s nurseries should be closed in a further tightening of the national lockdown, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. A majority of voters also think lockdown rules should be tightened on outside exercise with a ban on people walking or exercising with anyone from a different household. The findings are in line with a growing view among voters that the government is not responding fast or strongly enough to the virus. The proportion who think ministers are under-reacting is now 51% (+7 points) compared with a week ago, while the proportion who think they haven’t reacted quickly enough is 75%, (up 3) on last week and the highest Opinium has recorded. This latter figure includes 60% of people who voted Conservative at the last general election in December 2019. Some 51% believe takeaway coffee shops and cafes should close while 61% say it is time for nurseries to shut. There are broadly similar majorities in favour of tighter rules on outside exercise (53%), with 55% supporting the suspension of click and collect services in all but essential shops. Labour holds a four-point lead over the Conservatives in the latest poll, on 41% (up 1 point on a week ago) with the Tories on 37% (-2). This is the joint highest lead Opinium has recorded for Labour since the last election. The Liberal Democrats and SNP are on 6%, the Green Party on 4%, and Plaid Cymru on 1%. Johnson has also recorded his lowest score on Opinium’s “best prime minister” tracker, with just 29% picking him against 32% who would prefer Labour leader Keir Starmer. Johnson also records his lowest net approval since the last general election in December 2019, at -14 (34% approve while 49% disapprove). Starmer’s net approval has also dropped since last week from +15 to +10 now. Just 37% approve of the job he is doing as Labour leader, with 27% disapproving. Adam Drummond of Opinium said: “One of the consistent themes of this pandemic has been a government which is petrified of being punished by the voters for putting in place too many restrictions, and a public crying out for further restrictions because they are petrified of the spread of the virus. “The data from this week’s poll is probably the most extreme example of this trend, and perhaps one of the reasons why we have seen such a drop in support for the government.” Just 30% (-1) now approve of how the government has handled Coronavirus, compared to 50% (+2) who disapprove."
2021-01-16T17:02:44Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer outlines 'optimistic' future for UK with Biden as president,"Sir Keir Starmer has set out his “optimistic” vision for a wide-ranging new relationship with the US under Joe Biden. Speaking before Biden’s inauguration on 20 January, Starmer said he was “incredibly optimistic about the new relationship we can build” and that Britain must once again be “the bridge between the US and the rest of Europe”. The speech marks Starmer’s first full remarks on UK foreign policy since being elected Labour leader.
He described himself as “pro-American but anti-Trump”, saying he was committed to a new US-UK relationship, consisting of “a strong future together, on everything from security, climate change, aid and trade”. He said Boris Johnson had spent the last few years “cosying up to people who don’t have Britain’s interests at heart – thumbing his nose at our friends, breaking international law and courting the idea that he’s ‘Britain’s Trump’”. In contrast, he said that under a Labour government, Britain would seek to act as a “moral force for good in the world” after “a decade of global retreat” under the Conservatives. He drew on the examples of the work done under former Labour prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and urged Johnson to use this year’s hosting of the G7 summit to bring countries together to rebuild after the pandemic. “Britain needs to seize this chance to lead in the world again, just as Blair and Brown did over global poverty and the financial crisis, that’s what Britain can achieve,” he said. “The outgoing president is in the middle of being impeached; charged with incitement to violence, no less. And the US is more divided than at any time I can remember. “Amid all that, this is a moment of huge optimism. Of hope winning out over hate. And it can also be a turning point. Not just in America but also for Britain’s relationship with the US, and for global politics.” At the same time the Labour leader said he would look to build a “close economic relationship” with the EU, rooted in shared values with high standards and protections for businesses, working people and the environment. “Of course, Boris Johnson will never do that. He wants something completely different from Brexit. To deregulate, to lower standards, to slash rights,” he said."
2021-01-16T15:25:04Z,politics,Politics,Priti Patel faces growing pressure over deletion of police records,"Priti Patel is under mounting pressure to give a full account of a police computer error, which may have affected more than 400,000 crime records. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, the former director of public prosecutions, highlighted the gravity of the issue on Saturday and that some of the lost files pertained to live investigations. He urged the home secretary to take responsibility for the fiasco. The blunder, in which records for serious offences supposed to be kept in perpetuity were accidentally deleted, left police fearing criminals may not be caught – with officers already suffering what they term “near misses” for serious crimes.
The junior Home Office and Ministry of Justice minister Kit Malthouse released a statement on Friday blaming human error and saying urgent efforts were under way to recover the data and assess the full extent of the issue. He later said contingency plans had been put in place to ensure investigations could continue. Starmer told Sky News: “This government is very good whenever there is a problem at saying it’s somebody else’s fault. At a time like this we need the home secretary to take responsibility herself for this. At the very least she should be in parliament on Monday making a statement about this, explaining it, giving it the full facts and facing questions from MPs. That’s the least we should expect.” The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, also told the broadcaster: “You do not make our streets safer by losing such a substantial amount of information about criminal behaviour. This is extraordinarily serious. “The home secretary needs to be gripping this and tell us what’s going to be done to mitigate the risk, to try and recover this data and how do we prevent it from happening again.” Late on Saturday afternoon, Patel said Home Office engineers were continuing to work to restore data lost following a routine housekeeping process earlier this week. “Public safety is the number one priority of everyone within the Home Office, and I would like to thank the data engineers working to restore these records,” she said. “I continue to be in regular contact with the team, and working with our policing partners, we will provide an update as soon as we can.” A letter sent to senior officers on the National Police Chiefs’ Council on Friday from Naveed Malik, lead for the organisation on the police national computer (PNC), seen by the Guardian, outlined the scale of records affected. “Approximately 26,000 DNA records corresponding to 21,710 subjects have potentially been deleted in error, including records that have previously been marked for indefinite retention following conviction of serious offences,” he said. The letter revealed cases where some people police suspect nearly got away because of the blunder: “We are aware of a couple of instances of ‘near misses’ for serious crimes where a biometric match to an offender was not generated as expected but the offender was identified through matches between scenes. However, in these circumstances, without a direct match report to the subject, it may be more challenging for police to progress to an interview or arrest. “We are also aware of at least one instance where the DNA profile from a suspect in custody did not generate a match to a crime scene as expected, potentially impeding the investigation of the individual’s involvement in the crime.” Technicians are also scrambling to recover tens of thousands of fingerprint records, according to Malik’s letter, which said “30,000 fingerprint records and 600 subject records have potentially been deleted in error”. The deletion also caused chaos with the visa process. Applications, which are checked against the PNC, were suspended for two days but have now resumed. The Guardian understands that a rapid review identified the problem and corrected it so it cannot happen again. Malthouse said on Saturday: “As I’ve said, the affected records apply to cases where individuals were arrested and then released with no further action, and we are working to recover the affected records as a priority. “While we do so, the police national computer is functioning and the police are taking steps to mitigate any impact.”"
2021-01-16T07:00:25Z,politics,Politics,Brexit delays Mojo magazine as cover CDs remain stranded in EU,"The venerable cover CD, beloved of music magazine buyers for a generation, has been challenged by Brexit after Mojo was forced to postpone distribution of its next issue because of a delay in delivery. In an email to subscribers on Friday, Mojo said that while the magazine itself was printed, “the CDs which are produced in the EU, are not yet in the UK”. It is understood that the issue was caused by hold-ups in the process caused by new trade rules. Mojo, which apologised to readers and said they would be given early access to the digital edition of the magazine, is the victim of the latest logistical hiccups to strike business since the Brexit transition period ended. German freight giant DB Schenker paused UK deliveries on Thursday, blaming increased paperwork, while companies including Fortnum and Mason have reported problems delivering to customers in the EU and Northern Ireland. Marks & Spencer said it was concerned that a third of the products in its Irish food halls, including Percy Pigs, would now be subject to import tariffs. Meanwhile, international delivery giant DPD also said it was “pausing” road service from the UK into Europe last week. Mojo’s problem represents another challenge to the economics of the cover-mounted CD. Once a prized staple of music and technology magazines and even deemed a threat to the music industry when they appeared in weekend newspapers, they are now largely anachronistic as most people access entertainment online and fewer have CD players. The heritage music magazine is not the only publication to fall foul of Brexit-related issues. Electronic Sound magazine also said it had been forced to delay its next issue, editor Push told the Guardian, saying that a problem with the free vinyl sent to subscribers was “the result of issues with changing to a UK supplier”. Oliver Condy, editor of BBC Music Magazine, said he had feared the same issue with cover CDs and he had been “planning for this for months and months”. “We sent materials to the [CD] presses a couple of months early,” he said. “We haven’t seen the results yet, but we’ve got our fingers crossed it will be fine.” Bauer, Mojo magazine’s publisher, declined to comment, saying it was “still a live situation”. • This article was amended on 16 January 2021. The original incorrectly said Ocado was among the companies reporting problems delivering to customers in the EU and Northern Ireland. The firm only has customers in Great Britain (primarily England)."
2021-01-15T23:10:10Z,politics,Politics,‘Internexit’ for Leave.EU as domain name temporarily suspended,"Leave.EU has been forced to “Internexit” after the group’s EU domain name was temporarily suspended. It comes after the Irish businessman in whose name the pro-Brexit campaign group’s domain name is registered denied having any involvement with the organisation. Now visitors to the site are greeted with an error message, and the EU’s online registry marks the domain as under a server hold, meaning it is “temporarily inactive and under investigation”. Following Brexit, UK organisations are no longer able to use the .EU top-level domain, a change which – ironically – affected the pro-Brexit group, the most prominent owner of an EU domain name in Britain. Irish businessman Sean Power, who is based in Waterford, is still registered as the legal owner of the domain name. However, he has long insisted he has no knowledge of Leave.EU, and had never heard of the organisation before the Guardian contacted him on 7 January. “My lawyers are looking into this on my behalf presently and will be in touch as deemed necessary in due course,” he said last week. Last week, Neale Richmond, a member of the Irish parliament, wrote to ComReg, the country’s communications regulator, calling for an investigation into how Leave.EU was able to secure the domain name. “It is utterly ridiculous to think that Leave.EU could brass-plate an address in Waterford to maintain their domain name,” Richmond said on Friday. “They wanted to leave the EU, they have, that means they leave their domain too. “Many other questions in relation to data storage, fundraising, finances, donations and political activities would need to be answered if Leave.EU were genuinely relocating to Waterford. “Leave.EU are quite simply not welcome in Ireland, their questionable activities over the past number of years have brought a new level of toxic politics in the UK and beyond. “I welcome the suspension of this domain; I sincerely hope this is the end of this odious website and the related traffic driven to this odious brand. Good riddance.” But Andy Wigmore, the communications director for the campaign group, told the Guardian: “We’ll be back up soon – our lawyers will be taking action against those (and they know who they are) who have broken those delicious EU laws they love so much.” Calling Richmond a “third-rate EU fanatic,” Wigmore added: “if he wants to make those cowardly defamatory allegations outside of parliamentary privilege let’s see how massive Billy big balls Neale is then. “And any more nonsense from Brussels lovers like him and we may decide to put the full weight of Leave.EU behind the IREXIT campaign.”"
2021-01-15T22:30:27Z,politics,Politics,"Over 400,000 crime records could be affected by police computer error","More than 400,000 crime records could have been affected by a data blunder, with records for serious offences supposed to be kept forever accidentally deleted and police fearing criminals may not be caught, a letter from a senior officer reveals. The records were accidentally deleted due to a coding error on 10 January, and the incident affects fingerprints, DNA, and arrest records on the police national computer (PNC). The Guardian has learned that records related to serious offences, meant to be kept “indefinitely”, have been affected and police have already suffered what they term as “near misses” for serious crimes. Police leaders are also concerned that the chaos may cause them to hold data they should have legally deleted. Pressure is mounting on the home secretary, Priti Patel, to give a full account of the blunder affecting the PNC, which is run by the Home Office. A letter sent to senior officers on the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) on Friday from deputy chief constable Naveed Malik, lead for the organisation on the PNC, outlines the scale of records affected: “In PNC approximately 213,000 offence records, 175,000 arrest records and 15,000 person records have potentially been deleted in error. In terms of understanding the potential linkage between records, a one-person record can have multiple arrest records and one arrest record can have multiple offences linked to it.” The DNA database is connected to the PNC and has also been hit, the police chief’s letter reveals. It says: “Approximately 26,000 DNA records corresponding to 21,710 subjects have potentially been deleted in error, including records that have previously been marked for indefinite retention following conviction of serious offences.” Technicians are also scrambling to recover tens of thousands of fingerprint records, according to the deputy chief constable’s letter, which says that “30,000 fingerprint records and 600 subject records have potentially been deleted in error”. Police fear offenders may be missed. Malik wrote in the letter to police chiefs: “As the National DNA Database and the National Fingerprint Collection currently contain incomplete sets of biometric records, there is the possibility that biometric matches between crime scenes and offenders may not be identified.” The letter reveals cases where some people police suspect nearly got away because of the blunder: “We are aware of a couple of instances of ‘near misses’ for serious crimes where a biometric match to an offender was not generated as expected but the offender was identified through matches between scenes. However, in these circumstances, without a direct match report to the subject, it may be more challenging for police to progress to an interview or arrest. “We are also aware of at least one instance where the DNA profile from a suspect in custody did not generate a match to a crime scene as expected, potentially impeding the investigation of the individual’s involvement in the crime.” The Home Office said it was working with police to assess the impact of the error, which reportedly occurred by accident during a weekly “weeding” session to expunge data. The policing minister, Kit Malthouse, said the PNC was a large database of information that requires maintenance, adding: “Unfortunately down to human error, some defective code was introduced as part of that routine maintenance earlier this week and that’s resulted in a deletion of some records and that’s currently under investigation. “We are now working very quickly with policing partners and within the Home Office to try and recover the data and assess the full extent of the problem.” Although officials are “not entirely sure as yet” whether the problem has had an operational impact on the police, Malthouse said, contingency plans have been put in place to ensure investigations can continue. The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, called on Patel to make an urgent statement: “It’s not good enough for the home secretary to hide behind her junior minister on this when there has been such a major security breach on her watch. “It’s now vital that she makes an urgent statement outlining the true scale of the issue, when ministers were informed and what the plan is to provide public reassurance. Yet again, Conservative incompetence is putting people’s safety at risk.” He added: “This is an extraordinarily serious security breach that presents huge dangers for public safety. The incompetence of this shambolic government cannot be allowed to put people at risk, let criminals go free and deny victims justice.” On Friday night Thomas-Symonds wrote to Patel, urging her to show “personal responsibility and leadership” and asking when ministers were first made aware of the breach, if local forces had been informed of potential impacts in their area, and what steps were being taken to retrieve the data. The PNC allows real-time checks on people and vehicles. Millions of records are kept on it, and they are removed automatically after certain periods depending on the nature of the offence, the suspect’s history and other factors.
The deletion also caused chaos with the visa process. Applications, which are checked against the PNC, were suspended for two days but have now resumed. A spokesperson for the NPCC said: “We are aware of an issue with the PNC and are working closely with the government to understand the potential operational impacts.”"
2021-01-15T18:16:00Z,politics,Politics,UK Covid: Boris Johnson says all travellers to UK must show negative coronavirus test from Monday - as it happened,"To prevent new variants arriving in the country, all travel corridors will be closed from 4am on Monday. All arrivals will need a negative Covid test and must quarantine for 10 days upon arrival. The vaccine is â€˜steadily protecting those most at riskâ€™, Boris Johnson said. Almost 45% of over-80s and 45% of care home residents have been vaccinated. The spread of the virus is â€˜slowing right downâ€™ in most parts of the UK, Chris Whitty said, but warned hospitalisations and deaths would likely continue to rise into next week. There are early signs the restrictions are working, with the R number estimated to have narrowed to between 1.2 and 1.3, compared to 1 and 1.4 last week. In London, where tougher restrictions came in earlier, the R number is lower, estimated - based on data up until 11 January - to be between 0.9 and 1.2, compared with 1.1 and 1.4 the previous week. The UK government said a further 1,280 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Friday, bringing the official total to 87,295. The government also said that, as of 9am on Friday, there had been a further 55,761 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK. It brings the total number of cases in the UK to 3,316,019. You can view the data dashboard here. Separate figures published by the UKâ€™s statistics agencies for deaths where Covid-19 has been mentioned on the death certificate, together with additional data on deaths that have occurred in recent days, show there have now been 102,000 deaths involving Covid-19 in the UK. Wales will introduce new Covid risk assessments for workplaces, shops and supermarkets amid concerns some businesses are not taking restrictions seriously enough. All retailers will be required by law to put in place measures such as limiting the number of customers, while workplaces are to be obliged to carry out Covid assessments taking into account the new more easily transmissible variant. Wales also introduced mandatory testing for international arrivals. Passengers planning to travel into Wales from abroad will have to prove they have tested negative for coronavirus before their departure from 4am on 18 January. The new Brazilian variant of concern has not yet been detected in the UK, Prof Wendy Barclay, G2P-UK lead and head of department of infectious disease and chair in influenza virology at Imperial College London, said. It comes as Britainâ€™s ban on the arrivals of travellers from South American countries and Portugal came into effect at 4am on Friday morning, to limit the spread of a concerning new variant. The Supreme Court â€œsubstantially allowedâ€� an appeal brought by the FCA in a landmark Â£1.2bn legal battle over businessesâ€™ ability to claim on insurance for coronavirus-related disruption. The UK economy is edging towards a double-dip recession as GDP fell 2.6%. Official figures confirmed a renewed slump in November fuelled by the second national coronavirus lockdown in England. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. You can continue to follow our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic over on the global live blog, where the news has just broken that a tragic global milestone has been reached. More than two million lives across the world have now been lost to Covid-19. My colleague Mattha Busby has this very sobering reminder: It took eight months to hit 1 million dead. It took less than four months after that to reach the next million."
2021-01-15T06:00:29Z,politics,Politics,Migrant healthcare workers on Covid frontline angry about deportation risk,"Migrant doctors and other healthcare professionals who have contracted Covid-19 while caring for NHS patients sick with the virus say they are devastated that a parliamentary bill that would have given them the right to remain in the UK has been postponed. The healthcare workers said they were holding out hope that the second reading of the private members’ bill – which had been scheduled for 15 January and is now cancelled – could give them immigration security if passed. The immigration (health and social care staff) bill 2019-21 calls for migrant healthcare workers to be granted indefinite leave to remain. It is similar to the citizenship being granted in France to frontline migrant workers. The Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine, who sponsored the bill, has called on the government to consider debating bills such as this one remotely; private members’ bills were cancelled for several months due to the pandemic. “I make no bones about the fact that I would like the government to recognise the contribution made by the NHS workers – the foreign nationals – who have done so much for this country in this crisis,” she said in a blog post on Wednesday. The Royal College of Physicians, Royal College of Nursing, Doctors Association UK, Independent Age and Unison are all backing the bill along with organisations supporting migrants such as the Joint Council for Welfare of Immigrants. MPs have received 7,400 letters in support of the bill. Dr Femi Osunlusi, a senior house officer in general surgery at Walsall Manor hospital, said migrant healthcare workers were shattered by the cancellation of a bill they had hoped would provide them with a lifeline. Osunlusi contracted Covid-19 over Christmas, as did his wife, who is a physiotherapist. Both are now back at work. “If I didn’t go back to work, there would be gaps in the rota,” he said. He added that many migrant healthcare professionals were putting their lives on the line caring for Covid patients but faced immigration insecurity, having to apply every year for five years to renew their work visas. “If my employer chooses to stop my certificate of sponsorship, I can be deported at any time, despite the contributions I have made to this country,” he added.
Another doctor, Hassan Malik, currently off sick with Covid, said: “Migrant NHS workers have made an unquantifiable contribution to the treatment of the UK population during the coronavirus pandemic. Despite risking their lives during this crisis, these NHS workers on non-permanent visas have had to work knowing they and their families could be deported if they are struck by Covid. “The uncertainty of our immigration status hangs over us like the sword of Damocles. Without the assistance of these hardworking foreign nationals, our NHS would be in dire straits. I was working on a Covid ward and managed to avoid getting [the virus then]. But the new strain is much more transmissible, and I caught it.” There are 84,316 non-EEA internationally educated nurses working in health and care across the UK. The Royal College of Physicians’ annual 2018-19 census of consultant and higher specialty trainee physicians revealed that 43% of advertised consultant posts with an advisory appointments committee went unfilled due to a lack of suitable applicants. There are about 112,000 vacancies in adult social care in England on any given day. The immigration minister, Kevin Foster, said: “We are hugely grateful for the vital contributions all NHS staff have made during the pandemic, which is why we have introduced a range of unprecedented measures to ensure the health and care sector are supported fully. “Last year, we launched the health and care visa for eligible professionals and their families, which provides fast-track entry, reduced fees and dedicated support. This includes exempting health and care workers from payment of the immigration health surcharge, and extending the visas of more than 6,000 frontline health workers and their dependants for free.”"
2021-01-15T00:01:21Z,politics,Politics,"Johnson represents ‘boys’ club’ approach to Commons, says Rudd","Boris Johnson is emblematic of a “boys’ club” approach to the House of Commons which makes it harder for women to win promotion, his former cabinet colleague Amber Rudd has said as part of a project in which former ministers reflected on their time in power. Rudd, who was home secretary under Theresa May, and then quit as work and pensions secretary when Johnson was prime minister, said he was part of an “establishment group” whose style meant the political prospects for women were actually diminishing. “There is a kind of boys’ club-type behaviour in parliament because it is still more like a public school or a university club than anywhere else you’ll ever go,” Rudd told the Institute for Government (IFG). “I fear that it’s going backwards a bit at the moment because unless you have the leadership really making an effort to ensure that women are promoted as equals, all the time – not just because, ‘oh, let’s promote the women, we forgot about the women’ – it’s going to be a problem,” she said. “I see that in Boris Johnson, I’m afraid. Even though I don’t dislike him at all. He’s come from that establishment group. And also, he has that sort of language, which he’s – quite rightly – nervous of using in front of women.” Rudd said she had left Johnson’s cabinet amid a purge of Tory MPs over Brexit because of the way he treated people. “It was Boris Johnson’s style of government, really,” she said. “It was the way he treated other people and his determination to deliver Brexit, whatever the cost in terms of the economy and, I thought, the consequences to people’s lives.” Another former minister, Andrea Leadsom, said that when she was the Commons leader, her relations with John Bercow, the then Speaker, were so bad that eventually they could not have their scheduled weekly meetings alone. “It reached a point where I had to take someone with me, because of the level of vitriol in those meetings,” Leadsom said. “And he, likewise, said he needed to have someone there, because apparently I was extraordinarily difficult.” The two clashed repeatedly over how the Commons should operate amid a chaotic period when May was trying to get a Brexit deal through parliament. At one point Bercow was accused of calling Leadsom a “stupid woman” in parliament, which he denied. In another interview, Jeremy Wright, the former attorney general, who was a cabinet minister under both May and David Cameron, said the latter “let his irritation show more often and more visibly than Theresa ever did”. He also expressed regret at not having pushed back more against newspaper headlines condemning judges over their handling of high-profile Brexit cases. At its peak, a Daily Mail headline from November 2016 called three high court judges, who ruled that parliamentary consent was needed for the government to trigger the Brexit process, “Enemies of the People”. Wright told the IFG: “Where I think we were going wrong … was to allow the sort of abuse to play out in the newspapers, of those who were doing their job as judges and as lawyers.”"
2021-01-14T22:57:55Z,politics,Politics,Government rejects report it will lower workers' rights post-Brexit,"The government has rejected a report that following Brexit, it plans to tear up employment protections based in EU law – a strategy that Labour has called “a disgrace”. Proposals include an end to the 48-hour maximum working week, changes to rules about breaks at work, and removing overtime pay when calculating certain holiday pay entitlements, the Financial Times said. Another proposal would be to get rid of the current requirement for businesses to log information about daily working hours, to save on administration costs. The package is being drawn up within the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, the newspaper said, and while it has not been put to other ministers, the department has consulted some business leaders.
Such a move would prompt fierce opposition from unions and from Labour, with Boris Johnson’s government having pledged that the ability to diverge from EU rules post-Brexit would not involve watering down employment rights. But Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary – who took the job last week after his predecessor, Alok Sharma, was given a full-time role leading preparations for the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow in November – rejected the claims. “We are not going to lower the standards of workers’ rights,” he tweeted. “The UK has one of the best workers’ rights records in the world – going further than the EU in many areas. We want to protect and enhance workers’ rights going forward, not row back on them.” But his Labour shadow, Ed Miliband, said the FT report “exposes the truth about the government’s priorities, which are way out of step with the needs of workers and their families”. Miliband said: “In the midst of the worst economic crisis in three centuries, ministers are preparing to tear up their promises to the British people and taking a sledgehammer to workers’ rights. “These proposals are not about cutting red tape for businesses but ripping up vital rights for workers. They should not even be up for discussion. People are already deeply worried about their jobs and health. It’s a disgrace the government is considering forcing them to work longer hours or lose paid holidays.” Any deviation from EU standards could trigger retaliatory measures such as tariffs by Brussels, as permitted under the trade deal with the UK sealed on Christmas Eve. However, this would be gauged against the impact of any UK changes on competition. Under the European working time directive, weekly working hours should not exceed 48 hours on average, along with other stipulations such as a guaranteed rest break for work periods over six hours, and at least 11 consecutive hours of rest every 24. The UK, like some EU members, allows people to opt out of the 48-hour maximum. But the government stresses that some UK provisions go beyond the working time directive, such as a minimum full-time holiday entitlement of more than five weeks a year, against the EU’s four."
2021-01-14T19:56:26Z,politics,Politics,UK to ban travellers from South America and Portugal from Friday,"The UK government has been accused of putting lives at risk with a botched border policy after it banned arrivals from South America and Portugal several days after concerns emerged about a new Brazilian variant of Covid. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, announced that arrivals from more than a dozen countries including Argentina, Venezuela, Bolivia and Peru would be halted. He said Portugal had also been included because of its close travel links with Brazil. It is unclear as yet whether the Brazilian strain may be vaccine-resistant. UK citizens and permanent residents will be exempt from the travel ban but they and their families will have to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival.
The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, welcomed the measures as necessary but criticised the government’s failure to implement more systematic checks on arrivals. “This is yet another example of government incompetence, lurching from one crisis and rushed announcement to another. The failure to put in place an effective policy on testing before entry and a quarantine system that is checking only one in 100 people is putting lives at risk,” he said. The new measures came 24 hours after Boris Johnson was pressed by Labour’s Yvette Cooper about why he had not taken more urgent action in response to reports about the Brazilian strain of the virus. Cooper welcomed the travel ban on Thursday but warned: “We know from the first wave of the Covid crisis that focusing just on direct flights isn’t sufficient. We still need a proper testing and quarantine system for airports and ports as other countries have.” She called the government “irresponsible” for delaying its new testing regime for all arrivals to the UK at the last minute, pointing out that the Brazilian strain had been identified in Japan by testing of passengers in airport quarantine. The new testing system, which will require travellers to have a negative Covid test before coming to the UK, has been pushed back from Friday morning to Monday after a backlash from travel companies and tourists who complained the government had failed to provide enough guidance to operate the scheme effectively. The prime minister’s spokesperson defended the last-minute delay, calling it a “grace period”. “We always said we would introduce the regulations on Friday, and the laws still come into force on Friday, but we’ve implemented a grace period over the weekend so that passengers can have a little bit more time to get access to the tests they need that meet our requirements,” he said. The safeguarding minister, Victoria Atkins, had earlier suggested the delay had been made for business reasons. Speaking to Sky News, she said: “There’s a very delicate balancing act here between controlling the virus but also ensuring that we are not putting too much of a burden on the economy.” Travellers will need to present proof of a negative test result to their carrier upon boarding, and UK Border Force will conduct spot checks on arrivals. Arrivals who flout the rules will face a minimum £500 fine, and the operator who transported them will also be fined. Passengers will still have to quarantine for 10 days regardless of their test results. The guidance specifying the type of tests and documentation that would be required was not published on the government’s website until late on Wednesday, making it almost impossible for potential inbound travellers abroad to arrange tests in time for the original deadline. The decision on the travel ban was made at a meeting of the ministerial Covid-O committee on Thursday morning on the basis of evidence from experts on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) on new viruses. Government sources said devolved administrations supported Shapps’s decision, with Wales and Scotland poised to announce similar action. Johnson had hinted at fresh restrictions on Wednesday when he was grilled by MPs about the issue, telling Cooper: “We’re putting in extra measures to ensure that people coming from Brazil are checked: and indeed stopping people coming from Brazil.” Direct flights between Brazil and the UK were banned last month as the Brazilian government tried to prevent the highly transmissible English variant of the virus arriving on its shores. The UK government has been criticised throughout the pandemic for failing to act rapidly enough to control the borders."
2021-01-14T19:14:47Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson could face Tory challenge if lockdown lasts through spring,"Boris Johnson’s position as prime minister could be under threat if the coronavirus lockdown in England lasts into late spring, a backbench Conservative MP has warned. In a message to fellow Tories in the Covid Recovery Group (CRG), which comprises around 70 MPs who are wary of lockdown measures, Steve Baker urged colleagues to stress their concerns. He told fellow MPs it was “imperative you equip the chief whip today with your opinion that debate will become about the PM’s leadership if the government does not set out a clear plan for when our full freedoms will be restored, with a guarantee that this strategy will not be used again next winter.” Baker, the deputy chair of the CRG, wrote: “Certain government scientists have said that the current lockdown could last until late spring. There is no reason to think there will be any real resistance in cabinet to the argument for greater and longer and more draconian restrictions on the public. “This could be a disaster. Nothing seems more certain to break the public than giving hope before taking it away, and doing it repeatedly.” He said the government “has adopted a strategy devoid of any commitment to liberty without any clarification about when our most basic freedoms will be restored and with no guarantee that they will never be taken away again”. He added: “People are telling me they are losing faith in our Conservative party leadership because they are not standing up for our values as a party. If we continue forward with a strategy that hammers freedom, hammers the private sector, hammers small business owners and hammers the poor, inevitably the prime minister’s leadership will be on the table: we strongly do not want that after all we have been through as a country.” The CRG was formed to coalesce opinion on the Tory backbenches connected to emphasising the negative effects of lockdown, with a number of members voting against previous restrictions for England. The CRG was broadly supportive of the current lockdown, given the emergence of the new, more transmissible Covid variant and the extreme pressures on NHS hospitals. However, the issue is felt extremely keenly by some Tories, with reports last week that two MPs had submitted letters to the 1922 Committee, which represents backbench Tories, seeking Johnson’s departure. Triggering a leadership contest would require at least 15% of Tory MPs – around 55 – to send in letters. In a CRG statement following the imposition of the current lockdown, the group’s chair, the former chief whip Mark Harper, praised the Covid vaccination programme but said the government should set out how this “begins to translate into a return to normal life for us all and show a clear exit strategy – a route back to freedom”. Despite the message, Baker later tweeted his complete support for Johnson to remain as prime minister. He wrote: “What this country needs is the complete success of Boris Johnson, with his excellent EU deal, a successful vaccination programme and a #Road2Recovery back to freedom. I am clear Boris is the only person to lead us out of these difficulties and I support him in that endeavour.”"
2021-01-14T18:25:02Z,politics,Politics,Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard steps down,"The Scottish Labour party is to launch a fast-tracked leadership contest after Richard Leonard resigned as leader months before a Holyrood election. Leonard said he had decided over Christmas that the constant attacks on his leadership were undermining Scottish Labour’s ability to “get its message across”. Labour is trailing the Scottish National party by at least 35 points in opinion polls and is at risk of losing a dozen or more seats when Scotland goes to the polls on 6 May. The party confirmed it would launch a leadership contest immediately to guarantee Leonard’s successor is in position well before the election. Jackie Baillie, who has stepped up as interim leader, has agreed with Leonard that he can stand as a Labour candidate in May. Anas Sarwar, the centrist MSP who was recently made Scottish Labour’s constitution spokesman, and who lost to Leonard in the last leadership contest in 2017, is an early favourite for the post. Baillie urged different parts of the party to come together and said: “We face the fight of our lives in the run-up to the 2021 Scottish parliament elections.” Party sources said Leonard had had several clashes with senior colleagues and trade union leaders, and had lost the confidence of former allies on the Corbynite wing of the party who had become disillusioned at his approach. He was said to be guarded and unwilling to take advice. He narrowly survived a short-lived rebellion over his leadership by Labour MSPs in September. Tensions with Keir Starmer, the UK party leader, came to a head in late December when Leonard announced Scottish Labour would vote against the Brexit deal at Holyrood because of the economic damage he believed it would cause. That contradicted Starmer’s decision to back the UK government’s deal. Amid derision from their opponents, Leonard’s colleagues mounted a rapid damage-limitation exercise. The next day they claimed their stance was based on the UK government’s failure to include Holyrood in its Brexit planning. In a brief statement, Leonard accused the Scottish and UK governments of mishandling the Covid crisis but implied he no longer believed he was the best person to take them on. “I have come to the conclusion it is in the best interests of the party that I step aside as leader of Scottish Labour with immediate effect,” he said. “This was not an easy decision, but after three years I feel it is the right one for me and for the party.” Starmer thanked Leonard and said he should be “very proud” of his achievements, which included campaigning for the creation of a national care service in Scotland, jobs guarantees for unemployed youth and a fair rents bill. Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader and first minister, tweeted: “Despite our political differences, I’ve always liked Richard Leonard. He is a decent guy and I wish him well for the future.” In the 14 years since Alex Salmond and the Scottish National party claimed their first Holyrood election victory in 2007, Scottish Labour has had six leaders. Last summer Jackson Carlaw stepped down as Scottish Tory leader and was quickly replaced unopposed by Douglas Ross, a Tory MP."
2021-01-14T18:05:17Z,politics,Politics,UK Covid: arrivals from South America and Portugal banned from Friday over Brazilian variant concerns â€“ as it happened,"Travellers from South America and Portugal will be banned from arriving in the UK from Friday morning as a precautionary measure aimed at preventing the new Brazilian Covid variant from reaching the country, the government has announced. Headteachers in England have been told not to provide either free school meal vouchers or food parcels for disadvantaged children over the half-term holiday next month, it has emerged. A plan to discharge Covid patients from hospitals into care homes without tests has been branded â€œmadnessâ€� by care home providers who warned the move risks a repeat of last springâ€™s crisis, which was partly fuelled by pressure to relieve the NHS. Scotlandâ€™s plan for the distribution of coronavirus vaccinations has been taken offline after the UK government raised concerns that the document included sensitive details about vaccine supply. The government has faced sustained criticism in parliament from Conservative MPs representing fishing areas, including in Scotland, over red tape and delays caused by the introduction of the post-Brexit fishing regime.

2021-01-14T17:58:03Z,politics,Politics,MPs question Tory donor tipped for CPS inspector post,"The government’s preferred candidate for independent inspector of the prosecution service is a Conservative donor who gave £10,000 to the party during the last general election campaign, it has emerged. Andrew Cayley QC defended his suitability for the role of chief inspector of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which is appointed by the attorney general, Suella Braverman, after a committee of MPs quizzed him on the donation. Cayley, who was the director of service prosecutions from 2013 to 2020 and prior to that was the international co-prosecutor of the Khmer Rouge Tribunal in Cambodia, revealed he was a card-carrying member of the Conservative party during the pre-appointment hearing before the justice select committee. Asked about the donation by Labour MP Andrew Slaughter, Cayley said: “I have a very firm view about the democratic process. I lived in a country in south-east Asia where you wouldn’t even be interviewing me unless I was a signed up member of the ruling party, thank God we don’t live in a country like that. “I felt free to give that donation. The Conservative party is a party I support. I’m not active within the Conservative party. I am a card-carrying member of the Conservative party. “I took a number of decisions when I was working for the Service Prosecuting Authority that didn’t make the government very happy at all, in terms of the Iraq [war] cases, the investigation into members of the armed forces. “My view is I should be free to give donations to political parties I support. I certainly don’t believe it effects my independence. “If you look at the current leader of the Labour party [Keir Starmer] he went from being the director of public prosecutions (DPP) to gaining one of the safest Labour London seats in about 15 months, and I don’t think anyone questioned that. “I think as long as things are done fairly, as long as my independence is proven, which it is, I don’t think there are any issues with that at all. I certainly don’t have any intentions in this job to be politically active but after that who knows?” Her Majesty’s Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate inspects the CPS and the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). The inspectorate has looked at a wide range of issues ranging from disclosure issues, domestic abuse prosecutions, youth crime and handling of rape cases. A spokesperson for the Attorney General’s Office (AGO) said: “Andrew Cayley is the preferred candidate, appointed by fair and open competition which was governed by the public appointment principles. He was interviewed by panel that included independent members.”"
2021-01-14T16:35:43Z,politics,Politics,Revealed: business secretary accepted donations from fossil fuel investors,"The UK’s new business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, accepted substantial donations from fossil fuel investors and advisers as part of his 2019 general election campaign, despite the government’s commitment to net zero greenhouse gas emissions. Kwarteng was energy minister until earlier this month, when he was promoted to secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy. He replaced Alok Sharma, who has now taken full-time responsibility for the UK’s hosting of this year’s UN climate talks, Cop26. In the 2019 election campaign, Kwarteng received £16,000 from companies and individuals with a direct interest in fossil fuels, and a further £4,500 from companies that advise on or facilitate trading in fossil fuels. The donations, according to the MPs’ register of interests, included £7,500 from IPGL, a holding company with a 40% stake in Cluff Energy Africa, a London-based company that prospects for oil in west Africa. IPGL is owned by the former Conservative party treasurer Michael Spencer, and donated £48,000 to Conservative MPs, of whom Kwarteng received the highest single amount.
He also received £4,000 from Majid Jafar, chief executive of Crescent Petroleum, a privately held company with oil and gas operations in the Middle East, and a board member of Dana Gas. A further £4,500 came from Helios Investment Partners, whose portfolio includes Eland Oil and Gas, Impact Oil and Gas, Vivo Energy and Africa Oil Corp. In addition to these donations, Kwarteng accepted £2,500 from Capital Generation Partners, which advises on investments including fossil fuels, and £2,000 from CQS, an asset management firm that facilitates trades in fossil fuel interests among other commodities. Labour has called on Kwarteng to give back the donations. Alan Whitehead, the shadow energy and green new deal minister, said: “Ministers should not accept money from donors where there is a clear conflict of interest, and I hope he will pay it back. Our democracy should never be up for sale to Tory donors.” A spokesperson for Kwarteng said there was no conflict of interest and that all donations were in line with the ministerial code. “For the past 18 months, as energy minister, Mr Kwarteng led work to develop the energy white paper – this government’s plan to fully decarbonise our energy system, phase out fossil fuels and end the UK’s contribution to climate change. Any suggestion Mr Kwarteng is somehow not committed to the green agenda is manifestly false,” they said. A spokesperson for Helios said: “The donation was not made by Helios Investment Partners. It was made by Babatunde Soyoye, co-managing partner at Helios in his personal capacity when Kwasi Kwarteng was running for re-election at the last parliamentary elections in 2019. It was inadvertently recorded as Helios as this is also the same postal address for Mr Soyoye. We are in the process of requesting this to be corrected.” A spokesperson for Capital Generation Partners said: “Capital Generation Partners has not made a donation to him or to any other political figure. One of our partners made a personal contribution but this comprised his own funds, paid from his personal UK account and was explicitly made in his own name. The partner concerned has asked Mr Kwarteng to correct the record.” Kwarteng will bear much of the responsibility for putting the UK on track to meet the government’s target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Last autumn, Boris Johnson set out a 10-point plan, including massive investment in offshore wind, new nuclear power and an overhaul of infrastructure, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has set out plans for a new emissions trading scheme, of which the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy will take charge. The UK is not on track to meet its carbon budget targets, and experts have said much more interventionist policy from government and higher investment will be required to put the UK on a path to net zero. Kwarteng belonged to the Free Enterprise Group of Tory MPs, which takes a strongly free-market stance, calling for drastic reductions in the regulation of business. He was co-author of Britannia Unchained, a 2012 manifesto alleging that Britain, whose people were “among the worst idlers in the world”, suffered from a “bloated state, high taxes and excessive regulation” and needed a bonfire of red tape. Green campaigners also raised concerns over the business secretary’s links to fossil fuel interests. Connor Schwartz, climate lead at Friends of the Earth, said: “It’s clearly a concern that the new business secretary, [in] one of the most important roles in government for responding to the climate emergency, has received money from fossil fuel interests. It’s essential ministers take bold decisions to bring down emissions and create good, green jobs across the country, but how can people be sure they will do that if they’ve been aided in getting elected by money from oil and gas?”"
2021-01-14T16:04:12Z,politics,Politics,Tory MPs from fishing areas criticise government over Brexit red tape,"The government has faced sustained criticism in parliament from Conservative MPs representing fishing areas, including in Scotland, over red tape and delays caused by the introduction of the post-Brexit fishing regime. With some Scottish seafood exporters warning they face possible bankruptcy amid a suspension of road deliveries due to border delays, the environment secretary, George Eustice, conceded the sector faced “teething issues” and “some additional administration”. However, when asked several times by MPs about Boris Johnson’s promise during an appearance before the Commons liaison committee to compensate businesses affected by the new regime, Eustice ignored the questions. Instead, Eustice indicated many of the delays were due to seafood firms exporting to the EU not correctly filling in paperwork, saying this had been less of an issue for firms with experience of selling goods outside the bloc. “The key thing is to get this process working more smoothly, and that requires traders to familiarise themselves with that,” he said, adding that the paperwork had been designed by the EU and could be improved. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons leader, later went on to argue that the fish were now happier being British. “The key is that we’ve got our fish back. They’re British fish and they’re better and happier fish for it,” he told parliament.
However, Downing Street later confirmed there would be compensation for affected businesses, and said it did not believe the companies were to blame for delays or losses. “We have said that we are looking to compensate the fishing industry given they face temporary issues, and we accept that this may have been through no fault of their own,” Johnson’s spokesman said. “That’s why the prime minister said what he said yesterday.” It is understood officials in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs are looking at a compensation scheme whereby seafood exporters who can prove they lost business because of delays can apply for compensation. It is not expected to be an industry-wide scheme, said one source. “It’ll be a mechanism for providing support for individual firms who lost out in specific circumstances,” the source said. During an urgent question on fishing, Eustice heard sustained criticism and concern over the situation from a number of Tories, including Douglas Ross, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives. Ross said he had been contacted by fishing workers in his Moray constituency and around Scotland, “raising their serious concerns and frustrations about the current situation”. More than half a dozen English Conservative MPs representing coastal areas also expressed worries, with Steve Double, the MP for St Austell and Newquay in Cornwall, saying his local fleets “benefit little from this deal”. Sheryll Murray, the South East Cornwall MP, quoted a local fishing business owner who said border red tape was “posing a real threat to his business”. The row is seen as particularly damaging for the Conservatives in Scotland, amid predictions it could erode support for the party in previously pro-Brexit fishing areas at May’s Scottish parliament election. An opinion poll by Savanta ComRes for the Scotsman on Thursday morning showed a five-point fall for the Tories since December, suggesting they could lose 14 of their 31 seats. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland on Thursday, the Scotland Office minister, David Duguid, the MP for the fishing area of Banff and Buchan, said: “I do not underestimate the problems and the struggles that the industry is going through right now.” He promised urgent action. One seafood exporter, Jamie McMillan, of Loch Fyne Langoustines, speaking on the same programme, said his firm and many others were on the brink of bankruptcy because of the extra costs and delays, including inspections by vets taking up to five hours, which meant his live seafood was dying before it reached the wholesale market in Boulogne, France. On Wednesday, DFDS, which manages Scottish seafood and salmon exports by road, said it was suspending all deliveries of live seafood from small firms such as McMillan’s until Monday 18 January to see if the problems could be resolved or reduced. McMillan said his customers in Europe were switching to other suppliers in Denmark. “This is a very, very serious situation,” he said. “We’ve been screaming for the last six months that we have to get our produce to market within 12 to 24 hours. Any delays in that process, our shellfish will arrive in France dead. It is now harder to export to France than it is to the far east. That can’t be right.” The urgent question was asked by the Scottish Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael, who complained of fishing boats “tied up in harbour, their propellers fouled with red tape manufactured in Whitehall”. Carmichael also condemned Victoria Prentis, the fisheries minister, for seemingly saying she had not read the full post-Brexit trade deal when it was agreed on Christmas Eve as she was busy organising a nativity trail. Eustice said Prentis was only saying “that her jaw did not drop” when she read what was in the agreement, as she knew what it was going to contain. Nathalie Loiseau, France’s former Europe minister, tweeted on Thursday afternoon: “An MP who says the fish are happier because they are now British, a fisheries minister who admits she hasn’t read the agreement with the EU in her field: happily in Europe, we at least took fishermen seriously.”"
2021-01-14T14:55:23Z,politics,Politics,Plan to discharge Covid patients to care homes in England is 'madness',"A plan to discharge Covid patients from hospitals into care homes without tests has been branded “madness” by care home providers who warned the move risks a repeat of last spring’s crisis, which was partly fuelled by pressure to relieve the NHS. The Department of Health and Social Care issued guidance that Covid positive patients in England who have been in isolation in hospital for 14 days “are not considered to pose an infection risk” and do not have to be retested. If they are not showing new symptoms or have had fresh exposure to the virus they can be moved directly to care homes from hospital. News of the strategy was first reported in the Guardian on Wednesday when NHS commissioners told care operators in Yorkshire that discharges could start happening directly in some cases “because we now know they do not pose an infection risk to other residents in a care home”. Care homes are demanding to see evidence to support that assessment in the light of rising cases of the new more transmissible strain of the virus. About 1,200 care home residents died from Covid in England in the first week of January and on Wednesday the NHS ordered GPs to rapidly accelerate vaccination of England’s approximately 400,000 care home residents to deliver all first doses by the end of next week. The latest discharge guidance comes amid an urgent need to free up space in the NHS, and the DHSC said it was clarifying an approach that had already been approved by its deputy chief medical officers and Public Health England.
“Our priority is to ensure everyone receives the right care, in the right place at the right time,” a spokesperson said. “We have been doing everything we can to protect care homes since the start of the pandemic, providing billions of pounds of additional funding, free PPE, infection control guidance, increasing staff testing and providing priority vaccines.” But Mike Padgham, chair of the Independent Care Group, which represents providers in North Yorkshire, said: “I can’t quite believe the government is thinking of doing this. How do we know [people being discharged] haven’t been exposed especially with this new virulent strain? It seems we haven’t learned from the first wave. We want to help the health service but people will be reluctant to accept discharges without the comfort of a test … It seems madness.” Rights for Residents, which represents families who use care homes, said its members were “terrified” by the prospect of hospital patients who have had Covid being discharged into care homes without a recent test. “My anger and frustration is that the government has had 10 months to plan for this,” said Diane Mayhew, co-founder of the group. “Care homes have closed and many are standing empty and would have the perfect infrastructure for discharge.” In mid-December, DHSC policy on discharges said everyone with a positive test result being sent from a hospital into a care home should first be sent to a designated facility set up specially to handle potentially infectious patients. This was described as an “important precaution to protect care home residents and minimise, where possible, the risk of infection”. However, only 136 of the so-called “hot homes” have been established after the government set a goal of at least 500 in October. The December policy also said infected patients who had been isolated for at least 14 days and were not showing new symptoms need not be tested but that “a clinical assessment should be made to determine subsequent onward movement”.
The new guidance says: “If these individuals have already completed their 14-day isolation period from onset of symptoms or positive test result and have no new Covid-19 symptoms or exposure, they are not considered to pose an infection risk. They therefore do not have to be retested and can move directly to a care home from hospital.”"
2021-01-14T10:26:11Z,politics,Politics,Brexit problems halt some Scottish seafood exports to EU,"Deliveries of Scottish seafood to the EU from smaller companies have been halted until Monday, 18 January, after post-Brexit problems with health checks, IT systems and customs documents caused a huge backlog. Scottish fishing has been plunged into crisis, as lorry-loads of live seafood and some fish destined for shops and restaurants in France, Spain and other countries have been rejected because they are taking too long to arrive. The industry’s biggest logistics provider, DFDS, a Danish company, pointed to delays regarding health certificates, issues with the IT system interface between the group and local authorities, and incorrect or missing customs documentation from customers.
New Brexit rules require every box of seafood and fish to be offloaded from lorries and inspected by vets before it leaves Scotland. It has taken business owners five hours per lorry to obtain a health certificate, which is required to apply for other customs paperwork. If the issues are not resolved soon, some fear the trade, worth more than £1bn annually to Scottish businesses, could collapse. Faced with the backlog, DFDS suspended its “groupage export service” – which allows several exporters to group products together in a single consignment – last Friday, a week after the UK’s departure from the EU. It said it wanted to fix IT issues and train more staff to help its customers to get the customs documentation right. It is understood that single-load, single-commodity consignments are still being delivered. DFDS said it expected to resume deliveries next Monday, but the service would take considerably longer than before Brexit, and it highlighted the importance of 100% correct paperwork. Goods sent off on day 1, for example from Larkhall near Glasgow, are now being scheduled to arrive in Boulogne on day 3 – one to two days longer than it took to send goods to France before Brexit. Customers have been told to wait before sending orders, until they have received written clearance and completed a “summary control document” for each export dispatch. DFDS said: “By working together, we aim to have a robust service running very soon again.” Jimmy Buchan, chief executive of the Scottish Seafood Association, told the Guardian the problems were partly caused by the “untried and untested” new IT system, which went live on 28 December when the industry was on holiday. “We were thrown in at the deep end. We’ve had two years to prepare for this and government are standing back and saying: ‘This is what you wished for.’” He suggested setting up an independent clearing house for Europe in Scotland, which “clears seafood on Scotland’s soil, and it doesn’t have to stop again until it arrives in France”. He said this would save valuable time and could enable the industry to make overnight deliveries again.
The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, told MPs that Britain needed to secure easy access to Europe for the Scottish seafood industry. “[Regarding] the specific issue of seafood supplies, because of their perishable nature it’s absolutely vital that we ensure the smoothest possible access to European and other markets,” he said in parliament. At the same time, the UK government proposed to fast-track empty supermarket food lorries returning to Europe to reload, amid concerns that disruption at ports could lead to food supply shortages, the Financial Times reported (paywall). A consultation document sent to the industry by the agriculture ministry on Tuesday said “the potential for further disruption remains high”. It said: “Given the potential for border delays to impact supply chains over the next few weeks, we are proposing an emergency contingency measure  …  to expedite the return of empty food lorries from the UK to the EU where they can be restocked with supplies.” • The headline on this article was amended on 14 January 2021. The EU is not responsible for halting the exports as stated in an earlier version."
2021-01-13T21:59:05Z,politics,Politics,Lords inflict two defeats on government over 'spy cops' bill,"Peers inflicted two significant defeats on the government on Wednesday evening over a bill to regulate the use of undercover informants, passing amendments to stop them participating in murder and rape, and to curtail the use of children as informants. The lords voted by 339 to 235 to ban the use of under-18s as police or MI5 informants except in exceptional circumstances, in an amendment put forward by the children’s rights campaigner and peer Beeban Kidron. Children are frequently recruited by police seeking to prosecute “county lines” gangs who coerce youngsters and other vulnerable adults into transporting illegal drugs around the UK. “In every other interaction with the criminal justice system we try to remove children from criminal activity, to take them away from harm and towards safety,” Lady Kidron told fellow peers. “But before us is legislation which formalises our ability to do the opposite.” Thirteen Conservatives also rebelled against the government, led by the former transport secretary Lord Young. He warned that if an underage informant were to be discovered and killed “the policy would be reversed the next day after a public outcry and incredulity that this was permissible”. Peers were voting on the final set of amendments to the covert human intelligence sources (Chis) bill, legislation put forward to codify existing guidance covering the handling of informants and undercover operatives used principally by the police and MI5. The government was also defeated by 299 to 284 on an amendment from the peer Doreen Massey, which proposed explicitly banning those acting undercover from being allowed to participate in a list of serious crimes, including murder, torture, rape or other sexual offences as they gained information. Ministers had ruled out introducing such a list previously, arguing that creating a list of forbidden offences could give terrorists and serious criminals ways to unmask infiltrators by asking them to engage in such banned activities. “If we create a checklist on the face of the bill we make it very easy for criminal gangs to write themselves a list of offences which amount to initiation tests,” said Lady Williams, a Home Office minister. The government also argued that because the bill would be compliant with the Human Rights Act some offences were effectively banned, meaning that it did not amount to a “licence to kill”. Campaign groups welcomed the result, arguing that it would put the UK on a par with similar western countries in setting clear limits. Dan Dolan, deputy director of Reprieve, said: “The US, Australia and Canada all recognise the need for common sense limits to prevent undercover agents being authorised to commit murder, torture or rape, and now the House of Lords has too.” The defeats by the lords mean that the amendments will return in due course to the Commons. An acceptance of the amendment calling for an explicit ban on murder and other serious crime is not thought likely, but Labour sources said that Williams had indicated that the government would look again at the question of child informants. Peers were debating the bill at the second day of its report stage. On Monday, an amendment from Shami Chakrabarti seeking to strike out immunity for undercover agents acting within authorised guidelines was defeated by 309 to 153, after the Labour leadership chose to abstain."
2021-01-13T19:19:36Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson: a defensive man with much to be defensive about | John Crace,"For the last few days, the Commons has been unusually tranquil, with ministers and MPs going out of their way to be polite and cooperate with one another. Partly because there have been so few people in the chamber that the theatrics lose their edge, but mainly because MPs of all parties are genuinely terrified by the scale of the coronavirus pandemic. Cheap point-scoring feels like a waste of time when people are dying by the thousands every day. Needless to say, though, that all changed with Boris Johnson at prime minister’s questions. It’s not just the defensive, combative tone with which Johnson treats the session: that is perhaps understandable given that he has a lot to be defensive about and Boris’s first instinct when under pressure has always been to lash out and blame others. What really sticks in the throat is the lack of regret and remorse in his voice. His inability to accept any blame for his government’s response to the Covid crisis is borderline sociopathic. Johnson began with a quick U-turn. On Monday he had said there was no “clamour” for 24/7 vaccinations. Now he was telling us they would soon be piloted. But it was when Keir Starmer ran through the recent government timeline that Boris resorted to bluster and outright lies. He appeared to have forgotten that Matt Hancock had told the Commons about the new variant two days before Boris had announced there would be no lockdown and Christmas would be going ahead as usual at PMQs. Since then the government had consistently done too little too late, and Johnson was unable to explain why this third lockdown was less severe than the first one when the pandemic was now even worse. Perhaps the weirdest exchange took place when the Labour leader moved on to free school meals and Johnson merely accused Starmer of being worse at pointing out how crap the government had been than Marcus Rashford. Not the greatest defence of government policy. Keir had done his homework, though, and pointed out that the £30 free school meals worth about a fiver were more or less in line with the Department of Education’s own guidelines. Give or take a tin of sweetcorn. At which point Boris gave up on not answering questions and went into a long rant about Labour’s failings that the Speaker had to interrupt and call to a halt. This hadn’t been a vintage Starmer performance – he still struggles rather when Johnson basically ignores him – but it had been enough to expose most of the prime minister’s more disturbing pathologies. There were fewer hiding places on offer for Johnson during his two-hour appearance before the liaison committee – the supergroup of select committee chairs – as he faced more detailed questions on his handling of the pandemic and the UK’s exit from the EU. Though obviously that did not stop Boris from engaging in his favourite pastime of endless pointless digressions designed to disguise his lack of straight answers. Not that Johnson didn’t appear to have made more effort to come prepared to this meeting of the committee. Now that Dominic Cummings is off the scene, it feels as if his new team of advisers in No 10 have been telling him he needs to do more preparation for these events. Mostly in just being more polite and trying to appear interested in what he is being asked. His standard response to most questions about coronavirus was that the vaccine will sort things out eventually. He had less to say on his government’s track record over the past 10 months, as he has invariably done too little, too late. His desperate need to be loved by not imposing restrictions may well have accounted for thousands of unnecessary deaths. When push came to shove, Johnson again disowned his government’s own guidance on free school meals and agreed with both Robert Halfon and Catherine McKinnell that what had been provided by some contractors had been pitiful. He also appeared not to hear McKinnell enquire if he regretted having once said that Donald Trump should be awarded the Nobel peace prize. Perhaps even Boris struggles to believe he could ever have said anything so absurd. Labour’s Stephen Timms managed to extract an inference that the £20 uplift in universal credit would not be extended beyond April, but as so often it was Yvette Cooper who really managed to get under his skin. There is no love lost between the two and Johnson is self-aware enough to realise that in a straight fight he will always come off worse. So he opted for damage limitation as Cooper challenged him on his lack of action on both the South African and Brazilian variants. Right now, Cooper observed, it was possible for anyone to fly into the UK from both these destinations and travel onwards by public transport without a negative coronavirus test. Or indeed with little chance of anyone checking whether you self-isolated once home. Boris merely muttered “we’re taking steps” over and over again before mentioning the vaccine yet again. After which the fait accompli of Britain’s exit from the EU felt more like an afterthought. Hilary Benn pointed out that many supermarket shelves in Northern Ireland were empty due to the increased bureaucracy. Boris somehow managed to contradict himself by saying the flow of goods from Great Britain into Northern Ireland had never been so smooth, which was why goods were flying off the supermarket shelves, but that any ongoing problems would soon be sorted out. Let the good times roll. Thereafter the session rather petered out. Not least because Bill Cash was so full of praise for the man who had rescued the country from the evil empire of the EU that the only question he could muster was: “Please tell us why you are so wonderful.” Something Johnson was happy to do at length. After all, that is his favourite subject."
2021-01-13T18:36:17Z,politics,Politics,"UK Covid: record 1,564 deaths reported to take toll past 100,000; PM 'concerned' about Brazilian variant – as it happened","More than 100,000 people have died from coronavirus in the UK since the disease first appeared in the country almost a year ago, in what public health experts have said is a sign of â€œphenomenal failure of policy and practiceâ€�. Boris Johnson has told MPs that he is â€œconcernedâ€� about the new variant of coronavirus circulating in Brazil. (See 3.36pm.) But, in evidence to the Commons liaison committee, he refused to make it clear whether or not he was going to impose a ban on arrivals from Brazil. He told Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, that the government was â€œtaking steps to stop the Brazil variant being imported into this country, as weâ€™ve taken steps to stop the South African variant being imported into this countryâ€�. But, when challenged, he was evasive as to whether he meant Brazil would be covered by the rule coming into force on Friday saying all international arrivals into England will have to have had a negative test, or whether the government is planning a Brazil-specific ban. Johnson also told MPs the risk of intensive care units being overwhelmed was â€œvery substantialâ€�. He said: If you ask me when do we think that the ICU capacity is likely to be overtopped, I canâ€™t give you a prediction for that. But all I can say is that the risk is very substantial and we have to keep the pressure off the NHS and the only way to do that is to follow the current lockdown. The government is to roll out 24/7 vaccinations centres, Boris Johnson has confirmed, after days of pressure on ministers to step up the programme further. Shops in Scotland have been ordered to stop non-essential click-and-collect services and alcohol consumption is to be banned outdoors, in a further tightening of lockdown measures. The government has been forced into a U-turn over free school meal provision during lockdown, and it has emerged that its guidance on what should be in food parcels is strikingly similar to images circulating on social media that the prime minister described as â€œunacceptableâ€�. NHS England has ordered a rapid acceleration of care home vaccinations in response to rising Covid outbreaks in which deaths of residents have risen to levels not seen since May. Second shots of coronavirus vaccine could be delayed even further amid growing evidence that spacing out the doses improves their effectiveness. Hospital admissions in London and south-east England have fallen for the first time after rising steadily throughout December, figures show. The UK coronavirus vaccine rollout is constrained by limited supply of the vaccines, but the government is on track to vaccinate the top four priority groups by 15 February, Matt Hancock has said. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog."
2021-01-12T20:38:49Z,politics,Politics,"Since we've had the carrot, it's time for Patel to bring the stick","First the carrot, then the stick. At Monday’s Downing Street press conference, we had Matt Hancock being “Mr Nice Guy” as he begged everyone to stick to the guidelines as the vaccination programme was rolled out. For Tuesday’s we got Priti Patel – the iron fist in a tungsten glove – and Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, to spell out what was in store for those people who insisted on breaking the rules. Or for some people at any rate. Patel has form for giving a free pass to her mates, as she could never bring herself to criticise Dominic Cummings’s Durham safari back in the spring. This was the first time the home secretary had been let loose at a No 10 briefing since May last year and it soon became clear why. Because Patel is almost pathologically unable to utter a coherent sentence. Whenever she prefaces a statement with, ‘Let me be clear’ – which she does with monotonous regularity – you can be certain she’s going to be anything but.
Still, she did get through her opening scripted remarks almost unscathed – if through gritted teeth – as she was forced to admit that most people were observing the rules properly. This was clearly a disappointment. In Priti world, everyone – especially immigrants – is a potential law breaker and people should be issued with fixed penalty notices just for thinking of breaking the rules. The trouble started with the first question from Ian, a member of the public, who wanted to know why the rules for the third lockdown were less onerous than they had been for the first, when the government’s own scientists had identified that the new coronavirus variant was far more infectious. “Let me be clear,” she said. This was not about the rules now being more relaxed. Even though that was precisely what it was about, as the rules are demonstrably less draconian this time round. Priti umm-ed and ahh-ed, talked nonsense for a bit and left everyone even more confused. The rules were extremely clear. Everyone was to stay at home and act as if they had the coronavirus apart from the occasions on which they would be allowed out. And when they did go out, they should either stay close to their front door or remain local. Whichever was nearer to the front door or more local. It depended on the circumstances and whether it was “outdoor recreation”. Not surprisingly, this mess of an answer was followed up by the same question from a journalist working for ITV and was responded to with a similar word salad. With Patel, the words on their own can occasionally make sense: the trouble starts when she tries to put them in any kind of order. Hewitt tried to come to her rescue, suggesting: “People should ask themselves, ‘Is going out to do this essential?’ and ‘Am I doing it in the safest way?’” Which didn’t exactly help matters, as Patel’s prime mission was to avoid dobbing in the prime minister for his weekend bike ride at the Olympic Park. Even two days later, no one at No 10 seems any clearer if Boris headed out on his own from Westminster or went by car to Stratford with a police escort and only started cycling once he was there. Nor are we any the wiser why he chose the Olympic Park as his bike ride of choice, given that he reportedly noted after getting there how busy it was. At this point, even the not very sharp Patel could tell that the key message she had been sent out to communicate – that the rules were clear and people should use their common sense to work within them – was beginning to fall apart. Especially when the Guardian’s Rajeev Syal posed the question that many people had been asking themselves all day. How come two women in Derbyshire had been fined for driving five miles to walk around a reservoir, when Johnson had been aided and abetted to travel seven miles for his bike ride? “The police have been brilliant,” Patel said, before contradicting herself and admitting they had made a mistake with the two Derbyshire women, who had their fines rescinded when the police realised any journey within seven miles was more or less permissible. Exercise was vital to people’s health and wellbeing, she continued. And that also applied to exercise. Or something like that. By now the only thing that was clear was that Patel had been the wrong person to send out to promote a strong law-and-order message two days after the PM had done his best to muddy the waters about what the rules actually were. Predictably with Priti Vacant, the entire press conference ended in confusion when she once again repeated that the rules were tough enough and clear to everyone but that the government was actively looking at making them even tougher and more clear. For the punters, if not for the prime minister. Hewitt again did his best to save the day by saying that the police would continue to enforce the rules properly, but ideally people would save themselves and his coppers a world of pain by following not just the letter but the spirit of the rules. After all, his men and women had other crimes they would rather be investigating. Such as how a government department could dole out free school meal contracts at £30 a pop to a company that was only sending out meals that appeared to be worth about a fiver."
2021-01-12T19:27:01Z,politics,Politics,Tory MPs say Johnson’s future rests on a successful vaccine programme,"There is a popular meme among leftwing Starmer-sceptics in the Labour party, one that was often used against the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn: “Any other leader would be 20 points ahead.” While Keir Starmer has steadily eaten into the Conservatives’ poll lead, there is a frustration among some Labour MPs and the wider opposition to Boris Johnson that the prime minister does not appear to be absorbing more of the personal responsibility for the worst crisis since the second world war, a crisis that government delay, cronyism and ideology have all played a part in exacerbating. There are reasons why Johnson’s supporters believe he can continue to deflect some of the more personal criticism – although closer inspection of polling numbers and the disquiet on the Tory backbenches does indicate Johnson has damaged and squandered goodwill in ways that will be difficult to mend. One former Tory adviser said they had watched gobsmacked as a prime minister who had won his party a handsome majority now had those same backbenchers in open revolt. Even some of the most ardent opponents of Johnson on the Tory benches firmly believe their voters will give the party the benefit of the doubt in the handling of an unprecedented pandemic. But a successful vaccine programme is key to this. “Most hospitals have not actually yet been overwhelmed, most people have had their livelihoods protected by furlough, those have been the key measures so far and as long as the government passes its third test – which is to get everyone a vaccine before the summer is out – I think he will be able to ride this out,” one Tory MP said. Another shire Tory, a supporter of Jeremy Hunt’s leadership campaign, observed that as long as the prime minister could claim the success of the vaccination programme for himself, voters may forgive “his dithering, his lack of attention to detail and his pathological obsession with being liked, which is always the reason he is reluctant to make hard choices until they become inevitable and more painful”. His fiercest opponents within his own party had been lockdown sceptics, members of the newly formed Covid Recovery Group of Tory MPs who have been willing to vote against coronavirus restrictions in numbers large enough to defeat the government – had Labour not supported them. But the influence of the group has waned as quickly as it waxed, now the vaccination programme has commenced, with the vast majority of the group backing the latest lockdown measures. The group is also out of step with the general public, with polling showing most of the country favouring more stringent restrictions and longer lockdowns as a way of protecting loved ones. In the latest Opinium poll, 64% said they would prefer “a government who quickly puts lockdown measures in place, even if that means that sometimes measures are put in place that didn’t need to be”. One tactic that enrages Johnson’s opponents is the subtle shifting of blame on to the public’s compliance with rules as the reason for a rise in infections. Many were alarmed by a recent poll by YouGov, which found that 58% of Britons held the public most responsible for the rise in coronavirus cases over the last month, rather than the government, who were blamed by 28%. This came despite the insistence of Johnson that lockdown rules would lift on 2 December, that Christmas mixing would continue as planned and that schools would return as normal – followed by a last-minute scramble to change the rules after infections soared. However, a closer look at the polls suggests Johnson has not escaped blame. In the 12 months since the 2019 general election, Johnson’s lead dropped from double-digits to level-pegging, the steepest decline in modern history. According to the Focaldata survey of more than 22,000 people from early January, the public are deeply unhappy with the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the government would lose its majority at an election held at the present time. More people think Johnson should resign as prime minister than think he should continue in office, according to the latest Opinium poll. Many Tories privately fear there are voters the government will never win back, especially parents of teenage children whose education has been so disrupted by missteps, as well as teachers themselves. “It’s appalling what has gone on; the pressure on teachers has been unbelievable,” one senior Tory MP said. “What teacher would vote Conservative again? Not in a million years.” Ultimately, the judgment on Johnson at the next election will be on the success of the country’s recovery from the pandemic – with many more tough choices to come that the “sunlit uplands” prime minister cannot duck."
2021-01-12T18:51:44Z,politics,Politics,"Priti Patel insists 'rules are clear'; 1,243 more deaths recorded, second highest daily toll – as it happened","The UK has recorded 1,243 more Covid deaths - the second highest daily total on this measure. (See 5.12pm.) Priti Patel, the home secretary, announced the figure at a press conference where she twice dodged questions about why the current lockdown is less strict than last springâ€™s, even though the new variant of coronavirus poses a much greater risk because it is much more transmissible. Patel claimed the current rules were â€œtough enoughâ€�. But she also said that they were being kept under â€œconstant reviewâ€� and that conversations were going on within government about whether they might need to be tightened. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs Council, told the press conference that officers will not â€œlingerâ€� trying to encourage the public to obey lockdown rules. He also gave examples of recent breaches including a boat party in Hertfordshire with more than 40 people who had each paid Â£30 each for a ticket, and a minibus full of people from different households travelling from Cheltenham into Wales for a walk. In an article this morning Dame Cressida Dick, the Met police commissioner, said that people who break lockdown rules were now â€œincreasingly likely to face finesâ€�. (See 9.05am.) Hewitt has admitted that Derbyshire police officers made a mistake when they fined two women for going for a walk five miles from home. Asked about the case, he said the police were having to deal with â€œhighly unusualâ€� health regulations and that they were dealing with the public on â€œhundreds of thousandsâ€� of occasions. He went on: Sometimes mistakes will be made, but we always have looked at those, we have looked at them quickly, we have dealt with the members of the public concerned and we have said when we have got something wrong. The fines have now been rescinded. Asked about the same case, Patel said the police were â€œoutstandingâ€�, but she also pointed out that those fines have been withdrawn. Hewitt has indicated that he is not in favour of setting an exact distance people are allowed to travel when exercising away from home under the Covid regulations. Earlier the Met commissioner suggested the exercise guidance should be clarified. (See 10.04am.) But at the press conference Hewitt said: If you tried to make a definition for every possible circumstance that would be really challenging. I donâ€™t think we are in a position where we want to set a particular distance because how would - if a police officer stopped somebody - [they] prove that a person is within or outside that distance. At the press conference Patel defended Boris Johnsonâ€™s decision to go on a bike ride seven miles from his No 10 home on Sunday, but she also stressed the importance of people staying local. MPs have been told that hospitals might not the Covid pressure on hospitals in England may not reach its peak until February. (See 3.37pm.) Marcus Rashford has warned that â€œsomething is going wrongâ€� with free school meal delivery during lockdown, after he held talks with the school catering company at the centre of a row over inadequate free school meal (FSM) parcels. Experts are calling on the UK government to halt or pause its mass testing programme for people without symptoms in care homes, schools, communities and potentially at home, warning that the lateral flow devices it has bought are inaccurate and can do more harm than good. Military helicopters could be used within days to airlift coronavirus patients from the Isle of Wight, the islandâ€™s medical director has said, after an â€œastronomicalâ€� rise in infections fuelled by mixing and visitors over Christmas. The number of prisoners in England and Wales who have tested positive for coronavirus and died has risen by 50% in a month as cases behind bars surge. Public Health England is to step up its surveillance of a highly transmissible variant of coronavirus that arrived in the UK after fuelling a surge in the number of cases in South Africa. International travellers will need to present a negative Covid-19 test to enter England from 4am on Friday. The number of students in state schools in England plummeted in the week before Christmas, government data shows. The Chinese government has accused Boris Johnson of â€œgroundless conjectureâ€� after the prime minister suggested coronavirus could have spread from people grinding up the scales of pangolins. (See 4.50pm.) Chinaâ€™s treatment of the Uighur people amounts to torture, the British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has said as he set out measures designed to ensure no companies allow the use of forced labour from Xinjiang province in their supply chain.

2021-01-12T18:48:29Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson's bike ride: a 'storm in a teacup' or 'eroding public confidence'?,"Boris Johnson’s cycle ride to the Olympic Park on Sunday has provoked the full gamut of responses, from those praising his desire to keep fit on two wheels, to others simply wondering how he found the time when they haven’t washed their hair since schools closed. The incident also resulted in some interesting thought experiments, as politicians, senior police officers – and everyone else – struggled to answer two key questions: is seven miles actually seven miles? And how on earth do you define “local”? Speaking on BBC Breakfast, the policing minister, Kit Malthouse, wanted to clear things up. He said people must not “stretch the rules”. But then went on to say that whether seven miles was to be considered local or not “depends on where you are”. “Seven miles will be local in different areas,” he added. The rules, said the Metropolitan police commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, were not clear to the public, and even to some of her officers. No wonder, perhaps, that most readers who spoke to the Guardian about the episode responded with little more than a faintly irritated shrug. For Paul, a charity worker, it was a “non story”, for engineer James, “a storm in a teacup”, while Paul, a designer, worried it might put further restrictions on outdoor exercise. “Riding a bike is one of the few carefree, guilt-free, socially responsible things you can do in this shit-show of a time,” he said. “And now I feel like I need to be on a metaphorical elastic band attached to my flat.” But some were perplexed by the fact that Johnson had very local access to Hyde Park and St James’s Park – but chose to go much further afield. Christine, a teacher, asked if Johnson could not have cycled in the 17-hectare (42-acre) private gardens of Buckingham Palace – with its tennis court, lake and two and a half miles of gravel paths – where the prime minister has jogged and walked his dog since being given permission by the Queen during the first lockdown. “He just felt like going somewhere else,” she said. And which parent contemplating their 534th walk past the hairdressers, betting shop and cordoned off bandstand, recalcitrant children in tow, could not sympathise with that? Christine added: “Local for him is Green Park or St James’s Park. I wish people would stop cutting him so much slack – he has eroded public confidence.” Others felt the trip was yet another example of those in authority stretching the rules made for others to follow. “Personal responsibility only applies to the public when they are being blamed by the government but never applies to Conservatives or the prime minister,” said Paramdeep, 27. “Johnson certainly should be on his bike, out of No 10 – this country deserves so much better.” Eric in rural Oxfordshire, wondered if the controversy merely compounded the damage done during the first lockdown, when Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, bent lockdown rules to drive 264 miles from his London home to Durham, despite having had symptoms of coronavirus, before going on a family trip to Barnard Castle, ostensibly to test his eyesight. “It is well understood and accepted now that the Dominic Cummings scandal changed the calculus in everyone’s mind from how do I defeat the virus, to can I find a loophole in the lockdown rules,” he said. Yet there were significant numbers of commentators who suggested an enthusiastic cyclist prime minister trying to lose weight was exactly the role model the times required. “It’s good to hear prime minister @BorisJohnson has been cycling in London. @PHE_uk encourage cycling as a way to protect your physical and mental health,” tweeted the London Cycling Campaign. Linking to a story about the incident from the Guardian, the former Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable called the report “unbelievably petty” and went as far as to ask what the publication “had against cycling” – the question of a man who has clearly not seen the amount of Lycra on display in the Guardian’s London office on any pre-pandemic morning. There could have been another decent reason other than exercise that the prime minister took the cycle ride, suggested a Johnson parody Twitter account, which tweeted: “Well, that was useful. I now know I don’t need to wear glasses after all.”"
2021-01-12T08:13:22Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson under pressure over bike ride seven miles from No 10,"Boris Johnson is under pressure to clarify details of a Sunday bike ride seven miles from his Downing Street residence after No 10 refused to say whether he was driven there. Parkgoers spotted Johnson cycling in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic park in Stratford, east London, along with his security detail, at about 2pm on Sunday. A Downing Street source said the prime minister was exercising within the rules but would not give further details as to whether Johnson cycled from his Westminster residence or was transported there by car. “The PM follows Covid-secure guidelines. It does not say in the regulations that driving somewhere to take exercise is a breach of the rules. That is not a comment on the PM’s case but the rules only say remain local,” the source said. Official government guidance to reduce the spread of coronavirus says “you should not travel outside your local area” while exercising. Johnson’s spokesperson was unable to provide any information on the record but a No 10 source said there was no suggestion his travel had broken any rules, without giving details. Johnson has been a keen cyclist for years and goes jogging regularly near his home in Westminster. Andy Slaughter, Labour MP for Hammersmith in London, said: “Once again it is do as I say not as I do from the prime minister. London has some of the highest infection rates in the country. Boris Johnson should be leading by example.” Asked at Monday’s Downing Street press conference whether travelling seven miles for a cycle ride was within the rules, health secretary Matt Hancock said: “It is OK to go if you went for a long walk and ended up seven miles from home, that is OK, but you should stay local. It is OK to go for a long walk or a cycle ride or to exercise but stay local.”
News of Johnson’s Sunday excursion emerged in the Evening Standard days after two women were fined £200 by police for driving five miles from their home to meet for a walk at a reservoir, although the fines were rescinded on Monday following criticism. Derbyshire police said it had issued fixed penalty notices to Jessica Allen and Eliza Moore because driving to a location to exercise “is clearly not in the spirit of the national effort to reduce our travel, reduce the possible spread of the disease and reduce the number of deaths”. On Monday, the force’s chief constable, Rachel Swann, said: “Two fixed penalty notices that were handed to two women … have been withdrawn and we have notified the women directly, apologising for any concern caused. “I support the fact that the officers were trying to encourage people to stay local to prevent the spread of the virus. This is a responsibility for all of us.”
She added: “We have been working hard to understand the ever-changing guidance and legislation and to communicate this to our officers in a way that makes it clear what is the right course of action to take.” The government is understood to be reviewing guidelines on exercise, which could include limits on the distances people are allowed to travel as well as whether to restrict exercise within households when current rules allow exercise with one other person outdoors. Speaking on Monday, Johnson urged the public to respect coronavirus regulations when out grocery shopping and buying takeaway coffee, saying people needed to “do the right thing” and adhere to social distancing. “We need to enforce the rules in supermarkets. When people are getting takeaway drinks, in cafes, then they need to avoid spreading the disease there, avoid mingling too much,” he said. Johnson said Britain was in “a race against time” to distribute vaccines as he urged against any complacency. “We can all see the threat that our NHS faces, the pressure it’s under, the demand in intensive care units, the pressure on ventilated beds, even the shortage of oxygen in some places,” he said on a visit to a vaccination centre in Bristol, in southwest England.
“This is a very perilous moment. The worst thing now for us is to allow success in rolling out a vaccine programme to breed any kind of complacency about the state of the pandemic.”"
2021-01-11T22:50:51Z,politics,Politics,Did Boris Johnson’s bike ride bend the lockdown exercise rules?,"Boris Johnson has come under fire after he was spotted cycling in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic park in east London on Sunday, seven miles away from his Downing Street residence. Andy Slaughter, Labour MP for Hammersmith in London, accused the prime minister of failing to lead by example by exercising so far from home, but sources at No 10 insisted no rules had been broken. What exactly are the rules for outdoor exercise? The rules announced on 4 January for the third national lockdown in England state you are allowed to leave your home to exercise, but this should be limited to once a day and you should not travel outside your local area to do it. When exercising outside you can do so alone, with the people you live with, with your support bubble or with one person from another household. However, you must stay 2 metres apart from anyone not in your household or support bubble (or, if not possible, a metre apart with extra precautions like face coverings). Exercise includes, but is not limited to, running, cycling, walking, and swimming. Personal training can continue one-on-one, unless everyone is within the same household or support bubble. Where are you allowed to exercise? The rules state you are allowed to exercise in public outdoor places such as parks, beaches, countryside, public gardens, the grounds of a heritage site and playgrounds. Outdoor sports venues such as tennis courts, golf courses and swimming pools, however, must close. But as Matt Hancock emphasised during a Downing Street press conference on Monday evening, wherever you go to exercise, it must be local. What classes as “local”? This is the crucial bit of information missing from the government rules and which has caused quite a bit of confusion over the past few days. Last week two women were fined by Derbyshire police for travelling to a reservoir around five miles away from where they lived, with officers at the time saying they could have stayed closer to home. The force has since apologised and rescinded the fines, following further guidance from the National Police Chiefs’ Council. During Monday’s press conference, Hancock – in what seemed to be a deliberate reference to the prime minister’s bike ride – said: “If you went for a long walk and ended up seven miles away from home, that is OK. “But, you should stay local, you should not go from one side of a country to another, potentially taking the virus with you.” What about driving to get to where you exercise? While most people might think needing to take a car to get to an activity would suggest you were travelling too far, a Downing Street source stressed this was within the rules. When asked about whether Johnson had gone by car to the Olympic park, the source told the Guardian: “It does not say in the regulations that driving somewhere to take exercise is a breach of the rules. That is not a comment on the PM’s case but the rules only say remain local.”"
2021-01-11T18:18:19Z,politics,Politics,Matt Hancock rules out removing support bubbles if England restrictions tightened – as it happened,"Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has categorically ruled out any changes to the support or childcare bubble system. He was speaking at a No 10 press conference only hours after Boris Johnson said he was not ruling out toughening the lockdown rules. (See 2.33pm.) Asked if a further clampdown could involve support bubbles being removed, Hancock said: I can rule out removing the bubbles that we have in place - the childcare bubbles [and] the support bubbles are very important and weâ€™re going to keep them. I know how important they are to people and they are an important part of the system that we have got to support people whilst also having these tough measures that are necessary. Hancock has said meeting a friend outside could be banned if people donâ€™t follow current rules. (See 5.38pm.) He has defended Boris Johnsonâ€™s right to go for a cycle ride seven miles from No 10. (See 1.48pm and 5.38pm.) Hancock has praised the supermarket firm Morrisons for saying it will refuse to serve people who do not wear face masks. He said: It isnâ€™t just about the government and the rules we set, or the police and the work that they do - itâ€™s about how everybody behaves. I applaud the action Morrisons has taken today, the supermarket, they have said that they will not let people in without a mask unless they clearly have a medical reason. Thatâ€™s the right approach and I want to see all parts of society playing their part in this. Hancock has said he is â€œconfidentâ€� that the government can meet its target of offering the vaccine to around 14 million people who are in the top four priority groups by the middle of February. Hancock has revealed that the seven-day rolling average for UK Covid deaths reported daily has reached 926. (See 5.09pm.) But the latest figure shows the rolling average for the number of new cases starting to fall. (See 5.09pm.) The full dashboard data has just been published and is available here. Hospitals are reporting shortages of oxygen because of the huge pressure of treating the rising number of people left seriously ill with Covid, Boris Johnson has acknowledged. There are no plans for 24-hour provision of coronavirus vaccinations because there is â€œnot a clamourâ€� from the public for appointments beyond 8pm, Downing Street has said. The government must look at new coronavirus restrictions within the next 24 hours, Keir Starmer has said, naming estate agents and nurseries as those that could face further curbs to halt the spread of the virus. Prof Chris Whitty, Englandâ€™s chief medical officer, has said the next few weeks will be the worst of the pandemic as he urged everyone to minimise meeting people. Emergency plans have been triggered to keep bodies in temporary mortuaries in Kent and Surrey and a new temporary morgue is being built in London as a rising death toll from Covid begins to overwhelm storage facilities. More than a third of the UKâ€™s poorest families have seen their already meagre incomes squeezed during the pandemic because they have had to spend more on food, gas and electricity, and home schooling, a study has revealed. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2021-01-11T16:08:06Z,politics,Politics,Dutch officials seize ham sandwiches of drivers arriving from UK,"Dutch TV news has aired footage of customs officers confiscating ham sandwiches from drivers arriving by ferry from the UK under post-Brexit rules banning personal imports of meat and dairy products into the EU. Officials wearing high-visibility jackets are shown explaining to startled car and lorry drivers at the Hook of Holland ferry terminal that since Brexit, “you are no longer allowed to bring certain foods to Europe, like meat, fruit, vegetables, fish, that kind of stuff.” To a bemused driver with several sandwiches wrapped in tin foil who asked if he could maybe surrender the meat and keep just the bread, one customs officer replied: “No, everything will be confiscated. Welcome to the Brexit, sir, I’m sorry.” The ban came into force on New Year’s Day as the Brexit transition period came to an end, with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) saying travellers should “use, consume, or dispose of” prohibited items at or before the border. “From 1 January 2021 you will not be able to bring POAO (products of an animal origin) such as those containing meat or dairy (eg a ham and cheese sandwich) into the EU,” the Defra guidance for commercial drivers states. The European commission says the ban is necessary because meat and dairy products can contain pathogens causing animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth or swine fever and “continue to present a real threat to animal health throughout the union”. Dutch customs also posted a photograph of foodstuffs ranging from breakfast cereals to oranges that officials had confiscated in the ferry terminal, adding: “Since 1 January, you can’t just bring more food from the UK.” The customs service added: “So prepare yourself if you travel to the Netherlands from the UK and spread the word. This is how we prevent food waste and together ensure that the controls are speeded up.” • The headline of this article was amended on 12 January 2021. The seizures apply to all drivers arriving from the UK, not just British drivers as stated in an earlier version."
2021-01-11T13:42:09Z,politics,Politics,Salmond affair: call for investigation into Sturgeon to be widened,"Opposition MSPs have called for an investigation into Nicola Sturgeon’s actions during the Alex Salmond affair to be widened after fresh allegations she misled the Scottish parliament. Four MSPs, from Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, have asked a former prosecutor to investigate new claims from Salmond that Sturgeon broke the ministerial code by failing to disclose how much she knew about an internal inquiry into him. James Hamilton QC, Ireland’s former director of public prosecutions, was appointed in 2019 to investigate whether Sturgeon interfered with a civil service investigation into two allegations of sexual misconduct against Salmond, her predecessor as Scotland’s first minister. Salmond has told Hamilton that Sturgeon’s account to parliament of what she knew and when are “simply untrue”. He alleges she had a series of discussions about his concerns about the inquiry, offered to pass on his concerns and gave him advice on what to do. The four MSPs on a special Holyrood committee set up after a court ruled the government’s handling of that internal inquiry was unlawful, said they believed it was “vital” Salmond’s new allegations are formally investigated under the ministerial code. They have written jointly to John Swinney, the deputy first minister, and to Hamilton arguing the case for his investigation to be broadened. Jackie Baillie, a Labour MSP on the committee, said any minister found to have broken the code must resign. Sturgeon’s account was “at odds with Alex Salmond’s”. “It gets harder to swallow with every twist and turn,” Baillie said. On Sunday, Swinney dismissed Salmond’s allegations as “absolute nonsense” and said Sturgeon would robustly defend herself when she gives evidence to the Holyrood committee. Swinney said Hamilton already had the discretion to expand his inquiry if he saw fit. On Friday Sturgeon’s spokesperson said: “The first minister entirely rejects Mr Salmond’s claims about the ministerial code. “We should always remember that the roots of this issue lie in complaints made by women about Alex Salmond’s behaviour whilst he was first minister, aspects of which he has conceded. It is not surprising therefore that he continues to try to divert focus from that by seeking to malign the reputation of the first minister and by spinning false conspiracy theories. “The first minister is concentrating on fighting the pandemic, stands by what she has said, and will address these matters in full when she appears at committee in the coming weeks.” Sturgeon told Holyrood she was first told by Salmond about the allegations when the pair met at her home in Glasgow in April 2018. She published a list showing three face-to-face meetings and two phone calls with Salmond. In a potential breach of the ministerial code, she also acknowledged she did not tell the Scottish government’s permanent secretary, Lesley Evans, about their contacts until the eve of her second meeting with Salmond, at the Scottish National party conference in Aberdeen in June 2018. Sturgeon failed to tell parliament she had also met Salmond’s former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein, in her Holyrood office on 29 March. She told MSPs late last year she had forgotten it as it was a fleeting meeting because Aberdein happened to be in parliament. Salmond has told Hamilton that is wrong. He said the meeting was arranged after Sturgeon’s chief of staff, Liz Lloyd, had contacted Aberdein earlier that month and had told him about the investigation. Salmond alleges Lloyd also named one of the two women who had lodged complaints against him. The Scottish government said this was untrue. “This meeting was for the purpose of discussing the complaints and thereafter arranging a direct meeting between myself and the first minister,” Salmond told Hamilton. “There was never the slightest doubt what the meeting was about. Any suggestion by the first minister to the Scottish parliament that the meeting was ‘fleeting or opportunistic’ is simply untrue.” Salmond also alleges Sturgeon promised at their first meeting on 2 April she would tell the civil service they had met and pass on his request the harassment complaints be dealt with by mediation. Salmond said that in an exchange of messages on 1 June, Sturgeon had retracted that and instead told him she had always argued her intervention “was not the right thing to do”. “That was both untrue and disturbing,” Salmond told Hamilton."
2021-01-11T12:34:45Z,politics,Politics,"Make further Covid curbs in next 24 hours to halt spread, says Keir Starmer","The government must look at new coronavirus restrictions within the next 24 hours, Keir Starmer has said, naming estate agents and nurseries as those that could face further curbs to halt the spread of the virus. “This is the most serious stage of the pandemic and therefore, we have to face the most serious restrictions,” said the Labour leader. “I think a lot of people will be quite surprised primary schools are closed, and nurseries are open. “It is still possible at the moment, as I understand it, to go and view houses if you’re going to buy a house, and that wasn’t allowed last March. So we’re in this extraordinary situation … at least as serious, if not a more serious position than in March of last year, we’ve got less restrictions in place.”
“I think we are going to have to look in the next 24 hours or so, what are the other measures that could be put in place, and hear from the scientists as to which of those that they think are more effective, and then all pull together and support those measures if they’re needed because the numbers are still, as everybody knows, heading in the wrong direction on.” In his first major policy speech, the Labour leader called for the government to give employers the right to put workers on “flexible furlough” to allow them to look after children while schools are closed, as well as extending support to the “excluded” 3 million workers who have no support. Starmer said the government was doing little to support working families who had to work full-time and homeschool their children during the national lockdown. He said Labour in power would pledge the creation of 400,000 jobs in low-carbon sectors – “because this recovery has to be a green recovery”. He also said a Labour government would create a “high streets fightback fund” to protect local shops and retail, saying “Britain can’t reopen if our towns and our high streets are closed”. Starmer said the government had not honoured its contract with the British people by failing to get the virus under control after many months of restrictions. “It makes no sense to me at all that when we’re asking so much of the British people, the government is doing so little to support families,” he said, calling for “a legal, enforceable and immediate right for parents to request paid, flexible furlough and by promoting that to all working parents to help them get through this lockdown”. In his speech, Starmer laid out a number of measures he said the government could take in order to ease the burden on working families and their finances. He said the government could cancel council tax hikes with more funding for local authorities – calling the rise “a £1.9bn bombshell that lands a bill of around £90 on every family”. He also urged the government to pull its plan to cut the £20 universal credit uplift, which was put in place at the start of the pandemic, but which the government plans to cut back in April. Starmer said that would be “taking £1,000 a year from millions of families and pulling another 200,000 children into poverty”. He also criticised the decision to freeze public-sector pay for millions of key workers, people, he said, who had “got us through this crisis – including our armed forces, our care workers, our teachers, our firefighters and police officers”. Starmer, who on Sunday said he believed lockdown measures might need to be tightened further, said the government had been “found wanting at every turn” during the crisis. “Even in the best of times, you can’t be indecisive in government. In the worst of times, indecision can be fatal. Every time there’s a big decision to make, Boris Johnson gets there too late,” he said.
Starmer said the public needed to hear daily press conferences with the underlying message of “stay at home” and added: “One of the problems we’ve had in the last nine months is the mixed messaging coming from the government, this made it so much harder. The vast majority of the British public will comply with the rules, will do what’s asked of them, but they need absolute clarity as to what those rules are.” The Labour leader was also asked if he could see a role in a future Labour administration for the former prime minister Tony Blair, who is reported to have been in advisory talks with Matt Hancock about the vaccine strategy. Starmer said he had spoken to Blair about his reports but declined to suggest he would be offered any formal role now or in the future. “I’ve spent many hours of many days, talking to many, many people about the pandemic, and I will continue to do so because I want to hear from anybody who can help us through this and to ensure that I’m as best informed as possible,” Starmer said."
2021-01-11T12:11:27Z,politics,Politics,Home Office minister rejects plans for extra support for trafficking victims,"A Home Office minister has rejected proposals in a parliamentary bill for new support for victims of trafficking, a letter leaked to the Guardian reveals. Victoria Atkins, the minister for safeguarding, outlined her opposition to the modern slavery (victim support) bill, which calls for trafficking victims of all nationalities to receive a minimum of 12 months’ access to safe housing, support and protection from immigration detention. The private member’s bill has been tabled by Ian McColl, a Conservative life peer, and co-sponsored by Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative party leader and former work and pensions secretary. Atkins wrote to Maya Esslemont, the director of After Exploitation, a data mapping project tracking outcomes for slavery survivors in the UK, last week expressing her opposition to the bill. The minister said the government had been carefully considering the issues raised in the bill but “does not support the … bill in its current form. The government does not agree that victims should automatically be granted leave to remain for 12 months.” The letter added: “The government does not have an absolute exclusion from detention for any particular group.” It said that if the government did detain victims of trafficking who were vulnerable, assessments known as adults at risk were carried out and the detention was authorised by senior Home Office officials. Atkins’ letter outlines a series of measures the Home Office is taking to support trafficking victims. According to Home Office data obtained by After Exploitation through freedom of information requests, 1,256 potential trafficking victims were detained in 2019. The private member’s bill, along with a letter last October signed by dozens of NGOs, calls for increased protection for trafficking victims, particularly those at risk of deportation because they are not UK nationals. If trafficking victims are deported, not only are their lives potentially put at risk but valuable intelligence about who trafficked them could be lost. Esslemont said: “In order to be recognised as a survivor, victims are first referred by ‘first responders’ and then assessed via a two-stage process sometimes lasting years. It is insulting that even where victims undergo the gruelling steps requested of them, the government cannot meet survivors halfway with incredibly basic and short-term protection. “The current system of support and recognition is unsustainable and makes it difficult for non-UK survivors to report crime due to the threat of deportation or detention. Equally, UK survivors cannot be confident about the length of support, such as access to safe housing, they will receive if they come forward. Until the government creates a culture of safety for those exploited, it is impossible to win the trust of survivors who are rightfully fearful of seeking help.” Atkins said in a statement: “The government is committed to tackling the heinous crime of modern slavery and ensuring that victims are provided with the support they need to rebuilt their lives. We have already implemented a number of significant reforms to the national referral mechanism aimed at improving the speed, quality and independence of the decision-making, and offering the best possible support for victims.”"
2021-01-11T07:00:12Z,politics,Politics,Labour facing another split over police immunity in 'spy cops' bill,"Labour is poised to split again over a controversial bill allowing undercover agents to commit crimes while infiltrating criminal gangs, after the party’s leadership refused to back a Lords amendment from Shami Chakrabarti. The former shadow attorney general under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership says undercover police and informants could be immune to prosecution if the “spy cops” bill goes through parliament unamended. She has submitted an amendment for debate in the upper house on Monday, seeking to remove the immunity and saying that otherwise there would be “grave risk” of human rights abuses from agents acting undercover. But while Lady Chakrabarti is confident of winning Lib Dem support in the upper house, she has failed to win round the Labour leadership. Party sources said on Sunday that Labour would whip its peers to abstain. When told the leadership’s intention, the Labour peer said she intended to press her amendment to a vote, even though it was now unlikely to pass. “This is too important to be left to deals involving the usual channels,” Chakrabarti said. Labour has already split twice over the proposed legislation as it passed through the Commons. Two frontbenchers resigned in October as part of a rebellion by 34 MPs on its third reading, unhappy that the party was not prepared to vote against. A fortnight earlier 20 Labour MPs had rebelled at a second reading. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, had called on the party to abstain over the bill, arguing that statutory regulation of undercover operatives would have been necessary if the party had been in power, after the government only narrowly won a court case over the issue. Further concerns about the conduct of undercover officers resurfaced in November as a public inquiry opened into the work of the Met police’s Special Demonstration Squad (SDS), which targeted left-wing, environmental, anti-war and black justice campaigners for more than 40 years. Chakrabarti says the bill does more that codify existing policies used by MI5 and the police and, in effect, would give undercover informants and officers immunity against prosecution for crimes committed, if their actions were authorised. The legislation describes such as acts as “lawful for all purposes”. “Total legal immunity means even less incentive for some of the most volatile and manipulative people – including ‘turned criminals and terrorists’ – to behave ethically,” Chakrabarti said. “Blanket licence for crime without limit, is completely alien to equality before the law.” The peer said she believed that a group of women who successfully sued the Met in 2015 after they had been deceived into forming “abusive and manipulative” long-term relationships with undercover police officers, would probably find it impossible to bring a similar action again. “The ‘spy cops’ scandal with undercover state agents inciting and perpetrating crimes they were supposed to prevent, has yet to be investigated fully,” the peer said. It was unclear if the officers involved had their actions authorised, but Chakrabarti said it would be very difficult for future claimants to prove that either way. Peers are debating the covert human intelligence sources (Chis) bill, which reaches its report stage on Monday and Wednesday this week, where amendments are typically taken for a vote. Labour sources complained that Chakrabarti was trying to inflame internal divisions between the Corbyn and Starmer supporting wings of the party. One said there had been “no real attempt” to engage with the party leadership on the issue. The party intends to support several other amendments limiting the scope of the bill, including an amendment from Lord Dubs, requiring a judge to approve the use of a confidential source except in the case of an emergency, which is due to be voted on Monday. Conservative ministers say that the use of secret operatives remains critical in tackling terror offences, helping, for example, to halt a plot to kill former prime minister Theresa May. But former undercover police say the power is most frequently used in drug cases, where it can be at risk of abuse."
2021-01-11T00:02:03Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit UK should aim to be a global broker, not a great power, says report","Britain will fail if it seeks to reincarnate itself after Brexit as a mini-great power, and should focus instead on being a global broker for solutions to specific challenges such as climate change, cybersecurity, global health and human rights, a major report has proposed. The report by Robin Niblett, the director general of Britain’s leading foreign policy thinktank Chatham House, coincides with the 75th anniversary of the first meeting of the UN general assembly in London. It also warns that the UK will be making a mistake if it seeks to set itself up as a rival to the European Union on foreign policy, since it will need EU cooperation to meet many objectives. Niblett urges the UK not to indulge in nostalgic fantasies about individual glory or Global Britain. “Britain will fail if it now tries to reincarnate itself as an independently influential miniature great power,” he writes. “It should focus instead on being an enabler of positive international outcomes.” He also says the UK has an image problem as it strikes out on its new journey “at a moment when its competence is being called into question as a result of the government’s handling of coronavirus”. Instead, Niblett suggests, it should draw on its soft power and diplomatic network to become a practical solution seeker on some of the world’s great problems. The six subjects he chooses are climate change, human rights, Nato strength, global health, a cyber alliance of democracies and clamping down on global tax avoidance – a subject the UK championed in the past, but has since dropped. Even, he says, “enjoying unique reserves of soft power, a seat at most of the world’s top tables, and the assets to leverage the UK’s voice and support its interests does not guarantee an ability to lead global change or secure outcomes to the national advantage”. “The incoming administration of Joe Biden will seek to heal America’s relations with allies in Europe and Asia,” Niblett writes. “Brexit Britain will have to fight its way to the table on many of the most important transatlantic issues, with the EU now the US’s main counterpart in areas such as China relations and digital taxation.” The UK will also come under greater bilateral pressure than before to demonstrate its loyalty to the US or risk paying a price as the junior partner in the relationship. The test for British governments, Niblett says, will be whether they can turn the UK’s greater policy autonomy and nimbleness as a non-EU member into an asset in the relationship with the US. He argues strongly against the UK seeking to undercut the EU in foreign policy areas. “For Britain to strengthen its relations with Hungary or Turkey, for example, with no regard for the ways this could undercut the policies being developed towards them by their European neighbours would not only be hypocritical; it would be counterproductive, whatever the potential near-term economic benefits for the UK,” Niblett writes. “The EU remains the main upholder, inside and around Europe’s neighbourhood, of the political norms that Britain champions. If these are eroded, the UK will be less secure and less prosperous in the long term.” He also suggests that, in seeking new partners, the UK will have to choose not to be close to everyone, and suggests Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Russia and India as four countries with which the UK should not seek close alliances.
He also gives an implicit warning to Boris Johnson that he will have to improve and change his tone on the international stage if he is to achieve the new role he proposes for the country. A positive reputation for Britain as a valued and creative broker in the search for solutions to shared problems will need to be earned, he warns. “It will emerge only from the competence and impact of Britain’s diplomacy, from trust in its word, and from a return to the power of understatement for which the country was so widely respected in the past. Britain’s G7 presidency and co-chairmanship of COP26 [the UN’s climate change conference] in 2021 will be critical first tests.” He also urges Johnson and others to be judicious in their rhetoric, writing: “The notion of ‘Global Britain’ may have a convenient alliteration with ‘Great Britain’ but, in the minds of many, Britain became ‘Great’ by building a world-spanning empire whose injustices and inequities are now rightly being re-examined. “The government will need to be judicious in how it now goes about communicating its global agenda, especially among its Commonwealth partners.”"
2021-01-11T00:01:03Z,politics,Politics,Calls to escalate English lockdown amid fears one in five may have had Covid,"Ministers were under pressure on Sunday night to escalate the current lockdown in England amid warnings that current measures may not be tough enough. They came as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said about 2 million people – including about a third of people over the age of 80 – had already been vaccinated, and the opening of the mass vaccination sites is intended to accelerate the process. More than half a million people over the age of 80 are to receive letters inviting them to attend one of seven large coronavirus vaccination centres opening in England, where they will be able to book an appointment online or over the phone.
But, in an interview on Sunday, Hancock also said that, with hospital cases and deaths still rising sharply, the NHS was “probably under the greatest pressure it ever has been”. According to modelling seen by the Guardian, one in five people across England may have had coronavirus, equivalent to 12.4 million people, rising to almost one in two in some areas. It means that across England the true number of people infected to date may be five times as high as the total number of known cases according to the government’s track-and-trace programme. Amid concerns that people are continuing to mix more than they did during the first lockdown, Keir Starmer suggested the current lockdown measures might be inadequate. “They may not be tough enough,” the Labour leader told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. Nurseries should probably close, Starmer said. “Quite a lot of people are surprised that primary schools are closed and that nurseries aren’t closed.” Prof Peter Horby, chairman of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said the Kent variant has made the situation “more risky” and that if the infection rate does not slow down then “we’re going to have to be even stricter”. The current lockdown, England’s third, was announced in a televised address by Boris Johnson on 4 January, but Hancock on Sunday, just six days later, refused to rule out further restrictions. Reports suggested that measures could include a ban on exercising with those outside your household, the end of support bubbles, making office workers wear masks and stricter rules for supermarkets such as one-way systems and masks for outside queues. He said he did not want to speculate on what might be needed but that people should follow the rules. To drive home the importance of compliance with the restriction, Prof Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser, will be doing a round of media appearances on Monday morning to highlight the risks facing the NHS. Whitty, a regular at the No 10 press conferences but not someone who often gives interviews, is expected to stress that the risk from social contact is much greater than it was during the first lockdown because the new variant of the virus is so much more transmissible. Ministers are confident that the vaccination programme will ultimately provide a release from lockdown and mass vaccination centres will open from Monday at the ExCel centre in London, Ashton Gate in Bristol, Epsom racecourse in Surrey, Millennium Point in Birmingham; Robertson House in Stevenage; Etihad tennis club in Manchester; and the Centre for Life in Newcastle upon Tyne. Letters are being sent out to more than 600,000 people over the age of 80 living up to 45 minutes away from one of the sites inviting them to book an appointment. Anyone already offered a vaccination appointment by their local GP can choose which suits them best. Many more GP and hospital vaccination facilities are also due to open this week, as well as the first Boots pharmacy-based pilots, taking the total number of vaccination centres in England to about 1,200.
The large vaccination centres, which will also provide the jab to NHS staff, will be the first services to deploy volunteers from St John Ambulance and the NHS volunteer responder scheme who are helping with the programme. The government is committed to ensuring that everyone in the top four vaccination priority groups – care home residents and staff, NHS and care staff, the over-70s and the clinically extremely vulnerable – will have been offered a jab by 15 February. On Monday Hancock will also publish the government’s Covid-19 UK vaccines delivery plan, which he will set out at a No 10 press conference. Hancock said the document was being released “so the public can be assured of the time, effort and resources that have gone and will go into ensuring we protect the British people from the scourge of this virus”. Hancock said the government wanted to vaccinate everyone in the remaining five of the nine priority groups drawn up by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) – everyone else over the age of 50, and people over 16 with serious underlying health conditions – by the spring. It wanted to vaccinate all adults by the autumn, he said. Starmer said the priority list should be reviewed after the first four groups have been covered, with perhaps teachers being added as a new category, but the Department of Health said the independent JCVI drew up the list, and a JCVI source said there were no plans to revise the nine groups already included. On Sunday the UK recorded 54,940 further coronavirus cases and 563 further deaths. Although both figures were lower than the numbers for preceding days, the total number of reported deaths in the last seven days (6,363) is 49% up on the previous week. Ministers are also particularly alarmed about hospital numbers. The most recent UK-wide data showed 32,294 Covid patients in hospital on Thursday last week, with admissions up 35% week on week. That is more than 10,000 higher than the UK total for hospital numbers at the peak of the first wave in April. On Sunday Tracy Nicholls, chief executive of the College of Paramedics, told Sky News that the ambulance service was currently under “unprecedented” pressure and that there were cases of patients having to wait “five, six, seven, eight, even nine hours” to be transferred from an ambulance to a hospital because of a shortage of beds.
She also said she had heard of patients with non-life-threatening conditions in areas such as London and the south-east having to wait up to 10 hours for an ambulance to arrive. Hancock said that he expected the government to be able to ease restrictions in the spring but he refused to spell out exactly when he considered spring to be over. One unnamed government official was quoted in the Sunday Times as saying pubs might not be allowed to open in England until the May bank holiday. In a speech on Monday, Starmer will say the government should make putting families first a priority during the lockdown and he will challenge the government to commit to protecting family incomes by preventing the planned council tax rise, reversing the planned cut to universal credit and giving key workers a pay rise. Starmer will also urge people to take inspiration from the Labour government of 1945 when rebuilding after the pandemic, saying: “We can build a country worthy of the sacrifices of the British people, just as we did in 1945 when Attlee’s government built the welfare state from the rubble of war.”"
2021-01-10T20:00:11Z,politics,Politics,Labour calls for more help for working parents in England lockdown,"Ministers are being urged to change the eligibility rules for the government’s coronavirus job retention scheme to support working parents and others during the latest national lockdown in England. The call came as fresh analysis showed almost four million people said childcare responsibilities affected their work the last time schools were closed. According to a survey carried out by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), more than 22 million people reported that the first lockdown had affected their work. Almost four million, or 17.9%, cited childcare responsibilities as the reason. With schools closed until February half-term at the earliest, the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has called on her government counterpart, Rishi Sunak, to take urgent action to help those with caring responsibilities through the current lockdown. Dodds said: “Four million working parents found it hard to juggle work and childcare during the first lockdown. “Almost a year on, the government must change the eligibility rules of the furlough scheme to support working parents and other workers through the current lockdown. Early years providers are also teetering on the brink, with this new lockdown likely to further impact attendance.” Under current rules, individuals who start a new job after 31 October are no longer eligible for the scheme. ONS data suggests 520,000 people changed jobs between July and September last year. In the same data, 625,000 people changed jobs between April and June. This means some individuals who started a new job after 31 October could be denied access to furlough during the latest lockdown. Dodds believes that without childcare provisions, there will be significant effect on parents’ ability to continue to work. “It is a short-term financial consideration to not be supporting childcare providers right now,” she said. “That will have an enormous impact on a parent’s ability to work, particularly mothers, and we know that already mothers have been more likely to be made unemployed or to have to changed their hours very radically because of this crisis. This really is a crunch point for a lot of families and a lot of working parents. “We’ve had more guidance about how to play tennis from the government than what working parents should be doing with childcare for their kids and protecting their incomes. That’s really got to change now.” Anne Malindine, the CEO of Raised in Bristol, said: “We’re being asked to be the heroes of the hour but no one was interested in our experiences before. Why are we not, for example, in the priority list for vaccination? Children are living in households of adults and coming into nursery every day. “We can do our best and, undoubtedly, we are, but I think there hasn’t been an opportunity for feedback from a sector that has suddenly has a huge responsibility put on it. And I think that’s really evident for the first time. I haven’t seen it before.” The impact of Covid-19 since March has led to a stark decline in the number of families accessing childcare places. A survey carried out by the Early Years Alliance in November found that 25% of childcare providers believed they would cease to be viable within six months if the government changes its approach to early-years funding next year. According to Labour analysis, this could result in nearly 19,000 childcare providers being forced to close their doors within six months, and more than 30,000 at risk of closure by next Christmas.
A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “Early years settings remain low risk environments for children and staff and there is no evidence that the new variant of coronavirus disproportionately affects young children. “Keeping nurseries and childminders open will support parents and deliver the crucial care and education for our youngest children. “We are funding nurseries as usual and all children are able to attend their early years setting in all parts of England. Where nurseries do see a drop in income from either parent-paid fees or income from DfE, they are able to use the furlough scheme. “Working parents on coronavirus support schemes will still remain eligible for childcare support even if their income levels fall below the minimum requirement.” A spokesperson for the Treasury said: “It’s been clear since the first lockdown that employers can furlough eligible employees who have childcare responsibilities, including because of school closures.”"
2021-01-10T19:47:10Z,politics,Politics,Raab to clampdown on firms linked to forced labour in Xinjiang,"Dominic Raab is to address concerns over UK complicity in the use of forced labour in China’s Xinjiang province with more requirements on companies that buy goods there and possible sanctions on Chinese officials believed to be instrumental in the abuse. Proposals released by the foreign secretary this week could include fines if companies fail to meet commitments to show due diligence in their supply chains. A proposal for a total ban on cotton from the province is thought not to be feasible. The measures due to be announced by Raab and the trade secretary, Liz Truss, in the Commons on Wednesday come as a Conservative party human rights commission (CPHRC) backed by former Tory foreign secretaries prepare to demand the government do more to challenge China. The Foreign Office does not regard its supply chain measures as representing a definitive new government stance on British-Chinese relations, and will steer clear of proposing sanctions against officials involved in the suppression of democracy in Hong Kong. China, however, will resent suggestions that it allows the use of forced labour. China’s outgoing ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, said last week that relations between the two countries “depend on whether the UK sees China as a partner or a rival, respects China’s core interests and major concerns, and abides by the basic norms governing international relations, including non-interference in each other’s internal affairs”. “The ball is in the court of the UK side,” he said. The CPHRC will claim forced labour is rife in Xinjiang province, which supplies nearly a quarter of the world’s cotton. The Chinese government has long denied the claims, insisting that camps for workers are “vocational training schools” and factories are part of a huge, and voluntary, poverty alleviation scheme. Ministers are expected to extend the number of organisations subject to reporting obligations under the Modern Slavery Act (MSA); introduce binding rules on the content, timing and publication of modern slavery statements; and propose a single enforcement body to oversee MSA compliance. Limited financial or civil penalties for organisations that fail to comply are also being considered. As many as five officials were being considered for Magnitsky sanctions, which target those involved in human rights abuses. The Foreign Office refuses to discuss who may soon be subject to sanctions in advance. A Foreign Office spokesman said: “Our approach to China is rooted in our values and interests. However, where we have concerns, we raise them and hold China to account. We have done this consistently over the treatment of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang.” Rights groups say Xinjiang’s Uighur minority are being persecuted and recruited for forced labour. Photographic evidence suggests many of the camps do contain factories. Two Commons select committees are investigating the issue of forced labour, showing the degree of concern. As public awareness grows, many fashion brands are increasingly fearful they will be revealed to be unwittingly and indirectly sourcing cotton products from the region in China’s far west, and have been scrambling to make commitments about their supply chains. Raab will also set out his opposition to a Lords all-party amendment giving UK courts a right to declare if countries are committing genocide. A group of Conservative backbench MPs are supporting an amendment passed in the Lords that calls for the UK not to strike bilateral trade deals, including with China, if a British high court makes a preliminary assessment that the country has committed or is committing genocide. The amendment has the backing of Iain Duncan Smithand the Labour human rights barrister Helena Kennedy. The government opposes the measure on the grounds that determination of genocide is for international courts."
2021-01-10T15:28:59Z,politics,Politics,Musicians hit out after report UK rejected visa-free EU travel,"The government has been called spineless after a report it rejected a deal with the EU that would have given musicians visa-free touring on the continent, saving acts from expensive and potentially prohibitive post-Brexit bureaucracy. The Independent reported that despite the government’s claim Brussels had rejected an “ambitious” reciprocal touring arrangement, an EU source said it was the UK that refused to accept European acts having 90 days of visa-free travel. The unnamed source, who was said to be close to the negotiations, was reported as saying in “agreements with third countries, that [work] visas are not required for musicians. We tried to include it, but the UK said no”. The source accused the government of lying about the negotiations, and said the UK refused to agree because “they were ending freedom of movement”. The Department of Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS) had released a statement that said the UK had “pushed for a more ambitious agreement with the EU”, which would have covered musicians but its “proposals were rejected.” Priti Patel’s immigration reforms were blamed for the tougher restrictions on touring EU musicians, which require them to apply for visas for stays of more than 30 days and provide proof of savings and a sponsorship certificate. The DCMS stood by its original statement, reiterating its claim that it “pushed for a more ambitious agreement with the EU on the temporary movement of business travellers, which would have covered musicians”, while dismissing the story, calling it “incorrect and misleading speculation from anonymous EU sources”. Radiohead’s Thom Yorke responded to the report by calling the government spineless, while others demanded strong collective action as the music industry struggles to cope with the impact of Covid-19 and the prospect of costly EU touring. Horace Trubridge, the general secretary of the Musicians’ Union, called for the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, to clarify what occurred, saying the situation was unbelievable after months of campaigning for “musicians’ passports” that would allow visa and permit-free travel. The composer, broadcaster and crossbench peer Michael Berkeley said he had submitted an urgent question to the Lord Speaker over the issue. If “the story holds up then it would mean that, albeit by omission, we have been misled about these negotiations,” he said. Labour said that if it was confirmed the government had stopped musicians from touring in Europe to “make a political point, then music fans will not forgive them”. A petition backed by musicians including Laura Marling, Biffy Clyro and Dua Lipa has amassed more than 200,000 signatures and calls for the government to “negotiate a free cultural work permit that gives us visa-free travel throughout the 27 EU states for music touring professionals, bands, musicians, artists, TV and sports celebrities that tour the EU to perform shows and events and carnet exception for touring equipment”. Failure to agree a bloc-wide arrangement that means acts no longer need to acquire work permits for every European country they visit could rule out or dramatically curtail EU touring, according to musicians. Bands and orchestras said the bureaucracy could stop them from travelling to Europe, describing Covid-19 restrictions and the post-Brexit requirements a “double whammy” to an already devastated music industry."
2021-01-10T13:12:06Z,politics,Politics,HMRC to waive fines for taxpayers who file late returns due to Covid,"People who file their tax returns late won’t face a fine this year, as long as they can show that the delay was due to coronavirus. In a show of forbearance that could offer relief to millions of workers, HM Revenue & Customs will take a lenient stance towards people who file after 31 January for Covid-related reasons. The move means pressures of home schooling could be deemed a valid reason for delay, while people who can show that either they or their accountant have recently been ill with the virus are also likely to be shown clemency.
HMRC said: “We want to encourage as many people as possible to file on time even if they can’t pay their tax straight away. But where a customer is unable to do so because of the impact of Covid-19 we will accept they have a reasonable excuse and cancel penalties, provided they manage to file as soon as possible after that.” About 12 million people file their own tax return because they are self-employed, a landlord or have a second form of income. HMRC said slightly more than half had already filed a return by 4 January, meaning millions could benefit from an extension. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is also weighing up whether to extend the deadline for everybody, moving it from 31 January to March, according to the Sunday Times, which first reported the story. Kevin Sefton, chief executive of the tax app firm Untied, said a nationwide extension would help avoid HMRC being flooded with millions of excuse forms around the deadline.
“Covid-19 and the associated effects such as having to home-school children are circumstances that the self-employed population of the UK cannot control and are therefore causing these individuals extreme anxiety,” he said. “Challenges like these make it incredibly difficult for some people and business to stay afloat so we welcome anything that HMRC can do to ease the burden on the working population. “We are again calling on HMRC to extend the deadline officially for both filing and paying. This will reduce admin and paperwork at HMRC and uncertainty and worry for taxpayers.”"
2021-01-10T12:43:15Z,politics,Politics,Starmer accepts end of EU free movement in Brexit reversal,"Keir Starmer has abandoned the commitment to free movement of people in the European Union he made to Labour members during the party’s leadership contest. The Labour leader said his party had to be honest with the public, and that if it won the next general election a major renegotiation of the Brexit treaty would not be possible. The deal, which was finalised on Christmas Eve, confirmed the end of free movement for Britons and EU nationals within each others’ countries because it kept the UK out of the single market, as the Tories promised in their 2019 election manifesto. In an interview with the BBC’s Andrew Marr, Starmer was reminded that when standing for the Labour leadership after the party’s election defeat he said, as one of 10 pledges, he would “defend free movement as we leave the EU”. Marr also pointed out that in January 2019, when he was asked specifically if he would bring back free movement of EU citizens to the UK, he had replied: “Yes of course, bring back, argue for, challenge.” Starmer told Marr, however, that he was ruling out the sort of extensive renegotiation of the Brexit treaty that would be required to restore free movement. “I don’t think that there’s scope for major renegotiation. We’ve just had four years of negotiation. We’ve arrived at a treaty and now we’ve got to make that treaty work,” he said. He said there were aspects of the treaty that might be improved on, including how it covered the creative industries and what it did for the service sector, which he said had largely been left out. When it was put to him that this would disappoint Labour members who voted for him because of his commitment to free movement, Starmer said it was not realistic to pretend that the EU would want to negotiate a new Brexit treaty with the UK. “Whether we like it or not, that is going to be the treaty that an incoming Labour government inherits and has to make work. And it is not being straight with the British public to say we can come into office in 2024 and operate some other treaty,” he said. Free movement became an issue in the leadership campaign after the party conference backed the principle in autumn 2019. The commitment was linked to defending migrants’ rights generally, but it contradicted previous party comments saying free movement would end if the UK left the EU. Asked by Marr if he thought government debt, at about 100% of GDP, was at a dangerous level, Starmer said: “We’re going to have to reassess debt.” He would not, however, say how until he knew the state of the economy at the time of the next election.
He refused to commit to renewing Labour’s 2019 pledge for free broadband in the next election manifesto, although he said more should be done to improve broadband access for disadvantaged pupils and their families. Starmer also said he did not favour another Scottish independence referendum now, but that he thought Boris Johnson was wrong to rule one out for another 40 years. He also said the status quo with regard to Scotland wasn’t working, which is why he said Labour favoured a constitutional commission."
2021-01-10T11:18:37Z,politics,Politics,"Boris Johnson should resign as PM, 43% of people tell survey","More people think Boris Johnson should resign as prime minister than think he should continue in office, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. The first poll of 2021 found that 43% thought he should resign, while 40% said that he should remain as leader. However, most Conservative voters (87%) think Johnson should stay on as leader, with just 7% thinking he should resign. Just 20% believed Keir Starmer should resign as Labour leader, with 52% saying he should remain as leader. There were also signs of a slight drop in support for the government’s handling of coronavirus. Some 72% (+4 on the last poll) think the government has not acted fast enough, with 42% (+4) thinking they are definitely not acting fast enough.
The public appear to want to err on the side of caution in terms of Covid restrictions. More than three in five (64%) said they would prefer “a government who quickly puts lockdown measures in place, even if that means that sometimes measures are put in place that didn’t need to be”. Only 25% said they would prefer “a government who tries the hardest they can not to put lockdown measures in place, even if that means that sometimes decisions are made later than they would otherwise have been”. Johnson’s overall approval numbers have seen a slight drop. The proportion approving is now 37% (down one point from the last poll), while 45% disapprove (up one point). The government’s handling of the virus more generally has also seen a small drop. The number who approve is now 31% (-3), while the number disapproving is 48% (+3). This is the highest disapproval number since early November. Overall, Labour hold a one-point lead on 40% of the vote, with the Conservatives on 39%. The Lib Dems are on 6%, the SNP on 5%, and the Greens on 4%. Opinium polled 2,003 people online on 6-7 January."
2021-01-10T07:30:44Z,politics,Politics,"Baffling Brexit rules threaten export chaos, Gove is warned","Ministers must restart trade negotiations with Brussels immediately to sort out the “baffling” array of post-Brexit rules and regulations that now threaten much of the UK’s export trade to the EU, leading business groups have said. Amid mounting anger among UK firms at cross-border friction they were told would not exist, British manufacturing and trade organisations met Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove in an emergency session on Thursday to discuss problems resulting from the deal struck by Boris Johnson with the EU before Christmas. The prime minister had hailed what he claimed was a “zero-tariff” and “zero-quotas” deal that would allow free and simple access to the single market. Less than a month on, however, Britain’s EU departure appears to be anything but pain-free. One leading figure involved in the talks with Gove described the new rule book as a “complete shitshow”. Another said Gove seemed “very concerned” at hearing reports of problems, after a week in which Marks & Spencer was among leading companies to warn that more bureaucracy would increase costs. The source added: “He [Gove] seemed to realise the full gravity of the situation that is unfolding and about to get worse.” Gove admitted on Friday that there would be “significant additional disruption” at UK borders as a result of Brexit customs changes in the coming weeks. In the first week after the UK finally left both the single market and customs union, the parcels firm DPD suspended some of its services, bookseller Waterstones halted sales to customers in the EU and UK fishermen warned they would not be able to sell their fresh produce into EU markets because of delays at borders. There were also problems with consignments between Great Britain and Northern Ireland as new border checks caught many businesses unawares. Luxury food store Fortnum & Mason also told customers on its website: “We are temporarily unable to deliver to Northern Ireland or countries in the European Union”, while Debenhams has temporarily shut its online business in Ireland. Some of the problems are being blamed on a rushed deal, and others on the sheer complexity of arrangements including “rules of origin”, some of which have not been finally determined. Only goods made up largely of parts that originate in the UK qualify as tariff-free. Stephen Kelly, chief executive of the Northern Ireland business organisation Manufacturing NI, said: “The reason why the UK and EU originally agreed that there would be an implementation period of 11 months was so that people could get their heads around what was needed and assure their businesses were compliant. But we didn’t have that. We had seven days before everyone had to be ready, and one of those was Christmas Day. “There is a big problem with GB businesses being unaware of their new responsibilities. We have the triple whammy here of Covid, Christmas and new customs rules arriving all at once without any time to adjust.” Johnson assured Northern Ireland business owners in November 2019 that they would have “unfettered access” to the rest of the UK. “There will be no forms, no checks, no barriers of any kind,” he said. If anyone told them they needed to fill in forms, “tell them to ring up the PM and I will direct them to throw that form in the bin.” The government was also facing pressure over its Brexit deal from the SNP. Ian Blackford, the party’s leader in Westminster, called on the UK government to “pay compensation to Scotland”, claiming a “multibillion compensation package” was needed to mitigate the costs of Brexit in Scotland. Stephen Phipson, chief executive of the manufacturers’ organisation Make UK, said much still needed to be negotiated between the UK and EU. “Industry welcomed the trade agreement that avoided the catastrophe of no-deal, as tariffs and quotas would have been a disaster for exporters. However, this is only a starting point, as there are still substantial issues that need ironing out, with many months, if not years, of tough negotiations ahead. “There are customs experts with 30 years’ experience who are baffled by what the new regulations mean, let alone small- and medium-sized businesses who have never had to deal with the kind of paperwork that is now required. The great fear is that for many it will prove too much and they will simply choose not to export to the EU.” He also raised fears about the UK car industry, which could be adversely affected by tariffs if EU rules relating to the origins of components used in car manufacture cannot be met. “Having built up seamless and complex supply chains over decades, the automotive sector in the UK is facing a jolt to its systems that places its very future under threat,” he added. “While there is no suggestion multinationals will close plants overnight, we have already seen decisions to build new models placed elsewhere. As those models that have been built in the UK for many years come to the end of their life, we are likely to see a slow puncture for the sector of investment drifting away.” Dominic Goudie head of international trade at the Food and Drink Federation said talks needed to re-start between the UK Brussels. “Where problems emerge there will need to be further conversations,” he said. “The trade deal provides the means to do that. It is a question of whether there is the will to do so (after so many months of talks).” Sam Lowe, a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform, said there were problems that could grow over coming weeks and months. “The new import/export formalities are proving problematic for many companies. The lack of obvious queues at the border disguises the fact that many trucks are stuck in depots, unable to head to the ports due to their clients failing to provide the necessary documentation and information.”"
2021-01-09T08:00:16Z,politics,Politics,May elections to go ahead in UK despite coronavirus concerns,"Elections due in May are expected to go ahead despite coronavirus, officials have said, amid warnings they are likely to be among the most logistically fraught and complicated the UK has witnessed. Boris Johnson told MPs this week that while the plan was still for local and mayoral elections, some of which were postponed from last year, to happen on 6 May in England, this remained “under review”. Officials stress that while the pandemic means all government plans are theoretically subject to change, the strong expectation is the polls will go ahead. In England, as well as a double set of council elections, there will be ballots for the London mayor and assembly, for a series of other mayors, and for police and crime commissioners (PCCs). Scotland and Wales are holding elections on the same day for their parliaments, and for PCCs in Wales. Each UK nation organises its own elections. While Scotland’s government has left open the prospect of the Holyrood elections being staged over two to three days, to allow distancing and cleaning at polling stations, England is committed to its usual timetable. Election officials are warning that while turnout at English local elections tends to be low, the practicalities could mount up, not least because of the sheer number of contests taking place, with some voters receiving up to seven polling cards. With the government rejecting the idea of all-postal voting, polling staff will be protected by plastic screens. Voters will socially distance and be encouraged to bring their own pens. They will show polling cards rather than handing them over. There are nonetheless worries about attracting enough volunteer election staff, many of whom tend to be older, and about finding venues, with schools and community halls potentially wary about hundreds of people tramping through their building. With people able to apply for postal votes up to 11 working days before the election, there is also uncertainty of how many of these need to be produced – and thus how many people will turn out in person. Peter Stanyon, the chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators, which represents election officials, said the situation was hugely complex. He said: “I’m confident in my colleagues to do all they can to deliver a safe and secure election. If you’d asked me this a month ago, I’d have been more bullish. We are concerned, as key decisions and planning are happening now, without really knowing what the situation will be like in May.” All the preparations will cost money. While the Cabinet Office says councils can provide for this out of Covid funding already granted, the Local Government Association says government “will need to meet any additional costs of holding these elections in these extraordinary circumstances”.
It also remains to be seen whether distancing rules might hamper campaigning, much depending on the speed of Covid vaccinations. If significant restrictions remain in place there is a worry it could favour incumbent candidates, as regular election practices such as handing out leaflets and knocking on doors would be impossible. In Wales – where the elections will be the first to include 16- and 17-year-old voters – people are being encouraged to vote by post, and plans are in place to delay the poll if needed. In Scotland, there have been isolated calls for the election to be postponed but Nicola Sturgeon, whose Scottish National party is at 58% in opinion polls, has said she can see “no reason at this stage” why they would not go ahead. Neil Findlay, a Labour MSP who is quitting Holyrood at the election, said there were strong public health reasons to postpone the vote. “Can you think of any other place during this crisis where we’d be encouraging thousands of people to go into the same small spaces? That’s effectively what we’d be doing,” he said."
2021-01-08T19:25:57Z,politics,Politics,Firms halt deliveries from UK to EU over Brexit border problems,"A growing number of retailers and courier firms are suspending or cutting back deliveries into the EU as companies grapple with new border controls as well as import taxes. On Friday DPD, the international delivery giant, said it was “pausing” its road service from the UK into Europe, including the Republic of Ireland. Separately, Marks & Spencer said it was concerned that a third of the products in its Irish food halls, including Percy Pig sweets, would now be subject to import tariffs. Such taxes could spell higher prices for shoppers. DPD said new border procedures, including additional customs paperwork, needed for parcels destined for Europe were putting extra pressure on turnaround and transit times. The company said it was returning one-fifth of parcels to the sender because they had incorrect or incomplete data attached. It also blamed delays and congestion at UK ports for its decision, as well as more rigid requirements for Channel crossings. The firm said it hoped to restart the service on Wednesday. The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, said he expected there to be “significant additional disruption” at UK borders as a result of Brexit customs changes in the coming weeks. Speaking to broadcasters, he said: “So far disruption at the border hasn’t been too profound but it is the case that in the weeks ahead we expect that there will be significant additional disruption, particularly on the Dover-Calais route. It is our responsibility in government to make sure that business is as ready as possible, and hauliers and traders have already done a lot but we have to redouble our efforts to communicate the precise paperwork that is required in order to make sure that trade can flow freely.” Although the government sealed a “tariff-free” trade deal on Christmas Eve, it has emerged that food and clothing products that do not qualify as made in Britain could be hit with levies.
Under the agreement, if more than 40% of the pre-finished value of a UK firm’s product was not British, it would attract tariffs. Boris Johnson was said to have swerved the topic of Brexit impact in a call with more than 200 business leaders earlier this week. “It was a meaningless call, it was all mottoes – we are going to build back business better, build back business greener – and a few patsy questions about how much better it would be, nothing about the realities of Brexit and Covid hitting us all hard,” said one business leader. The department store chains Debenhams and John Lewis, which recently closed its international business, are among the big names no longer serving the Irish market. Fortnum & Mason, the famous London department store, has also temporarily ceased shipping to Northern Ireland and EU countries. The bookseller Waterstones has also suspended sales to customers in EU countries, as has the fashion chain Jigsaw. Retailers have been hit by the cost of customs paperwork that applies to all imports and exports, including goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. M&S has temporarily cut nearly 400 products from the food and drink aisles of its 20 stores in Northern Ireland. Sainsbury’s has made a similar move and filled the gaps on its shelves with products from Spar shops. The moves are designed to simplify the business and so avoid the delays at the border amid reports of retailers having trucks turned back. The reduction of M&S’s range equates to about 5% of the 6,500 products usually sold in M&S food halls and includes popular ready-meals such as lasagne and beef bourguignon, as well as takeaway salads and some essential lines such as bread, sugar and teabags. A spokesperson for M&S said it had served customers in Northern Ireland for over 50 years and its priority was to provide the “same choice … our loyal customers have always enjoyed”. Its stores had been receiving regular deliveries this week but the changes came as it moved over to new processes, he said. M&S has also warned that more than 2,000 of its food products, including Percy Pigs, could attract new import taxes when re-exported to its stores in EU countries such as Ireland and France. The new “rules of origin” regulations dictate whether tariffs must be paid based on where a product’s ingredients come from and where it has been manufactured. The M&S chief executive, Steve Rowe, said: “Tariff-free does not feel like tariff-free when you read the fine print. For big businesses there will be time-consuming workarounds but for a lot of others this means paying tariffs or rebasing into the EU.” Tesco said it had experienced short delays moving goods into Northern Ireland but that it had a “good supply of products coming into Northern Ireland”. It added: “There has been a short delay on certain products but we’re working with suppliers to get these back on the shelves as quickly as possible and direct customers to alternatives where we can.” Tesco said it was discussing the rules of origin regulations with HMRC and Irish Revenue and hoped “to find a satisfactory resolution as quickly as possible”. The British Retail Consortium said: “At least 50 of our members, all of them large retailers, face potential tariffs for re-exporting goods to the EU.” Dominic Goudie, the head of international trade at the Food and Drink Federation, said some product-specific rules meant exports were no longer viable, with “serious challenges for supply chains that span across the UK and EU”. He also said EU-produced food and drink that moved to other EU markets via Great Britain without further manufacturing taking place in Britain faced the payment of full EU tariffs on return to the EU. “As a result, suppliers are being forced to cancel deliveries of products to customers, particular those in Ireland,” he added. One unnamed source for a logistics business spoke of mayhem behind the scenes. He described how one truckload of parcels had to be completely offloaded and relabelled on Thursday night before export to the EU, simply because one line on the code for goods was wrong. He also told of companies hiking charges for invoices to £3.50 a parcel going to Europe, making low-value goods too expensive to export. John Arbon Textiles, a small artisan knitting wool company in Devon, said it had been told by DPD that its spools and balls of fibre would not be accepted in Europe.
“I feel DPD are being cautious, but I have no confidence that I can send anything to my customers in the EU at the moment,” the business’s owner, Juliet Arbon, said. Northern Ireland’s chief vet has said goods arriving in the region, which is now following EU rules for imports, would be destroyed or returned if not compliant after a short grace period. Robert Huey told a Stormont committee that some companies contracted to do the paperwork for hauliers were “overwhelmed” and in one case a staff member had to show a major supermarket how to complete its paperwork."
2021-01-08T17:33:02Z,politics,Politics,Irish politician calls for investigation into Leave.EU's Irish registration,"An Irish politician has called for an investigation into how Leave.EU was able to secure a web address that should have been reserved for European citizens, after it was revealed that the campaign group’s website was registered under the name of an Irish man based in Waterford. Neale Richmond, a teachta dála (member of parliament), has written to ComReg, the Irish communications regulator, calling for the body “to ensure that the company meets all necessary requirements to hold a .eu web domain”. “I am deeply concerned by this move and would like to receive assurances as to whether this move is a legitimate way to retain the web domain following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union,” Richmond’s letter continues.
When contacted by the Guardian, he said: “I see Leave.EU to be an odious organisation with a dubious reputation that spews bile, often directed specifically at Ireland. I am asking for scrutiny of their operations and qualifications.” Alongside his letter, Richmond shared examples of Leave.EU messaging, including tweets calling the former taoiseach Leo Varadkar an “EU lapdog” and “childish”, and dubbing Joe Biden an “Irish nationalist” who “is no friend of Britain”. Sean Power, the Irish businessman whose name appears on Leave.EU’s domain registration, insists he has never heard of the company. “My lawyers are looking into this on my behalf presently and will be in touch as deemed necessary in due course,” said Power, the chief executive of Business Services Group, a Waterford-based company. “I have nothing to do with Leave.EU and never heard of it before yesterday.” Andy Wigmore, head of communications for Leave.EU, asked for comment about both Power’s and Richmond’s claims, replied “Good lol”, with an emoji of a face laughing tears of joy. Under EU law, domain names ending in .eu can be owned only by European citizens, or by businesses and individuals based in Europe. Before Brexit, Wigmore had suggested that Leave.EU was content to lose access to its domain name if the eventual relationship between Britain and the EU did not allow for the name to be kept. But this week, after Britain’s transition period came to an end, domain registration records showed the pro-Brexit campaign group had in fact transferred ownership to a shell company based in Ireland, with Power’s email address listed as the contact. • This article was amended on 12 January 2021 to use the Irish term for a member of the Irish parliament."
2021-01-08T16:14:54Z,politics,Politics,'I'm stuck here': lorry drivers in Calais begin to feel effects of Brexit,"Roger White arrived in France at 2.30pm on Tuesday with a truckload of hard cheese from Somerset. Before Brexit he would have rolled off the Eurotunnel train and carried on up the A16 to Belgium, unloading his wares a few hours later at his ultimate destination in Utrecht. But 24 hours after setting foot on European soil, the 69-year-old driver from Yeovil is still sitting in his cab in the Eurotunnel compound in Calais after being asked to reverse into a special unloading bay at a newly built border control post for sanitary and phytosanitary checks (SPS) checks on food. “I’ve been here since yesterday afternoon and I am stuck here until God knows when. I have to wait until I am cleared to go,” he said.
He knew there was trouble ahead when he drove off the shuttle and the electronic display assigned him the orange lane instead of the green, indicating he would be subjected to an inspection by authorities. “I think they are picking on the English trucks maybe,” he said, as there was nothing wrong with the cheese. “Just missing paperwork.” Until it arrived, he would not be free to go. “I am just waiting here. It is terrible – not good at all,” he said. A driver for 48 years, White remembers what it was like before the single market in 1993 swept away the trade barriers that Brexit has re-erected. “We had customs checks before but it was so well organised on the border,” he remembers. “Everybody is learning as they go. You can do your preparations beforehand but it’s not enough. All of this is new to everyone and unfortunately there is nothing we can do about it. We just have to get used to it,” he said. Eurotunnel traffic is exceptionally low seven days after Brexit with drivers and exporters still avoiding the ports and Channel train services, partly because of pre-Brexit stockpiling and partly because business is conventionally quieter in the first two weeks of the new year. In normal times, 6,000 to 9,000 HGVs cross the Channel each day, but the Department for Transport said just over 2,000 HGVs crossed on 6 January, the day of the Guardian’s visit, with “90%” of those trucks border-ready. It tested 1,081 drivers for Covid that day, with six coming back positive, bringing the number of tests carried out on drivers to 46,563 since the chaos on 23 December.
Just down from White’s truck are another 30 or 40 HGVs also waiting clearance. The French drivers Benjamin Brogniart and Michael Delattre have come from Corby in Northamptonshire with lorries packed with red plastic packaging for industrial batteries. They have been stuck in the lorry park since 8pm the night before. “Brexit, for us, it’s not very good,” said Brogniart. Another French driver, Alexandre Tronet, joins the conversation. “This is what you wanted. You wanted Brexit,” he said. “I got here at 6am,” he added, putting his waiting time so far at six and a half hours. Again he has to wait until the freight owner sends over the correct customs paperwork to authorities stationed at the Eurotunnel border post. “You make the decisions at the last minute. They should have had this ready in the autumn and this would be running properly,” he said.
Eurotunnel said so far Brexit had gone smoothly with the vast majority “fully compliant” with the new trading arrangements, and it was determined to help British exporters get to grips with the system. “Our aim is to have people spend as little time as possible here. Apart from teething problems, everything has gone very smoothly,” said John Keefe, the director of public affairs. “For the few trucks that are stopped, we have our Eurotunnel border service to help them through the process. They meet the drivers on arrival, help them go through the paperwork or inspection and help them gather whatever documents are missing so that they can leave here as soon as possible. They also make sure the drivers, the haulage companies and the traders understand what was missing and what they need to have with them to avoid stopping next time.” These maiden Brexit disruptions offer a glimpse of the potential for delays when traffic levels at Dover and Calais return to normal levels at the end of this month. Eurotunnel said it had been Brexit-ready since March 2019 when it first put the infrastructure now being deployed in place at a cost of £47m.
It already operates an array of controls and checks on those travelling the other way, including safety checks using sniffer dogs. They are deployed on every truck at the “pit stop” inspection point, trained to identify stowaways. The stop now also provides an opportunity to scan drivers’ paperwork for exports into Britain.
On the other side of the channel, the UK has delayed the imposition of Brexit checks for six months: some of the lorry parks are not ready, nor is business, as the Brexit deal was only sealed on Christmas Eve. It has put in place mitigation measures to avert a repeat of the mayhem on Kent roads before Christmas. One of those is the Michael Gove-inspired Kent Access Permit (KAP) – being called the Brexit passport – which is issued electronically to trucks whose suppliers have to testify they have all their paperwork for the Channel crossing in order. The Cabinet Office said 18,000 KAPs had been issued so far and “around 700 lorries have been turned away from the border” with a further 150 fines handed out for non-compliance. “One of our guys was fined £300,” said Delattre. The driver was caught not by police, but when he went to the Ashford HMRC park to get a Covid test, which are now mandatory before boarding either a train or ferry to France."
2021-01-08T15:39:27Z,politics,Politics,Johnson promised tariff-free trade – so why is Brexit reality so different?,"Less than two weeks after Boris Johnson celebrated what he described as his “jumbo” Brexit deal that would guarantee tariff-free trade with the EU, British businesses have found the small print tells a different story. Some EU retailers say they will not sell into Britain because they would have to register in the UK for VAT, while other high street names including Marks & Spencer are finding that those goods not largely made in Britain could indeed be subject to tariffs. Why is this happening? John Lewis says its decision to stop selling into the EU is not related to Brexit but a strategic decision to concentrate its business on the UK. Other businesses, however, have told customers they have suspended exports to the EU or into the UK while they get to grips with the new trading arrangements.
One of the big issues is whether goods sold by retailers into Europe are subject to tariffs. Under the Brexit deal a product will attract tariffs if more than 40% of its pre-finished value is neither of British nor EU origin, from Japan, for example. Big retailers will take time to calculate their exposure to tariffs and some have suspended all sales to the EU while they work out their new cost base. The cost of new paperwork, including customs declarations required on goods being traded in both directions, is another consideration, as is the £150-a-time health certificate require on all consignments of food. What about companies selling into the UK? Because the UK is no longer in the EU-wide VAT system, the government is requiring EU businesses to register for a UK VAT number, charge VAT at the point of sale and hand over the tax to HMRC. The bike parts supplier Dutch Bike Bits said on its website it had been forced by a “ludicrous” policy to stop dealing with UK customers, despite that fact that it had “many customers within the UK and would like to be able to trade [with them]”. “The British government has decided to require every company which exports to the UK to apply and collect British taxes on behalf of the British government,” it said. Other companies deciding to stop shipping to individual consumers in the UK include Beer On Web, a Belgian beer specialist; BestSecret, a German designer merchandise site; the Belgian chocolate manufacturer Neuhaus and the Dutch homewares store Hema which has simply closed its UK-facing webshop. Some have said they hope the move will be temporary. The Finland-based outdoor clothing retailer Scandinavian Outdoor said it had halted UK sales but hoped to take orders again once “our UK VAT registration and the overall process of selling to the UK post-Brexit has been sorted out”. Before Brexit, companies could reconcile VAT payments and charges through an electronic system that worked out which country would benefit from what tax. As of 1 January, the EU no longer validates UK VAT numbers so British VAT must be collected at the point of sale rather than at the point of importation. It means EU companies abroad must register for UK VAT and account for it if the product is valued at less than £135. Which retailers are affected? The British Retail Consortium says that at least 50 of its members face potential tariffs for re-exporting goods to the EU. Marks & Spencer has said about one-third of its food lines are subject to complex rules of origin regulations including Percy Pigs sweets, which could attract tariffs if re-exported to places like Ireland and France. Debenhams has closed its online business in Ireland for similar reasons. North Face, the outdoor clothing company, has also put a notice on its website that “due to customs clearance issues caused by Brexit, the shipment of orders to Northern Ireland are suspended from December 28 until further notice”.
What is happening at ports? Dover and Folkestone, the gateway to Europe, are relatively quiet, partly because of pre-Christmas Brexit stockpiling by importers but also because large retailers have temporarily suspended exports. Holyhead, the UK’s second-largest ferry port, has also experienced a decline in trade as British businesses struggle to get to grips with Brexit rules. On Thursday night Ireland’s revenue commissioners announced they were easing the rules for traders to try and get traffic flowing again. There have also been complaints that trucks are being stuck in Dublin port while checks are being conducted. When will things improve? It will takes weeks and months for British businesses to assess the impact of the new rules. The government was so concerned about lack of Brexit readiness it decided to phase in the new controls on the British side over six months, an indication of how long it expects disruption to last."
2021-01-08T10:44:14Z,politics,Politics,Bookcase diplomacy: Grant Shapps' shelves flatter new US counterpart,"The UK transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has apparently used his bookshelves to flatter the incoming Biden administration in the US, while condemning Donald Trump for encouraging the storming of the Capitol building. During a round of broadcast interviews on Friday morning, Shapps was seen with a copy of a memoir by Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden’s nominee for transportation secretary, placed behind his head as he gave video interviews from home.
In an interview with Sky News, he condemned the violence in Washington as “despicable” and said it was “inescapable that people were encouraged to go a march on the Capitol building”. Shapps’s comments and his backdrop of the memoir, Shortest Way Home, come only months after he declined to condemn Trump for suggesting people should inject themselves with bleach to protect themselves from Covid. They also underline how quickly senior Conservatives have moved from praising Trump to condemning him. Shapps stopped short of calling for Trump to be impeached as Democratic leaders in the US have demanded. He said: “What happened completely dishonours democracy and was just despicable to see those people encouraged to go to the Capitol building and to ransack it like that. I think we can very fairly leave it to the Americans to work out what they should do next, that’s their call clearly.” He added: “It’s not for me interfere in American politics any more than I expect an American president or politician to do in the UK.” Shapps’ bookshelves have drawn attention before, having previously featured union flags, a ministerial red box and face-up covers of books with titles including Getting Inside People’s Heads and How to be Nice to People."
2021-01-07T18:40:28Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: hospital numbers in east and south-east England more than double first wave peak – as it happened,"A national booking service for vaccine appointments in England will be launched to help hit ambitious targets, Boris Johnson has said, as he pledged to immunise every elderly care home resident by the end of the month. As Jessica Elgot and Heather Stewart report, the prime minister said everyone would be able to get a vaccination within 10 miles of their home and that GP-led vaccine sites providing jabs would increase to more than 1,000 by the end of next week, and hospital sites to 223, delivering hundreds of thousands of vaccines a day by 15 January.
Sir Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, has said the health service is facing an â€œincredibly serious situationâ€�. Speaking at a No 10 press conference alongside the PM, Stevens said there were 50% more Covid patients in hospital now than at the peak of the first wave. And numbers were â€œaccelerating very, very rapidly,â€� he said. He went on: Weâ€™ve seen an increase of 10,000 hospitalised coronavirus patients, just since Christmas Day. Thatâ€™s the equivalent of filling 20 acute hospitals with extra coronavirus patients ... And that is, of course, all happening at what is traditionally the busiest time of year for hospitals and the wider NHS. The UK has recorded 1,162 further coronavirus deaths - the second highest daily total on this measure. (See 4.51pm.) Boris Johnson has said Donald Trump was â€œcompletely wrongâ€� to cast doubt on the result of the US presidential election and encourage his supporters to storm the Capitol. In his most critical comments as PM about Trump, a pro-Brexit ally who once boasted about Johnson being a British version of himself, Johnson said: Insofar as he encouraged people to storm the Capitol and insofar as the president consistently has cast doubt on the outcome of a free and fair election I believe that that was completely wrong. I think what President Trump has been saying about that has been completely wrong. I unreservedly condemn encouraging people to behave in the disgraceful way that they did in the Capitol. And all I can say is Iâ€™m very pleased that the president-elect has now been duly confirmed in office and that democracy has prevailed. A third Covid vaccine is likely to be approved for use in Britain next week but it will not be available until April because the UK is no longer part of the EU. Homelessness campaigners have demanded an urgent reboot of the governmentâ€™s â€œEverybody Inâ€� scheme to provide safe shelter for thousands of rough sleepers as the UK enters another lockdown, with winter temperatures expected to plummet. The founder of Clap For Our Carers and Clap For Heroes has distanced herself from tonightâ€™s event after getting abuse and threats from â€œa hateful few on social media channelsâ€�. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2021-01-07T17:12:21Z,politics,Politics,Leave. EU leaves Britain after Brexit,"Leave.EU has left the UK, as Brexit forced the Eurosceptic campaign group to choose between its name and its country. According to domain name registration records, the organisation, founded by businessman and activist Arron Banks, picked the former. The website is now registered in the name of Sean Power, the chief executive of the Ireland-based professional services company BSG. When asked, however, Power, who is based in Waterford, insisted that he had no involvement with the organisation. When informed that his name and contact details were present on the registration, he said he would be “looking into the matter”. Leave.EU has had some time to consider its move. The organisation is named after its web address, but .EU domain names can only be held by businesses or individuals based in the EU or wider European Economic Area. As the Brexit transition period drew to an end in 2019, the British owners of .EU domain names – of which there were estimated to be about 340,000 – started to express alarm that no deal had been made, meaning that they would have to give up their websites when Britain left the EU. Initially, Leave.EU suggested it was fine with that outcome. “If we leave with no deal our job is done,” Leave.EU’s communications chief, Andy Wigmore, told the Guardian in 2019. “No need for Leave.EU any more. Cheers all round, I’m sure!” But in July that year, the EU threw a lifeline to organisations, confirming that UK-based owners of .EU domains could continue to operate – provided the actual registration was transferred to an EU citizen.
For companies which did not take that step, it is not too late to follow Leave.EU’s lead. According to UK government advice: “On 1 January 2021, any UK registrant who cannot meet the eligibility criteria will have their .eu domain names withdrawn. A withdrawn domain name no longer functions … and can no longer support any active services (such as websites or email). “Withdrawn domain names will not be available to any other entity for a further 12 months. On 1 January 2022, all the withdrawn domain names will be revoked and made available for registration by other entities.” But a grace period, lasting until 31 March this year, allows registrants to transfer suspended domain names to an EU-based owner, or any person with EU citizenship."
2021-01-07T12:42:43Z,politics,Politics,Lawyer calling for Dominic Cummings investigation forced to move after attacks on home,"The former regional chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal has revealed he was forced to move house after his campaign for an investigation into alleged lockdown breaches by Dominic Cummings apparently prompted attacks on his property. In June, a week after Afzal became the figurehead in a legal campaign to prosecute the prime minister’s former chief aide, a brick was thrown through the window of his family home in Manchester, he told the Guardian. The following month his car was “slashed” outside the home after he announced he had urged the Metropolitan police and Crown Prosecution Service to investigate Cummings’ journeys to Durham and Barnard Castle. Afzal said: “My family felt scared. I don’t blame Dominic Cummings. All I know is that in 25 years prosecuting some of the most organised criminals in the country, nobody has attacked my home. Yet suddenly someone starting attacking me and my family and we’ve had to move house. “There’s always a personal cost to standing up [for] what’s right. In 2006 I was on an al-Qaida death list after I prosecuted Danish cartoon protesters, and in 2012 the far right demonstrated outside my house after the Rochdale grooming gang case. I accept that people will attack me personally, but I draw the line when my family is involved.” Afzal said he would not be intimidated. “It has made me more committed to delivering justice, not just in the Cummings case, but for anybody for feels they are not being listened to. More than 3,000 people have crowdfunded the campaign to get Cummings prosecuted, and thousands more have messaged me to say ‘you’re doing this for me’. This is about restoring trust.” Cummings, who resigned from the government in November after an internal power struggle, denies his movements during the first lockdown amounted to a breach of the Covid regulations. In December, Durham police revealed it was assessing a 225-page dossier submitted by Afzal and his lawyers, alleging Cummings breached the lockdown rules multiple times and perverted the course of justice in his account of his movements.
Afzal says the documents gave Durham police a “second bite of the cherry” after the force decided to take no further action against Cummings following a three-day investigation in May. “I suspect they are now carrying out a much more thorough investigation than the very cursory one back in May. Durham police now has the opportunity to restore public confidence in them,” he said. “I know for a fact that senior police officers feel it has set back public confidence in policing. And the evidence says that public compliance with the rules has diminished as a result of Cummings’ behaviour.” Afzal, a former senior prosecutor for London and the chief prosecutor for north-west England until 2015, said: “If this was the prosecution service I was part of, I have no doubt they would say there is a case to answer. My concern is that we may not have as robust and courageous a prosecution service as we had in the past.” If Durham police and the CPS decide not to prosecute, Afzal says he would have the financial backing to pursue the case himself. “I could prosecute the perverting the course of justice allegation as a private prosecution. I have been approached by philanthropists who like many are deeply concerned by what happened and are prepared to pay for any legal action that might follow, but it should be the state taking the responsibility.” Afzal said he feels “angry and emboldened” by the events of 2020. His older brother Umar died of coronavirus in April while isolating at home in Birmingham. Weeks later, his mother died of a “broken heart”, he said. He added: “My brother would not be dead if the government hadn’t stopped community testing on 12 March.” Afzal, who is currently suffering from Covid himself, also offered to meet Boris Johnson on behalf of the families bereaved by the virus. “I think he desperately needs to hear the voices of the bereaved. I would bring along others who have suffered similarly. The prime minister would benefit tremendously from hearing from us – he would be more decisive and listen to the scientists and medics more.”
If Johnson agreed to a meeting, Afzal says he would volunteer to act as a US-style special prosecutor to investigate the UK’s response to the Covid crisis. Such an investigation would help restore public confidence much quicker than a public inquiry, he said. “It could be 10 years before we get the results of any public inquiry, but we need answers now. I would say to the prime minister: ‘Give me the legal powers and I will be your special prosecutor on the response to Covid. It’s important you do this, prime minister, because public confidence and trust is at an all-time low.’” In April, a paperback version of Afzal’s book The Prosecutor will be published with a new chapter on the death of his brother and the Cummings affair."
2021-01-07T12:28:26Z,politics,Politics,"Williamson wrong to force universities to abide by antisemitism definition, say lawyers","A group of eminent lawyers, including two former appeal court judges, has accused Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, of “improper interference” with universities’ autonomy and right to free expression. They say that Williamson’s insistence that universities adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism or face sanctions is “legally and morally wrong”. Their statement comes amid some academic resistance to Williamson’s letter to university vice-chancellors in October, in which he warned: “If I haven’t seen the overwhelming majority of institutions adopting the [IHRA] definition by Christmas, then I will act.” Academics at University College London are due to vote this month on whether to call on the institution’s governing body to rescind its November 2019 adoption of the IHRA definition. Some are arguing it stifles free speech on Israel. Oxford and Cambridge are among universities that have adopted the IHRA definition in recent weeks. The Department for Education said at least 27 institutions have adopted the definition since Williamson’s letter.
According to a tally by the Union of Jewish Students (UJS), a total of 48 out of 133 have now adopted the definition, including the vast majority of universities in the elite Russell Group. The UJC said those institutions reluctant to follow suit were showing “contempt … for their Jewish students.” However, the lawyers’ letter, published by the Guardian, says: “The legally entrenched right to free expression is being undermined by the promotion of an internally incoherent ‘non-legally binding working definition’ of antisemitism. Its promotion by public bodies is leading to the curtailment of debate. Universities and others who reject the instruction … to adopt it should be supported in so doing.” It cites the Universal Declaration of Human Rights regarding freedom of expression, which is embodied in UK law by the 1998 Human Rights Act. Williamson was “legally and morally wrong in October to instruct English universities to adopt and implement” the IHRA definition of antisemitism. His threat of sanctions “would be an improper interference with their autonomy”. The letter adds: “The impact on public discourse both inside and outside universities has already been significant.” Among its eight signatories are Sir Anthony Hooper and Sir Stephen Sedley, both retired lord justices of appeal. Academic opposition to wholesale adoption of the IHRA definition centres on freedom of expression and in particular whether criticism of Israel’s treatment of the Palestinian people would be inhibited. The IHRA definition is only 40 words long. It says: “Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.” But it is accompanied by 11 illustrative examples, of which seven relate to Israel. According to the report of a working group set up by UCL’s academic board, the definition and examples “disproportionately draw debate over Israel and Palestine into conversations around antisemitism, potentially conflating anti-Zionism with antisemitism … thereby … risking the suppression of legitimate speech and academic research.” The report says the definition has no legal basis, and there is already a “large body of existing UK law and coherent UCL policies that instead should be used as the basis of any institutional mechanism to combat antisemitism”. Universities have “an express statutory obligation to protect freedom of speech within the law”, the report says. As an educative tool, the definition “may indeed have potential value, but that would have to be balanced against potentially deleterious effects on free speech, such as instigating a culture of fear or self-silencing on teaching or research or classroom discussion of contentious topics”. The report says: “The ability to have uncomfortable conversations or feel challenged by clashing ideas lies at the heart of the mission of higher education. There are times when we need to clarify and illuminate these tensions, rather than rush to meet the demands of vocal critics who may misrepresent these instances as acts of discrimination, if we are to uphold the values of university life.” While acknowledging “disturbing evidence that incidents of antisemitism have persisted in our university”, the report recommends UCL’s governing body retract its adoption of the IHRA definition and “consider more coherent alternatives”. Academics at UCL were due to vote on the report’s recommendations before Christmas, but decided to extend debate into the new year because of the level of interest. One critic of the report, Harry Goldstein, claimed its arguments give credence to “precisely the conspiracy theories that are central to classical antisemitism. It must all be a plot to silence criticism of Israel.” In a blogpost, Goldstein – who describes himself as a liberal centre-left supporter of Israel – said the report blurred the distinction between criticism of Israel and anti-Zionism, used tendentious language, and failed to “understand the distinctive nature of antisemitism compared to other racisms”. Dave Rich, the head of policy at the Community Security Trust (CST), which advises the UK Jewish community on security issues, said the academic argument over definitions of antisemitism “loses sight of what really matters: the welfare and safety of Jewish students at British universities”. A CST report, Campus Antisemitism in Britain 2018-20, recorded a total of 123 antisemitic incidents involving students in 34 towns and cities over the two-year period. “Far too many Jewish students do experience prejudice or bigotry, whether on campus, off campus and online. This included antisemitism from the far left, merging their hatred of Israel with suspicion of any Jews who disagree with them,” Rich wrote last month. James Harris, the president of the UJS, said the continuing battle over the IHRA definition was “unacceptable”. He added: “We have seen multiple examples of anti-Jewish racism being dismissed by universities who consistently refuse to adopt this definition. When the definition is not used, it gives the power to those investigating to arbitrarily determine what they believe constitutes antisemitism. “The IHRA definition is a cornerstone in ensuring that antisemitism, when reported, is dealt with in a way which Jewish students can be confident in.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “The government expects institutions to take a zero-tolerance approach to antisemitism, with robust measures in place to address issues when they arise.”"
2021-01-07T12:28:24Z,politics,Politics,Tories urged to suspend politicians who likened US violence to anti-Brexit protests,"The Conservatives are to investigate two senior Tory figures who equated the storming of the US Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump with people opposing Brexit, after complaints from Labour. The party is to look into tweets sent by Susan Hall, the Tory group leader on the London assembly, and Andrew RT Davies, formerly leader of the Welsh Conservatives. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader and party chair, wrote to Amanda Milling, who chairs the Conservative party, to say she was “deeply concerned” at the comments. Davies, who is a member of the Senedd Cymru and shadow minister for health, responded to a tweet by Keir Starmer condemning the scenes in Washington by noting the Labour leader’s former support for a second Brexit referendum. Davies wrote: “To be honest I’m not sure you’re in the strongest position right now given you campaigned to overturn democracy and the will of the British people.” In her tweet, Hall said she was “flabbergasted at the amount of remainers screaming on Twitter that Trump voters should respect democracy – err, hellooo – pot – kettle spring to mind!” Hall later apparently deleted the tweet, but sent another tweet calling the Green MP Caroline Lucas, another supporter of a second Brexit vote, a “hypocrite” for condemning the violent Trump supporters. Milling is to write to Hall and Davies to warn them about the consequences of such language. A Conservative party spokesperson said: “The scenes in Washington last night were disgraceful and unacceptable. We totally condemn them. We are investigating these comments.” In her letter to Milling, Rayner wrote: “I am deeply concerned that two Conservative elected representatives have equated democratic debate in the UK with an armed, violent and fundamentally anti-democratic assault on the US legislature, during which people lost their lives. “These statements are absolutely unacceptable, extremely dangerous and must not be allowed to stand. “To equate peaceful democratic debate in the UK with deadly violence in the USA validates the violence that we have seen in Washington DC, serves to legitimise and incite violence in our own country and undermines our democracy and democratic processes.” Rayner said she hoped Milling would condemn the comments, begin an inquiry, suspend Hall and Davies from the party, and “ensure that they are not able to stand as Conservative candidates in the May elections”. Boris Johnson and senior Conservative ministers have vigorously condemned the violence in Washington, but have largely steered clear of condemning Trump for fomenting it. As well as making repeated, baseless claims that the November presidential election was “stolen” from him due to fraud, Trump addressed the protest crowd in Washington shortly before it stormed the Capitol. In a tweet on Wednesday night, Johnson said: “Disgraceful scenes in US Congress. The United States stands for democracy around the world and it is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power.” In a tweet earlier on Thursday, Rayner called Johnson “spineless”, and the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, “toadying”, saying both “have to also take their fair share of shame for not calling out his lies after the election”."
2021-01-07T10:15:43Z,politics,Politics,Customers in Europe hit by post-Brexit charges when buying from UK,"Customers in Europe buying products ranging from furniture to pet food from UK companies are receiving unexpected bills for VAT and customs declarations or finding household names have stopped shipping to the continent, as post-Brexit trading rules bite. “We bought a €47 [£42] shelf from Next for our bathroom,” said Thom Basely, who lives in Marseille. “On the morning it was supposed to be delivered we received an ‘import duty/tax’ demand for over €30, like a ransom note. It came as a complete surprise.” A Frankfurt resident who ordered cycle clothing from a UK company was sent a tax and customs demand for €102, while a woman in the Netherlands who bought trousers in December “with no issues” faced a €40 bill for two more pairs ordered in January. Chris Hickson, a retired logistics and freight forwarding expert living in France, said many people may have been surprised because “they believed the tariff-free trade deal negotiated between the UK and EU meant there would be no extra charges”. Since the end of the Brexit transition period, however, continental customers must both complete a customs declaration for goods imported from the UK – a procedure generally performed by transporters, for which consumers will be charged, frequently up to €20 per declaration – and pay national VAT. Other European customers have been informed that such iconic British retailers as the luxury food store Fortnum & Mason were unfortunately “unable to send any products to European countries at this current time, due to Brexit restrictions”.
Customers of the department store chain John Lewis, also popular with British citizens living in the EU, who value its “never knowingly undersold” price match guarantee and reliable customer service, have also been disappointed. Until December, the retailer offered EU delivery for many items on sale through its website, including clothes. But anyone requesting shipping to Europe is now greeted by a page stating: “We are no longer taking orders for international delivery.” Some retailers, such as George at Asda, have promised no additional charges, but several international platforms including Asos have halted deliveries to Europe from their UK sites, instead directing buyers to national versions in, for example, France. David Martin, who lives in the Creuse region in central France, said he switched his regular order for dog food from the pet supplies company Zooplus to its Irish site after being told the UK platform was no longer accepting orders from the continent.
An “import fees deposit”, meanwhile, is now automatically added to orders from continental Europe placed via Amazon’s UK website, nearly doubling the cost of some items and making it significantly cheaper to find an EU alternative. Hickson said fees for customs declarations were usually collected by the international shipping companies, such as DHL or UPS, responsible for transporting the goods, with customers notified of the charge – and obliged to pay – before delivery. “Many vendors are not yet aware that this is the case, or if they are may not be able to say in advance what the bill will be,” he said. “VAT will depend on the category of goods and their value.” Despite the tariff-free deal, customs duties will apply to goods ordered from the UK that do not originate from Britain. Goods ordered from and manufactured in the UK should not attract customs duty, but products ordered from the UK worth more than that €150 and shipped from outside Britain will. A leading French consumer website cited the example of a pair of trainers ordered from a UK website for £270 but manufactured in and shipped from China, saying customs duty of 16.9% and 20% French VAT would bring their cost to about £378. And while continental buyers are no longer charged British VAT on UK purchases, they must now pay local VAT in their country of residence - although this is waived for orders under €22 until 31 July. Platforms such as Amazon are entitled to collect continental VAT on orders worth less than €150. “It’s a hugely complex situation,” Hickson said. “My recommendation to anyone in the EU looking to buy goods in the UK is: don’t order anything until you know what the charges and VAT will be. And be patient. This should all sort itself out eventually, but it’s going to take some time.”"
2021-01-07T09:30:54Z,politics,Politics,Labour MP Jo Stevens thanks 'exceptional' NHS staff for Covid care,"The Labour MP Jo Stevens has expressed her gratitude to the NHS staff who cared for her after she returned home following treatment in hospital for coronavirus. Stevens said she “cannot begin to describe my gratitude to the wonderful people who have cared for me in hospital” and described healthcare workers as “truly exceptional”, in a tweet sent late on Wednesday night. She described how lucky she felt to have been discharged from hospital, saying she knew that for many families it was a “very different situation”. Her discharge comes in a critical week for hospitals, as figures show more than 1,000 deaths were recorded in the previous 24 hours from the virus.
The MP for Cardiff Central was said on New Year’s Eve to have been “laid low with Covid for a while”. Three days later, her team announced she had been admitted to hospital, triggering an outpouring of support. Her team tweeted on Tuesday that her condition was improving, writing: “She has asked us to thank you all for your kind concern and good wishes which have been overwhelming.” The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, expressed pleasure that his shadow culture secretary had returned home in a tweet on Wednesday evening. He also thanked the NHS.
Stevens, 54, is the fourth MP known to have been treated in hospital with Covid. Along with the prime minister, Boris Johnson, who was admitted to intensive care in April, the Labour MPs Yasmin Qureshi and Tony Lloyd were also admitted to hospital. Lloyd spent 10 days on a ventilator in an induced coma."

2021-01-06T18:56:52Z,politics,Politics,Safe but unsafe: Boris introduces MPs to Schrödinger’s schools | John Crace,"It’s getting to be a habit. Last week parliament was recalled to pass the EU trade agreement. This week it was recalled to allow the government’s third national lockdown to be retrospectively rubber-stamped. From this, you might imagine that the government either leaves important legislation until the last possible minute or doesn’t really have much of a clue what it will be doing from one day to the next. And you wouldn’t be wrong on either account. A recall suggests high drama. The reality was the precise opposite. A general sense of existential ennui until the proceedings reached the conclusion that everyone knew was inevitable. But parliamentary formalities must be observed, so the day kicked off with Boris Johnson giving a statement in which he basically cut and pasted paragraphs of Monday night’s TV address along with a few from Tuesday’s Downing Street press conference. The new coronavirus variant had forced his hand, he began. If rather later than many scientists had wanted, given he had known about the variant for weeks. So he was planning on locking down the country until at least 22 February, even though the regulations gave him the leeway to keep the UK shut down until the end of March. No one wanted to close schools, he continued, before insisting schools were still safe, even though he was closing them. This caused some puzzlement on both sets of benches. We were now in the realm of Schrödinger’s schools. Both safe and unsafe. Unless what he was trying to say was that the schools themselves were safe: it was just the pupils and the teachers in them who weren’t. But not to worry, because this time round we had a way out of the pandemic, with 14m doses of the vaccine being administered to the most vulnerable individuals by the middle of February. He was rather short on detail on the logistics of this. But then, Johnson has often relied on a wing and a prayer. In reply, Keir Starmer’s only regret was that the government hadn’t acted earlier, as he himself had suggested. The Captain Hindsight, as the prime minister used to call the Labour leader, has morphed into Captain Foresight. But to be fair, most of the country has been consistently ahead of the government on when further restrictions are needed. Keir breezed through a shortlist of the government’s failures over that past 10 months but even he sounded as if he was on autopilot, with the expression of someone who knew he was basically talking to himself. MPs had been advised to stay away from parliament – for their own sanity as much as their health – and to contribute remotely, but only Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems appeared to have taken the guidance seriously. While the opposition benches were near enough empty, the Tory benches were almost full with MPs who had made a special effort to travel into Westminster to say just how dangerous such travel had become and, though they regretted the measures and would like regular votes between now and March on keeping the restrictions in place, they accepted the need for them at present. The lone dissenter was Desmond Swayne, who described the loss of liberty as “pettifogging malice” – someone needs to let him know the daily Covid death total had just passed 1,000 for the first time since April – but Boris dealt with him easily enough. In fact, by the end Johnson was looking quite chipper. So much so, that he began to overpromise yet again, virtually assuring the house that schools would reopen and life would be more normal next month. After a few days under the cosh, Boris the crowdpleaser was back. Even if it was in reduced circumstances. Still, that statement proved to be the day’s highpoint compared with what followed – a statement from the hapless education secretary, Gavin Williamson, on why there was no inconsistency between him saying last week that exams were still on and schools would remain open and this week announcing the opposite.
It was all a far cry from those heady days of 2006 when he won fireplace salesman of the year at the St Albans Travelodge. Back then he had been a somebody. A man going places. Now he’s just a third-rate politician, in a job from which he can’t be sacked because he’s fucked it up so badly that his successor would inevitably also have to resign from the fallout of Gav’s incompetence. So he can do nothing but muddle on, each day making a bad situation worse. His tragedy is that, deep down, he knows he’s useless. His confidence is shot, his self-worth at rock bottom. Only the last vestiges of ego remain. He’s condemned to being the worst education secretary of all time but is powerless to do anything about it. Even the most loyal and unctuous Tory MPs have had it with Williamson. One by one they pointedly failed to congratulate him on a job well done and pointed out his failings, over exams, laptops, everything really. He used to be the cabinet’s Private Pike but that has long since become a gross insult to the Dad’s Army character. “I never wanted to be in this position,” he sobbed. And for the first time, he had most of the country on his side. Because there is no one who values education who wishes he was in his current position either. His only value – apart from satisfying Johnson’s bullying tendencies – is to make the other cabinet deadbeats look not quite so bad. It’s life, Gav, but not as we know it."
2021-01-06T18:54:44Z,politics,Politics,"'Inept, careless, tribal': Calls grow for Gavin Williamson to go","“The most incompetent, ineffectual and inept education secretary in living memory.” Such was the Yorkshire Post’s verdict this week on one of the county’s own sons, Scarborough-born Gavin Williamson, in a blunt editorial calling for him to resign or be sacked. A Times leader was similarly damning. “Mr Williamson, by far the worst performer in an underpowered cabinet, already looks to have sacrificed his own future in government. Britain cannot afford for him to be so careless with the future of its children.” Early on Wednesday morning, the education secretary cut a forlorn figure as he made his way into the Department for Education (DfE), to shouts from a Sky TV crew asking if he was going to resign. His appearance before MPs in the Commons later the same day to explain the latest of a catalogue of delayed decisions, disastrous climbdowns and humiliating U-turns, will have done little to bolster his shattered reputation.
And it could all have been so different. When Williamson took up the post in 2019, his arrival at the DfE coincided with a much-needed boost to schools spending, a new levelling-up agenda and a fresh commitment to further education and vocational and technical qualifications. Then the Covid pandemic hit, and though there was initially some sympathy for a secretary of state who found himself facing unprecedented challenges, that swiftly dissipated. The U-turns have come thick and fast, from exams and exam results, to free school meals, BTecs and failed school openings, to the point where the education secretary is routinely likened to the pathetic TV comic character Frank Spencer, of the 70s sitcom Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em. Even the most moderate of headteachers and sector leaders have become increasingly exasperated with his leadership, among them Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. “We would all acknowledge he has been dealt a difficult hand,” he said, “but equally so have the people I’ve been representing.” He awarded him a C+ for effort and a U for achievement. “The most important ingredient in leadership is to be able to take people with you.” Too often, said Barton, the unions have been seen as part of the problem, rather than part of the solution.
“The frustrating thing with Gavin Williamson is too often there’s a tribal political outlook and this is probably not the best time to be tribal.” Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, and an outspoken critic of Williamson, said: “He has never got on top of the brief. I always have a lot of sympathy for a secretary of state for education because it’s a huge area. It’s highly complex with a lot of technical issues. “I’ve spent 40 years in education so I should know about it. But what you can expect a secretary of state to do is to do the homework, to do a lot of learning, to master the brief. He just never has. “In a crisis like the pandemic, you are not going to get everything right. But it’s really important to get the key decisions as right as possible.” She also complained that Williamson had been too concerned with ideology, rather than the impact on the ground in schools, among teachers and parents. The decision to take legal action to force schools in Covid hotspots to remain open, and to insist that 3 million children should return to primary school this week, literally hours before the prime minister announced a national lockdown including schools, were among his worst errors, Bousted said. Williamson’s cast-iron guarantee just last month that exams would take place this summer has resulted in yet more egg on his face. The only possible explanation for his continuing leadership at the DfE, according to one critic, is that he is a useful “fall guy” to take the flak for the prime minister.
“Williamson’s skill, if it is a skill, is making people lose the will to live,” said one former colleague who asked to remain anonymous. “He drains energy from everyone and everything around him. He’s a vacuum, a black hole, a void.” Former Labour education secretary Estelle Morris knows a thing or two about the challenges of the job, and when to resign. Almost two decades ago, after just a year in the post, she handed in her resignation saying she didn’t feel she had done a good enough job, a rare instance of political mea culpa. Gavin Williamson may have lost the trust of heads, teachers and parents, but she says resignation is not always the answer, despite a minister’s shortcomings. Instead, she suggested others with expertise should be drafted in to support and help rebuild trust and confidence in the department. “To be a really successful secretary of state for education you’ve got to be both political and educational. But Gavin Williamson is almost all about politics. I’m not saying he doesn’t care what happens to kids. “But the thread running through is that every time he has been asked to make a decision, he has had his eye on the political, rather than the educational impact. “I never call for resignations. We are in such a dire position that we need a better debate. Something needs to change, but I know what it takes for a department to adjust to new leadership and resignation is not always the right answer.”"
2021-01-06T17:15:12Z,politics,Politics,Johnson: no Covid vaccine in Scotland if it were up to SNP,"Boris Johnson has taken a swipe at the Scottish National party by claiming that there would not have been a single Covid-19 vaccine in Scotland if it were up to Nicola Sturgeon’s party, the Guardian understands. Addressing a virtual meeting of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs on Tuesday evening before Wednesday’s Commons vote on the third national lockdown in England, the prime minister highlighted the threat of the new Covid variant, but is also said to have criticised Scotland’s ruling party. Johnson tackled a series of questions from backbenchers on the Zoom call, including one from a Scottish Tory MP about the SNP, the answer to which took aim at the pro-independence party. The prime minister is understood to have said that the strength of the union lay in what could be done for people across the UK, claiming that if it were up to the SNP, no coronavirus vaccines would have been delivered in Scotland. One MP who attended the virtual meeting said: “Essentially, the point the prime minister was making is that the UK is a major country, we’ve got sufficient clout to get the vaccines rolled out. He did actually mention that we were ahead of the rest of Europe. “He said if it were up to the SNP, then there wouldn’t have been a single vaccine delivered in Scotland. It was a UK effort, in other words, and needed the clout of a big government.”
Asked about Johnson’s comments on Wednesday, the prime minister’s press secretary, Allegra Stratton, said she had not been present at the 1922 meeting. But she said: “In terms of the broader point about the vaccine, there’s no doubt that the union’s been critical in the development, production and administration of the vaccine, and indeed across a range of measures. The UK governments during this pandemic have all worked together to provide for the British people. “I think on Monday Nicola Sturgeon said they have 100,000 vaccines in Scotland. It’s great news for the Scottish people, but it’s been a collective effort.” Responding to Johnson’s remarks, an SNP spokesperson said on Wednesday: “These comments are as crass as they are inaccurate and show once again how desperate the Tories are to politicise the pandemic. The development of vaccines has been a global effort and our focus is on ensuring we vaccinate people in Scotland as quickly and as safely as it is possible to do so.” The first doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid vaccine began to be administered in the UK on Monday, after the jab received approval from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) last month. It is the second vaccine to be approved by the regulator in the UK, following the Pfizer/BioNTech jab. According to the government, through the vaccines taskforce the UK “secured early access” to 357m doses of the seven “most promising” vaccine candidates. That includes the Oxford/AstraZeneca and BioNTech/Pfizer jabs.
Vaccination is being managed separately by health services in each UK nation, including NHS Scotland. Johnson’s comments follow Sturgeon saying that Scotland had acted “much earlier” to get the latest Covid wave under control compared with Johnson’s government in London. Speaking during a coronavirus press briefing earlier on Tuesday, Scotland’s first minister made the claim as she sought to defend her decision to close places of worship, which remain open in England. “It is one of the points of difference between Scotland and the UK, but so is the fact we decided to act much earlier in the curve of this wave of the pandemic to get it under control,” Sturgeon said. “We are trying to act as cautiously as we can at the moment to stop this situation deteriorating any further.” On Sunday, Johnson reiterated his position that a Scottish independence referendum should be a “once-in-a-generation” vote. The prime minister told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “Referendums in my experience, direct experience, in this country are not particularly jolly events. They don’t have a notably unifying force in the national mood. They should be only once in a generation.” In November, Johnson triggered an angry reaction from politicians across the spectrum after he dismissed devolution as “a disaster north of the border”. During a Zoom call with about 60 northern Conservative MPs, the prime minister described devolution as “Tony Blair’s biggest mistake”.
Responding to questions from the SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, on Wednesday after his Commons statement on the lockdown, Johnson said “every part of the United Kingdom” had received the vaccine “thanks to our national NHS”. He added: “It is thanks to our United Kingdom NHS, thanks to the strength of UK companies, that we are able to distribute a life-saving vaccine across the whole of our country, and I think that is a point that he might bear in mind.”"
2021-01-06T16:02:59Z,politics,Politics,Councillors vote to review plans for £100k unveiling of Thatcher statue in Grantham,"Councillors in Margaret Thatcher’s home town have voted for plans to underwrite a £100,000 unveiling ceremony for a statue of the former prime minister to be reviewed. South Kesteven district council’s cabinet had previously agreed to allocate funding for the event, due to be held in Grantham, Lincolnshire, this year, in the anticipation that they would be able to recoup the money in donations. But the council’s culture and visitor economy overview and scrutiny committee has voted in favour of asking the cabinet to review the decision and provide additional information on the event’s costs. Paul Fellows, an independent councillor and member of the committee, put forward the motion for the cabinet’s decision to be further scrutinised. He said: “As a scrutiny committee our decision was to look at the procedure process. It was not about whether or not we should have the statue. That decision had already been made and agreed through the planning committee.” Fellows had raised doubts about whether the cabinet had followed the correct procedures, and put forward a successful motion for the cabinet to “come up with some justification for why they think that that is a reasonable decision to make”. Grantham Community Heritage Association (GCHA), which runs the Grantham Museum, and South Kesteven district council worked with the Public Memorials Appeal to draft a planning application for the statue, which was approved in 2019. The bronze statue, at 10.5ft (3.2 metres), was offered to the district council after proposals to erect it in Parliament Square, in central London, were rejected by Westminster council in 2018 as councillors feared it would be attract protests.
The statue has been paid for by the Public Memorials Trust, a charity that aims to commission and erect memorials of historically important figures. Money raised by the GCHA Margaret Thatcher Appeal will help deliver the statue. No public funds have been used. The council’s decision to underwrite a £100,000 unveiling ceremony had reignited the debate on whether the statue should be erected at all. The Liberal Democrat councillor Amanda Wheeler said: “I think it’s embarrassing that the district council even contemplate spending £100,000. It’s so out of touch with where we are right now as a country.” Wheeler said a recent housing report for Grantham had placed the council into special measures yet it wanted “to blow £100,000 on salmon, caviar, and champagne”. She added: “I can understand the statue being in Grantham, not that I approve of it, nor am I going to challenge that, but under no circumstances should we be having this big celebration party.” At a public meeting to discuss the ceremony – which took place over Skype on Tuesday – members of the public logged in using the names Arthur Scargill and John Major. The Labour councillor Charmaine Morgan, who stepped down as a member of the planning committee in 2019 to speak in opposition to the planned statue, said: “It feels like the council is fiddling while we are burning. They want this big ‘feel good’ event, when thousands of people in our district are struggling to put food on the table. I think they’ve gotten their priorities completely wrong.” Amanda Schonhut, the director of fundraising for Grantham Museum, which is run by Grantham Community Heritage Association (GCHA), previously said the issue continued to divide the town. “It’s been a bit like a mini-Brexit,” she said. According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, the council leader, Kelham Cooke, called it “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to boost tourism and to raise the profile of Grantham”. “Already I have had several expressions of interest to donate towards the cost of the event which is a huge vote of confidence for us,” he said."

2021-01-05T19:22:20Z,politics,Politics,Mother fears son could die as Brexit stops medical cannabis supply,"The mother of a nine-year-old boy with a rare and severe form of epilepsy has told how she fears her son could die after the government announced his supply of a life-changing cannabis medicine from the Netherlands would stop because of Brexit. Hannah Deacon was given just two weeks notice by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) that due to the end of the transition period “prescriptions issued in the UK can no longer be lawfully dispensed in an EU member state”. Her campaign to save her son Alfie Dingley’s life in 2017 led to a change in the law enabling the medicine which has seen him seizure free after years of 150 seizures a week, to be prescribed in the UK. Deacon told the Guardian she is in despair about her child’s future if he cannot get the Bedrolite oil he now takes three times a day. “They [the DHSC] said they understand our concern but they can’t do anything. Well let me tell them, it is not concerning, it is terrifying.” She says she wasn’t even told directly by the DHSC that she would no longer get the drug, something she describes as “galling”. Instead the letter went to pharmacy suppliers around the country who were told to advise on “alternative” prescriptions which would be “clinically appropriate to switch patients on to”.
“I am facing the fact that my son might go into refractory epileptic seizures again which can kill people. That’s how dangerous this is. So to say ‘oh you can swap it for another product, sorry we can’t help’ it is grossly unacceptable. It’s very very dangerous and I’m really frightened about what is going to happen,” she said. “The letter was sent on the 17 December, so we had no time. We’re very lucky that we were able to secure a couple of months worth of medicine. But that is not long. What makes me really angry is the lack of time we have, the lack of empathy, of care. My son is on a medicine that works for him, why would they take that away?,” she said. Neurologist Mike Barnes who led the fight with the Home Office to get Bedrolite prescribed for Alfie accused the DHSC of “an astonishing level of ignorance” to think every cannabis product is the same when there are “147 different cannabinoids” in each plant in addition to terpenes which create very specific medical properties. “Each variety of cannabis is subtly different and you can’t just swap a child from one product to another,” he said. In desperation Deacon wrote to Boris Johnson begging him to intervene on 29 December. “I just got an automatic response to say that he doesn’t reply to people that aren’t his constituents, which I find shocking because he is the prime minister,” said Deacon. Alfie was born in 2011 and was “perfect” she says but when reached four months he was constantly sick. At eight months he had his first “tonic-clonic seizure” and deteriorated from then losing every skill he had developed. By the time he was five years old he was having up to 150 cluster seizures every week, leaving him in intensive care once a week. “He would sometimes have these seizures for three or four days and then have a massive inflammatory response with back to back seizures that would mean he was pretty much flying off the bed they were so bad,” his mother said. He was diagnosed with a rare epilepsy syndrome caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for the protein protocadherin 19, something only nine known boys worldwide have so prognosis and clinical trials of potential drugs was not possible. She went on to research treatments for epilepsy and found evidence of cannabis being used in 1841 leading her to developments in the Netherlands by a specialist pharmacist Arwin Ramcharan at Transvaal Apotheek. She moved to the Netherlands in September 2017 and Alfie began the treatment which saw his seizures stop but had to return five months later after money ran out, prompting her battle to get it legalised. “He has been seizure free for eight months,” she said on Tuesday. And before a tweak in the combination of drugs had an 11-month seizure free stretch before that. “We don’t have a perfect life and then he has a very difficult genetic epilepsy which causes behaviour problems; he has autism. Life is definitely not rosy but his quality of life is amazing he hasn’t been near a hospital for two years,” she said. Barnes said the situation was “appalling”. It is “not an exaggeration”, he says, to say that “one or two” of the 42 children on the drug “will die” if they can no longer receive this medicine. He said the way the DHSC has dealt with the situation was “lazy and flippant” and these families are now in crisis. Deacon says she would like to speak to Johnson and health secretary Matt Hancock to ask them what are they doing to protect her child.
Ramcharan said: “For me, it is really sad. We are not allowed to send this medicines whatsoever to the UK after Brexit. It is now a battle between the UK government and the Dutch government.” Deacon said her boy had “a horrendous quality of life, no quality of life” when he was ill, he is now able to attend to school. “I fought for two and a half years to keep my son well and to get him help on the NHS and it’s a real kick in the teeth, to be honest, for them to just, you know, not do anything to help us,” she said. “For the prime minister to ignore me, and all the other families, is an utter disgrace,” she said. The DHSC said: “We sympathise with patients dealing with challenging conditions. There is a range of alternative cannabis-based medicines available to UK patients. “The decision on what treatments to prescribe for patients is rightly one for clinicians to make, on a case-by-case basis and dependent on the specific needs of the individual. If patients have any concerns, they should discuss them with their doctor.”"
2021-01-05T19:01:56Z,politics,Politics,Former Labour chair criticised for raising doubts over Covid vaccine,"The former Labour party chair, Ian Lavery, has come under fire after questioning why anyone would have confidence in the Covid vaccine and expressing concern at the pace at which the two newly introduced jabs were approved. Footage of the MP emerged hours after the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, spoke out about anti-vax campaigns and said he would support emergency legislation to tackle them. It shows Lavery apparently casting doubt over the speed at which the regulatory process was carried out for the vaccines. However, Lavery – who is understood to have been spoken to by Starmer’s office – later tweeted that “my words have been taken out of context”, adding that he rejected “any claims that I am in any way opposed to the rollout”. He also praised the scientific community’s achievements on the vaccine. The comments were made in a video broadcast by Socialist Telly – which describes itself as “Grassroots Socialist Television, for the many” – on 3 January. Noting the government’s handling of test and trace, PPE provision and the awarding of public contracts, Lavery said: “Why would anybody have any confidence in the vaccine?”
Lavery, who also made reference to the UK’s decision to delay administering the second vaccine dose so more people could get their first jab sooner, made clear he wanted people to get the vaccine. “I want everybody, let me be honest, I want people to take the vaccines, I really, really do and it’s important,” he said. However, in the footage – first reported by the Guido Fawkes website on Tuesday – he added: “I have got concerns about how these vaccines have … come on to the market when it would normally take 10 years and it’s … [taken] four month[s]. It normally takes three or four years to pass through the regulatory procedures … it hasn’t taken three or four weeks. And of course I’ve got concerns, massive concerns, about this government and the lack of trust.” Responding to a clip of the footage, the former Labour MP Mike Gapes – who defected to Change UK in 2019 before losing his seat at the general election – tweeted: “What a disgrace.” Lavery, an ally of the former leader Jeremy Corbyn, served as the party chair for nearly three years until April 2020. On Tuesday, Starmer told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that “we have to deal with the anti-vax campaigns because they will cost lives”, as he explained that he would be prepared to work with the government to pass emergency legislation to deal with them. Lavery tweeted on Tuesday afternoon: “Like everyone else, I am blown away by the achievements of our scientific community in bringing a vaccine forward for a disease we have only known about for a year. My words have been taken out of context and I reject any claims that I am in any way opposed to the rollout. “We now need a national effort to ensure the vaccine is rolled out. I urge everyone to make sure they get the vaccine as soon as possible so we can once again see family and friends and get back to fighting for a better Britain.” Rollout began on Monday for the recently-approved Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, the second to be given the green light in the UK. It follows the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) also authorising the Pfizer/BioNTech jab last month, which made the UK the first western country to license a vaccine against Covid. Speaking as the Oxford vaccine was approved at the end of last month, the MHRA chief executive, Dr June Raine, stressed “no corners, whatsoever, have been cut”. As England begins a third national lockdown that will last for at least seven weeks to stem the spread of the virus, the government is hoping to deliver a first vaccine dose to those in the four highest-priority groups – 13.9 million people – by mid-February."
2021-01-05T18:57:36Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus: more than 1m in England infected as UK daily positive tests hit record 60,916 - as it happened","Boris Johnson has revealed that more than 2% of the population of England - or more than one million people in total - is now infected with coronavirus. Thatâ€™s equivalent to one person in 50. The figure comes from the Office for National Statisticâ€™s infection survey, which is viewed as one of the most reliable guides to the prevalence of coronavirus in the community because its figures are based on the results of a large-scale, weighted survey, and donâ€™t just track the results from people who have actively decided to get a test. The last published ONS survey, released on Christmas Eve, put the coronavirus rate in England at one person in 85. Commenting on the new figures Johnson told a press conference at No 10: When the Office of National Statistics (ONS) is telling us that more than 2% of the population is now infected - thatâ€™s over one million people in England, and when today we have reported another 60,000 new cases, and when the number of patients in hospitals in England is now 40% higher than at the first peak in April, I think obviously everybody - you all - want to be sure that we in Government are now using every second of this lockdown to put that invisible shield around the elderly and the vulnerable in the form of vaccination and so to begin to bring this crisis to an end. Prof Chris Whitty, the governmentâ€™s chief medical adviser, said an infection rate of one in 50 was â€œreally quite a large number indeedâ€�. See 5.08pm. Johnson claimed that it might be possible to start relaxing the lockdown measures from February - provided certain conditions were met. Asked if the country could be out of lockdown by March, he gave a highly qualified answer. He said: Our ability to get through this fast depends on a number of things. Provided we donâ€™t learn anything new about the virus we donâ€™t yet to understand, some new mutation we havenâ€™t currently bargained for; provided the vaccine rollout goes according to plan; provided the vaccine rule is as efficacious as we think it is; above all, provided that everybody follows the guidance now, then we think that by the middle of February, when a very considerable portion of the most vulnerable groups will have be vaccinated, then there really is a prospect of beginning the relaxation of some of these measures. I would not put it any stronger than that. But Whitty said some restrictions might still be needed next winter. He said said the risk level would gradually decrease over time with measures being â€œlifted by degrees possibly at different rates in different parts of the country, weâ€™ll have to seeâ€�. He went on: Weâ€™ll then get over time to a point where people say this level of risk is something society is prepared to tolerate and lift right down to almost no restrictions at all. We might have to bring in a few in next winter for example, thatâ€™s possible, because winter will benefit the virus. Johnson said that almost a quarter of the over-80s in England have now had one dose of vaccine. Announcing the latest figures he said: We have now vaccinated over 1.1m people in England and over 1.3m across the UK. And that includes more than 650,000 people over 80, which is 23 per cent of all the over 80s in England. And that means that nearly one in four of one of the most vulnerable groups will have in two to three weeks â€“ all of them - a significant degree of immunity. But Johnson could not guarantee that all children would be back in school before the summer holidays. Whitty said there was a risk that delaying the period between giving the first dose of vaccine and the second could help the virus to mutate, but he said the danger was small. He said the advantages of giving more people a first dose quickly justified this. Sir Patrick Vallance, the governmentâ€™s chief scientific adviser, played down the risks posed by the South African variant of the virus. He said a possible change in the virus shape in the variant â€œtheoretically gives it a bit more risk of not being recognisedâ€� by the immune system. But he went on: There is nothing yet to suggest thatâ€™s the case. This is being looked at very actively. Itâ€™s worth remembering that when a vaccine is given you donâ€™t just make one antibody against one bit, you make lots of antibodies against lots of different bits, and so itâ€™s unlikely that all of that will be escaped by any mutations. But we donâ€™t know yet. At the moment, youâ€™d say the most likely thing is that this wouldnâ€™t abolish vaccine effect. It may have some overall effect on efficacy but we donâ€™t know. Whitty said the governmentâ€™s timetable for administering the vaccine was â€œrealistic but not easyâ€�. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2021-01-05T13:28:14Z,politics,Politics,Exams in core subjects may still go ahead in England this summer,"Exams in core subjects may still go ahead in England this summer despite the extended lockdown, according to plans being considered by Gavin Williamson. The education secretary is due to make a statement in the Commons on Wednesday after the prime minister called for schools to close and said summer exams were likely to be cancelled as part of a third national lockdown. Williamson will tell MPs he has directed the English exams regulator Ofqual to come up with a contingency plan to replace this year’s GCSEs and A-levels, which the government had hoped to retain despite concerns about pupils’ lost learning during the pandemic. One of the options under consideration is holding exams in core subjects such as English, maths and possibly science at GCSE, with school-assessed grades for other subjects, though there are concerns this could lead to pupils neglecting non-examined courses. Ministers are also worried pupils might stop engaging with their studies without the goal of exams. It is understood Ofqual may also look at online assessments as one possible option, though access to laptops remains a problem in schools. Teachers could also be asked to prepare and assess portfolios of students’ work, a sample of which could be moderated externally to try to ensure fair grades.
The government will be desperate to avoid a repeat of last year’s exams fiasco, when ministers cancelled exams and were then forced to scrap GCSE and A-level grades generated by an Ofqual algorithm. They finally resorted to school-assessed grades, causing chaos for university admissions. The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, told Sky News on Tuesday: “Obviously we can’t have A-levels, GCSEs or BTecs in the way that we have had them in the past but there are ways of ensuring that we can assess the work that students have done, give them a fair recognition of that and help them on to the next stage of their education.” Before the announcement of the latest lockdown, the government resisted calls for summer exams to be cancelled for the second year running, with Williamson saying last month he could “absolutely” give a cast-iron guarantee that exams in England would go ahead. The vow came as Williamson unveiled plans for pupils to be given advance notice of topics and to be allowed to take in exam aids including formula sheets. Asked about plans for summer assessments, an Ofqual spokesperson said: “We know how difficult this must be for students, teachers and lecturers. We wish at all costs to avoid arrangements for this summer’s GCSEs, A-levels and vocational and technical qualifications inflicting further disadvantage on students. We are considering a number of options to ensure the fairest possible outcome in the circumstances.” Meanwhile, college leaders in England have urged the government to cancel this month’s vocational exams, which are due to get under way this week, saying it is neither safe nor tenable to press ahead in the context of a national lockdown. Hundreds of thousands of students are due to sit vocational exams in schools and colleges this month. Announcing the lockdown last night, Boris Johnson said the exams should proceed as planned.
The Association of Colleges’ chief executive, David Hughes, has written to Gillian Keegan, minister for skills and apprenticeships, calling for an urgent rethink. He said the prime minister’s message was that everyone should stay at home to help defeat the virus. Hughes added: “Asking college staff and students to ignore that message to sit exams is simply untenable. It is patently not safe for them and their families, even with the best mitigations a college can put in place. To go ahead with this exam series now would also be unfair on students.”"
2021-01-04T21:24:32Z,politics,Politics,"To predict government policy, listen to Boris and wait for the opposite | John Crace","In hindsight, the clues were there for everyone to see. Last week, the government forced a vote on extending recess by an extra week until 11 January. After all, it wasn’t as if there was a lot on for MPs to scrutinise. Brexit was bound to be going swimmingly and the coronavirus was near enough completely under control. So sure enough, on the very first day of its prolonged holiday, Boris Johnson announced that parliament would be recalled on Wednesday. It’s now becoming easier and easier to predict government policy. Just listen to what the prime minister said in the morning and the opposite is likely to be true come the middle of the afternoon. It’s almost like clockwork – the government does what most reasonable people would have done several weeks earlier. At every stage in the coronavirus pandemic, the government has been hopelessly behind the curve. From being late to lockdown in March while the Cheltenham festival and Carrie Symonds’s baby shower went ahead. From ignoring the Sage advice in September for a second national lockdown and being forced into one in November by both Keir Starmer and the rapidly rising rates of infection. From announcing a five-day Christmas free-for-all in early December – everyone knew Covid liked to take time off over the holiday period – which he then had to cancel after everyone had already made their plans. During the biggest national health crisis in 100 years, it’s just our luck to have Johnson in charge. A man pathologically unable to make the right calls at the right time. The prime minister is a narcissistic charlatan. The Great Dick Faker. Someone who can’t bear to be the bearer of bad news or to be proved wrong by people who disagree with him. So he stubbornly ignores the evidence until he becomes overwhelmed by it and public opinion has turned against him. He isn’t just a liability as a leader, his indecision has cost lives. His hubris will only cost him his job. So the day started off much like any other day for Boris. A quick feelgood photo opportunity jaunt to watch someone get the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine on its first day of national distribution and a short clip to camera. Schools should definitely remain open, he insisted, apparently oblivious to the fact that most health and teaching professionals had said otherwise. But Boris thought differently. Most schoolkids only got a mild dose of Covid and the teachers should stop moaning. Despite the increased infectivity of the new coronavirus variant, teachers should take one for the team as children couldn’t afford to fall further behind in their education. It didn’t seem to have occurred to him that children also have parents and grandparents with whom they live and who might not be so lucky. There might be a time for increasing restrictions – Nicola Sturgeon announced Scotland’s early in the afternoon and the Labour leader had made a second appeal in two days for Johnson to see sense – but now was not the right time. Which begged the question: “If not now, then when?” With infections increasing exponentially, the death rate rising and hospitals struggling to cope with the rate of admissions, just how many more people would have to get seriously ill before Boris could be bothered to take action? As it happened, not many. Because shortly after filming this interview and insisting there would be no No 10 press conference that evening, Johnson announced he would be addressing the nation on TV at 8pm. Yet again, Boris had been shamed into another U-turn. Better late than never. Though too late for some. For his TV address, a dishevelled Boris – why change the habit of a lifetime and make it look like you give a toss? – didn’t look serious so much as scared shitless. Someone for whom reality had – temporarily at least – penetrated his self-delusion. There was little way to sugarcoat the news, despite him talking up the vaccine. No triumphs to be declared, no ersatz leadership theatrics for reassurance. Only the despair of a down-on-his-luck TV evangelist was on offer in the eight-minute statement. He began as if the huge rise in coronavirus cases had come as a massive shock to him at lunchtime, even though it was old news to the rest of the country, and spoke of his deep regret – the hurt was all his – at putting the country back into a total lockdown. Including closing the schools he had opened that morning. “Some of you might be wondering why we haven’t done this before,” he said. A question literally no one was asking as no one expects anything but incompetence and delay from this government any more. Typically, there was nothing about financial support for those whose livelihoods may be affected. He ended by saying that if all went well, there could be an easing of the lockdown by mid-February. But not even The Great Dick Faker, the master of self-deception, sounded convinced by this. As usual he didn’t have the balls to level with the country and tell us what we all deep down know. That it’s going to take at least three months before there’s even a hint of a return to normality. And that’s if we’re lucky. “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”"
2021-01-04T21:12:39Z,politics,Politics,UK Covid: Boris Johnson tells people to stay at home as England enters third national lockdown â€” as it happened,"Hereâ€™s a quick run-through of this eveningâ€™s events. England will enter its toughest nationwide lockdown since March, with schools closed and people allowed to leave home once a day for exercise for at least six weeks. â€œIf things go wellâ€�, Johnson said the government expects to have offered the first dose to everyone in the four top priority categories by mid-February. Exams â€œwill not be able to go forward as normalâ€�, Johnson said. Primary schools, secondary schools and colleges across England will move to remote teaching from tomorrow - except for key workersâ€™ children and vulnerable children. The government is advising people who are clinically extremely vulnerable to begin shielding again. The UK reported its highest ever daily number of new cases, with 58,784 further infections registered. As well as being a record rise, Mondayâ€™s figure is also the seventh time in a row that the daily number of cases has topped 50,000, which had never happened until last week. The UKâ€™s four chief medical officers and NHS England medical director have recommended that the UK alert level should move from level 4 to level 5. The Scottish MP Margaret Ferrier, 60, has been arrested and charged in connection with alleged culpable and reckless conduct over an alleged breach of coronavirus regulations between 26 and 29 September 2020. All schools and colleges in Wales will move to online learning until 18 January, the education minister has said. The number of Covid-19 patients in hospital in England stood at 26,626 as of 8am on 4 January â€” a week-on-week increase of 30%. Thatâ€™s all from the politics blog for today, but you can follow our global blog for any major UK developments as well as international stories."
2021-01-04T17:16:08Z,politics,Politics,Government's Covid missteps continue to baffle Tory MPs,"With England on the verge of a third national lockdown and schools across the country closing their doors, it is hard to believe that less than three weeks ago the government was insisting its three-tier system was sufficient and five days of Christmas mixing could go ahead. It was 15 December when Boris Johnson overruled scientists’ advice and told the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland he would face down calls to cancel Christmas. Just four days later, swathes of the country were in a new tier 4 with festive mixing cancelled. More regions followed within days. Then three days before Christmas, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) suggested evidence showed infections would soar if schools were allowed to open as normal.
Yet allies of the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, briefed hard that he was mounting a counterattack to stop schools from closing, before Johnson yet again bowed to the inevitable last week and ordered classrooms in high-risk areas to shut to most pupils. Conservative MPs are united in their deep frustration at the chaos – but are split on its root cause. Many blame the government’s communications’ strategy, which has never fully recovered since cabinet ministers were ordered to defend Dominic Cummings as a model father after he was accused of flouting lockdown rules. Others point to the birth of the “stay alert” slogan in May as the moment where public compliance began to give way to ridicule. But communications chaos alone does not explain the flip-flopping and about-turns when it comes to policy and strategy, critics say. Often the sequence goes: news of government scientific advisers’ grave warnings leak, ministers sombrely opine on the need to act – and there follows a days-long vacuum of information set against a backdrop of growing and increasingly urgent calls for action. Last week there were stark and repeated warnings about growing pressure on the NHS, as cases surpassed 50,000 day after day. On Sunday the prime minister said there was “no question” England would need tougher Covid lockdown rules soon, echoed by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, on Monday morning. It took 36 hours for the next steps to become clear. But in that vacuum, there is no transparent strategy for how action is decided. Though the UK is in a bleak situation, some MPs who blame communications say the government’s strategy and policy have not differed hugely from other countries that have also found themselves in deep difficulties. “The comms is [a] key problem. Underneath it all, the approach of most countries has been broadly similar,” one Tory MP said. “The key thing is to project competence with your ministers and your delivery. We have done neither. But the delivery bit can only be done with decisive decision-making.” Government communications has been beset by leaks in addition to strategic decisions to hand key announcements to certain papers or broadcasters, meaning public information filters out in the strangest of ways. Several MPs pointed to the near-farcical news of the new tier 4 and the cancellation of Christmas for many – which emerged via tweets from the Sunday Times deputy political editor, Caroline Wheeler, who got the leak. However, the journalist was locked out of her Twitter account and used a new account – meaning reporters, MPs and the public were initially unsure whether the news had been faked. Government advisers will privately say that delayed decision-making and a rapidly changing situation with the new variant of the virus are to blame rather than any communications strategy.
Andrew Mitchell, a veteran Tory MP who has not been afraid in the past to criticise the government, says the government is dealing as best as it practically can. “The truth is that it is the new variant of the virus that has driven a horse and cart through policy,” he said. “I have great sympathy with the government in trying to take very tough but essential decisions.” Yet there are gaps in the strategy that continue to baffle many MPs from all sides – including arrivals into the UK where travellers do not even routinely have their temperature checked, let alone are required to show a negative Covid test result. A number of normally loyal Conservative MPs have broken ranks in the past few days to call out the delay and indecisiveness, implicitly a criticism of ministers and Johnson himself. Among them was Neil O’Brien, only recently appointed as head of the Conservative party’s policy board. In a Twitter thread, O’Brien said the government “need[s] to do something big to slow the explosive growth and stop hospitals being further overwhelmed”, saying the current wave of coronavirus “is in many ways *worse* than the original spring surge”. The other call came from Jeremy Hunt, the former cabinet minister and now chair of the health select committee who normally restricts his campaigning to mass testing, but who joined the clamour for a change of strategy on Monday. “We need to close schools, borders, and ban all household mixing RIGHT AWAY,” he tweeted. Once again, the path for the government seems inevitable, but MPs are beginning to wonder if it is the fault of the communications or ministers themselves as to why they keep repeatedly falling into the same missteps. • This article was amended on 7 January 2021 because an earlier version referred, in the opening sentence, to ‘the UK [being] on the verge of a third national lockdown’. That should have referred to England."
2021-01-03T17:04:44Z,politics,Politics,Jo Stevens: outpouring of support for MP in hospital with Covid,"Politicians from across the political divide have sent best wishes to the Labour MP and shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens, who is being treated in hospital for coronavirus. The Cardiff Central MP has been “laid low with Covid for a while”, according to a statement from her team on New Year’s Eve. On Saturday, they tweeted from her account: “Jo has asked us to let you know that she is being treated in hospital for Covid. Thanks for all your good wishes, we will give an update when we can.” The 54-year-old was elected at the 2015 election, winning the seat back for Labour from the Liberal Democrats. She was shadow secretary of state for Wales for a short while under Jeremy Corbyn. She is the fourth MP known to be taken to hospital with Covid, including the prime minister, Boris Johnson, who ended up intensive care in April. Her Labour colleagues Yasmin Qureshi and Tony Lloyd were also admitted to hospital, with Lloyd spending 10 days on a ventilator in an induced coma. Qureshi, the MP for Bolton South East and a shadow minister for international development, said she had been left “anxious and concerned” after being taken by ambulance to her local hospital in October. In an interview with the Guardian last month she described the “unbearable pain” caused by coughing fits and pneumonia as the disease took hold. News of Stevens’s illness prompted well wishes from across the House of Commons. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he wished Stevens a “speedy recovery”. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, tweeted: “Get well soon Jo, a dear friend and colleague.” Mark Drakeford, Wales’s first minister, said: “All of our thoughts and best wishes are with Jo for a speedy recovery. Thank you to Jo’s constituency team for continuing to support Cardiff Central constituents at this difficult time.” In November she wrote to the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, calling for the government to clamp down on platforms that host “anti-vax” content. During the pandemic, Stevens has lobbied for more support for the culture sector, which she said was in “complete despair”. She told MPs in October: “In arts and culture, experienced, skilled and talented live performers, and the people who create, produce and make those economically successful events happen, are being treated by the Treasury as though their jobs were mere hobbies.”"
2021-01-03T14:25:33Z,politics,Politics,Tony Blair: I would have voted for Boris Johnson's post-Brexit trade deal,"Tony Blair, who was one of the most prominent campaigners for a second referendum on EU membership, has said he would have backed Boris Johnson’s post-Brexit trade deal with Brussels in the Commons. The former prime minister revealed he would have supported the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, who whipped his MPs to vote in favour of the prime minister’s agreement with the EU last week before the end of the transition period. Starmer – who also backed remain during the 2016 vote as well as calling for a second referendum in 2019 while serving as the shadow Brexit secretary – faced pressure from his own party ranks over his decision to support the deal, despite criticising it as “thin”. Three Labour junior frontbenchers resigned after defying Starmer and refusing to vote for the agreement. They were among 36 of the party’s MPs who abstained. One Labour MP went further and voted against the deal, which sailed through the parliamentary approval process on 30 December. Starmer, who before becoming leader last year accepted that Johnson’s election victory at the end of 2019 “blew away” the case for a second Brexit referendum, had declared Labour’s support for the prime minister’s trade deal with the EU after an agreement was reached on Christmas Eve. Asked if he would have voted for the deal in the Commons, Blair – among the most high-profile members of the remain camp during the 2016 Brexit referendum – told Times Radio on Sunday: “I would have backed the leader on this. I mean, look, it’s a tactical question for the Labour party because the problem is … it’s open to your opponents to say that if you don’t back the deal, then you’re voting for no deal.” He continued: “I would have backed the leader on it. Look, there was a case for abstaining and there was a case for … voting for it because the alternative’s no deal.” He added: “I don’t think it particularly matters to the Labour party either way. I think what does matter is that we’re still in a position where we’re pointing out what the problems with this deal are.” Separately, in a piece published on Sunday, Blair argued that though he was “passionately opposed” to Brexit and that he had not changed his mind about its “wisdom”, it was now “reality” and “we must make the best of it”. Meanwhile, Johnson confirmed he would continue as prime minister after Brexit and sought to play down issues with red tape over trade after the UK formally severed ties with the EU following the end of the transition period at 11pm on Thursday. “Of course, there are going to be changes and we’ve made that clear,” the prime minister told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, adding: “Actually, I think there’s a great opportunity for British SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] and exporters of all kinds.” He continued: “What we’ve seen is many companies in this country not exporting in the way that they could … the tragic reality of … business life is that there is some bureaucracy. We’re trying to remove it but we have a massive opportunity to expand our horizons and to think globally and to think big.” Asked if he would carry on as prime minister after Brexit, Johnson said: “Yes.” The prime minister added: “We now have freedoms that we haven’t had for 50 years and there are lots of reasons to be very positive about this otherwise grim new year.”"
2021-01-03T13:59:44Z,politics,Politics,UK carmakers have three years to source local electric car batteries,"UK carmakers face a three-year scramble to source electric car batteries locally or from the EU to avoid tariffs on exports following the Brexit free trade deal, according to industry analysts.
The Christmas Eve deal means that all UK-EU trade in cars and parts will continue to be free of tariffs or quotas after the the Brexit transition period ended on Friday, as long as they contain enough content from either UK or EU factories. The deal came as a major relief to the embattled car industry. Batteries will at first be allowed to contain up to 70% of materials from countries outside the EU or the UK. However, from 1 January 2024 that requirement will tighten to 50%. This will mean that sourcing battery materials from within the UK or EU will be the only realistic option for UK carmakers to avoid EU tariffs from 2024 onwards, according to Alessandro Marongiu, a trade analyst at the lobby group the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The rules mean it will be vital for UK carmakers to secure a battery supply from the the EU or the UK, said Mike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive. The deal makes it “imperative that the UK secures at pace investment in battery gigafactories and electrified supply chains”, he said. Ian Henry, whose AutoAnalysis consultancy works with a number of major carmakers, said one key issue in preserving the UK car industry was creating an entire supply chain, including manufacturing important and chemically complicated parts such as the cathodes crucial to lithium-ion batteries. “By the mid-2020s, the UK has got to be doing a lot more than just assembling bits from a kit,” said Henry. “Several core processes in battery manufacturing will have to take place here in order for the UK to have a viable electric vehicle industry.” The vast majority of batteries used in UK and EU electric cars are sourced from east Asian companies such as China’s CATL, Korea’s LG Chem or Japan’s Panasonic. However, European carmakers and governments are pouring billions of euros into new battery plants, with at least 10 credible efforts under way from companies including Sweden’s Northvolt and the French oil major Total, according to data company LMC Automotive.
The UK is lagging behind, with no fully funded plans to begin battery production in Britain, despite the promise of government funding and industry support for British “gigafactories” capable of large-scale battery production. The government-backed Faraday Institution this year said a failure to build a UK battery supply chain could cost more than 100,000 jobs by 2040. The Brexit deal was welcomed by the startup Britishvolt, which is the only company with public plans to build a gigafactory in the UK. Britishvolt last month bought rights to a site in Blyth, Northumberland, where it plans to build a factory, subject to fundraising. The Brexit deal’s provisions fit perfectly with Britishvolt’s ambitious plans to start battery production at scale by the end of 2023. It hopes to start building the plant in the summer. A spokesman said the deal would allow it to serve both the UK’s domestic automotive industry and carmakers in Europe."

Max Duncan said the Iberia desk had refused to recognise his green card as proof of residence despite assurances by the British and Spanish governments that both the old foreign national identification (NIE) document and the new foreign ID card (TIE) remained valid. Duncan said he and seven other residents of Spain had not been allowed to board the 10.55am flight to Madrid. The Spanish wife of one of the Britons was also part of the group.
Madrid had announced last year that in the light of Brexit, UK nationals resident in Spain would be given a photo ID to replace the residency papers carried by EU nationals although the green card would remain valid proof of residency. It then restricted passenger travel from the UK on 22 December until 19 January after the discovery of the new coronavirus variant in southern England, with exceptions for Spanish nationals and those legally resident in Spain. The British embassy in Madrid reiterated in a tweet on Saturday night that the green card was valid. “This should not be happening, the Spanish authorities have reconfirmed again this evening that the green residency document will be valid for travel to return to Spain as stated in our travel advice,” it said. Patricia Moody and her husband, who were flying home to Almería via Madrid, were also turned away. “We had tickets with Iberia but someone said BA were accepting the green card so we bought tickets with them, so we spent a total of £1,500. BA boarded one of our suitcases then said we couldn’t board after all.” Moody and her husband, who urgently needs medication, are waiting to hear from the British embassy in Madrid. Meanwhile, their PCR tests, which cost £249, are no longer valid for travel.
It was not just the Madrid flight that was affected. On Saturday, Carlos Torres, who has dual UK-Portuguese nationality, narrowly escaped being deported when he arrived at Barcelona airport. “Yesterday I was on flight BA474 from London Heathrow and landed in Barcelona at 13:20,” Torres wrote on Facebook. “Everyone had their NIE, negative PCR test result and HR code [Spanish travel health] which all had been already checked prior to boarding at Heathrow. The police then start checking all the NIEs and calling people to verify their status. It quickly escalated to the police telling everyone they must board the plane and fly back to London. “I kept telling them that I’m a European Union national and that they have to let me through. All the Brits were forced back on the flight (me included). Finally, the penny dropped and the senior police officer let me through at the last minute.” Tens of thousands of Britons have registered to be issued with the new card but many are waiting to receive their ID as the system is overloaded. There are about 300,000 British residents in Spain, although the number may be much higher as many live outside the Spanish system. BA said in a statement: “In these difficult and unprecedented times with dynamic travel restrictions, we are doing everything we can to help and support our customers.”"
2021-01-03T10:59:24Z,politics,Politics,"Coronavirus restrictions 'probably about to get tougher', says Boris Johnson","Boris Johnson has raised the prospect of even tougher lockdown measures, including school closures, being imposed in England in the coming weeks to stem surging Covid-19 rates. Amid concerns over pressure on the NHS and the higher transmissibility of the new coronavirus variant, the prime minister revealed he was “fully reconciled” to potentially having to “do things in the next few weeks that will be tougher”. He also acknowledged that the coronavirus curbs were “probably about to get tougher”. Nearly eight in 10 people in England are already under “stay at home” tier 4 measures, which include the closure of non-essential shops and strict one-to-one outdoor meeting limits between households, but Johnson suggested stricter curbs could be introduced. Asked whether it may be necessary to introduce tougher “tier 5” restrictions in the near future, Johnson told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: “It may be that we need to do things in the next few weeks that will be tougher in … many parts of the country … I’m fully, fully reconciled to that. And I bet the people of this country are reconciled to that.”
Asked what “tougher” might mean, Johnson said: “Until the vaccine really comes on stream in a massive way, we’re fighting this virus with the same set of tools.” Pressed again on what it might mean and if, for example, it could include March-style restrictions on daily exercise or a curfew, Johnson replied: “You’ve spoken about tier 5, I haven’t said that, but there are obviously a range of … tougher measures that we would have to consider.” Asked what they would be, the prime minister said: “I’m not going to speculate now about what they … would be, but I’m sure that all our viewers and listeners, will understand … clearly, school closures, which we had to do in March, is one of those … things… It’s not something we necessarily want to do.” Acknowledging that the situation was “very difficult”, Johnson added: “We’re entirely reconciled to doing what it takes to get the virus down and … that may involve tougher measures … in the weeks ahead.” “What we’re doing now is using the tiering system, which is a very tough system … and, alas, probably about to get tougher, to keep things under control. But we’ll review it.” He added: “And we have the prospect of vaccines coming down the track in their tens of millions … and that, I think, is something that should keep people going in what I predicted, back on your show in October, will be a very bumpy period right now. It is bumpy and it’s going to be bumpy.” Despite warning of stricter measures on the horizon, and in the face of pressure from education unions, Johnson separately urged parents to send their children into primary schools on Monday in areas of the country where they are still set to open. Sir Mark Walport, who sits on Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) and was formerly the UK government’s chief scientific adviser, said it was “pretty clear” more restrictions would be needed to prevent transmission of the virus. “It is going to be very very difficult to get under control without much tighter social distancing measures,” he told Marr.
Those measures could potentially include closing schools, he said, adding: “We know that transmission occurs within schools, we know that a person between 12 and 16 is seven times more likely than others in a household to bring the infection into a household, and we know that there was a small dip in the amount of transmission in schoolchildren after the half-term, which then went up again when they went back.” Minutes from the Sage meeting on 22 December showed the group feared that even with full lockdown and closure of all schools, it might not bring the R number below one in the presence of the new variant."
2021-01-02T22:07:35Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson would lose majority and seat in election tomorrow â€“ poll,"The public are deeply unhappy with the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the Brexit negotiations, a damning new poll suggests. The poll predicts that if a general election were held tomorrow neither the Conservatives nor Labour would win an outright majority. Disturbingly for Boris Johnson, the survey says the Conservatives would lose 81 seats, wiping out the 80-seat majority they won in December 2019. It gives the first detailed insight into the public’s perception of Johnson’s handling of the Brexit talks and the pandemic, amid fears that Britain is heading into a third national lockdown. The prime minister is on course to lose his own seat of Uxbridge and Ruislip South, if the insight is accurate. According to the survey of more than 22,000 people, conducted by the research data company Focaldata, using the multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP) method that is said to be more than accurate than conventional polling, the results would leave the Tories with 284 seats and Labour with 282 – an increase of 82. Results in Scotland would see the Scottish National party achieve a near complete sweep, winning 57 of the 59 Scottish seats. The poll also predicts the Liberal Democrats would be reduced to just two seats – in Bath and in Kingston and Surbiton – down from the current 11. One in four voters who supported the Lib Dems in 2019 said they will switch allegiance to Labour. Many of the seats that Labour would gain are in the north of England, Midlands and Wales, part of the “red wall” collapse that swept the Tories to power at the last election, the Sunday Times reported. The survey forecasts that the Conservatives would cling on to just eight of the 43 red wall seats that they won at the last election – Bassetlaw, Bishop Auckland, Colne Valley, Dudley North, Great Grimsby, Penistone and Stocksbridge, Scunthorpe, and Sedgefield. Labour is marginally ahead of the Tories on 37.7% of the vote, with the Tories on 35.6, the Lib Dems on 8.7% and the Green party on 6.9%. The findings clearly suggest new Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is making headway in rebuilding support for his party. In the last six months Labour has steadily hauled in the 26-point lead the Conservatives held. The poll results are likely to foment further unrest among Tory MPs about the performance of the prime minister and his cabinet. Justin Ibbett, founder of Focaldata, who carried out a similar poll for the Conservatives prior to the 2019 election, told the Sunday Times: “One year on from their stunning general election triumph, it is clear that the Conservatives already have a lot of work to do if they are to replicate their 2019 success in future elections. “The SNP would appear to be the real winners. Not only do they win all but two Scottish constituencies, but the most likely outcome is a Labour-SNP coalition government, which would have an overall majority of just over 20 seats.” Tory supporters were quick to point out on social media that the survey period ended before news of the Brexit deal was announced and claim there is evidence of a swingback to the Conservatives in the few days since."
2021-01-02T21:02:45Z,politics,Politics,"Come clean on logjams at British borders as new Brexit rules kick in, ministers told","Ministers are facing demands for more honesty and transparency over any logjams at the UK border in the wake of Britain’s exit from the EU, amid concerns that waves of disruption will last for six months. Several lorry drivers are understood to have been turned away at Dover for not having the right paperwork following the end of the Brexit transition period last week. It has caused concern among logistics and manufacturing companies that more severe problems could occur as trade flows increase later this month. The main initial worries for businesses concern the availability of vets to carry out checks for new export health certificates. This could hit meat and food sales to the EU. Bigger challenges will come when freight starts flowing from manufacturers of complex products, which are unlikely to have begun using the new systems. “We are going into a test period,” said Elizabeth de Jong of trade body Logistics UK. “If you were running your own business, you wouldn’t do it like this. You would have designed your new processes, you’d have trained people in them, you’d have tested the new systems, you’d have used it with dummy data, you’d have had a walkthrough. Those are all fundamentals of management. We’ve not been able to do any of it. “There are also cliff edges ahead. In July, we’re going to start import checks as well: that will need more capacity and more people. We’ve also got grace periods in Northern Ireland. “We need the absolute analysis of what’s going well, what isn’t, where the blockages are and what are the difficulties. We need that honesty and transparency. It’s a shared problem. We will get there and there are a lot of people who want this to work.” As the Brexit transition period ended last Thursday, Boris Johnson hailed the new relationship with the EU as an opportunity to “transform our country”. Disruption was not expected over the weekend, with low levels of freight crossing the border. However, almost half of the lorries entering Belfast from Britain on the first ferry of New Year’s Day were inspected: one was stopped for three hours. Jean-Michel Thillier, customs director for Calais, has warned the new arrangements will face “trial by fire” when traffic increases. In a move designed to curb queues, lorry drivers heading for mainland Europe must have a Kent Access Permit before entering the county. However, there are already reports that some holders of the permits still did not have all the necessary paperwork. Johnson won the support of hardline Tory Eurosceptics for his Brexit trade deal, but there remains unease about Northern Ireland being treated differently from the rest of the UK and extra checks effectively creating a border in the Irish Sea. Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis tweeted on Friday, however, that there was “no Irish Sea border”.
Labour leader Keir Starmer’s decision to back the Brexit deal – which led to three frontbench resignations – is still angering his MPs. Some said they were now completely unclear about Labour’s aims for improving Britain’s relationship with the EU. “The Labour MPs [who refused to back the Brexit deal] aren’t going away,” said one rebel. “They will absolutely want Labour to be looking again at a customs union with the EU.” Former shadow cabinet member Clive Lewis warned that it would prove impossible for Labour to avoid the Brexit fallout. “The departure from Europe is going to open up a whole series of questions. A big part of the manifesto is going to have to talk about what we’re going to do with our relationship with Europe.”
Meanwhile, Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party – which is seeking permission to rebrand as Reform UK – is planning to use concerns about fishing in its local election campaign in May. But for now, with Farage having announced that the “war is over”, the party is planning to focus more on issues such as the government’s Covid strategy. The Brexit party says it will field around 2,000 candidates in May’s local elections. However, chairman Richard Tice said he was already concerned there would be attempts to postpone the elections because of the pandemic."
2021-01-02T07:00:32Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: how the new rules will change your visits to the EU,"Before Brexit, UK citizens could travel, live, go on holiday and work anywhere in the EU without any special permits or visas. As of 1 January 2021 that is no longer the case. The Guardian’s Money team has spent the week poring over the many pages of documentation to explain how Brexit will affect you. Holidays and travel What does all this mean for holidays this year – if and when they are allowed to resume? While the coronavirus crisis has pretty much put a halt to all immediate travel, when the current restrictions are lifted and EU trips can resume, Brits face some significant changes over the next two years. While most of those taking city breaks or beach holidays to an EU country (plus Norway, Switzerland and Iceland) will see little immediate difference, the picture is markedly different if you travel a lot or spend a significant amount of time in the EU.
Britain and the EU have agreed visa-free travel for short visits, meaning UK passport holders can spend up to 90 days in the its Schengen zone during any 180-day period. This can be in a series of short visits or one long visit, and it applies to all EU countries with the exception of the non-Schengen countries Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania. You could make a 90-day trip to any of those and still not use up your 90-day allowance. The same is true of Ireland, which allows unrestricted travel from the UK as part of a common travel area for British nationals. From 2022 (the exact date is yet to be confirmed), you will have to buy a visa waiver for holidays and short stays in the EU. This is not a visa but a permission to enter. It will cost €7 (£6.29) and will be issued under the European Travel Information and Authorisation System, similar to the Esta permit currently required to visit the US. I usually spend more than 90 days in the EU over a six-month period as a tourist – will I be able to with a visa? Probably not. The Brexit agreement clearly restricts short trip visits to a maximum 90 days within one 180-day period. While the UK government says Brits who have exceeded their 90 days will be able to apply for a visa to stay longer, the European commission says that once the 90 days are up, the person would cease to be a tourist or “short stay” visitor, and would have to apply for a full long-term immigration visa – with all the costs and hassle that that entails. As it stands, someone spending May, June and July with a friend in Spain would not be able to return visa-free to any EU country inside the Schengen travel area until November – six months after they arrived in Spain. So, for example, if they wanted to visit Venice in August, that might prove tricky. However, each EU country has the right to set its own entry terms. It is possible that, for example, the Spanish or Portuguese governments, which are keen on maintaining UK tourist levels, could decide to offer an easy, non-work visa in the future, but this is by no means a given. Expect more details to emerge from EU countries during the coming months – but don’t bank on it.
Will my Ehic card still work? Yes and no. According to the NHS website, your European health insurance card remains valid in the EU until it expires, which for some people will be quite a way off. However, a replacement is being developed called the global health insurance card (Ghic). The bad news is that there are few details at the moment, and it does not for now extend as far as the Ehic. Currently, the new Ghic is expected to cover you for travel in EU countries, but not Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein. If travelling to any of those countries, buying private cover should be regarded as an absolute necessity. Transitional arrangements have been put in place for Norway allowing UK nationals to use their UK passport to access state-provided medical treatment if necessary. The government is also negotiating new arrangements with Switzerland and the European Economic Area (EEA)/European Free Trade Association (Efta) states that could result in Ehic-style reciprocal healthcare cover there. Keep in mind that the Ehic and its successor the Ghic are not the same as travel insurance. The Ehic card entitles visitors only to necessary state healthcare for free or at a reduced cost. It does not, for example, cover repatriation to the UK after a serious accident. The “global” bit of the new Ghic is something of a misnomer. The British government has not suddenly decided to give British tourists free health cover in the US. It will offer cover only under existing reciprocal arrangements: largely in Commonwealth countries such as Australia and New Zealand. Will I need travel insurance? It is not a legal requirement that a traveller buys insurance when visiting the EU, but for the vast majority of people it would be daft not to, with scores of annual multi-trip policies costing less than £50 available for travel to the EU in 2021. There have been widespread concerns about the cost of travel insurance post-Brexit as the Ehic is withdrawn, particularly for those with pre-existing conditions.
What about passports/immigration control? Pre-Brexit, you could travel to EU countries on your passport right up to the point it expired. As of 1 January 2021, the UK government was advising travellers visiting the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, to have at least six months left on their passport. You will no longer be able to use EU fast-track passport control and customs lanes, meaning possible delays at some airports. Also, when you arrive in an EU country (except Ireland), be prepared to show your return ticket. You could also be asked to show that you have enough money for your stay.
And driving abroad? The good news is that your UK driving licence will continue to be valid in the EU. Previously it was understood that UK drivers would have to apply at the Post Office for one of two (or both) international driving permits, depending on the destination country. However, if you are taking your own car or other vehicle abroad, you will still need to apply to your insurer for a green card to prove that you have cover. There shouldn’t be a charge, except perhaps an admin fee, according to the Association of British Insurers. You should print it out and be ready to show it if asked by the police or other authorities. Note that Northern Irish drivers who enter the Republic will also need one. The ABI says the EU could end the green card requirement in the coming months. What about mobile roaming? The right to use your UK phone allowance while in the EU will end, meaning there is nothing to stop the phone companies reintroducing roaming charges. The big four main providers – EE, 02, Vodafone and Three – have said they have no plans to do this in the short term. As part of the deal, the UK and EU have agreed to cooperate on “fair and transparent” rates for mobile roaming. It remains to be seen what that means. And pet passports? The old EU pet passports are no longer valid. Instead the EU has agreed that Great Britain should be given “part two listed” status, allowing pets to travel within its borders providing the owners obtain an animal health certificate (AHC). This confirms that your pet is microchipped and vaccinated against rabies. You will need to get a new certificate each time you travel up to 10 days prior to travel. The AHC will be valid for four months.
How much booze can I bring back with me? The days of filling the car with as much wine as the suspension could take are also over, and a booze cruise to Calais won’t really be worth it after 1 January. Travellers returning from the EU will be restricted to 18 litres of wine (24 bottles), 42 litres of beer and 4 litres of spirits or liqueurs over 22% in alcohol – plus up to 200 cigarettes. So, compensation for flight delays … will we still get it? Yes. The EU261 rules that require airlines to compensate passengers for seriously delayed or cancelled flights have been written into UK law and remain as before. EU travel firms supplying UK consumers will also still have to provide compensation if their company goes bust. Studying in the EU For anyone who was already living or studying in the EU before 31 December 2020, it is business as usual, and you will pay the same (EU) fees until the course ends. You will also continue to be eligible for the same support – access to loans and so on – as students from the country you are studying in. However, as things stand, British students applying to study in the EU from September 2021 onwards face paying the much higher international fees paid by all non-EU nationals. They may well also not have access to the loans and other help that their predecessors enjoyed. Working in the EU
From 1 January 2021, UK citizens no longer have an automatic right to live or work in the EU, so if you are looking to do this, you will need to check your destination’s immigration rules. UK citizens who moved to an EU member state before 31 December 2020 can carry on living and working there but must register as a resident in the country where they live by 30 June 2021. For Britons who live in the UK but spend a lot of time working in the EU, things are now very complicated. There is a deal for senior managers who are seconded, and some short-term business visitors can work for 90 days in any given six-month period, but there are restrictions on the activities they can perform. The list of permitted activities shows that while meetings, trade exhibitions and conferences, consultations and research are fine, anything that involves selling goods or services directly to the public will require a work visa. Each EU member state has its own immigration regime, with often strict sanctions for those who don’t comply. Musicians and other performers have been left out of the deal, meaning that they have to get work permits to tour in the EU. The singer-songwriter KT Tunstall and the comedian Dawn French are among the more than 200,000 people who have signed a petition on the subject. There is no mutual recognition of professional qualifications in the deal, causing complications for those such as doctors, accountants and architects qualifying in the UK who wish to practise in the EU after 1 January. Living in the EU
I am a UK national in the EU – will I still get my UK pension? Yes. UK pensioners (including EU citizens who have worked in the UK) who have retired to an EU country have already been guaranteed that they will be able to receive the UK state pension, and benefit from any annual uprating. For people who intend to retire to another EU nation in future, there are also safeguards. The government guidance says: “You can carry on receiving your UK state pension if you move to live in the EU, EEA or Switzerland, and you can still claim your UK state pension from these countries. Your UK state pension will be increased each year in the EU in line with the rate paid in the UK.” If you are receiving a private pension, such as an annuity, from the UK but are resident abroad, the government says you should contact your provider. But in general it says: “UK law allows for workplace pensions to be paid overseas. The government does not expect this to change because the UK has left the EU.” However, there may be issues about the bank account into which your pension is paid. The Pensions Advisory Service says that although practice varies, pension schemes and annuity providers do not typically pay pension benefits directly into an overseas bank account, leaving the individual to transfer the money from a UK bank account – which will result in transfer fees and exchange rate fluctuations. More importantly, if you are resident overseas, there is a risk that your bank may close your UK account. In that case, you will need to contact the pension provider to ensure that it can pay the money into an overseas account.
So can I keep my UK bank account? Thousands of Britons resident in the EU were told in September that they would have their UK bank accounts closed by the end of the year. UK banks have been operating across the EU under passporting arrangements. Account holders who bank with firms that own an EU-based subsidiary will have their accounts transferred to that EU entity. But where that is not the case, accounts are likely to be closed. The Netherlands is particularly affected, with Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide and the Co-operative Bank withdrawing services. The Lloyds group, which includes Bank of Scotland and Halifax, is also closing accounts in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Ireland and Slovenia, and Nationwide will no longer serve Italy. Barclays is closing accounts for customers in Belgium, Estonia, Italy and Slovakia, and Barclaycard accounts across the EEA will be closed unless linked to a UK address. While Santander customer accounts remain open, the bank is not taking on any new requests from EU-based customers. What does this mean for my payments in and out of the account? If you used your account to run direct debits for bills in the UK, there is no obvious solution other than to check with other banks to see if you can switch to a new account, according to Robert Hallums, of the advice consultancy Experts for Expats. Some pension providers may accept transfers from a currency account such as the Moneycorp online currency account, which converts payments and receipts into the desired currency without large fees or currency fluctuations. You can also use this kind of account to pay bills in the UK or receive rental income. In the worst-case scenario, you may need to consider paying it into a local bank account and accept the higher costs of currency exchange rates and fees. Will £85,000 of my savings still be protected? The Financial Services Compensation Scheme will still pay out the first £85,000 of your balance if your bank collapses, provided it is regulated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority. • This article was amended on 4 January 2021 to change references to Europe to the EU in the headline and text."
2021-01-01T17:55:07Z,politics,Politics,'Betrayed': Dover residents furious over building of Brexit lorry park,"It was all quiet on the Dover front in the hours after the UK left the EU, as lorries continued to avoid the port. But just minutes away, beyond the famous white cliffs, the sense of fury over Brexit was palpable as local residents came to terms with a government letter they received on New Year’s Eve telling them that from summer, their rural idyll of farmland and ancient Roman ways would be transformed into a customs clearance lorry park for 1,200 trucks. The site is in addition to the the Ashford lorry park 22 miles away that barricades fields behind 4-metre fences. Locals say they feel “betrayed” and “trapped” by the “lies” of the government over Brexit. Just as they were looking forward to a new year, the letter from the transport minister Rachel Maclean arrived advising them that the white cliffs site had been purchased and would be used as an “Inland Border Facility” from July.
“I am absolutely devastated,” said Charlotte Ashmore, who lives on a short row of period cottages overlooking the vast site, acquired under special legislation. The Green party coordinator for Deal and Dover, Sarah Gleave, said residents had been kept in the dark and feared they had no way of stopping construction.
She was told in a freedom of information disclosure by Kent county council, seen by the Guardian, that the white cliffs site would take over from Manston airport, where thousands of lorries were held last week after the French Covid border closure. Work is expected to start in days, and residents in the tiny villages of Whitfield and Guston that shoulder the site say the park will destroy the quality of their lives, wreck the environment including an ancient Roman right of way across the fields, and bring non-stop light and noise pollution. “My son has autism and we only moved here two years ago because of the calmness here. He doesn’t like noise and he doesn’t like light and he’s really anxious about this. He doesn’t want a lorry park here,” said Ashmore of her six-year-old, Nathan. “I’m considering putting the house on the market but we’ve just got a new five-year mortgage so we are trapped,” she added.
Like her neighbour Mick Palmer, she complains about the lack of consultation, saying the Department for Transport has given just “brief facts”. A former HGV international driver, Palmer is all too familiar with the need for lorry parks where drivers can rest up, wash and eat. He doesn’t believe the government claim that lorries will be required only to drive in, get their customs paperwork cleared and drive out again. “I’ve been here for 36 years and I would have been for all my life. They have just told lie after lie after lie. Never has a country treated its people so badly,” he said, adding that Westminster “bigwigs” had no interest in the consequences of their decisions. “They say it’s not going to be a lorry park but a customs clearance site and lorries will only be here for 20 minutes. “I know exactly what will happen. Lorries have nowhere to park in Kent, and they will come in here and stop and wave their tachograph and say: ‘I’m not moving.’ “They will have to have floodlights, power points for refrigerated lorries, which means generators going all night. “We heard this might happen and they said they might start digging on 3 January. We went to a local meeting with some officials and asked how many of them had come down here to look at the site. Not one of them. They don’t know our lives; they don’t know the impact on our lives,” he said. Residents say they have seen the 5-metre wooden fencing at the Ashford lorry park up the road, which has destroyed hedgerows and sweeping country views for walkers and residents. They fear they will face the same but just 25 metres away from their doors. “It is absolutely crazy. We have got to stop this,” said Palmer.
Gleave is desperately concerned about the impact on the environment. “People only hear about the port, but this is the North Downs way, the main footpath that goes across the county of Kent. It has fantastic wildlife, and is an area of fantastic food production, which is important post-Brexit, and the last thing we want to do is to destroy it. “The village of Guston is a wonderful community. People are here for the tranquility and community. They don’t have clout, but they are fighting it.
Sharon McCartney is one of those residents, out walking with her daughter, Missy, and their dog, Violet. “I am disgusted,” she said. “You can already hear the hum of the A2 but it doesn’t bother me when we are in the garden. But what is it going to be like with 1,200 lorries?” Missy, 17, is also devastated. “I use that Roman road to go into town. In the summer it’s one of the best walks you can do.” A Department for Transport spokesperson denied the site was a replacement for Manston. It said the facility would bring local jobs and “further planning consent” requirements would allow locals to express their views. They added: “Purchasing the white cliffs site in Dover will allow the government to set up an inland facility with easy access to the port, which does not itself have the space needed for extended checks. “We understand concerns about resulting disruption, which is why we are working with the relevant authorities and our principal designer to ensure the surrounding roads are not negatively impacted by increased HGV movements.”"
2021-01-01T16:05:39Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit is nothing to celebrate, says Ireland's foreign minister","Brexit is “not something to celebrate”, Ireland’s foreign minister Simon Coveney declared after the UK formally severed ties with the EU, as he warned of trading disruptions due to fresh red tape.
In stark contrast to Boris Johnson’s buoyant characterisation of the country’s future following the end of the transition period at 11pm on Thursday, Coveney painted the UK’s departure as a source of regret. Calling it the end of an era, Coveney said trade across the Irish Sea would be “disrupted by an awful lot more checks and declarations, and bureaucracy and paperwork, and cost and delays”. But on Friday, as the first ferries arrived in the Republic of Ireland from Britain under the new post-Brexit trade rules, events appeared to unfold smoothly. In Dublin, Irish Ferries’ ship Ulysses docked at 5.55am with about a dozen trucks on board, after travelling from Holyhead in Wales, and there were no delays as the freight trailers cleared customs checks. Meanwhile, the first ferries also sailed in and out of the port of Dover uneventfully, although it is thought that the real test is yet to come as the New Year is typically quiet and importers had been stockpiling products before the end of the transition period. In an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Friday, Coveney said: “For 48 years, the United Kingdom really has been a central part of the European Union. And that is now firmly ending with the end of the transition period … For all of us in Ireland, that is not something to celebrate. Our relationship with the United Kingdom is so close, so integrated, so interwoven, if you like, politically, economically and from a family perspective. “My own personal story is so shaped by the Anglo-Irish relationship, and that’s the same for so many other Irish people, so we’re seeing the United Kingdom moving in a different direction on its own, chasing some notion of trying to re-find its sovereignty and … that is something that we regret but, of course, we accept because it was a democratic decision.”
Despite Downing Street securing a trade deal with Brussels on Christmas Eve – which was subsequently fast-tracked through parliament on Wednesday as MPs approved a bill making the agreement UK law – Coveney warned there would still be trade issues. “We’re now going to see the €80bn [£72bn] worth of trade across the Irish Sea between Britain and Ireland disrupted by an awful lot more checks and declarations, and bureaucracy and paperwork, and cost and delays,” he said. “That is the inevitable consequence, unfortunately, even with a trade agreement which everybody, I think, is very relieved was signed on Christmas Eve.” However, he said there would be no additional checks on goods between Northern Ireland – which is staying in the EU’s single market, as well as applying EU customs rules at its ports – and the Republic of Ireland. Newly introduced checks on goods arriving in Northern Ireland from mainland Britain would be “as limited as possible”, he said. “In terms of checks on goods, the whole point of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland linked to Brexit is to maintain an all-Ireland economy in terms of the movement of goods as it is today,” he said. “The only checks will be on goods coming from GB into Northern Ireland, and those checks will be as limited as possible to protect the movement of goods and services within the United Kingdom as a whole.” The first ferry from Great Britain operating under the terms of Northern Ireland trading protocol docked in Belfast on Friday on schedule at 1.45pm – the Stena Line ship arrived from Cairnryan, in Scotland, with no evidence of disruption or delay. In France, the president, Emmanuel Macron, used his New Year’s Eve message to take aim at Brexit, calling it the product of “lies and false promises”. Meanwhile, in a piece for the Daily Telegraph to mark the new year, Johnson wrote: “Despite the many predictions of failure – and constant suggestions that the talks should be abandoned – we got a great new deal with our European friends and neighbours.” More than four years on from the Brexit referendum, Johnson also said the country had “taken back control of our money, our laws and our waters”. He added: “And yet it is also the essence of this treaty that it provides certainty for UK business and industry, because it means that we can continue to trade freely – with zero tariffs and zero quotas – with the EU.” He described it as a “big win for both sides of the Channel”, continuing: “For us, it means the end of the rancorous bickering about “Europe” that has bedevilled our politics for so long. It means the end of that uneasy feeling that we were constantly being asked to sign up for the details of a project – a giant federal fusion of states – in which we didn’t really believe and hadn’t really bargained for.”"
2021-01-01T15:00:12Z,politics,Politics,Brexit trade deal places Europe back at centre of UK politics,"In the words of one official in Brussels involved in the Brexit negotiations, the last year “accelerated the grieving process” over the UK’s departure from the EU. This is not to say the bloc’s institutions will be celebrating the country’s passing from the single market and customs union, 48 years to the day after its accession to the then European Communities on 1 January 1973. It remains a devastating loss to the EU, from which the full repercussions are yet to be seen even four and a half years after the referendum. The success or otherwise of the British experiment will play into European domestic debates for many years to come, not least the French presidential election in 2022. Yet, among even the most anglophile of officials and diplomats, of which there remain many in the EU quarter of Belgium’s capital, there is not only acceptance of the country’s exit but some unashamed relief.
The EU’s 27 member states were slow to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, but, diplomats muse, how much worse would it have been with the UK as a member state? There was initial resistance from some capitals to the concept of joint borrowing on the financial markets as part of an effort to build up the EU’s €750bn Covid economic recovery fund, more than half of which will be distributed as grants rather than loans. The Netherlands, Sweden, Austria and Denmark – called “the frugals” – were forced to show their true colours after decades of hiding behind British awkwardness about such great leaps towards convergence. The link made between payments from Brussels and adherence to the rule of law among the member states – particularly relevant to Poland and Hungary – would have further posed a problem in Whitehall, where encroachment into domestic affairs has long been anathema. It is questionable whether, in the face of inevitable British scepticism, the concept of the recovery fund would have been allowed to fly at all. The final deal was hard-fought and messy, but how much more tortured would it have been with British involvement? Brexit, then, has been made tolerable by events. Now that it is done, there is nothing sentimental about Brussels’ approach to the future. If it was a coincidence then it was a happy one that at the same meeting at which EU ambassadors gave the green light to the post-Brexit trade and security deal this week, they also signalled approval of an investment pact with China. While it has its critics, the deal eases barriers to EU companies hoping to invest in China by lifting joint-venture requirements as well as caps on foreign equity in the automotive industry, private healthcare, ancillary services for air transport and cloud computing. China has also committed to “continued and sustained efforts” to ratify International Labour Organization conventions against the use of forced labour. The French government has framed the development as the EU correcting an imbalance in the openness of the two economies, a flexing of muscle not possible for any one member state or medium-sized island nation alone. While Boris Johnson has talked of a “global Britain”, Ursula von der Leyen has been putting into action her pledge to lead a “geopolitical European commission”. None of this is to traduce the Brexiter vision of a nimble Britain, able to negotiate trade deals around the world that better play to the country’s strengths in services, and financial ones in particular. But it is yet to be seen in practice – and officials in Brussels question both whether Whitehall has the bandwidth for what is to come and the sincerity of Johnson’s claim that his deal finally settles the European question in his party and the wider country. There are far too many pointers to the opposite being true. Just look at the impending flashpoints and the potential for European obsessions to be stirred. Great Britain now has the ability to diverge from EU environmental, social and labour regulatory standards in the future – but in doing so it opens itself up to tariffs on exports into its biggest market. The UK may close its waters to European fishing fleets in five and a half years, but again the trade deal foresees consequences in terms of a closure of the European market to British exporters. Politically inspired demands will again rub up against their economic consequences. The deal foresees a possible renegotiation of all its terms in four years’ time if regulatory divergence and tariffs create an imbalance. That would follow a likely general election in 2024. Johnson has already claimed Sir Keir Starmer would rip up the deal to put the UK under the yoke of Brussels as a Labour prime minister. Keep Brexit done, is the mantra. The campaign lines can already be seen. Meanwhile, under the withdrawal agreement, Northern Ireland’s assembly will vote in four years on whether the region should stay in the EU’s single market. It is a debate that will be easily framed as a choice between the EU and Britain. The Irish government has already said it will fund participation of the Erasmus+ student exchange programme for Northern Irish students after the British government opted not to pay for continued membership. Perhaps most significantly of all, the question of EU membership will be central to the next great political debate in the UK: Scottish independence. As the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, never tires of saying, no part of Scotland backed Brexit. But Johnson’s deal – outside the single market and the customs union – means as a matter of EU law that an independent Scotland, newly acceded to the EU, would need to erect a full-fat customs border with England. Johnson has his trade deal, and there should be cause for relief in that. But rather than take the question of the UK’s relationship with Europe out of British political debate, the terms of the deal plonk it right at the centre in a way unthinkable even a decade ago. And there isn’t any obvious way back."
2021-01-01T12:30:09Z,politics,Politics,"Football, flights and food: how the EU reshaped Britain","Historians of the future will judge the politics of the half century before the Brexit transition ended on 1 January 2021. What, though, of social and cultural historians, those who study how we live? Perhaps the most symbolic cultural artefacts of the last 50 years will turn out not to be a blue flag but a bottle of Blue Nun, a block of mozzarella, a Ryanair boarding printout or a ticket to a Bayern Munich v Manchester City football match. Despite half a century of belonging to the EU club, most British people say their emotional bonds to Europe are not strong. “Nearly 60% of Britons do not identify as European at all,” says Anand Menon, a professor of European politics at King’s College London. Allegiance to an abstract notion or a set of institutions is a stretch even for Europhiles. The early weeks of the pandemic in March tested solidarity even among the diehard founding member states. Yet lives and lifestyles across the continent are closer than imaginable in 1973 and in ways that cannot be measured by a survey. Even if no European “society” exists for Britain’s departure to disrupt, an informal convergence of tastes and cultural assumptions that could be called “Europeanisation” has taken place over the last five decades.
We may be familiar with how burgundy passports transformed migration, education and work. Scientists, researchers, countless professionals and the Erasmus generation will be affected by the loss of freedom of movement. EU citizens who made lives in the UK, especially after the opening up to eastern Europe from 2004, are bracing for a new precarity. But what about the majority of Britons who never married a Swede, bought a holiday home in France, got an engineering job in Eindhoven or spent a year studying in Madrid? How bumpy a ride will their sociocultural readjustment be? For good or ill, the boring business of trade – integrated supply chains, the free movement of goods and common rules for everything from energy to eggs – has shaped their lives too, even if few saw themselves as participants in a post-national experiment let alone expressed it as a form of identity. The greatest irony is that much of the Europeanising process that Boris Johnson’s hard divorce settlement aims to end was not driven from Brussels but from London.
Britain entered the bloc in 1973 entirely for transactional reasons and not because it “bought into the narrative” of political integration, says Menon. If GDP alone is the benchmark of success, membership paid off. Income per person is approximately 8.5% higher than it would have been had the UK stayed out, Nicholas Crafts, a professor of economic history at the University of Sussex, estimates. He attributes this extra prosperity to increased competition, lower trade costs and higher productivity. Margaret Thatcher may have let her antipathy to the federalist dream seed the culture war that led to Brexit, but she backed the 1985 project that would from 1992 become the EU’s most far-reaching achievement: the single market. Unwittingly, in pursuing its own interests via an expansive “common market”, the UK ended up selling EU citizens a common European lifestyle and perhaps even a common identity. British fingerprints, says Crafts, were all over the project. It meant goods could be packaged, labelled, transported and safely sold across Europe without any additional paperwork. “We were pushing strongly for it,” says Crafts. “It’s very simple: if you reduce the costs of doing business, the volume of trade goes up. “British business found standardisation a bonus. Because a regulatory union – which is exactly what the single market is – reduces costs much more than tariff-free trade does.” Food, glorious food How Europeans eat and drink in 2020 compared with 1973 is probably the clearest illustration of how the single market influenced habits and at least partially rewired Britons’ expectations. The Daily Mail recently published a pictorial guide to dealing with Brexit-related food disruption. Pizza, brie and avocado could be replaced by chips, toast and mutton, it suggested. The Christmas Eve Brexit deal spares Britain hefty tariffs on food imports but new barriers and costs could reduce the year-round availability of certain foods and make them more expensive. The Mail’s much-mocked food chart was an even more useful reminder of the socio-gastronomic transformation that EU membership delivered to Britain. The shift in food quality and the democratisation of Britain’s food culture has been “staggering”, says Tim Lang, a professor of food policy at City, University of London. Food, he says, has been a symbol of European integration ever since the common agricultural policy (CAP) was founded to banish the memory of wartime starvation.
In 1973, the ONS retail price index reflected the pre-common-market British palate: that year’s representative shopping basket included mutton, Smash instant mashed potatoes and tinned corned beef. Olive oil may have been on the tables of the Elizabeth David-reading English middle classes, but most people cooked with lard. Wine didn’t figure even in 1977: sky-high tariffs put anything more than the occasional bottle of Blue Nun out of most people’s price range. We can partly blame EU agricultural policy for the disappearance of traditional fruit varieties but British supermarkets found it cheaper to import granny smith or golden delicious apples, Dutch-grown tomatoes and Spanish strawberries at the volumes British customers had started to demand. Muesli, ground coffee, pitta bread, fromage frais, riesling and pesto all joined the ONS shopping basket between 1980 and 2000. “The Europeanisation of the British diet is something even Brexiters have to acknowledge,” says Lang. “Mediterranean foods and pizza-eating cafe culture used to be for the British elite. That completely changed and it is remarkable.” In 1988, domestically produced food accounted for 66% of all food sold in Britain. Today, the figure has fallen to 50% while more than 60% of the UK’s fresh food is imported from the EU. For dairy products, the EU is almost the sole supplier.
Post-Brexit, the nutritional range could narrow for poorer British families and as a House of Lords select committee report warned, food inequality could widen with those who can afford it still able to buy high quality local fresh produce. A tightly woven “highly Europeanised” ecosystem of food safety oversight, meanwhile, evolved to protect consumers, which necessarily deepened integration between EU governments, says Lang. “If there is contamination in a tin of tomatoes in Italy every member state is alerted simultaneously.” Less palatable, he says, is the concentration of giant food manufacturers – which account for half of all European food sales – and the power of a few big retail corporations. Not only have they shaped the food system, they also make “taking back control” a challenge. “The single market allowed that process to accelerate,” says Lang. “Tesco, Carrefour, Aldi and Lidl were able to go everywhere and they have done so.”
Households also reflect the UK taste revolution that coincided with seamless trade. Terence Conran brought the first “continental quilts” to Britain from Sweden in the 1960s with their promise of uncluttered easy living. Duvets, used on the continent for a century before that, weren’t in the ONS British shopping basket until the early 80s. A few years later, Brits were being sold flatpack modernism and the Scandinavian dream, with the arrival in the UK of the first Ikea store. In driving down prices, and making linguistic differences irrelevant – although another legacy of Britain’s membership is English as a lingua franca – the single market, with its network of consumer protection laws helped to turbo-charge a consumer revolution. “It might have happened without EU membership but not at the same pace,” Crafts says. “You expect, with greater integration, that relative prices become similar and that affects consumption.” A broadening of horizons The soft power of the single market reshaped the culture in other ways. A Milan to Paris airfare cost the equivalent of at least €400 in 1992. Between 1993 and 1997, the EU liberalised aviation. Enter no-frills Ryanair, initially in the UK and Irish markets, now Europe’s biggest airline. Cheaper travel has been a mixed blessing for weekend hen and stag do destinations, and disastrous for the climate. But another genie was out of the bottle: air traffic in the EU trebled in the first 20 years of the single market. Trips within the EU accounted for most British holiday travel in 2019.
A “symbiotic” relationship grew, too, between budget air fares and another British institution, says Simon Chadwick, a professor of Eurasian sport at Emlyon Business School in France. Football fans didn’t historically travel in big numbers to continental games, but from the late-1990s, La Liga, Serie A and Bundesliga entered the collective vocabulary as short-haul football tourism exploded. “Europeanisation has been built through football,” says Chadwick. In 1995, a seminal European court of justice verdict revolutionised the hiring and transfer of EU players by insisting on their freedom to work in any member state. Football, it turned out, was also governed by the single market. The Bosman ruling kicked off a new era. The Italian player Fabrizio Ravanelli caused a sensation by quitting Juventus for Middlesbrough weeks after his club won the 1996 Champions League. Players, managers, coaches and staff at all levels of the game flocked to the UK. European mainland fans arrived too, fuelling a football economy for Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and other UK cities. “Fast forward 20 years, the psyche of English fans had changed,” says Chadwick. “We don’t talk now about ‘foreign players’ ,they are just players.” Wenger, Klopp and Guardiola have become household names. “People just accepted their style and approach to the game as part of the culture of English football. Many people are not aware that this exchange is part of freedom of movement within the EU.”
Brexit makes signing EU players by Premier League clubs more cumbersome with points-based work permits now required. Young English footballers such as Jude Bellingham, who plays for Borussia Dortmund, may find doors closing to them. The single market has allowed the proliferation of football broadcasting rights and any free trade impediments created by Brexit could also undermine the lucrative nature of Premier League TV deals with EU countries, says Chadwick, especially as services are not covered by the Johnson government’s deal with the EU. The Premier League’s most lucrative overseas deal, for example, is with Scandinavian EU member states. Free trade difficulties could also have an impact on Uefa’s marketing of broadcast rights, both across Europe and elsewhere in the world. “We take a lot for granted but we are on the cusp of something different,” says Chadwick. “Football is so deeply embedded in the life of the nation that people don’t realise what they have, or what they might lose.” The EU is today far more than the marketplace Thatcher helped to craft. It has a single currency, legally binding environmental standards, worker protections, social policies, a budgetary policy that attempts to level out regional disparities and a human rights charter. Its critics say the pandemic and the need for a green recovery should be the impetus for a more progressive, less “Anglo-Saxon” EU political economy to emerge. Will the same realities drive the UK’s direction, or will the conscious repudiation of a European identity built on seamless trade and integration become tangible? Perhaps, as the Lithuanian novelist and historian Kristina Sabaliauskaitė predicted, the moment that Britain starts to experience life outside the EU is the moment it learns “with a shock, how very European it was after all”."
2021-01-01T07:00:03Z,politics,Politics,"Fear, mistrust – and hope: Britain's long walk away from the EU","As a previous Tory prime minister trying to find his way through difficult times once said: this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning. Brexit is hardly complete. The last-minute nature of the UK’s trade deal with the EU and the fact that it barely covers whole swaths of the economy – financial services are a good example – means some negotiations will have to grind on. The new bodies set up to arbitrate between the two sides will soon have work to do. Northern Ireland remains part of the single market for goods and will be enforcing EU customs rules, the most vivid example of the deal’s contorted provisions, which may have no end of political consequences. Certainly, given that public opinion in Scotland now suggests unprecedented levels of support for independence and that elections to the Scottish parliament will take place in May, what Brexit means for the increasingly fragile union between the UK’s four countries will now start to become clearer. Over the past week, the British government and its cheerleaders have implied that in averting a no-deal exit, we have avoided all the chaos and disruption that would have come with it. But this is not exactly the view of people at the sharp end. After the deal was announced, I spoke to Rob Hollyman, the director of a haulage firm based in Purfleet in Essex, which in normal times would be doing 25 runs a week to the continent, transporting prepackaged “non-essential foodstuffs” back to the UK via the port of Dover and the Eurotunnel. “Deal or no-deal makes very little difference to where we’ll be on 1 January,” he said. He and his drivers still do not know how long new export and customs clearances for loads from Britain will take in EU countries, and what that will mean for queues of lorries on the UK side of the English channel. The worst-case scenario of the government’s border and protocol delivery group, let us not forget, involves queues of 7,000 lorries in Kent; to put that in perspective, the recent chaos when France closed its border to hauliers coming in from the UK involved half that number.
“Is it going to take minutes, or hours, or days?” Hollyman said. “The general sense is that it’s going to be chaotic for … a period. But we don’t know how long that will last.” The practicalities of Britain’s exit from the EU, then, remain full of uncertainty. Besides, proclaiming the first day of 2021 as some shining new dawn hardly suits our current reality. With the Covid pandemic reaching new peaks, hospitals reaching breaking point and most of the UK adjusting to life under increasingly stifling restrictions, this is hardly an occasion for union jack bunting and tributes to the bulldog spirit. But we should not underestimate today’s bracing significance. Our step away from the EU confirms that any idea of Britain as a country with an essentially European destiny is over, for a generation at least. The UK’s institutional arrangements are now in line with the vision of Britain that narrowly won the 2016 referendum – what Brexiters see as a proudly sovereign country, and their adversaries malign as an inward-looking, crabby place, eternally fixated on its past. If you ever had a hopeful vision of a UK that might be liberated from its history, culturally vibrant, and at last fully European (you can find it in some early Tony Blair speeches – he believed we could somehow be “a young country”), this is a moment of undeniable sadness. And there is another, even more profound reason to mourn, lost amid all that recent talk about fish species and lorry parks. What became the EU was, at heart, a response to centuries of conflict, and two wars in the 20th century whose aftershocks have still to die down. In eventually joining, the UK served notice that, whatever its innate scepticism, its people and politicians just about understood that close mutual ties were the best means of maintaining peace and stability. But after 47 years of membership and an often surreal period of politics, we are walking away. What is perhaps most mind-boggling is how unlikely this would once have seemed. Twenty or so years ago, I can recall driving around the country to interview an assortment of people who wanted Britain to leave the EU: maverick Tory backbenchers, pamphleteers, eccentric academics. At a social event in Blackpool organised by the UK Independence party’s north-west branch, I listened to long soliloquies about secret plots to end parliamentary democracy, before being asked to draw the raffle, and handing the winner a banana plant. This was a reference to the briefly famous “metric martyr” Steve Thoburn, a market trader from Sunderland who had refused to sell fruit and veg in the metric units as required by an EU directive, and been taken to court by his local council.
Back then, it was still de rigueur to write about stories like these in a tone of gentle mockery. But what people like me didn’t realise was how much hostility to Britain’s membership of the EU had already permeated the culture. As the writer and Guardian columnist Hugo Young had pointed out, British discourse about Europe “seldom moved beyond the narrow modes of complaint, lecture and demand”. Tory Euroscepticism was edging towards support for a clean break. The rightwing press was now a monolithic source of hostility to the imagined monsters collapsed into the word “Brussels”, amplifying the voices of people who – to quote a 1988 article in the Sun – had “no desire whatsoever to become politically involved with foreigners with whom we have nothing in common”. Even Blair, hailed as the first truly European British prime minister, would sometimes play to the Eurosceptic gallery (“I will have no truck with a European superstate – if there are moves to create that dragon, I will slay it,” he once told Sun readers), and was fond of expressing British exceptionalism: “Not for us the malaise of France or the angst of Germany,” he said in 2005. Anti-EU prejudices had long since gripped the kind of voters who leaned Tory, and expressed their antipathy towards the EU from a position of relative affluence. But in 2016, that alone would not have been enough bring the leave side victory and set off the fitful chain of events that led to today. What made the difference was the mistrust and resentment sown by 35 years of rising insecurity and inequality, the effects of austerity, and the way that many people’s anger and dismay was focused on immigration. In 1998, Young said it was doubtful whether Euroscepticism had “any special connection with some embittered, unrepresented, forcibly silent majority”. But as the decade that began in 2010 rolled on, this was roughly what the forces behind Brexit pulled off. For six years, as I worked with my colleague John Domokos on the Guardian’s video series Anywhere But Westminster, I heard endless voices following much the same script, all over England and Wales (in Scotland they were noticeably thinner on the ground). Just before the referendum, I was in Southway, a somewhat pinched housing development on the northern edge of Plymouth. A man in a red hatchback saw we had a camera, rolled down his window and let rip. “This country’s dying on its knees, right?” he said. “I’d come out of the common market. I’d come out of the European court of human rights. I’d cut overseas aid. I’d abolish the licence fee. I’d kick out all the illegal immigrants. I’d sort out health, education, transport, defence, law and order.”
A month or so later, I visited Kidsgrove, near Stoke-on-Trent. I was with the local Labour MP, Ruth Smeeth, and 20 or so Labour activists who were knocking on doors and trying to persuade people to back remain. The fact that I had been invited along proved that they had no idea what was about to hit them. When it did, it was sometimes shrill, and ugly – but in retrospect, this was the sound of the country’s subsequent course being set. Of 24 households they canvassed in 30 short minutes, 23 were voting leave; in 2019, all three of Stoke’s parliamentary seats were won by the Tories. “We want to be British,” said one woman. “We want our government to run our country, not someone we’ve not elected in another bloody country. And that’s it. I want my country back. I’m scared for my country. Scared.”
Some people were indeed scared. If they expressed fears about immigration, it was often impossible to separate their anxieties from worries about housing, work and the effects on their immediate environment of the cuts. But equally, time spent in any town or city would usually uncover a smattering of obvious racists and bigots. And whether their opinions were expressed hesitantly or with full force, some people’s readiness to make sweeping judgments about people from other cultures and countries seemed to be plumbing new depths – not least when it came to new arrivals from the key countries that had joined the EU in 2004: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia. In 2013, I spent time in Peterborough, a growing city in the east of England whose large Polish population and Eurosceptic Tory MP seemed to make it a perfect place to explore where the country might be heading. “There’s too many people in the country [for us] to cope, to be honest,” one man told me. “Turf ’em out. Turf as many out as they can. Not in a bad way; I’m not a racist of any sort. But if they turf ’em out, we’ll all be better off.” He was mixed race. Occasionally, it started to feel as if a certain unease about immigration had become a strange token of integration: no longer the sole preserve of the irate white men who would soon be known as “gammon”, but beyond the progressive middle class, something that felt discomfitingly universal. Yet who were the people so many had decided should not have come here? The story of people from the so-called accession countries was the same essential story of newcomers to Britain down the ages. In Peterborough and the parts of eastern England that extended from Norfolk to Lincolnshire, thousands had arrived from eastern and central Europe and stoically taken jobs as shelf-stackers, crop-pickers and warehouse workers, often working impossible hours for woefully poor wages, and ensuring that large swathes of the consumer economy ticked over. Even if such towns as Wisbech and Boston often felt divided and uneasy, the children of Poles, Latvians and Lithuanians had enrolled at local schools, and begin to develop new hybrid identities. Among the people I met who had progressed to being managers, supervisors and homeowners, there seemed to be more faith in this country’s openings for the upwardly mobile than you would find among most British people. The fact that so many voters then opted to slam the door still seems grim, not least in the age of warm tributes to “key workers”. But the anti-immigrant rhetoric and sentiment that cohered around Brexit are now embodied in even more legislation. The new Immigration Act comes into force on 1 January , and replaces free movement with a points-based system that looks like it may drastically affect care work, warehousing, agriculture, food processing, and more: another likely source of problems that will soon start to reveal themselves.
All this may suggest that Brexit was almost entirely reducible to a great spasm of nastiness and loathing, something that suits an age of political polarisation. But we should not forget that, whatever else swirled around the referendum, votes for leaving the EU were also founded in optimism and hope – something brought home to me by a visit in March 2019 to Wigan in Greater Manchester, where 64% of local voters had backed Brexit and the intervening three years hardly seemed to have changed anyone’s opinion. On a cold Wednesday morning, I had a long conversation with Ian, an Amazon driver, who was beginning to wonder if Brexit would ever happen. “We voted out,” he said. “To get out and repair the country … They’ve done a lot of damage in the last few years, our government. They always do. They need to pay a bit more attention to what we need. Provide the money for policing, the NHS … Let’s bring it back, [and] build this country up again.” To all intents and purposes, this is the same vision of post-Brexit “levelling up” that will be at the heart of the immediate political future.
While I was there, I also met Charlie Dale, who was doing voluntary work at a local food project, having recently lost his job as a team leader with Asda. He was on universal credit, and regularly down to his last pennies. He told me he had voted leave, and would do so again. “Hopefully, we can get some jobs back in,” he said. When I said that Brexit was surely likely to make the country poorer, he replied without missing a beat: “How can I be poorer?” We met again six months later, when taking a job on zero-hours contract that delivered precious little work had worsened his predicament. He was living on soup and powdered milk and facing eviction, and had taken to staying in his house all day to preserve calories. On the TV in his ground-floor flat, Sky News was showing increasingly ugly demonstrations outside parliament as Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement once again hit the skids. In some inarticulable way, the noise and discord on the TV seemed to be of a piece with the impossibility of his day-to-day existence. “I think somebody’s going to get killed,” he said. “I wanted to leave, but the leave I wanted has been twisted.” Gesturing at the TV, he said that if he was asked again, he would vote remain, “just for all this to stop”. Four days after Christmas, I spoke to Charlie again. Since we last met, his lot had improved; he had a job with a local firm making ready meals, and had recently gone back to work after months of being furloughed. The government’s record on the pandemic and Boris Johnson’s leadership style, he said, had sustained his sense of regret about voting for Brexit, and the trade deal had not changed his mind. “I think Boris has been stitched up, with everything being decided at the last minute,” he said. “I don’t think the EU’s going to make it any easier for us. We’re in for a tricky year, aren’t we?”"
2021-01-01T06:05:49Z,politics,Politics,First lorries cross into France as Britain and Europe wake to new Brexit reality,"Moments after the UK left the EU with an 11th-hour deal, the first trucks hauling goods across the new customs border presented their clearance documents to French agents before loading on to a train to pass through the Eurotunnel. With Britain having finally quit the EU single market and customs union, there were no early signs of feared chaos at the border in the first hours of 1 January 2021. Ivanov Shumeykov was the first driver processed by officials late on New Yearâ€™s Eve. He smiled and waved as his HGV went through Eurotunnel controls in Folkestone, Kent just after 11pm. The first arrivals on the shuttle from France following the end of the Brexit transition period were expected at around 12.23am.
Scenes in Dover have been quiet as many hauliers have been staying away to avoid being the first to test new border controls. Freight flows through the Eurotunnelâ€™s Calais terminal were extremely light in the early hours of Friday morning. Yann Leriche, chief executive of Getlink which operates the Eurotunnel, told Reuters tweaks to customs procedures might be necessary but that there would be no chaos in the weeks ahead. But Matt Smith, managing director of HSF Logistics, which ships mainly fresh meat and chilled goods between Britain and Europe, said the new post-Brexit customs systems and paperwork were largely untested. â€œWeâ€™re not too sure to be honest, it seems to be a bit of a headache,â€� he told AFP. â€œThereâ€™ll be delays along the line at some stage.â€�
British and European businesses have warned of carnage as they learn to navigate a wall of red tape and paperwork that threatens to disrupt the smooth flow of nearly â‚¬1tn in annual trade. The Brexit transition periodâ€™s end still leaves Northern Ireland remaining in the EU single market for goods. Northern Ireland will also apply the blocâ€™s customs rules at its ports, even though the region is still part of the UK customs territory, to prevent the return of a hard border with the Irish Republic. To avoid disrupting cross-border trade and a return of checkpoints along the politically sensitive Irish border, the EU and UK agreed to move new regulatory and customs processes to the Irish Sea. That means checks are focused on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Many hauliers based in Northern Ireland will keep volumes light for the first few days of 2021 as they wait to see what the impact will be, industry figures have said. While the UK formally departed the EU at the end of January 2020, a transition period meant almost all tangible changes were deferred â€“ until now. From Friday morning, individuals and businesses both in the UK and beyond face a dizzying new array of red tape, a good deal of it still to be confirmed, covering everything from travel, residency, work and tourism, to the supply of goods and services. Considerable government anxiety remains focused on the situation at the Channel ports in Kent, particularly after Covid-related delays earlier in December saw thousands of lorries backed up at a disused airfield â€“ one of 10 sites prepared for possible Brexit-caused disruption. Officials are hopeful of a smooth start to the new era but are braced for possible delays next week, with government estimates suggesting that more than half of smaller businesses have not yet prepared for the end of the free movement of goods and services. Boris Johnson largely ignored Brexit in his New Year message to focus on the Covid-19 pandemic instead, heralding the end of a year â€œin which the government was forced to tell people how to live their lives, how long to wash their hands, how many households could meet togetherâ€�. But he did say that the UK had â€œfreedom in our handsâ€� and the ability to do things â€œdifferently and betterâ€� now the long Brexit process was over. On Thursday night French President Emmanuel Macron said the UK remained a â€œfriend and allyâ€�. As the clock struck midnight in the UK, Scotlandâ€™s pro-independence first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, tweeted: â€œScotland will be back soon, Europe. Keep the light on.â€�
Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who played a key role in the 2016 Brexit referendum, revelled in the milestone, writing: â€œ25 years ago they all laughed at me. Well, theyâ€™re not laughing now.â€�
In a video message, Farage said, â€œThis is a moment to celebrate: 2021 as an independent United Kingdom. Cheers!â€� before leaning into the camera and saying conspiratorially: â€œShame the pubs arenâ€™t open.â€�
Thursday night marked the end of many previous freedoms for British individuals and businesses, even to the extent of restricting where freight drivers can travel within the UK. To mitigate against the buildup of lorries at Channel ports, hauliers now need what is called a Kent access permit, or â€œkermitâ€� for short, to even enter the county. From Friday, those without the 24-hour pass can be pulled over by government officers, fined Â£300, and sent back. One issue left unresolved in the trade deal, agreed between Johnson and the EU on Christmas Eve and voted into law by parliament on Wednesday, has been partially settled. A last-minute agreement between the UK government and Spain will allow Gibraltarians to move freely between the British overseas territory and the EU â€“ but the agreement will only come into force later in the year."
2021-01-01T06:00:02Z,politics,Politics,'We feel in a bit of a no man’s land': Brexit brings mixed feelings in Trowbridge,"As the UK’s departure from the EU loomed, Alex Joll, who runs the Free Range Cafe in Trowbridge’s grand old town hall, thought he had better stockpile one of his key products. “It’s quite random,” he said. “Our coffee comes from Peru, but is stored in a huge warehouse in Germany before coming to the UK, where it is roasted. I thought I’d better stock up just in case. I got in an extra month’s worth a little while ago to tide us over just in case.”
Joll voted for Brexit. “For all sorts of reasons, really. I don’t think the EU was the right institution for the UK to operate in. I’ve lived in France and Spain and am married to a Spanish woman. I think they’ll let us back in when we want to go. It was time for a change.” Ben Laver, 18, who was doing a shift at the cafe, was too young to vote in the EU referendum. He would have plumped for remain. “As a young person, the economic insecurity of leaving the EU is concerning. I don’t think all that was promised – the extra money for the NHS, all the fishing rights – has come to fruition.”
Laver is a member of an alt-rock band called Enter Red. He worries that the departure from the EU will make it harder for his band, which tours the south-west of England, to venture overseas. “Usually you get the cheapest plane ticket, sleep where you can and then dash home. Paying hundreds of pounds for visas may not make it viable for us.” A majority of people who live in Wiltshire – 52.5% – voted for leave. With hours to go before the UK’s final exit, there was no sense of jubilation in the county town of Trowbridge. And for many people, there was a bit of extra work to be done, more rules to read.
Sam Rose, a director of a recruitment company, was to be found ploughing through regulations trying to work out how the changes would affect her business. “We feel in a bit of a no man’s land at the moment,” she said. Her company provides labour for many of the factories, workshops and food-processing plants on the industrial estates on the outskirts of Trowbridge. For years, a steady stream of workers from eastern Europe has arrived here.
“That has been slowing down,” Rose said. Because coronavirus has led to more British people losing their jobs, there is no shortage of labour at the moment. “But we don’t know whether that will change.” Some of the factories for which she supplies labour are reporting concerns that their supply chains with Europe will be impacted. “That could have a knock-on effect on us,” she said. Trowbridge has long attracted people from across the globe. It has large Italian and Moroccan communities and is twinned with the Moroccan city of Oujda. Serkan Ozturk, who is of Turkish origin, set up a fruit and veg shop in the centre of the town in the summer, a bold venture in the time of Covid. “It has been hard,” he said. Now he is a little worried that Brexit could lead to an increase in the price of his fruit. “But I think Brexit will be good for the UK in the end,” he said. Wiltshire’s farmers are not so sure. Nick Bush has an arable and sheep farm north of Trowbridge. He is pleased that there is a deal, but says it is just the start, rather than the end, of the next chapter for British agriculture.
“The fact we have a deal is a good starting point,” Bush said. But he worries that there still could be “hitches” at the borders and is keen to know more about the new environmental land management (ELM) scheme, which will largely replace schemes that have been available under the common agricultural policy. Farmers will not remain quiet if things do not work out. “I like the fact that the government now has to answer more directly to farmers,” said Bush. “They can’t hide behind the EU and say it’s their fault now.” The leader of Trowbridge town council, Stewart Palmen, is sad at the departure from the EU. A Liberal Democrat, he campaigned for remain and for a second referendum.
“What worries me is the ‘little Britain’ attitude. I see us as just being part of the world. My father’s Finnish and I’ve always classed myself as European. Today I’m angry about my citizenship being taken away and my identity being restricted.” His Tory counterpart on the council, Antonio Piazza, also voted for remain but said the deal was a “huge relief”. “I think people are ready for a fresh start, to get on with our lives and think about the positives, such as the new trade deals and relationships with other countries.” Piazza’s family has paperwork to do. His father, Onofrio, a barber in the town, came to the south-west of England from Italy in the 1970s and settled but still has Italian citizenship. “He has a form to complete to stay in the UK,” said Piazza. “But that shouldn’t be complicated.” Piazza said he loved the multiculturalism of Trowbridge. “That won’t change. It is possible to leave the EU and still love Europe.”"
2021-01-01T00:53:18Z,politics,Politics,"'Keep the light on': joy for some, regret for others at Brexit endgame","Politicians in Britain and the EU have expressed triumph while others voiced bitter regret after the UKâ€™s Brexit transition period ended on Thursday night. Britain left the European blocâ€™s vast single market for goods, services and the movement of people at 11pm GMT on New Yearâ€™s Eve â€“ midnight in Brussels â€“ completing the biggest single economic change the country has experienced since the second world war. For some, including the prime minister, it was moment of pride. Boris Johnson said the UK was now â€œfree to do trade deals around the world, and free to turbocharge our ambition to be a science superpowerâ€�. But in Scotland, which voted strongly in the 2016 Brexit referendum to remain, the pro-independence first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, tweeted: â€œScotland will be back soon, Europe. Keep the light on.â€�
The former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who played a key role in the 2016 Brexit referendum, tweeted: â€œ25 years ago they all laughed at me. Well, theyâ€™re not laughing now.â€�
He also wrote: â€œThis is a big moment for our country, a giant leap forward. Time to raise a glass. BrexitAtLast.â€� The UKâ€™s chief Brexit negotiator, Lord Frost, said the UK had a â€œgreat future before usâ€� with the chance to â€œbuild a better country for us allâ€�.
The Conservative MP Bill Cash, who has campaigned for Brexit for decades, said it was a â€œvictory for democracy and sovereignty.â€� On Friday morning, anti-Brexit Labour peer and former Transport minister Andrew Adonis said: â€œThe very first day of Brexit is a massive rupture of the UKâ€�.
Across the Channel the view was different. In his new yearâ€™s address, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, expressed regret. â€œThe United Kingdom remains our neighbour but also our friend and ally,â€� he said. â€œThis choice of leaving Europe, this Brexit, was the child of European malaise and lots of lies and false promises.â€� The divorce could also have major constitutional repercussions for the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland, which shares a border with EU member the Republic of Ireland, remains more closely tied to the blocâ€™s economy under the divorce terms, a status some fear could pull it away from the rest of the UK. Many in Britain felt apprehension about Brexit taking place during a pandemic that has upended life around the world. â€œI feel very sad that weâ€™re leaving,â€� said Jen Pearcy-Edwards, a film-maker in London. â€œI think that Covid has overshadowed everything that is going on. But I think the other thing that has happened is that people feel a bigger sense of community, and I think that makes it even sadder that weâ€™re breaking up our community a bit, by leaving our neighbours in Europe. â€œIâ€™m hopeful that we find other ways to rebuild ties.â€�"
2020-12-31T23:00:53Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit: in crisis, without fanfare, UK finally ends the EU era","Four years, 27 weeks and two days after a referendum that split the country almost down the middle, the UK left the EU’s orbit on Thursday night in a departure that was notably low key, and marked by warnings of likely disruption to come. In a sometimes sombre new year message, Boris Johnson largely ignored Brexit, an outcome he arguably shaped more than any other politician, to focus instead on the toll of Covid-19 and what he called “the grimness of 2020”. With the majority of England subject to tough restrictions, and hospitals warning of a calamitous winter coronavirus crisis in the weeks ahead, the chimes of Big Ben, temporarily reconnected from ongoing restoration work, sounded across near empty streets at 11pm. This was the pivotal moment for Brexit. While the UK formally departed the EU at the end of January 2020, a transition period meant almost all tangible changes were deferred – until now. From Friday morning, individuals and businesses both in the UK and beyond face a dizzying new array of red tape, a good deal of it still to be confirmed, covering everything from travel, residency, work and tourism, to the supply of goods and services. Considerable government anxiety remains focused on the situation at the Channel ports in Kent, particularly after Covid-related delays earlier in December saw thousands of lorries backed up at a disused airfield – one of 10 sites prepared for possible Brexit-caused disruption. The moment of Brexit passed without ceremony in Dover. The town had a ghost-like quality, Covid emptying it of new year’s celebrations, as it approached 11pm with half a dozen trucks trying to make it over the line before the new trade barriers were erected. Greeted by two police officers, they were told the last ferry had departed at 9pm for France. Those who had evidence of a Covid-19 test in the last 72 hours were allowed through to the small lorry park at the port where they could sleep overnight before boarding the 7:40am ferry, the first voyage from Dover under new Brexit trading rules. Officials are hopeful of a smooth start to the new era but are braced for possible delays next week, with government estimates suggesting that more than half of smaller businesses have not yet prepared for the end of the free movement of goods and services. It all adds to a prime ministerial in-tray already overflowing with the impact of coronavirus, not least the government’s decision to defer the return to school of some pupils next week, and with Labour accusing the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, of “serial incompetence”. Johnson used much of his New Year message to herald the end of a year “in which the government was forced to tell people how to live their lives, how long to wash their hands, how many households could meet together”. It was a far cry from his 2019 message, where fresh from a crushing election victory, the prime minister promised “a fantastic year and a remarkable decade for our United Kingdom”. Johnson did maintain some of his trademark Brexit boosterism this time, arguing that the development of the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine was illustrative of a UK “free to do things differently, and if necessary better, than our friends in the EU”. “This is an amazing moment for this country,” Johnson said, citing what he said were boundless possibilities with trade and innovation. “We have our freedom in our hands and it is up to us to make the most of it.” The reality, at least in the short term, is that 11pm on Thursday marked the end of many previous freedoms for British individuals and businesses, even to the extent of restricting where freight drivers can travel within the UK. To mitigate the buildup of lorries at Channel ports, hauliers now need what is called a Kent access permit, or “kermit” for short, to even enter the county. From Friday, those without the 24-hour pass can be pulled over by government officers, fined £300, and sent back. However, one issue left unresolved in the trade deal, agreed between Johnson and the EU on Christmas Eve and voted into law by parliament on Wednesday, has been partially settled. A last-minute agreement between the UK government and Spain will allow Gibraltarians to move freely between the British overseas territory and the EU – but the agreement will only come into force later in the year. Spain’s foreign minister, Arancha González Laya, said she expected border controls, albeit lightly applied, to be required for the next six months to allow for the deal in principle to be formalised. Under the agreement, Gibraltar will be part of the EU’s Schengen free-travel zone. Checks will instead be undertaken at the Rock’s airport and ports by the EU’s Frontex border agency, a point of contention in talks with the British government. Dominic Raab, the UK foreign secretary, said: “All sides are committed to mitigating the effects of the end of the transition period on Gibraltar, and in particular [to] ensure border fluidity, which is clearly in the best interests of the people living on both sides. We remain steadfast in our support for Gibraltar and its sovereignty.” Spain has refused to allow the post-Brexit trade and security deal to be applied to Gibraltar, over which it has a territorial claim. The head of Gibraltar’s government, Fabian Picardo, said: “There will be complexity to come … we may end up with a deal on the [free] movement of people but not goods.” Northern Ireland will similarly see a more phased-in approach to the post-Brexit world, with the requirement for customs declarations when retailers in Great Britain send goods to non-business customers in Northern Ireland deferred for three months. With Northern Ireland remaining under the rules of the EU’s single market and customs union, animal-based food products shipped there from the rest of the UK will also require export health certificates from April."

2020-12-31T19:50:56Z,politics,Politics,"Dover eerily quiet on Brexit eve, but hauliers fear more chaos","After a week of mayhem, the roads of Kent are eerily deserted, almost devoid of freight traffic as lorry drivers from all over the EU avoid Dover and the Eurotunnel as the Brexit transition period ends. The only reminder of the potential for Brexit chaos are the miles and miles of detritus – plastic bottles, shopping bags, and even towels – strewn along the banks of the southbound M20 motorway to the cliffs of Dover. The government modelled plans for up to 7,000 lorries stuck in Kent in the wake of Brexit trade barriers going up at 11pm on the EU side of the channel. But all the evidence suggests importers have done their stockpiling and will be avoiding the port as the UK’s 30-year membership of the single market abruptly ends. Just a trickle of lorries entered the Eurotunnel, and there seemed to be fewer than a handful heading to Dover early on Thursday evening. Eurotunnel said traffic was usually quiet around new year; it was exceptionally so this year because so many importers had rushed to bring supplies in before 1 January, hence the heightened levels of traffic brought to a halt when the French slapped a Covid travel ban on freight just before Christmas.
Rod McKenzie, policy director at the Road Haulage Association (RHA), said: “I don’t think we will start to see things getting back to normal levels of traffic until the second week in January. Even then I think the real chaos is going to be invisible chaos. “People don’t know what paperwork they have to fill in, haven’t dealt with customs declarations before, and if they don’t get that filled in properly, they don’t get the Kent access permit to travel into the county, so they will be stuck at depots and distribution centres around the country.” The Kent access permit, KAP, or “Kermit” as it has been dubbed, is mandatory for all drivers wanting to cross the Channel after 11pm on 31 December. Officials said that so far only about 450 of these 24-hour permits had been issued. The slow take-up was feeding fears that there could be a partial repeat of the pre-Christmas chaos with lorries halted or told to turn back if they do not have the Brexit passport in the coming weeks. Drivers without a permit could be pulled over by the Driver and Vehicles Standards Agency using automatic number plate recognition and potentially fined £300, the officials said. The concerns have been echoed by the RHA, with estimates that 50% or more of small- to medium-sized companies might not be ready for the border checks, which could raise the prospect of chaos later in January as supply chains become forced out of Brexit hibernation. In Ashford, just a few miles north of Dover, the hum of construction continues into the night on the 66-acre lorry park destined to be a holding pen for more than 1,000 vehicles.
Many people in the area are mourning the loss of the fields and their environmental benefits. “The downs on the left and the vale on the right – you could walk right through to Mersham village. It was lovely to do on a summer’s evening, but obviously the government had other ideas,” said Hugh Tyman, who was walking his dog, Willow, at a small housing estate on the other side of a dual carriageway separating residents from the lorry park. Did he vote to leave the EU? “I did support it, but we weren’t told enough about how it would work by the politicians. Now they’ve done the deal and we don’t know the ins and outs of it either. I probably wouldn’t vote for it now that I know about all the paperwork, and the travel rules changing,” he said. Another local in a country cottage on a former rural lane shouldering the vast site was also upset and said she hoped to get compensation. “My daughter grew up looking over cornfields,” she said. “There is just a constant drone of generators and it won’t stop after construction because the refrigerator lorries will have their generators on all night. The construction workers had four days off over Christmas –it was just lovely.” Down the road, John Lang and his wife, Cherylynn, thought they had bought a rural idyll to retire to when the Guardian first told them about the government acquisition in July. Like the rest of the residents, they said, there was no warning or consultation on the lorry park. They lost their 360-degree view of farmland and now look out on a pine-yellow four-metre-high perimeter fence at two sides of their house. “It’s like living in a compound, it’s hideous,” said Cherylynn. John voted for Brexit and said he was optimistic about the future but did not think it would do much for Kent, which voted to leave the EU. “I can’t see what the benefit for us here in Kent is,” he said. He said that lorries were now accidentally coming down his country lane “because the postcode is the same as the lorry park”. He hoped ultimately it would be sorted out.
Stewart Wickham, a bus driver, was delighted that a trade deal had been reached because it meant the international driver permit lottery would no longer threaten his livelihood. “I’ve just taken the GB hockey team over to Brussels and Amsterdam, and next week we find out if we are taking to them to their winter training ground in Malaga. If there wasn’t a deal, I wouldn’t have been able to do that,” he said."

2020-12-31T15:02:57Z,politics,Politics,Tampon tax: government axes VAT on sanitary products,"The tampon tax has been abolished after the government honoured its March commitment to remove VAT on women’s sanitary products. But the campaigner who played a pivotal role in the drive to axe the tax has accused the government of using the issue as a political football, after politicians said it had been scrapped thanks to Brexit. Existing EU law prevented member states from reducing VAT below 5%. Laura Coryton, who started the Stop Taxing Periods campaign in May 2014 while a student at Goldsmiths, said the Brexit process had made it less likely that the tampon tax would be abolished throughout Europe. She said: “It is a day for celebration today, but it is just frustrating that the tampon tax is being used as a political football in terms of Brexit.” The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said he was “proud” the government had delivered on its promise, adding that it was providing free sanitary products in schools, colleges and hospitals. Speaking at Wednesday’s Brexit debate, Sir Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative chairman of the Commons liaison select committee, said: “We will be able to do things like abolish the tampon tax, which so many honourable ladies opposite railed against the government about, only because we’re leaving the EU.” Coryton said it was frustrating to hear the scrapping of the tax cited as a victory for Brexit, and hear little mention of the more than 320,000 people who had signed the petition, and campaigning MPs such as Labour’s Stella Creasy and the former Labour MP Paula Sherriff. “It’s great that the government is taking it really seriously – if the prime minister can talk about periods, surely anyone can talk about periods,” she said. “But it’s frustrating … to make this campaign into a pro-Brexit thing, because it doesn’t reflect the many different types of people who have been campaigning for it.”
Also, it’s not true, she said, adding that in 2016 – under pressure from the then prime minister, David Cameron, the European parliament had voted unanimously to start the regulatory process to allow any EU country to abolish any tampon tax. “That process has since gone cold, because we then left the EU and we were the ones pushing for it,” said Coryton. “So if anything, actually, Brexit has made it worse, because if we were to have stayed in the EU, then this piece of legislation would have gone through… then any EU member would be able to axe the tax, not just the UK.” In 2018 the European commission published proposals to change EU VAT rules, which could allow countries to axe the tampon tax in their countries, but it is yet to be agreed on by all member states. Since 2015 the £15m funds the tampon tax has raised in the UK have been directed to women’s refuges and domestic abuse charities. “The tampon tax has long been a symbol of policymaking based around men’s needs, so removing VAT is symbolically important,”’ said Mary-Ann Stephenson of the Women’s Budget Group. “But the tampon tax money has been an important source of funding for the women’s sector – the government needs to be clear about what will replace it.”"
