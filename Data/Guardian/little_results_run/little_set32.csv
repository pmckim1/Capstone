2015-07-09T17:54:43Z,global-development,Global development,Ethiopia courts scepticism after freeing imprisoned writers ahead of Obama visit,"After more than a year of imprisonment, two Ethiopian women had no idea they were about to be released until a prison loudspeaker informed them they were free to go. “They were kind of stunned. Can you imagine what kind of emotion? They didn’t believe it at first – they thought they were being taken somewhere else,” said a friend of Edom Kassaye, the freelance journalist who was released from Kality jail on Thursday morning along with another detainee, the Zone 9 blogger Mahlet Fantahun. Their release followed that of three others from the Zone 9 case on Wednesday after prosecutors dropped terrorism-related charges against five of the 10 suspects. The trial has attracted widespread condemnation, with human-rights advocates and western governments arguing the writers were persecuted solely for criticising an intolerant government. “The government should show this is only a first step toward releasing all political prisoners and opening up space for Ethiopians to voice dissent on a range of issues,” said Leslie Lefkow, deputy director of the Africa division at Human Rights Watch, adding that the suspects “shouldn’t have been imprisoned in the first place”. Many Ethiopian Facebook users believe the sudden concession is related to this month’s visit of President Barack Obama, the first to Africa’s second most populous country by a sitting US leader. While the US values its relationship with Ethiopia from a security perspective, praising the country’s development record, it also routinely criticises the government’s repression of civil rights. “It is funny how dictators are more accountable to Americans than to their own people and constitution,” wrote Kassahun Addis, an exiled journalist, in a Facebook post. “This looks like a pre-emptive charm offensive by the US and Ethiopian governments.” The charges alleged the group of critical bloggers and journalists had been plotting against the government with foreign organisations. Redwan Hussien, a government spokesman, put the releases down to “magnanimity” – an official recognition that the five writers released were only accomplices to the conspiracy. The trial against the rest would continue, he said. But Ameha Mekonnen, a defence lawyer for the suspects, countered on Thursday: “All were charged as principle offenders. There’s no distinction among them.” The pardoning of convicts occurs regularly in Ethiopia. Two Swedish journalists were shown clemency in 2012 after being jailed for supporting a rebel group in the Ogaden region of Ethiopia with which they became embedded. Birtukan Mideksa, meanwhile, the opposition leader who – in a case that attracted widespread condemnation – was twice jailed by the government, was also pardoned eventually. Over the course of court proceedings that have so far lasted more than a year, the state has failed to present any evidence of terrorism-related activity on the part of the bloggers and journalists. The prosecution case amounted to calling witnesses who had observed police making raids and confiscating evidence, such as laptops, in April 2014. “There was no witness who was there to say, ‘I saw this or that person being involved in this or that crime,’” said Ameha. Judges will decide at the next hearing, on 20 July – a week before Obama’s visit – whether the remaining suspects have to defend themselves or are acquitted, Ameha said. The idea that dropping the charges was politically calculated in advance of Obama’s visit was strengthened by the release on Thursday of another journalist, Reeyot Alemu. She headed home after serving around four years of a sentence that was reduce to five years from 14 on appeal in Aug. 2012. Reeyot had been imprisoned for plotting against the government after working with the US-based opposition website Ethiopian Review and writing articles critical of the government in local newspapers. Redwan said it is standard practice to release prisoners early. But an an acquaintance of the jailed journalists and bloggers, who wished to remain anonymous, suggested Reeyot had been told she would serve her full sentence after refusing to apologise for crimes she denied committing. Another factor in the decisions may have been that Ethiopia is hosting a critical UN financing for development conference next week. Global leaders will gather in Addis Ababa to try and agree on how to finance the ambitious sustainable development goals, which will set the international development agenda for the next 15 years. Ethiopian officials will be eager to deflect attention away from the jailed bloggers and towards the country’s record of economic growth and poverty reduction. The government will hope that donors who already deem Ethiopia worthy of development assistance will support a plan for carbon-neutral industrialisation by 2030.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/09/ethiopia-releases-imprisoned-writers-obama-visit-financing-for-development-addis,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jul/09/ethiopia-releases-imprisoned-writers-obama-visit-financing-for-development-addis
2015-07-09T12:23:50Z,global-development,Global development,Syrian refugees: four million people forced to flee as crisis deepens,"The conflict in Syria has now driven more than four million people – a sixth of the population – to seek sanctuary in neighbouring countries, making it the largest refugee crisis for a quarter of a century, according to the UN. On Thursday, the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said the total number of Syrian refugees in Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan, Egypt and other parts of north Africa stood at 4,013,000 people. With at least 7.6 million people forced from their homes within Syria, almost half the country’s people are either refugees or internally displaced. The conflict, now in its fifth year, has killed more than 220,000 people.
António Guterres, the UN high commissioner for refugees, said the exodus was the biggest refugee population from a single conflict in a generation and called on the international community to step up. He said: “It is a population that needs the support of the world but is instead living in dire conditions and sinking deeper into poverty. “Worsening conditions are driving growing numbers towards Europe and further afield, but the overwhelming majority remain in the region. We cannot afford to let them and the communities hosting them slide further into desperation.” Turkey is now the largest refugee-hosting country in the world, sheltering 1,805,255 Syrians. Lebanon has taken in 1,172,735 Syrian refugees, Jordan 629,128, Iraq 249,726 and Egypt 132,375. About 24,055 Syrians are refugees elsewhere in north Africa. The latest UN figures do not include the more than 270,000 Syrians applying for asylum in Europe, nor the thousands resettled from the region elsewhere.
The milestone of four million comes just 10 months after the number of Syrian refugees hit three million, and the UN predicts there will be 4.27 million in the region by the end of this year. At the end of 2014, one in every five displaced people worldwide was Syrian. Despite being the world’s single largest refugee crisis, the number of people fleeing is still far lower than the number of Afghans who were forced from their country following the Soviet withdrawal. According to the UNHCR, there were 6.3 million Afghans living in Pakistan and Iran in 1990.
The sheer number of Syrian refugees that have fled the war in their homeland is putting the international humanitarian system under huge financial strain. At the end of June, UN aid agencies warned that a $5.5bn (£3.6bn) appeal to tackle the Syrian refugee crisis this year was less than 25% funded, putting millions of vulnerable people at risk – a situation that has already led to cuts in vital assistance. Last week, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) warned once again that it was running out of money to feed the refugees and could be forced to cut all help for the hundreds of thousands of Syrians in Jordan as soon as next month. Muhannad Hadi, the WFP’s regional director for the Middle East, north Africa, central Asia and eastern Europe, said: “Just when we thought things couldn’t get worse, we are forced yet again to make yet more cuts. “Refugees were already struggling to cope with what little we could provide.” According to the agencies and their partner organisations, the shortfall has meant 1.6 million refugees have already had food assistance cut this year and 750,000 children are not attending school.
Most of Syria’s refugees have no prospect of returning home in the near future amid a conflict that has become increasingly complex and intractable. In the north and north-east, Kurdish militias are fighting Islamic State in see-saw battles that continue to drive civilians across the border into Turkey. Turkey’s reluctance to absorb more refugees often leaves people stranded for days at the border. In Aleppo and Daraa, two of Syria’s largest cities, rebels fighting the regime of the president, Bashar al-Assad, have pressed on with offensives that have encountered stiff resistance from loyalist troops, stalling the attacks. But even if they were to seize the coveted territory, or begin an assault on the capital, Damascus, the country would be faced with the collapse of state institutions and services as the opposition attempts to manage a large metropolis such as Aleppo under unforgiving air strikes. The regime’s collapse there would likely drive more refugees into neighbouring states, particularly Lebanon, where displaced Syrians already make up a fifth of the population, upsetting the delicate sectarian balance and stretching infrastructure past its breaking point. Lebanon has responded with increasingly stringent entry conditions. Assad’s government and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah are fighting to secure the border region that straddles the two countries after a series of defeats that exposed the growing fragility of the Syrian army. A recent global trends study by the UNHCR found that the level of worldwide displacement is higher than ever before, with a record 59.5 million people living exiled from their homes at the end of 2014. The UNHCR estimates that an average of 42,500 men, women and children became refugees, asylum seekers or internally displaced people every day last year – a fourfold increase in just four years. By the end of last year, there were 19.5 million refugees – more than half of them children – as well as 38.2 million internally displaced people and 1.8 million asylum seekers. With war, violence and persecution leaving one in every 122 humans on the planet a refugee, internally displaced or seeking asylum at the end of 2014, the UNHCR warned that the world was experiencing an “age of unprecedented mass displacement”. Decades of displacement According to UNHCR, there were 6.3 million Afghans living in Pakistan and Iran in 1990 following the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. The Bosnian war of 1992-1995 forced 2.7 million people to flee, making it it the largest displacement of people in Europe since the second world war. Following the Rwandan genocide in 1994, two million people fled to neighbouring countries. The refugees, who were mainly Hutus, sought refuge in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), Tanzania, Burundi and Uganda. In 1999, more than 867,000 people fled the war in Kosovo, most of them heading to Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia. The 2003 US invasion of Iraq and the violence that followed is estimated to have pushed about two million Iraqis into countries including Syria, Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/09/syria-refugees-4-million-people-flee-crisis-deepens,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jul/09/syria-refugees-4-million-people-flee-crisis-deepens
2015-07-09T11:38:50Z,global-development,Global development,South Sudanese refugees in Uganda receive generous welcome | Andrew Green,"When fighting broke out in December 2013 in South Sudan’s capital, Juba, it spread rapidly toward the country’s north-east – directly towards John Aleu’s home. He wanted no part of the conflict and hoped the remoteness of his village in northern Jonglei state would insulate him. But in September last year, a group of fighters came to steal his cattle. As he tried to spur the animals to flee, he was shot in the foot. It took his neighbours three days to carry him to the nearest hospital. His foot was saved, but he will never be able to walk without crutches again. By April he was well enough to travel, so together with his family he journeyed across the border to Uganda. “If I’m going back, I can’t feed my family,” he said. “I’m in need of something that can promote my life and my family’s life.” More than 150,000 South Sudanese have fled to Uganda since the fighting started, in part because the Ugandan government has one of the most generous refugee policies in the world. Once registered, new arrivals can move to permanent settlements – where they are given their own plot of land – rather than refugee camps. UN agencies provide food and resources to build a house. Schools and health centres are positioned nearby and refugees are encouraged to find jobs. “They have all the rights that are attributed to any human being, irrespective of their status as refugees,” said Titus Jogo, the government’s refugee desk officer for Adjumani district in northern Uganda, where Aleu is now living. It is all available to Aleu, but with one condition: he must abandon any ethnic animosity he still harbours.
South Sudan’s ongoing conflict grew out of a political dispute between President Salva Kiir and his former deputy, Riek Machar. Aleu accused Machar’s supporters of introducing an ethnic dimension, pitting the former deputy’s Nuer tribe against Kiir’s Dinka group, of which Aleu is a member. He believes he was deliberately targeted by Nuer fighters. Machar’s supporters have made similar allegations. And the UN has reported ethnically targeted killings and rapes by both sides. But Jogo said the Ugandan government will not tolerate any ethnically motivated violence. “We openly told them that we are receiving them as refugees from South Sudan in spite of their differences,” he said. “We want them to live together and forget whatever happened to them.” It is really the only option, because the government does not have the logistical capacity to sort people into sites based on ethnicity. And it has worked well, Jogo said. “I would actually like to invite Kiir and Machar to come to Adjumani to see how well they can live together.” The Alere resettlement site outside Adjumani, now more than two decades old, has been housing South Sudanese refugees longer than the country has existed. Members of more than a dozen South Sudanese tribes live in squat, circular mud huts that dot the hilly landscape. Peter Mamer Ayom settled in Alere in 2012 after a series of cattle raids in his village outside Bor, the Jonglei state capital. He was recently appointed as a community development worker, which means he is responsible for circulating within the community and sorting out any conflicts that arise. He said the refugees – including 800 recent arrivals – take the mandate to avoid ethnic tensions seriously. “We’re not thinking about all the fighting, which is happening from South Sudan,” he said. “We left all those things behind.” The only conflict he is concerned about is with the local community. There have been complaints from people living near the settlement sites that the South Sudanese are receiving unfair advantages. Though he is from Uganda, Johnson Emerson worked at a restaurant in South Sudan. He fled along with the refugees when the war started – and though he has access to the same markets and health centres, he still believes they “should not be welcomed” unless local Ugandans are given all the same services.
Despite some conflict between the two communities, Ayom said tensions have eased in recent months, allowing refugees to focus on building new lives – a process that diverts any energy they might spend on nursing grudges. While they are allowed to work, he said it is difficult to find jobs, which leaves refugees dependent on the monthly food rations distributed by the World Food Programme. Alongside the refugees from South Sudan, WFP is also supporting people displaced from Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At $5.5m (£357m) a month, it is the most expensive response in Uganda’s history according to acting country director Michael Dunford. In December, the agency was even briefly forced to cut rations when funding ran low, though Dunford said there is no current shortage. But the WFP’s work looks set to increase. Fighting continues in South Sudan, and almost 5 million people are facing acute food insecurity, which would result in more refugees heading for the border. Both Dunford and Jogo said they were prepared to welcome anybody who wants to come.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/09/south-sudanese-refugees-uganda-receive-generous-welcome,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jul/09/south-sudanese-refugees-uganda-receive-generous-welcome
2015-07-09T07:00:07Z,global-development,Global development,Ukraine crisis needs a political solution to reinforce EU aid efforts | Christos Stylianides,"There is a humanitarian crisis right on the doorstep of the EU. More than 2.2 million people have been forced to leave their homes because of the fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. As many as 900,000 have sought refuge in neighbouring countries. Last week, I visited eastern Ukraine for the second time this year to see for myself the impact of our humanitarian aid programmes on the lives of those affected, and to discuss the challenges ahead. One example of how the EU is helping vulnerable people in the crisis is through a cash-and-vouchers programme. While these schemes may be less visible than aid convoys, they can be far more efficient in responding to individual needs. In Kramatorsk, I met Julia, whose third child was born just a few months ago. Julia was forced to leave her home due to the conflict, and her husband has lost his job. The cash-and-vouchers scheme helps Julia to support her family, enabling her to buy food and to access clean water. Yet because of the ongoing fighting and road blockades, she cannot visit other relatives such as her grandmother, who lives in her hometown and also needs assistance. Hers was just one of the stories of personal struggle from the 5 million people estimated to be in need of assistance, according to the UNHCR, the UN refugee agency. Nearly two-thirds of them are particularly vulnerable, including children, the elderly and the disabled. So far, EU humanitarian aid has reached 1.5 million people thanks to great teamwork with our international partners. Most of those who have been helped are among the most vulnerable. But their ordeal is not over. Their lives are still blighted by uncertainty. On 1 July, the commission therefore decided to double its 2015 humanitarian budget for Ukraine by committing a further €15m (£10m). We will also launch a project under our EU children of peace programme to address the trauma of thousands of children in eastern Ukraine. All in all, the EU has provided more than €223m in immediate assistance to civilians affected by the conflict on both sides since early 2014. But more needs to be done. A UN appeal at the beginning of this year is so far only 35% funded. The international community needs to step up its assistance, and aid must be strictly needs-based, without any political agendas attached. That is how we can ensure that we reach the most vulnerable, regardless of the area they reside in. We are particularly concerned about the humanitarian situation in non-government controlled areas. The EU is providing assistance on both sides of the conflict line, and to refugees in neighbouring countries, including Belarus and Russia. Despite the ceasefire agreed in Minsk in February, fighting continues. The staff of EU-funded humanitarian organisations have come under fire while distributing assistance. This is unacceptable: our aid is always provided on the basis of humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence. The access to the non-government controlled areas in Ukraine’s Donbas is now more restricted, cutting people off from desperately needed assistance. This is why I reiterate my call on both sides to refrain from further fighting and to ensure unfettered and speedy access for internationally recognised humanitarian organisations. During consultations with the government, I received assurances that they will address our concerns about access across the frontlines. More than 1.3 million people have been displaced from the conflict areas in Donbass and Crimea. During my visit, I spoke to some of them and heard of their hopes. Many were receiving humanitarian aid but they needed support beyond emergency assistance to find houses, jobs, schools for their children and to access healthcare. We must look at how we can best support them together with the Ukrainian government. Solidarity is one of the cornerstones of the EU. Our humanitarian assistance demonstrates that we stand by the most vulnerable people affected by the conflict in Ukraine. Yet, as we know too well, humanitarian problems cannot have solely humanitarian solutions. This is why the EU is also deeply engaged in supporting the implementation of the Minsk agreements with a view to bringing about a sustainable solution that respects Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence as well as international law. We need a political solution and it must come urgently.

2015-07-08T15:00:14Z,global-development,Global development,Australia under pressure to boost aid spending on poorest countries,"Less than one-quarter of Australia’s aid money is going to the world’s poorest nations, new analysis by aid organisation One has revealed. About 22.7% of aid money goes to the least developed nations, with the Abbott government instead opting to focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Around 20% of the world’s poorest countries are in that region, with more than two-thirds in sub-Saharan Africa. Australia’s aid budget has been slashed by $11bn over the last few years, and in the 2013-14 financial year, the country spent $4.7bn on development funding. Just 5% of that – $240m – went to sub-Saharan Africa. A further $713m went to other under-developed nations. Nearly all jurisdictions received a cut to funding, as outlined in the 2014-15 May budget, but sub-Saharan Africa received one of the largest cuts, losing 70% of its funding. Aid group One wants donor countries like Australia to adopt new goals for next week’s aid conference in Ethiopia. The United Nations financing for development conference will plot out a financial pathway end extreme poverty by 2030, and is the last major aid meeting before the sustainable development goals are adopted in New York in September. The new goals will replace the Millennium Development Goals, many of which fell by the wayside when the global financial crisis hit. One said donor countries must commit to raising its aid funding to 0.7% of gross national income (GNI), of which 50% should go to the world’s least developed countries. “2015 could be a game changer for the world’s most vulnerable people, but decisions taken in Addis Ababa will determine whether the opportunity is seized or squandered,” said One’s director of global policy, Eloise Todd. “We won’t see an end to extreme poverty unless countries like Australia shift focus to the poorest countries and the poorest people.” “So far, the Abbott government has been historic for all the wrong reasons, overseeing cuts to the aid budget that have set Australia down the path to being the least generous it’s ever been in terms of aid,” she said. Australia currently spends 0.27% of GNI in aid. By contrast, Britain is one of the few countries to have met the 0.7% aid goal. The US provides the most aid in terms of quantity, nudging $33bn in 2013-14. But by proportion the figure is low, representing 0.19% of GNI. Both the US and Britain have increased their aid contribution to sub-Saharan Africa by more than 7% in one year. One also wants donor countries to focus on aid programs that offer basic services like health and education, particularly for women, and urges recipient nations to strengthen anti-corruption measures so that aid money gets to the most vulnerable. The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, will give the keynote address at next week’s financing aid conference in Addis Ababa. Labor’s foreign affiars spokeswoman, Tanya Plibersek, will be attending, while the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, was yet to confirm either way. “There are a number of foreign policy and security matters that the minister must attend to next week and she is currently finalising her schedule,” a spokeswoman said.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/09/australia-under-pressure-boost-aid-spending-poorest-countries,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jul/09/australia-under-pressure-boost-aid-spending-poorest-countries
2015-07-08T13:54:41Z,global-development,Global development,"Spread of global conflict transforming humanitarian work, says Red Cross chief","The world’s inability to deal with the proliferation of conflict driven-crises is forcing the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to shoulder an ever-larger burden and reassess the way it works, the organisation’s president has warned. Peter Maurer said the operational budget of the world’s oldest humanitarian organisation had risen by almost 50% over the past three years as it tried to keep pace with an “extraordinary period” of enduring humanitarian emergencies. He said the failure to find political solutions to the ongoing violent crises in areas including the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa and Ukraine had left the ICRC spending more than 1.5bn Swiss francs (£1bn) a year as it – and other humanitarian organisations – tried to “plug the gaps” in the global response. “The international system is having difficulty getting to grips with those conflicts; countries have difficulty moving to consensus on how to deal with those crises,” he said. “That seems to open spaces for disorder and conflict and we have those dynamics – which may be distinct and different in each and every country – but together they nevertheless refer us to an international system that does not seem to have international institutions with the ability to negotiate solutions to conflicts or to the big, increasing and accelerating impact of crises. Basically, it increases the necessity for us to respond.” Maurer pointed to Syria – which moved from internal civil unrest to a “proxy war” involving regional and global powers over the course of three-and-a-half years – as an example of the “striking absence” of political progress. “Isn’t it a bit of a symbol that high-quality negotiators have not been able to move anything significant in the Syrian context?” he said. “We had Kofi Annan and Lakhdar Brahimi and now we have Staffan de Mistura at the present moment, and they have tried bottom-down, top-up approaches, combinations of top-down and bottom-up; they have tried quiet, they have tried public; they have tried pressure, they have tried good will, and somehow there doesn’t seem to be any political process that will turn the tide.” That lack of progress, he said, had left the ICRC and others scrabbling around for “as big a plug as possible” to try to contain a regional humanitarian crisis. Elsewhere – in rural Afghanistan, Ukraine’s Donbass region, Lake Chad, northern Nigeria and southern Niger – he said the organisation was “in a very lonely situation” as it operates where few do because of the difficulties of negotiating access. Even the provision of medical assistance, which had previously been uncontroversial and accepted, was proving increasingly difficult in conflicts involving many different parties and against a backdrop of rising attacks on medical staff and facilities. Maurer said the volume, complexity and duration of the current emergencies was forcing the ICRC to re-examine the mechanics and aims of its responses. “We still have a strong commitment to our original mission, which is to protect and assist people who are suffering from the impact of violence, but the violence has changed its character, format and pattern so that we are now responding year after year,” he said. “I think we are challenged in how we define humanitarian action today and how we relate to long-term needs. We are also confronted with legitimate expectations from the people who want us to respond far more thoroughly to their basic pleas than we would have done in a much more contained form of conflict.” Maurer said that a recent trip to Maiduguri, the northeastern Nigerian city at the heart of the Boko Haram Islamist insurgency, had also led him to consider whether the ICRC should extend its core humanitarian remit to include the provision or facilitation of education. “I saw 500,000 displaced persons – a lot of them kids,” he said. “For the second year running, they are not going to school and they are in camps where there are no educational facilities. Each day that passes without kids being able to go to school is an enormous burden on the future.” Given that the ICRC are the only ones there and could not help with schooling, said Maurer, perhaps the time had come to try working with others in an attempt to ensure a basic level of education. “We may not do it ourselves, but if we can’t provide some structure for an organisation to come and do it, they won’t come,” he said. “And if they don’t come, we will have to do it ourselves or we will fail. It’s a completely different humanitarian need. Maybe we will have to slowly walk our way into that territory without necessarily already knowing how we do it from one conflict to another.” Maurer said he was acutely aware that a move into education could jeopardise the ICRC’s much-valued reputation for neutrality. Boko Haram’s name means “western education is forbidden”. “We will certainly have to do a sober assessment in order to retain what is critical for our basic operation. I wouldn’t immediately give up and say, ‘This is just much too political and we will never do it, or we will never have a partnership with someone who does it.’” It was, he added, one of the many dilemmas now facing humanitarian organisations at a time when a record 59.5 million people have been forced from their homes by war, violence and persecution. “While conflicts have expanded and deepened and transformed, actors have transformed and humanitarian assistance is transforming,” he said. “Protection work is transforming and taking on another character.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/08/conflict-humanitarian-assistance-red-cross-chief-peter-maurer,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jul/08/conflict-humanitarian-assistance-red-cross-chief-peter-maurer
2015-07-08T11:43:21Z,global-development,Global development,DfID praised for putting gender equality at the heart of development,"Britain’s Department for International Development (DfID) has broadly succeeded in implementing a new law measuring the impact of its overseas aid on reducing gender inequality, establishing a lead on integrating gender into humanitarian efforts that other international donors should follow, according to a report. The study, by the Great Initiative and Plan UK, analysed information drawn from 44 projects – a mixture of business cases for development aid and approved humanitarian assistance – since the International Development (Gender Equality) Act came into effect in May last year. The act places a duty on the government to consider ways in which development and humanitarian funding will build gender equality in the countries receiving aid.
The report praised DfID for engaging in a meaningful way with the act and going beyond its legal obligations. It urged the British government to encourage other countries to make a similar binding commitment. “DfID is broadly compliant with the procedures it has defined for implementing the act – namely a clearly flagged statement in the business case outlining the impact on gender inequality,” the report, which was launched on Tuesday, said. The study advocated several improvements, suggesting that DfID should: focus on ensuring that all business cases have a clearly flagged statement of gender impact; increase the quality of gender analysis by, for instance, sharing good practice from gender-sensitive and gender-transformative programmes; and address issues of transparency. The report also urged DfID to maintain a high level of political leadership and step up global advocacy around the act. “We were delighted to find that the act has both driven, and joined forces with, other measures to promote gender equality. At the time of our analysis (May 2015) 64% of the business cases in our sample contained a clear statement addressing gender impact and only 18% of business cases lacked this statement,” the report said. DfID had since explained why some cases lacked statements, the report said. Most of the gaps were due to political or commercial sensitivity, while two of the absent statements were in the process of being published. However, the report’s authors noted that transparency was still an issue. “DFID has some progress to make on transparency. Accessing information can be a challenge,” it said, adding that this fell short of DfID’s commitments under the UK Aid Transparency Guarantee. Another problem raised by the report’s authors lay in ensuring gender analyses, carried out during project planning, were implemented in delivery. “DfID has had a strong initial focus on compliance, as we would expect in the first year since the act was passed, so there is little evidence yet available about the expectation on programme staff – and even less on delivery partners – to ensure a gender focus is maintained through programme delivery.” Launching the report, Mariella Frostrup, a founding trustee of the Great Initiative, said independent evaluations were important to shore up public support for UK aid.
She highlighted one case study from the report – the DfID-funded upgrading and resurfacing of a road in western Uganda – as an example of the importance of a gender perspective. The project was scored as low relevance to gender because promoting equality was not its primary objective. “But it surprised us, and indeed it turned out to be one of the most transformative projects we found in our evaluation. It identifies women’s land ownership, violence against women, women’s employment and social norms and stereotypes as issues to be addressed. And it mandates that 25% of jobs on the project are reserved for women, that women’s safety and security is guaranteed and that gender sensitisation and awareness projects are run alongside the actual construction,” she said. “Projects like this give me hope that we can eliminate gender inequality, but only if we recognise it, and tackle it wherever and whenever we can. That is what the act mandates us to do.” Gender was already a priority for DfID before the passage of the act, the report said. In a June interview with the Guardian, Justine Greening, the international development secretary, described DfID’s focus on women and girls as relentless. Greening said she was determined to continue the department’s work on tackling female genital mutilation and child marriage over the next parliament – and in the negotiations over the sustainable development goals, which will replace the millennium development goals later this year. A DfID spokesperson said the act had given extra ambition and focus to the department’s efforts to improve the rights and wellbeing of girls and women. “The report makes clear that DfID has gone above and beyond the act and we will continue to push other countries to follow our lead,” the spokesperson said. Tanya Barron, chief executive of Plan UK, said in a statement that the report showed what could be achieved when gender equality became a “mandatory consideration, not an optional tick box”. She urged the EU, the World Bank and the UN system to replicate what the UK had done, especially in this critical year when the development agenda for the next 15 years is being fine-tuned. “The stakes have never been higher, as the sustainable development goals, financing for development and climate change talks set the world’s course for the foreseeable future. This report provides the evidence we need to argue that gender should be at the heart of these agreements.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/08/dfid-international-development-gender-equality-act,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jul/08/dfid-international-development-gender-equality-act
2015-07-08T10:20:18Z,global-development,Global development,Tanzania accused of making laws on the hoof in 'Kafkaesque' curb on free speech | Hannah McNeish,"There is a strange pattern to interviews in Tanzania. People on the verge of offering information stop mid-flow, pause, and then say something along the lines of: “I don’t have the data or information on that.” It appears odd until you look at the bills that have been rushed through parliament in recent weeks, which activists and journalists say could turn Tanzania into one of Africa’s most repressive countries for freedom of speech.
“It’s not a coincidence. This is the year of elections,” says Maria Sarungi Tsehai, founder of Change Tanzania, a social media citizen movement. The organisation campaigns against laws that threaten independent reporting and dissident voices in the lead-up to October’s presidential and parliamentary elections. A Cybercrimes Act, signed into law on 8 May, criminalises the sharing of information deemed “false, deceptive, misleading or inaccurate”, forces internet service and mobile phone providers to share users’ information without telling them, and allows police officers to search and seize equipment without much justification. Maxence Melo, co-founder of JamiiForums – a news and social networking platform that has become Tanzania’s top whistleblowing site – is extremely worried about the laws. Since the site was founded in 2006, he has been questioned 17 times, detained twice, received death threats and suffered a mysterious car accident. But he has refused to divulge the sources of information posted online. In 2007, Jamii published details of a corrupt energy deal – known as the Richmond scandal – which led to the dissolution of the cabinet and resignation of the prime minister. The exposé also brought Melo’s first arrest and interrogation. Another energy scandal exposed by Jamii and subsequently picked up by newspapers led to further senior sackings and donor distrust in the shape of threats to withhold almost $500m (£324.5m) in aid. More trouble followed for Melo. “They used to say: ‘We are going to come with a law that will force you to give us whatever document [or] details we need,’” he says. Diplomats and journalists have dubbed the Cybercrimes Act the “Jamii bill”. Some MPs have told Melo not to make a fuss about it until after the elections, saying it might be amended later. After elections in 2011, Melo says, Jamii was made “an enemy of the state” by President Jakaya Kikwete, who publicly blamed the site for a 20% drop in voter support from 2007. On the other hand, opposition politicians – some of whom have had their dirty laundry aired – have accused Jamii of working for the government. The deputy communications minister, January Makamba – who hopes to run for the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party this year, when Kikwete steps down after his second term – accused Jamii of favouring the opposition in the last ballot.
Makamba says the Cybercrimes Act was not meant to prevent the exchange and drafting of information but “to protect people from abuse”, such as online fraud and bullying. “Tanzania is one of the freest countries in Africa,” he insists. That diplomats are unable to find the final text of laws that have been passed is embarrassing for them, says Makamba, adding that the fact activists are struggling to see the drafts of others “speaks volumes about their level of interest on the matter”. Tsehai couldn’t disagree more. “The fact that they’ve been trying to shroud bills that are openly trying to curb the freedom of expression is ridiculous,” she says. “I’d almost say it’s Orwellian, but I prefer Kafka.” The cybercrime law sits uneasily with Tanzania’s membership of the open government partnership initiative, which is meant to make government business more transparent to citizens. Tanzania has a long tradition of official wariness of providing information and handling criticism. Independent media only appeared 10 years ago, but really took off in the past five years with the proliferation of more than 800 newspapers. Many of these pop up at election time, with a clear political agenda. However, politicians quickly managed to buy or close outlets and, according to former journalists, encourage self-censorship. Mobile phones have changed things. Jamii has more than a million followers on Facebook, 28 million mobile subscribers and up to 600,000 people using its online forum every day. “The people in power … are finding that they have to deal with the jungle, something they can’t control, which is the internet,” says Tsehai. The Cybercrimes Act seeks to deal with the rambunctious new media by decreeing that anyone sending or receiving “unsolicited messages” can be penalised for sharing them, be it through text messages, Facebook or Twitter. Tsehai fears the authorities will send some citizens to jail “so that they can be examples for the people, and terrify them” into policing their own thoughts.
Another law, the 2013 Statistics Act, also deters Tanzanians from using or quoting anything but official government figures and data. Jamii’s plans to get citizens to post polling station reports in October is in jeopardy because the punishment for publishing “false or misleading statistical information” without “lawful authorisation” from the National Bureau of Statistics is a year in jail, a 10m shilling (£3,246) fine, or both. After attempting to plant moles among Jamii’s staff, politicians are now offering to buy advertising at hugely inflated rates in an attempt to sway the site’s owners. They would rather shut down a site that is growing at 25% a month than buy it. “I do not believe in money. I believe in people,” says Melo, 39, whose phone buzzes all the time with requests to join the site or attempts by hackers to silence him. Jamii, who gave up a relatively lucrative civil engineering job to work for virtually nothing, uses profits from advertising mainly on paying the 50 staff who edit up to 50,000 comments a day. Melo survives on four hours sleep a night, because he vets new users and verifies all the information before it goes up, to ensure Jamii’s credibility and avoid legal problems. That will become more difficult if other bills affecting the media are passed. Meanwhile, Melo and others fear an even bigger crackdown on dissenting voices. “If I’ve already been questioned 17 times [so far], I’ll probably be questioned 100 times in a month because they want to get everything, they want to have everything.” The International Women’s Media Foundation supported Hannah McNeish’s reporting from Tanzania as part of its African Great Lakes reporting initiative",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/08/tanzania-laws-curb-free-speech-social-media-jamii-forums,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jul/08/tanzania-laws-curb-free-speech-social-media-jamii-forums
2015-07-08T06:00:03Z,global-development,Global development,"New development goals need to be ambitious, actionable and accountable","The great strength of the millennium development goals was their ability to focus the minds of the development industry and, to some extent, governments on a handful of key priorities, such as child survival, basic education and women’s rights. But that was also their weakness. It inevitably meant that equally important themes were excluded, and, by extension, it meant the exclusion of those countries and constituencies for which these other themes were the main concerns. So the oft-expressed critique that the sustainable development goals are too broad, and that we need a kind of MDG-plus agenda, is misplaced. We need this SDG agenda precisely because it brings in other issues, most obviously links to global environmental problems but also the economic and structural causes of the social issues emphasised by the MDGs.
Most important, perhaps, as I have argued, is that the SDGs overturn an embedded but old-fashioned paradigm: the idea that there are developing and developed countries. The SDGs will apply to all countries, not just a sub-group. This inclusivity is one of the reasons that the SDGs could be a success. While the MDGs were resented by some countries as “someone else’s agenda”, the SDGs are explicitly fully negotiated and agreed across the board. If you wanted a list of priorities, then the SDGs are not for you. It is hard to think of a statement of intent by the world’s nations that is as comprehensive and visionary as the SDG agenda set to be acclaimed in New York in September. In a sense, it is more from the family of grand UN visions than a specific action plan. Certainly, there are 17 goals. But the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) has 30 articles, none of which carry an action plan or indicators to monitor progress. Smart targets did not yet exist. But it sets out a vision, justifying and supporting progressive attitudes everywhere. It has since been translated into more than 300 languages, a world record. Insofar as documents signed many miles away can be useful to ordinary people struggling to fulfil their rights and potential, it does its job. So I am broadly an SDG fan, because I hope it will do something similar. Having said that, there is no doubt that it is actions that matter, not just words. We need to set the SDG negotiators, and the governments they work for, a “triple A challenge”: the SDG agenda needs to be ambitious, actionable and accountable. Ambition will not be a problem. It is the other two As we need to work on.
In a new paper bringing together lessons from conversations held between a number of governments about how to implement the SDGs, David Steven, senior fellow at NYU’s Center on International Cooperation, emphasises two things: the need to integrate the most important aspects of the agenda into national plans, and the need to improve data. Translating the SDG agenda as agreed on the international stage into a workable action plan at the national level will be the big challenge. Steven says we must lose no time in getting started, arguing that any delay will be costly. I would add that momentum is critical – these are political targets and politics is all about the moment. Steven makes clear that countries are not yet ready to deliver, and that prioritisation, even within this explicitly holistic and universal agenda, is not a dirty word – as long as the toughest challenges are not shunned. Of data, there is already a great deal written – here is my tuppence worth. But there is no doubt that the international community must help countries improve evidence and information as they seek to meet the SDGs. So much for actioning the SDGs. What about accountability? Of course, this is intimately related with action. If civil society, along with more formal accountability bodies, does not hold government to account with both political pressure and solid evidence, then we can’t expect much action. The vision of a world in which human rights are respected is still an inspiration to read, almost 70 years since it was first put on paper. The SDG agenda is also visionary and inspiring. As the long process of drawing up the next set of global goals reaches its final straight, its ambition is assured. It is time to turn our attention to action and accountability in the hope of giving the whole process a triple A rating.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/08/new-development-goals-ambitious-actionable-accountable-sustainable-development,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jul/08/new-development-goals-ambitious-actionable-accountable-sustainable-development
2015-07-07T15:27:03Z,global-development,Global development,"Facing snakes, scorpions – and fear of attack – on Kenya’s Walk of Hope","We set off on the morning of 13 June from the town of Garissa in eastern Kenya. At first, our group was hundreds-strong, and included officials from the county and national government, all of us walking together to restore dignity and promote peace in a long-neglected region. After 11km, only seven walkers remained as people offered their excuses, wished us luck and headed back into a town made infamous when Somali insurgents from al-Shabaab killed 147 people, mainly young students, on a university campus in April. As I write, those of us who continued the Walk of Hope have covered 500km, heading deep into Kenya’s North Eastern province. Our destination: border point one in Mandera, a town near Kenya’s borders with Ethiopia and Somalia. In all, we planned to cover a gruelling 728km.
In north-eastern Kenya, the land is flat with sparse vegetation cover. Temperatures soar to 40C during the day and the nights can be cold and windy. Most people living here are ethnic Somalis, as am I. The idea was to walk every day to the nearest settlement, by whatever means, covering between 15km and 43km. We never planned to sleep in the bush – we feared the snakes and scorpions. As it turned out, we saw many scorpions on the road and just three snakes. It can be a little disappointing if you build an expectation. Our choice of food was informed by ease of preparation rather than anything else. None of us felt like competent cooks. We packed a pickup full of tinned tuna, juice, energy drinks, dates and mineral water.The settlements we walked through typically featured a mixture of permanent and semi-permanent houses, a small school, a clinic and a borehole, if the residents were lucky. The unlucky ones had just a school and maybe a borehole producing saline water. Clinics are a luxury in these places. The economy revolves round livestock: the settlements boom in the rainy season and bust during the dry season. In one village, an old man insisted on offering us tea. The borehole there had broken in 1978, and nobody had bothered to repair it. I was born that year. One thing stood out in all the villages we passed through: each had a beautiful little mosque with solar lighting and a booming speaker for the call to prayer. Some settlements had two mosques, competing for attention.
On average, we walked 30km every day with the aim of finishing the walk in 25 days. That’s a brisk pace, which results in blisters and muscle pains. At 38, I was the oldest walker, an unfit lecturer: I was not a star performer. I was exhausted all the time and felt like I was walking on thorns, always inches away from giving up. My blisters became well known when I posted a picture on Facebook of my swollen feet, and the BBC’s Somali service picked up the story. My blisters are overshadowing my real self, I mused. Red Cross paramedics followed us, ready to deal with our injuries, and sometimes offering massages. In one settlement, people were bemused by these strange walkers. They had not yet heard about the Walk of Hope. So they grilled us to make sure we were not thugs or hoodlums. Then, they gave us mats and a temporary shed to sleep in. We were welcomed in many settlements with the traditional honour of slaughtering a goat. The most challenging part of the walk was fasting. Fasting is obligatory for us Muslims during Ramadan, and since the walk is not a necessity we could not excuse ourselves on account of being travellers. We walked at night and rested during the day. This had its challenges: at night, we could not see what was in the bush. We were not scared of wild animals – the lion is the only dangerous animal in these parts and all we saw were footprints. One night, we happened on a feisty hyena feeding on the carcass of a goat, but we were too tired to be bothered. Whenever we reached a settlement, we visited the school and the health centre to check on provision there. Non-Somali teachers have refused to work in north-eastern Kenya after several attacks by al-Shabaab on non-Muslim citizens. Health workers were also scared away. We wanted to document the effects of these shortages. We discovered that schools were terribly understaffed even before the attacks began.
In many places, the local community operates the government schools as if they were private institutions: they employ untrained teachers and students pay fees. No standards are enforceable, and the central examination system is a farce since students are not subjected to the same curriculum, teaching materials or teaching hours. The biggest problem in the many health centres we visited was the complete absence of doctors. The best one can hope for is a nursing officer or a medical officer with a diploma from a medical training college. In Kenya, it seems, doctors are the preserve of city dwellers. Security was always on our minds. Northern Kenya is often depicted as a wild land where bandits roam. Walking on the road made us vulnerable. We took all threats seriously – we could not be complacent. One night we were camping in the bush when one of the guys saw a post on Facebook claiming that al-Shabaab wanted to attack the Walk of Hope. We were in the bush, 30km from the nearest settlement. We convinced ourselves that the fellow posting the threat was just seeking “likes” and decided to ignore it. I hardly slept that night, but not because I was scared – a very cold wind was blowing and I thought we would freeze to death, before anyone had a chance to attack us. Similar posts appeared on the same page the next day. One night while trekking on a dirt road, a vehicle stopped a short distance away and three people jumped out and ran into the bush. We thought, “This is it!” but the attack never came. Nonetheless, we ran for our lives, straining our muscles and blistering our feet. It was the worst night of the walk. And suddenly, that was the end of my journey: the rest could continue but my feet could no longer take the strain. Egg-sized blisters appeared between my toes, and my feet swelled up. I needed to see a doctor. The Walk of Hope continues. Salah Abdi Sheikh is an activist, author and former dean of the school of business and technology at Umma University. The other walkers are now at El Wak, about 175km from Mandera, which they hope to reach in six to eight days. Sheikh hopes to join them for the final 20km",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/07/facing-snakes-scorpions-fear-attack-kenya-walk-of-hope,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jul/07/facing-snakes-scorpions-fear-attack-kenya-walk-of-hope

While the MDGs have ended extreme poverty for more than a billion people since they began in 2000, UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon warned that inequalities persist and progress has been uneven. Minority and indigenous communities, such as Burma’s Rohingya and Iraq’s Yazidi, are being displaced into cities at an alarming rate, said a report by Minority Rights Group. A crucial problem is that governments are not consulting with communities in their policymaking processes. The EU must plan 25 years ahead in its strategy for dealing with surging numbers of refugees and migrants, warned François Crépeau, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants. Crépeau said increasing aid spending to help stabilise turbulent countries would not immediately help stem the flow of migrants and refugees.

It’s not a democracy, and most people have no particularly strong desire that it should be one. The present system of government is working well for them, the economy is still growing at an extraordinary rate. People’s lives are better than their parents’, and far better than their grandparents’. That is what is important to them. Should the economy go South, then I imagine there might be a revived interest in democracy, but that would be as a means to an end (prosperity) rather than as a goal in itself. So - no, democracy is not a ‘universal value’, and it is highly dangerous to treat it as such. Trying to impose democracy on people who have no desire for it leads to chaos, bloodshed, and racial and ethnic strife, as many recent examples (Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, Libya) unfortunately prove.

2015-07-07T08:47:30Z,global-development,Global development,Why developing countries need to toughen up on taxes | Lilianne Ploumen,"Next week, the UN financing conference in Addis Ababa will take decisions that will have a profound impact on the global community over the next 15 years and beyond. Tax collection in developing countries will determine whether the sustainable development goals can rival the success of the millennium development goals, which expire this year. For most developing countries, tax revenue lies somewhere between 10% and 15% of gross domestic product. That’s low compared with an average of about 35% for developed countries. In historical terms, however, it’s not that low. Throughout the 19th century, in all western countries tax revenue was below 10%. In his book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, Thomas Piketty shows us that it was only after 1910 that tax revenue slowly started rising. Low tax revenues meant that governments were able to fund only the most basic services, such as policing, the courts and the armed forces. Universal access to healthcare or education, infrastructure and a social safety net – in short, the foundations for decent, prosperous lives – call for much higher tax revenues.
This goal can be achieved, perhaps sooner than many of us ever dared dream. Success in the fight against hunger and poverty, under the banner of the MDGs, has changed our perception of what is possible. Now, the world’s bold new ambition is to leave no one behind. To achieve this, we will have to, at last, realise the full potential of developing countries. This is known as domestic resource mobilisation, and it all starts with higher rates of tax revenue collection. In order to be able to finance their share of the SDGs, developing countries will have to increase tax revenue collection to about 20% of GDP, according to the UN. I see three main areas for action. First, ensure fair taxation. The urgency here is overwhelming. The UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) estimates that multinationals avoid $100bn worth of corporation tax in developing countries. Governments and international institutions now have to make good on promises to fight tax avoidance and tax evasion. Second, strengthen tax inspectors. Developing countries need support to broaden their tax base and build tax collection capacity. Two years ago, the Netherlands started giving technical assistance to developing countries, and we now plan to double our current contribution. Today, we are active in 10 countries and we are starting an initiative to generate extra resources for building tax collection capacity. I believe this is a good investment, because internationally the rate of return on such support is way over a factor of 10. We plan to launch this initiative at the Addis summit. Countries that want to use these extra resources will need to express the political will to reform their tax systems. In developing countries, tax systems often have a regressive effect because they tend to rely heavily on consumption taxes, like VAT and excise duty, or on import levies. The poor end up paying a relatively high amount of tax because they spend all their income on goods subject to VAT, such as groceries and phone credit. And they pay import levies on their mobiles. There is no tax-free shopping for the poor. Third, broaden the tax base. Developing countries need more capacity to administer and collect more complex forms of tax, like income and wealth taxes. Apart from VAT, countries need a progressive income tax regime. Because the poor are often hit harder by income tax too. In Zambia, for instance, the sugar picker and the woman with a market stall pay more tax than the sugar factory itself. Businesses can use smart tax arrangements – tax avoidance tactics, in other words – to ensure they pay less than 1% in tax. While the market seller has to pay four times that rate on the couple of dollars she earns. That is not only wrong from a gender perspective; it’s completely unfair. That’s why I am delighted that we have already agreed with five countries to revise our tax treaties. We have signed a new treaty with Malawi, and signed an amendment with Ethiopia, and we are holding discussions with seven other countries on updating treaties. In total, we are looking to revise our treaties with 23 countries. Anti-abuse provisions – defining which companies get access to the treaty benefits – will ensure that the Netherlands is no longer an attractive option for companies that use tax avoidance tactics. Theirs is the kind of business we would rather do without. These anti-abuse provisions are meant to exclude companies that only establish themselves in a third state to benefit from tax treaty advantages through that country, without having any other activities in that third state. Finally, we regularly urge developing countries to be more discerning when awarding tax exemptions. The Netherlands is now putting its money where its mouth is. Along with other countries, we are prepared to forgo tax exemptions on goods and services that fall under official development assistance. The task before us is daunting. The leap from the billions we needed for the MDGs to the trillions we will need to make the SDGs a success is a big one. But just consider what we’ve achieved already. Ending hunger is within the grasp of this generation – a feat that seemed inconceivable only a generation ago. We must redouble our efforts if we want to do the same with poverty. It is possible to make the billions we provide in official development assistance spark the trillions that we need in private sector resources. Above all, I see ways for developing countries to increase their tax revenues. That will enable them to unleash their full potential at last.

2015-07-07T06:00:04Z,global-development,Global development,Bullets banish books in South Sudan as education becomes a casualty of war | James Copnall,"At the end of a school day in the South Sudanese capital, Juba, young girls in light brown uniforms walk home, chatting in the late-afternoon sun. The scene should be repeated all over the country but over the past year and a half the civil war has forced hundreds of thousands of children out of school nationwide. Education is one of the hidden casualties of South Sudan’s latest conflict, which began in December 2013 and shows little sign of ending. School buildings have been requisitioned by soldiers, pupils and their teachers have been press-ganged into armed groups, and an estimated 400,000 children have been forced out of school. In the three worst affected states, Jonglei, Upper Nile and Unity, 70% of the 1,200 schools have been closed. In some counties, not a single school is open.
The education sector was a concern even before the war broke out: the national literacy rate of 27% was one of the lowest in the world, and primary school enrolment (47%) and completion (10%) rates were also unimpressive, though better than they had been during the long years of conflict before South Sudan seceded from Sudan. At independence four years ago this week, South Sudan was one of the least developed countries in the world, and the new schools created in peace time were often extremely basic. Nevertheless, some progress was made. The country’s subsequent rapid descent into civil war reversed many of those slight gains. Aliza Ruai knows what that feels like. She had been a student in Lich primary school, in Unity state, when the war began. In June 2014, she was forced to flee as the violence surged towards her home. “We could only move at night,” says the 17-year-old. “I couldn’t see the fighting but I heard the guns. I was feeling very bad. I was afraid. My father was taken in April before we fled. I have not seen him since.” She missed her exams because of the fighting, and spent more time out of school as she looked after younger siblings. Now, though, she is studying again, at a makeshift school in the UN camp where she lives on the outskirts of Bentiu, the state capital. “Because I want a good life, I will study,” she says. “Maybe I can be a doctor or a teacher.” Samuel Liom is at the same school. He was 14 before he first went to school, since there wasn’t one in his village. At first, he found it difficult to be in a class with much younger children, but he enjoyed learning so much that he overcame his embarrassment.
Like Aliza, Samuel was forced to flee the fighting in Unity state – what he calls the “shooting and lootings” – and dead bodies by the side of the road. At first, he wasn’t sure whether it was worth going to school in the camp, but sitting around doing nothing became frustrating. Now he is back at school, and hopes to get a job with the UN. The civil war has sharpened the focus of his studies. “My favourite subject is social science because you will learn the world story – how other countries are doing in terms of justice and social issues,” he says. “If you do social studies, you know the heart of the country.” South Sudan needs peace, Samuel says, to allow him and others to lead normal lives. Both Aliza and Samuel are studying at a school supported by Unicef as part of its Back to Learning Campaign, which has reached 121,000 children and hopes to help three times as many. Funding, though, is in short supply.
When a war breaks out, education sinks down the list of priorities. In 2014, around 1% of humanitarian spending went on education. As the world meets in Oslo this week for a Summit on Education for Development, Unicef will argue for a higher priority for education in humanitarian emergencies. “We have to keep in mind that conflicts today, like in South Sudan, are lasting much longer, so we have to rethink the way traditional humanitarian assistance is provided,” says Phuong T Nguyen from Unicef, in South Sudan. “Aspects of education are life-saving: how to protect yourself from cholera, the use of clean water, how to protect yourself from gender-based violence. It’s not in the same sense as food but it is life-saving.” Many in South Sudan would agree. Edmund Yakani is a prominent activist who organises programmes to help provide schooling for children affected by conflict. He’s concerned that an entire generation is growing up without a proper education – making South Sudan’s future prospects even bleaker. Even areas not directly affected by conflict are “overwhelmed”, he says. Class sizes have grown from around 45 to well over 100 in many cases, “reducing the quality of education. And many teachers are getting work as humanitarians because the money is better. The educational cost of this war is high.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/07/bullets-banish-books-south-sudan-education-casualty-war,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jul/07/bullets-banish-books-south-sudan-education-casualty-war

The goals were intended to serve as a precise, memorable and measurable way to focus development policy in the first years of the 21st century and to improve the lives of hundreds of millions of the world’s poorest people. Underlying them, however, was a simple if stunning ambition; an epochal call to arms. “We will spare no effort to free our fellow men, women and children from the abject and dehumanising conditions of extreme poverty, to which more than a billion of them are currently subjected,” ran the Millennium Declaration that was adopted at the summit. “We are committed to making the right to development a reality for everyone and to freeing the entire human race from want.”
If progress on the MDGs has been mixed – and the final report plainly admits that it has – then their architects can at least claim that progress on ending extreme poverty has been spectacular: between 1990 and this year, the number of those living in extreme poverty has fallen from 1.9 billion to 836 million. Improvements in many other areas have been less impressive, however. Last year, the the UN deputy secretary general, Jan Eliasson, bemoaned the lack of action on clean water and sanitation, warning that the slow progress in building toilets and ending open defecation was having a “staggering” effect on the health, safety, education, prosperity and dignity of 2.5 billion people. His comments came two months after Unesco admitted that there was “no chance whatsoever” that the millennium development goal of achieving universal primary education by 2015 would be met. The MDGs have often been criticised for their naivety, their narrow interpretation of the ethos behind the millennium declaration and for their lack of focus on longterm, sustainable development. But they are at least acknowledged to have concentrated global attention on their separate eight areas. Many fear that the MDGs replacements – the sustainable development goals, which will be agreed by the UN in September – will struggle to do even that. Whereas the MDGs consisted of eight goals supported by 21 specific targets and 60 indicators, there are currently 17 SDGs comprising 169 targets. The number of indicators has yet to be set but there are likely to be hundreds. The sheer number of goals, targets and indicators has prompted some to worry that the SDGs will be a hard sell. The British prime minister, David Cameron, has made it clear that he favours fewer. “I don’t believe they will cut it at 17,” he said last year. “There are too many to communicate effectively. There’s a real danger they will end up sitting on a bookshelf, gathering dust.” Despite this, the numbers look unlikely to change as reaching agreement even on 17 has been a long, hard slog. But the UN is acutely aware of the need to grab people’s attention with the SDGs, which will set the development agenda until 2030. During last year’s SDG negotiations, the secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, grouped the goals into six “essential elements”: dignity, people, planet, prosperity, justice and partnership. If the numerous SDGs are to make an impression on the global consciousness, they will need careful packaging and a simple, unifying message. As Helen Clark, the head of the UN Development Programme, put it in January: “We need to catch people’s imagination with this because if you just say ‘sustainable development’, eyes glaze. If you say, ‘17 goals’, it takes a genius to recite the 17.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/07/sustainable-development-goals-will-be-hard-sell-for-united-nations,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jul/07/sustainable-development-goals-will-be-hard-sell-for-united-nations
2015-07-06T15:45:12Z,global-development,Global development,What have the millennium development goals achieved?,"The millennium development goals have targeted eight key areas – poverty, education, gender equality, child mortality, maternal health, disease, the environment and global partnership. Each goal is supported by 21 specific targets and more than 60 indicators. Below, we’ve looked at what has been achieved on some of the targets within each goal. MDG 1: The number of people living on less than $1.25 a day has been reduced from 1.9 billion in 1990 to 836 million in 2015, although the target of halving the proportion of people suffering from hunger was narrowly missed.
MDG 2: Primary school enrolment figures have shown an impressive rise, but the goal of achieving universal primary education has just been missed, with the net enrolment rate increasing from 83% in 2000 to 91% this year.
MDG 3: About two-thirds of developing countries have achieved gender parity in primary education.
MDG 4: The child mortality rate has reduced by more than half over the past 25 years – falling from 90 to 43 deaths per 1,000 live births – but it has failed to meet the MDG target of a drop of two-thirds.
MDG 5: The global maternal mortality ratio has fallen by nearly half – short of the two-thirds reduction the MDGs aimed for.
MDG 6: The target of halting and beginning to reverse the spread of HIV/Aids by 2015 has not been met, although the number of new HIV infections fell by around 40% between 2000 and 2013.
MDG 7: Some 2.6 billion people have gained access to improved drinking water since 1990, so the target of halving the proportion of people without access to improved sources of water was achieved in 2010 – five years ahead of schedule. However, 663 million people across the world still do not have access to improved drinking water.
MDG 8: Between 2000 and 2014, overseas development assistance from rich nations to developing countries increased by 66% in real terms, and in 2013 reached the record figure of $134.8bn (£80.3bn).",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2015/jul/06/what-millennium-development-goals-achieved-mdgs,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/datablog/2015/jul/06/what-millennium-development-goals-achieved-mdgs
2015-07-06T14:48:58Z,global-development,Global development,UN: 15-year push ends extreme poverty for a billion people,"The millennium development goals (MDGs) have driven “the most successful anti-poverty movement in history” and brought more than a billion people out of extreme penury, but their achievements have been mixed and the world remains deeply riven by inequality, the UN’s final report (pdf) on the goals has concluded. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, said that while the 15-year push to meet the eight goals – on poverty, education, gender equality, child mortality, maternal health, disease, the environment and global partnership – had yielded some astonishing results, it had left too many people behind.
“The MDGs helped to lift more than one billion people out of extreme poverty, to make inroads against hunger, to enable more girls to attend school than ever before and to protect our planet,” he said. “Yet for all the remarkable gains, I am keenly aware that inequalities persist and that progress has been uneven.” While the world has reduced the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day from 1.9 billion in 1990 to 836 million in 2015, the target of halving the proportion of people suffering from hunger was narrowly missed. Between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of undernourished people fell from 23.3% to 12.9%. Current estimates suggest around 795 million people are undernourished – the overwhelming majority of them in developing regions. Progress has been hindered by higher food and energy prices, extreme weather, natural disasters, political instability, humanitarian crises and the economic recession of the late 1990s and in 2008-2009. Ban noted that in 2011, nearly 60% of the world’s extremely poor people lived in five countries – India, Nigeria, China, Bangladesh and the Democratic Republic of Congo – and that familiar divisions and inequities were as stark as ever. “Too many women continue to die during pregnancy or from childbirth-related complications,” he said. “Progress tends to bypass women and those who are lowest on the economic ladder or are disadvantaged because of their age, disability or ethnicity. Disparities between rural and urban areas remain pronounced.”
Progress on education has been mixed: the goal of achieving universal primary education has also just been missed, with the net enrolment rate rising from 83% in 2000 to 91% this year. The literacy rate for those aged 15 to 24 showed an identical rise, while the number of out-of-school children fell from 100 million 15 years ago to 57 million today. Despite having to contend with a rising population, high levels of poverty and armed conflicts, sub-Saharan Africa made the greatest progress in primary school enrolment of all the developing regions, with its rate growing from 52% in 1990 to 78% in 2012.
The push for gender equality and to empower women has led to about two-thirds of developing countries achieving gender parity in primary education – underlining the fact that the aspiration of eliminating gender disparity in primary and secondary education has not been met. When it comes to employment outside the agricultural sector, women now constitute 41% of paid workers, up from 35% in 1990. Although the proportion of women in parliament has nearly doubled over the past 20 years, only one in every five seats is held by a woman. Efforts to narrow the gender divide continue to be stymied by discrimination in law and practice, violence against women and girls, unequal employment opportunities and unequal division of unpaid care and domestic work. While the child mortality rate has declined by more than half over the past 25 years – falling from 90 to 43 deaths per 1,000 live births – it has not declined by the MDG aim of two-thirds. Vaccination helped to prevent nearly 15.6m deaths from measles between 2000 and 2013, but that progress has slowed since 2010, with an estimated 21.6 million infants not receiving the vaccine in 2013. The biggest preventable causes of death for children under five are pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria, which between them claim 16,000 lives a day.
The aspiration of reducing the maternal mortality ratio by three-quarters has not been realised, with the ratio falling by nearly half (from 380 deaths per 100,000 live births to 210). Today, only half of pregnant women in developing regions receive the recommended minimum of four antenatal visits, and a quarter of babies worldwide are delivered without skilled care. Postpartum haemorrhage accounted for 27% of maternal deaths in developing regions between 2003 and 2009; other major complications were high blood pressure during pregnancy, complications from delivery and unsafe abortion. Progress on combating HIV/Aids, malaria and other diseases has also varied. The target of halting and beginning to reverse the spread of HIV/Aids by 2015 has not been met, although the number of new HIV infections fell by around 40% between 2000 and 2013, from 3.5 million cases to 2.1 million. The fight is being hindered by risky sexual behaviour and a lack of basic knowledge about HIV among young people in many countries. The target of halting and reversing the incidence of malaria has been achieved thanks to a tenfold increase in international financing since 2000 and sustained malaria prevention and treatment initiatives. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets, indoor spraying, diagnostic testing and the use of effective drugs have helped prevent more than 6.2m deaths from the disease between 2000 and 2015. The global malaria incidence rate has fallen by more than a third and the mortality rate by more than half. Significant progress has been made in the fight against tuberculosis: improved prevention, diagnosis and treatment saved an estimated 37m lives between 2000 and 2013. The push for environmental sustainability has brought some 2.6 billion people access to improved drinking water since 1990, meaning that the target of halving the proportion of people without access to improved sources of water was achieved in 2010 – five years ahead of schedule. However, 663 million are still without improved drinking water.
Efforts on sanitation have fared far less well: 2.1 billion people have gained access to improved sanitation (a toilet that hygienically separates faeces from human contact) since 1990, leaving the target of halving the number of people without access to basic sanitation short by nearly 700 million people. Some 2.4 billion people in developing countries – a third of humanity – still lack access to improved sanitation facilities, while 946 million people still practise open defecation. The differences between rural and urban areas are often considerable. While four out of five people in urban areas have access to piped drinking water, the figure for those in rural areas is just one in three. Nearly half of those in rural areas lack access to improved sanitation facilities compared with less than a fifth of those in urban areas. Moves to improve the way the world works together on development have been aided by an increase in the amount of official development assistance (ODA) that rich countries give to developing nations. Between 2000 and 2014, ODA increased by 66% in real terms and hit a record high of $134.8bn (£80.3bn) in 2013. Ban said that lessons had to be learned from the MDGs as the world prepares to agree their successors, the sustainable development goals, which will set the agenda for the next 15 years. “We need to tackle root causes and do more to integrate the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development,” he said. “Reflecting on the MDGs and looking ahead to the next 15 years, there is no question that we can deliver on our shared responsibility to end poverty, leave no one behind and create a world of dignity for all.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/06/united-nations-extreme-poverty-millennium-development-goals,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jul/06/united-nations-extreme-poverty-millennium-development-goals
2015-07-06T13:09:50Z,global-development,Global development,UN special envoy says Ebola flare-ups could continue for some time,"The new Ebola outbreak in Liberia last week was not unexpected, and more like it may occur, according to the UN special envoy on Ebola, Dr David Nabarro. The 17-year-old whose death signalled the outbreak in Liberia may have come into contact with an infected animal or picked up the virus from a person in whom it had lingered beyond the 21-day quarantine period, experts believe.
Two more people from the teenager’s village have fallen ill since the boy’s death last Sunday, but although the new cases have dismayed the government, population and health experts, Nabarro said that because of the large amount of virus that has been in circulation, this could be the pattern for some time to come. “We’re still pretty confident it is going to end, in a period which is not unreasonable, but I don’t think the end will necessarily be the end. There will be subsequent mini flare-ups occurring all over the place,” he said. How the teenager became infected is the subject of rumour and speculation, because he is not thought to have come into contact with anybody from Sierra Leone or Guinea, where there are still cases. But, said Nabarro, “there has been an awful lot of virus around. Some of it may have gone back into the animal kingdom”. That could mean the virus occurring in animals in locations where there was none in the past, increasing the chances of disease if people eat or are in physical contact with infected animals, such as fruit bats. This epidemic has also shown that the virus can linger beyond the 21-day quarantine period in the prostate in men and in the eyes in both men and women, he said. It has been found in amniotic fluid and in the foetuses of women who were pregnant when they became infected with Ebola but survived. “We don’t know yet whether they are an undetected chain of transmission, because Margibi [the county where the cases occurred] was one of the last parts of Liberia to be declared Ebola-free, or whether they are the result of some kind of perpetuation of the virus, survivors that we hadn’t known about, or whether they represent a brand-new arrival of the virus from outside the human race – a new Ebola appearance – and that answer will not be known for some time,” Nabarro said. Examination of past Ebola outbreaks since the disease was first identified four decades ago shows a 50% probability of isolated mini outbreaks within a year after the main one has been declared over, he said. While there is not absolute clarity on this, it appeared that the reasons were perpetuation of the virus in survivors or re-introduction from animals which may have picked it up from infected humans. Nabarro praised the calm and confident Liberian response to the new cases, as well as the handling of the continuing epidemic in the other affected countries. The communities in Sierra Leone and Guinea where there are still cases now need to be approached with great sensitivity, said Nabarro. These are communities that want to be left alone, with their cultural values and traditions undisturbed, he said. It was important to focus on individual households in a quiet and non-aggressive way and listen to them. “People are very, very scared,” he said. “They are scared they are going to get into trouble with the authorities but they are scared that they will get into trouble with the spiritual world if they don’t do their burials right. It needs a very sensitive response.” Nabarro was speaking before a major UN conference aimed at encouraging donations to help the three hard-hit west African countries recover from the damage of the epidemic. At the secretary general’s international conference on early recovery, which begins on Friday in New York, donors are expected to offer help with restoring health and education systems, but it is thought likely the governments of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea will hope for more assistance to rebuild their economies.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/06/ebola-un-special-envoy-liberia-flare-ups-david-nabarro,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jul/06/ebola-un-special-envoy-liberia-flare-ups-david-nabarro
2015-07-06T09:13:09Z,global-development,Global development,"Make poverty history? A decade on from Gleneagles, it is a genuine possibility | Adrian Lovett","It is hard to believe that, when world leaders met at Gleneagles 10 years ago on Monday, nobody on the planet had an iPhone, YouTube was preparing to open its first office above a Silicon Valley pizza house, and tweeting was confined to birds. But looking back on that day, when the Make Poverty History campaign reached its climax at the G8 summit, it is clear the world has changed in many more ways. On 6 July 2005 I was in Edinburgh, preparing to head to Gleneagles to make our case. Days earlier, we had mobilised half a million people at the huge Edinburgh Make Poverty History rally – the largest in Scottish history – and at the Live 8 concerts in London and around the world. Seven million white campaign wristbands had been worn in the UK, and tens of millions more worldwide, challenging leaders to act. The G8’s answer included a promise of $48bn (£31bn) in new aid – half of it to Africa – and outright debt cancellation for many of the world’s poorest countries. It wasn’t everything the campaign had asked for, and it hasn’t all been plain sailing since. Shamefully, some of the richest countries have reneged on the promises they made that day. But the deal done at Gleneagles, unlike the faded Nokia 3310 I clutched back then, has looked better with the passing of time. Those who kept their word, along with strong political leadership from within Africa itself, have helped transform the world since. Consider some numbers. Since 2005, new HIV infections have decreased by 33%; in sub-Saharan Africa almost one-third fewer children die before the age of five. And 35 million more children are now in school.
The change becomes real when seen up close. A while ago I visited a government health clinic supported by Save the Children in South Wollo, Ethiopia, eight hours drive from the capital. With increased aid and its own resources, the Ethiopian government has been able to extend the treatment of deadly childhood illnesses like diarrhoea and pneumonia, with a new army of equipped and empowered community health workers. I was shown a meticulously maintained record book listing each patient that came in – mainly children – with names, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. The final column on the ledger was headed “outcome”; in each row, the entry almost invariably contained a single word: “better”. The same was true in one clinic after another. Seeing that combination of real, micro-level data with demonstrable success and progress was exhilarating. I wished that every white-band wearer in the world could have stood there too and read that roll call of hope. Perhaps the most profound change is in the perceived achievability of Make Poverty History’s mission. In 2005, despite Nelson Mandela’s insistence that extreme poverty could be overcome just like slavery and apartheid, many observers – and even some campaigners – assumed it was an unreachable pipedream.
Ten years on, that aim of ensuring that nobody should live in absolute poverty by 2030 is set to be enshrined in the sustainable development goals, which will be signed by world leaders at the UN this September. The campaign slogan has become the first item on the world’s to-do list. And the reason for that new sense of possibility? We’re halfway there. The extreme poverty figure has dropped from 43% of the world’s people in 1990 to 21% in 2010. And it’s continuing to fall. The virtual elimination of extreme poverty in the next 15 years won’t be easy – in fact, it will be an increasingly hard slog. But nobody now says it cannot be done. The question is whether we will choose to do it. Policymakers need to start to answer that question this month when they gather for the financing for development summit due to be held, neatly, in Addis Ababa – capital city of the country that became a byword for famine 30 years ago and is now at the frontline of the data-driven fight to end hunger and extreme poverty for good. If the map of poverty and development has transformed in 10 years, the way we run campaigns has changed almost as much – and that’s a change for the better, too. Networks like Avaaz and change.org, unheard of in 2005, have harnessed internet and social media platforms to put power in people’s hands and turn leadership pyramids upside down. A growing movement of global citizens is forming. And that movement is more authentic and representative than ever, no longer directed from Washington, New York or London. One’s membership of nearly 7 million people includes 2 million from Africa. After watching 250 One youth ambassadors from across Europe and beyond, who came (with some very big balloons) to southern Germany for last month’s G7 summit, I know we are in great shape for the fight ahead. These are smart, savvy, passionate advocates who know their facts. They also know that facts are nothing without activism – and activism means little unless we take it to where decisions are made, get them changed, and hold decision-makers accountable. Not so different from Make Poverty History perhaps, at its best. But – I hope – more global, more sustainable and more empowering. Oh, and now we can tweet about it too. • Adrian Lovett is Europe executive director at the One Campaign",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/06/make-poverty-history-campaign-gleneagles-sustainable-development-goals,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jul/06/make-poverty-history-campaign-gleneagles-sustainable-development-goals
2015-07-06T06:00:05Z,global-development,Global development,"In global healthcare, quality and access are what matters – not who delivers it | Joanna Buckley and Serufusa Sekidde","When the UN financing for development conference begins in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, there’s likely to be a big elephant in the room: the private sector. Some commentators have warned of the possible implications of pursuing “ultra-free market” ideologies that see private companies as key providers of basic public services. Ignoring the private sector rather than working with it would seem like the most morally defensible approach when faced with the prospect of large corporations “selling” health and education services with the sole objective of turning a profit.
Sometimes, though – whether we like it or not – the private sector might be our only option. Take fragile and conflict-affected states: the World Bank estimates that more than 1.2 billion people live in countries affected by widespread conflict and political unrest. The UK Department for International Development and other donors have flagged these countries as a “priority category”. Given their vulnerability, fragile and conflict-affected states simply do not have access to the large amounts of state expenditure needed to provide widespread coverage of basic services. World Health Organisation data from 2013 shows that in Afghanistan, government expenditure on health amounted to just 21% of total health expenditure (compared with 84% in the UK). Donors are also unlikely to commit to long-term aid funding where they can’t easily link this expenditure to immediate, tangible outcomes – an unrealistic expectation in fragile states where, by definition, the focus needs to be on long-term systemic change. In these contexts, it is hardly surprising that privately run services step in to plug the gap. In Somalia, despite the population having one of the lowest rates of GDP per capita in the world, the private sector delivers more than 60% of the country’s healthcare services. In these situations, where the private sector is already a fixture, the question is not how to prevent companies from filling the gap left by ineffective state structures, but rather how to work with these companies to ensure the gap-filling is good enough to promote positive, lasting impact.
There are some fundamental areas that need addressing. First, a lack of regulatory frameworks and inspection procedures can result in huge negative social and economic consequences. Our work, investigating private healthcare provision in Somalia, highlighted some disturbing results: the proliferation and sale of unregulated and potentially dangerous pharmaceutical products not only puts patients at risk but is also likely to lead to a greater burden on public health services when remedial treatments are needed further down the line. Poor market oversight can also make life difficult for businesses trying to tailor their products and services to appropriate customer bases. In Somalia, the unfettered boom in hospitals and smaller clinics has made it difficult for enterprises to differentiate themselves, resulting in negative competition that benefits neither the business nor the customer. The public sector has a key role to play in addressing these issues, helping to ensure the introduction and enforcement of minimum standards and accreditations. This will necessitate meaningful collaboration between the sectors – working with, rather than against, private enterprises. In some cases, NGOs are stepping in to fill the void. In Somaliland, PSI’s network of recognisable BulshoKaab Pharmacies is a good example of a successful attempt to give credibility to quality services in an ever-expanding marketplace. In Somaliland and Puntland, we are seeing the emergence of informal referral systems whereby the private sector sends emergency cases to the public sector, and public sector facilities pass on cases requiring specialist skills and equipment to their private sector counterparts. We found a general desire among health workers to formalise these relationships to help improve basic efficiencies – for example, by establishing systems allowing data on the availability of beds to be shared. In critically vulnerable environments, it is clearly important that we work with what is already in place to support the delivery of basic services. Private sector facilities spring up to plug the gap left behind by weak public institutions and a lack of capacity and funding. Their continued existence is testament to the demand for them. While this might not be to everyone’s ideological taste, it is sometimes the reality on the ground. In fragile and conflict-affected states, it is often the only reality. The public sector has an important role to play in promoting the regulation and oversight of these services, ensuring they are really working for the customers they aim – and claim – to serve. Sustainable development goal 17 talks of engaging with the private sector to help “strengthen the global partnership for sustainable development”. It is time to catch up with private service providers to ensure this engagement is truly sustainable. What should matter is quality and access. Not who delivers it.

2015-07-05T09:49:00Z,global-development,Global development,Julia Gillard urges action on lack of schooling for 121m children worldwide,"The world needs to step up its efforts to tackle the crisis of 121 million children, particularly girls, who receive no formal schooling, Julia Gillard, the former Australian prime minister, has warned. Speaking before a major education summit in Norway, Gillard said the world was at a pivotal moment in tackling millions of children growing up without basic schooling, in much the same way as the need to address global health issues reached a tipping point in the early 2000s. She said it was not just a moral imperative to give everyone the right to go to school but better educated parents would help prevent infant mortality and lift people out of poverty. “The poorest girls will get there a full 70 years after the richest boys. The gap is startling,” she said. “There is a moral, rights-based reason why we’ve got to educate every girl, but there’s also a practical development outcomes if we do educate girls. “We know that if we educated every girl, we would see infant deaths plummet by 3 million. We know that if women are educated children are more likely to survive childhood, more likely to be vaccinated, that economies grow because women have got the capability to work and direct that financing back to their families. Educating girls is win, win, win all round.” Nine in 10 school-age children around the world get a primary education but there are still about 121 million children of primary and lower secondary age who are not in school. Of the 58 million not in primary school, about 31 million are girls. Gillard, who is chair of the board of the Global Partnership for Education, said there was a lot of positive energy around the need for more international cooperation on education for millions of unschooled children, led by people such as Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton and Gordon Brown, who is now the UN special envoy on education. “Born of tragedy, there has been a far greater focus by leaders on girls’ education – the shooting of Malala Yousafzai (who will attend the summit) and the dreadful circumstances of the Nigerian schoolgirls – has galvanised the world community.” Speaking to the Guardian before the Oslo Summit on Education for Development, Gillard said she was “convinced this is an important moment for everyone to take a big step up”, with discussions on girls’ education, and how to provide emergency schooling for children fleeing conflict zones like Syria. They will also talk about a new financing commission to raise money from donors to leverage national education budgets. Gillard, who was prime minister of Australia for three years before being ousted by her predecessor Kevin Rudd in 2013, said her biggest passion was fighting for better education throughout the world now that she had retired from politics. “The motivating force throughtout my life and work in politics has been access to education and opportunity so I find it truly heartbreaking that we can look at our world and contemplate that it could be 100 years before girls get basic education, let alone full access to education,” she said. As the first female prime minister of Australia, Gillard gained renown for her so-called “misogyny speech”, taking now-prime minister Tony Abbott to task over sexist attitudes. Having written a book about her experiences in politics, she has spoken in the past three weeks on a visit to the UK about how women need to call out sexism when they encounter it and argued they must not let it dissuade them from putting themselves forward, especially in male-dominated environments. Gillard said fighting for better education for girls was one of the central battles for feminism. “We know at current rate of change it won’t be until the start of the next century that the first cohort of sub-Saharan girls universally get to go to primary school and 100 years is far too long to wait,” Gillard said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/05/gillard-urges-action-on-lack-of-schooling-millions-of-children-worldwide,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/jul/05/gillard-urges-action-on-lack-of-schooling-millions-of-children-worldwide
2015-07-03T14:14:17Z,global-development,Global development,What will $32bn do to solve the world's problems? | Sam Jones,"On Wednesday, a Saudi Arabian billionaire, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, announced he would donate his $32bn (£20bn) fortune to charity over the coming years. The decision, he said, had been motivated by his life-long commitment to helping to build a “more peaceful, equitable and sustainable world for generations to come”. If the money were split equally among the eight programmes the prince suggested – with $4bn going to each – what might it achieve? Here are some of the options. Modernisation and infrastructure A $4bn investment would buy 600km of standard gauge railway between Nairobi and Mombasa. Alternatively, it would cover two 600 megawatt hydropower stations on the Nile in Uganda. The full $32bn, meanwhile, could take energy supplies to more than half the places off the grid in Africa (source: Overseas Development Institute). Poverty alleviation A $4bn windfall would go about 80% of the way to ensuring every person in the Democratic Republic of the Congo – one of the poorest countries on the planet – has access to basic services such as health and education (source: ONE campaign). The same sum would cover the funding gap for essential health and education services for everyone in Tanzania, Zambia and Liberia (source: ONE campaign). Disaster relief $4bn would cover the total bill to help the Syrian refugees who have fled to nearby countries, providing essentials like clean water, adequate shelter and food assistance (source: Oxfam). A $4bn injection would fully fund roughly 20% of the current worldwide humanitarian needs. Or, more specifically, it would just about cover the gap in funding for the entire Syrian regional refugee response and the funding gap on South Sudan combined (source: Care International). The same sum would almost cover the funding gap for 12 other ongoing humanitarian crises around the world (source: Care International). Education and empowering children With support worth $4bn, the 58 million children left behind by the millennium development goal on education would be able to go to primary school (source: Care International). Just $500,000 could enable 1,000 schools in Pakistan to use the latest technology to plan, prepare and manage against the risk of attacks, enabling children to attend school more safely. The sum would cover the creation of school safety strategies using analytical software, and working with communities to implement them (source: Unicef). A $1,000,000 investment would enable 10,000 nomadic children in Eritrea to go to school. This could include establishing new nomadic learning centres, expanding existing ones, and training teachers to enable the most marginalised children to access their right to a quality education for the long term (source: Unicef). $3.2bn would feed the 66 million school-aged children who go hungry. Being well-nourished would give poorer children a far greater chance of getting an education and bringing themselves out of poverty through better paid work (source: Oxfam). Promotion of health For $4bn, more than 12 million people could be provided with antiretroviral drugs – more than the total number of people living with HIV/Aids across the least developed countries. Alternatively, the money would pay for 190 million children to be fully vaccinated, saving more than 6 million lives (source: One campaign). Spending $4bn on water and sanitation services would also go a long way to relieving a health crisis that kills 1,400 children every day (source: WaterAid). A $4bn investment would also build 666m basic pit latrines, or 111m improved latrines – which include a ventilation pipe and mesh to reduce odours – to serve 555 million people (source: WaterAid). With $4bn, it would also be possible to reach as many as 167 million of the 179 million people living in the 17 countries worst off for access to clean water. Assuming there were no other obstacles, that means every person who right now lives without water in Angola, Chad, DRC, Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Haiti, Madagascar, Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger, Tanzania and Papua New Guinea (source: WaterAid). Empowering women Given that the median income of women’s rights organisations worldwide is $20,000 a year, $4bn would fund 10,000 women’s rights organisations for 20 years (source: Mama Cash). Eradicating disease A $4bn injection would buy a four-year supply of the 11 World Health Organisation recommended-vaccines for use in 73 countries (source: Gavi, the vaccine alliance).",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/03/saudi-prince-alwaleed-32bn-fortune-charity-world-problems,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jul/03/saudi-prince-alwaleed-32bn-fortune-charity-world-problems
2015-07-03T12:00:00Z,global-development,Global development,"Murder, drug cartels and misery counter Argentina's claims of falling poverty | Patrick Greenfield","The gangland murder of four youths in a notorious slum in the south of Buenos Aires came as little surprise to residents. The victims of last April’s attack had each been shot in the head by hitmen amid an ongoing turf war between rival gangs. Known as “villas miserias” – literally, “slums of misery” – the sprawls of redbrick shacks that punctuate the Parisian-style architecture of the Argentinian capital have become synonymous with violence. These marginal neighbourhoods have little or no state presence to oppose the growing influence of drug cartels. Despite often being located in urban centres, most residents do not have access to mains electricity, running water or sewers. In 2013, the NGO Techo identified 1,834 of these informal settlements across Argentina, saying they were home to 500,000 families. In Buenos Aires alone, the number of people living in villas miserias grew by about 50% between 2001 and 2010. These fringe communities have become the focal point of the fight against poverty in the South American country, with investment from the government and NGOs focused on providing basic services and integrating them into wider society. After Argentina’s devastating debt default in 2001/2, a boom in social security spending did much to sustain high growth rates. But the success of these social programmes has been threatened by another default and an inflation-inducing currency devaluation last year. This bleak picture seems to sound a false note given the government’s claims that Argentina has one of the lowest poverty rates in the world. At a UN Food and Agriculture Organisation summit in Rome in June, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner said the poverty rate was now lower than 5%, compared with a crippling 54% in 2003. When Aníbal Fernández, head of the Argentine cabinet, was later asked on national radio if the country had truly achieved a poverty rate lower than, say, Norway, Denmark and Germany, he replied: “Yes, although you might not like it and it is difficult for you to accept. Countries like Germany are having a difficult time with poverty.” Even discounting the fact that poverty rates in Germany and other European countries are based on different calculations, the validity of figures published by Argentina’s Indec statistics agency has long been challenged. “In terms of ‘fiddling the figures’, the [Fernández presidency] has considerable form – from cooking the books on inflation, to massaging growth data and … fudging poverty data,” said Colin M Lewis, professor emeritus and Argentina expert at the London School of Economics. “A regime that presents itself as a champion of the poor has even more reason than most for making exaggerated claims about poverty reduction, particularly as inflation accelerates and a decline in the rate of inequality appears to be stalling,” he added.
It is widely acknowledged that Indec has long published an artificially low consumer price index (CPI). Private economists estimate inflation at more than 25%, while the government has said it is about 15%. But despite evidence of creative accounting, there has also been real progress in tackling poverty, some analysts say. “The reason why the president has high approval ratings of around 50% is that many people have seen their living standards rise – unemployment is low and average wages have risen faster than prices during her tenure, even when you use the estimates of inflation favoured by the opposition,” said Paul Segal, a senior economics lecturer at King’s College London. Argentina measures its poverty rate by calculating the number of people who cannot afford a basic basket of goods and services, such as education and housing. This basket is directly linked to the CPI, which statisticians say can lead to abuse. “If inflation is high, the basket value increases, and therefore poverty increases. This is politically inexpedient for a president whose election, and continued popularity, is partially grounded in a promise to reduce poverty,” said Christopher Wylde, associate professor of international relations at Richmond, the American International University in London. “Manipulating the official inflation rate serves a wider set of priorities, and its impact on poverty data could be interpreted as somewhat tangential. These wider priorities include: lower repayments on inflation-indexed bonds, better gross domestic product data … the impact on the real effective exchange rate and the concomitant impact on balance of payments through the trade channel, and a better bargaining position with unions, who use inflation data to negotiate pay increases,” Wylde said. An independent study by the Universidad Católica Argentina, released in April last year and using more realistic CPI data, reported a poverty rate of roughly 26% in 2013. Away from the rarefied air of pure statistics, in the low shacks of the villas miserias, people echo the charges of official exaggeration and manipulation, grounding their anger in daily deprivations. “In our neighbourhoods, entire families are homeless and there’s no drinkable water. Where is this ‘reduction in poverty’?” said Viviana, an NGO advocate who works in a slum in the gentrified barrio of Retiro in Buenos Aires. She did not want to give her last name for fear of harassment by the authorities. “It’s a joke that the president would announce that [poverty rate] to the world. That number, so untenable to the Argentine eye, is something she’d never say to the people who live in las villas miserias. That’s only something she could have said in Rome.” Indec has agreed to reform its methodology on measuring inflation and poverty but, given that no fresh data on poverty has been published since December 2013, it seems unlikely anything will change before legislative and presidential elections in October. Fernández, whose Front for Victory party has held power since 2003, is barred from standing for a third consecutive term. With persistent economic instability, fears about the prevalence of drug cartels and a creeping fiscal deficit, the ghosts of 2001 haunt every Argentine politician.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/03/argentina-murder-drug-cartels-misery-counter-poverty-claims,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jul/03/argentina-murder-drug-cartels-misery-counter-poverty-claims

My name’s Hugh Muir. This July in Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, they’ll host the UN’s third international conference on Financing for Development. Member states will decide on how the sustainable development goals, the blueprint for development priorities over the next 15 years will be financed. Global development’s Clár Ní Chonghaile went to a panel discussion called Financing the Future at the Overseas Development Institute and asked participants what they hoped the Addis meeting would deliver. CNC This July in Ethiopia the UN will hold its third international conference on financing for development. This is ahead of September’s summit to ratify the sustainable development goals. The challenge facing member states in Addis Ababa will be deciding how to pay for this ambitious set of goals that will drive development priorities over the next 15 years. The issues are complex and cover everything from aid and taxes through to the role of the private sector and trade, but success is crucial if the SDGs are to be achieved by 2030. GR My name’s is Gideon Rabinowitz, I’m a research officer here at the Overseas Development Institute. I think the best possible outcomes are that we get commitments that allow for momentum on aid and international public finance to continue into the future. So we currently have in the proposed text for the agreement that developed countries will deliver 0.7% of their national income as ODA by 2020. That really gives campaigners and advocates a hook to really push their governments to deliver and scale up their aid in the coming years, which is great. So we need to keep that language there. AR I’m Andrew Rogerson. I’m from ODI. Maintain their promises – that’s on the volume of ODA – but also on its composition. They need to spend a lot more on the poorer countries proportionally. CNC The UN’s 0.7% target has, so far, proved elusive. That is why campaigners want Addis to spell out a clear re-commitment to the 45-year-old target. Rupert Simons, chief executive of Publish What You Fund, says member states must be ambitious if the SDGs are to leave no one behind. RS I think it’s critical to get a good outcome at Addis but it’s not just about getting an outcome – anyone can get an outcome and sign on the dotted line. The key is that the outcome be ambitious and, above all, be universal. So where I see Addis coming in is that we’re moving from an MDG agenda, which is what the north does to the south, to a universal agenda, which is everyone in the world collaboratively moving to a better future. We’re not currently on track for that sort of outcome in Addis. CNC One of the problems will be balancing the needs and responsibilities of all the member states, from emerging economies to fragile states to richer, traditional donors.
GR The major powers are looking for ways to opt out of some of the commitments. There’s an agenda at the moment that unless the emerging economies put something on the table, that the developed countries won’t come along and make additional commitments. Well that, to me, isn’t sufficient justification for not making a commitment. The emerging economies have only recently come to prominence in the global economy. It’s the developed countries that need to be showing the way and they shouldn’t be using the emerging economies as an excuse not to deliver on their commitments. AR Some of them who are still classified as developing countries but are very emerging power houses can also do an awful lot, not necessarily in the form of gifts but in the form of loans, in the form of trade and so on. So they need to be part of a more responsible global system. CNC Another talking point at Addis will be how to harness alternative streams of financing to supplement traditional aid flows. Some governments want to use the private sector to help kick-start development; but others are concerned about whether such projects will have enough of a focus on improving the lives of the poorest. AD I’m Amy Dodd from the UK Aid Network. I think it’s not unreasonable to say that we need to be looking at other forms of financing and what developing countries, particularly the Brics, for example, can be doing. But realistically it feels to me that there was a kind of historic responsibility. Aid is something we promised to do over half a century ago, it feels like something we need to deliver. And so I can see a certain unwillingness, particularly from southern partners, that actually, you know, we just haven’t lived up to those commitments. BS My name’s Bianca Sheed and I’m from SAB Miller. I think there’s a great deal of interest from the private sector in Addis, and what the expectation will be. And what the expectations of financing are as far as the private sector is concerned. CNC A positive outcome at Addis will be welcomed, and will set the stage for the September meeting and also a critical summit on climate change this December. From there, the next step will be ensuring that financial pledges can be reliably tracked and monitored. RS The most important commitment for us at Publish What You Fund is that all financial flows, whether they are north-south, south-south or private investment, be transparent and accountable. We don’t have that currently. We have made some progress towards it in the world of aid transparency, but a lot of the Addis Ababa accord, if that’s what we can call it, is about broadening financial flows to include the south and to include private flows, and we need to make sure that transparency is also applied to those flows. If it’s not, then we will leave the power in the hands of those who have the information; and that is overwhelmingly rich countries and investors, and we’re, once again, cutting out the poor and the supposed beneficiaries of those financial flows. HM Global development’s Clár Ní Chonghaile. And joining me live in the Guardian studios here in London to discuss these issues are Tim Jones, policy officer at the Jubilee Debt Campaign; Paddy Carter, one of the lead authors of the ODI’s report on how international public finance can help eradicate poverty; and on the phone is Jean Letitia Saldanha, senior policy advisor from CIDSE, or International Cooperation for Development and Solidarity. Welcome to all of you. So you heard in the report there a wish list of outcomes from the summit in Addis Ababa. Let’s start with the proposal that member states deliver 0.7% of their national income as official development assistance by 2020. Only five member states reached that target last year, so how likely do you think it is that we’ll get a firm commitment. Let me start with you, Tim. Do you expect the meeting in Addis to light a fire under those states. That’s most countries that haven’t met the commitment so far, do you think that that will improve? TJ The evidence isn’t that great at the moment. But of course the aid part of it is only one part of the negotiations, so there are many ways of generating finance and aid is an important part of that. But also the other ways of finding finance through countries being able to keep their own resources through tackling tax avoidance, capital flight – those are going to be just as important in negotiations as well. HM Paddy Carter, your report for the ODI said, and I’ll quote you here: “If we stick to business as usual, we’ll fall far short of our development goals in 2030.” And I think you listed five recommendations to make sure that member states at Addis actually find a way to meet those goals. Just very quickly take us through those. PC Some of our recommendations were of a quite technical nature to do with how we think the delivery of international public finance could change to deliver the sustainable development goals. So, for example, one of the problems we identified is that in the lowest income countries in the world at the moment, there’s basically no social protection programmes, or at least it’s very fragmented and small scale. So we have been suggesting the creation of a new multi-lateral financing facility to accelerate the introduction and expansion of social protection in the world’s poorest countries. And really without such action, the ambition of leaving no one behind will really just be empty words. HM Jean, you heard that. Do you think that’s a good way forward? JLS Absolutely. I mean I think that the proposals that ODA makes in their report are absolutely plausible. The question is the reality on the ground in the negotiations. I’m here in New York following these negotiations, and why we would like all this to happen on the ground. And in fact it has to happen, as ODI forecasted – if it does not we’re going to still have extreme poverty, etc. But here in New York we’re seeing that reality is far from delivering what we all want, and there is a whole lot of bargaining at the moment, even to have any kind of commitment in the outcome of Addis. On the one side the northern countries want the southern countries to commit. And on the other side southern countries want the northern countries to commit. HM Now we heard there just a bit earlier that phrase “leave no-one behind” – that’s the mantra for the sustainable development goals. Tim, in your view, how much pressure is there on the donor countries? And could the aims of the SDG prove just to be too much of a financial burden for at least some of them? TJ I don’t think it could be too much for most donor countries because ultimately the amounts of public finance being talked about are still very small for them. And although we’ve had this financial crisis we’ve been going through, the reality is there are still huge amounts of money in northern countries, and that governments maybe aren’t accessing it through getting the money in through tax, but it’s certainly there. The deeper challenge is to… why do we give aid money? Is it about redistributing wealth around the world; is it about addressing past wrongs? And if we answer that question that can help us work out who are the people who should be contributing, whether it is those who have caused problems for countries in the past through colonialism or through their policies imposed on countries in the 80s and 90s. If it’s about redistribution we can look at the countries that have the most wealth in the world and work out how they should redistribute it. There’s, as I said, there’s also the fact that, for example, sub-Saharan Africa actually gives more money to the rest of the world than it receives. So we’ve also got to tackle that side of the equation as well as just the donor giving money in the first place. HM Jean Letitia Saldanha in New York what are your views on this? Are we expecting too much, particularly from the southern countries? JLS I completely agree with Tim that northern countries have a particular responsibility. Southern countries are, in fact, net creditors. Donor countries made commitments based on an acknowledgement of a particular responsibility, historical or otherwise, way back 40 years ago. So I think that southern countries in their circumstances at certain times may be able to contribute overall to sustainable development. And I do believe that every country has to make efforts, but northern countries have a very specific responsibility in this regard. HM So everyone has to do their bit. Paddy, what about the emerging economies, how much should we be expecting from them? PC Well they’re already doing a lot. From memory I think that if you think about financial flows which resemble foreign aid – although the emerging economies don’t like to think of themselves as aid donors – that type of financial flow is already up to about 12% of global aid flows. And they have a lot more to offer besides money. So, for instance, China is well known to know a thing or two about infrastructure investment; and Brazil, returning to my earlier point about social protection, economies like Brazil are famous for having implemented large-scale social protection programmes; so they can bring a lot in terms of technical assistance. However, the sort of emerging economy view on development assistance is that it’s more like a private act between consenting governments than it is something which international agreements, such as what we’re going to be seeing at Addis, have much to do with. So I think that they’re going to be a bit resistant to coming up with some of the things that some of the rich countries might want them to commit to. And instead we’ll see them contribute just because they perceive it to be in their interest. HM So let’s just change tack a little bit because I want to focus, for a moment, on tax. How much is tax avoidance by multinationals an issue? And could this really be a major source of funding for the SDGs? To answer that question we sent our producer, Kary Stewart, on to the streets of London on a treasure hunt. “That’s right. So who here enjoys paying tax?” KS No one really likes to pay tax but without it much of the infrastructure that we take for granted would not be possible. Multinationals, however, are routinely exploiting loopholes which allow them to avoid paying taxes, often by using tax havens. The result is that developing countries are estimated to lose tax revenues that are worth almost three times what they get from developed countries in aid. So how are corporates implicated? We went out on a treasure hunt on the streets of London to find out. NA My name is Natasha Adams and I’m the activism officer at ActionAid. I came to do a piece of research looking at where a lot of the headquarters of the corporates that ActionAid has exposed for tax dodging in developing countries were – they’re actually in quite a small area of London, around Mayfair. And so it made sense to put this tour together. It was actually Tom’s idea. He’s the guy who runs the tour with me.
Tom Indeed. So welcome one and all to Mayfair. It’s nice around here, isn’t it? What do you guys think? Do you think it’s nice around here? NA A piece of research that ActionAid did actually showed that 98 of the FTSE 100 companies are using tax havens just routinely. So it’s not really a question of who is the worst offender, we’re rather trying to highlight something that it is endemic. KS A report by the UN Conference on Trade and Development estimated that profit-shifting by multinational companies costs developing countries $100bn a year in lost corporate income tax. Another report, by IMF researchers, estimated that developing countries may be losing as much as $213bn a year to tax avoidance. “So if you hear people complaining about international aid, we really need to keep this in perspective. The money that poor countries lose to tax dodging is so much more than total global aid flows. It could be a really good source of sustainable funding for development…” KS So why are funds raised by taxation so central to development? Taxes give states resources to invest in essentials such as education, roads and healthcare. As countries become wealthier, taxes fund social welfare and pensions, reducing poverty and inequality and evening out aggregate demand. “Really lovely window displays. Every time we’ve stopped here which will be perfect for your tax haven island…” KS Over the last decade the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the OECD, has been working to encourage countries to agree to higher standards of transparency, and also to an exchange of information in tax matters. These efforts have gained global endorsement from the G20 and the UN. However, many argue that poorer countries are often left out of the discussions altogether.
AD One of the biggest problems in terms of how the global tax system is designed is that poorer countries don’t have a fair say in deciding on how the global tax rules are set up. So most of those decisions are made at an OECD level which means that the poorest countries, they just have no say. KS In fact lower income countries are in a trap where lack of funding results in below-par administrative structures which make it difficult to collect taxes. A June report published by the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation calls for the abolition of the separate entity principle. The establishment of an international tax system could be one of the most effective ways for donor countries to help developing countries mobilise their own resources. “We don’t know exactly how big the tax bill should be because of the kind of secrecy element we discussed earlier, but I’m pretty sure it will be a lot more than 10 million...” KS Unlocking tax, and creating transparent global tax system are at the heart of discussions about how to fund development and end inequality. That’s why these will be the hot button topics when UN members meet up in Addis next month. “It’s very, very clear that using tax havens to avoid paying tax in countries where some of the poorest people in the world are…” HM So what we see there is I suppose what we knew – multinationals are clever at avoiding tax. Tim, if these loopholes were tackled in Addis, to what extent would that contribute to financing for the SDGs? TJ It could be huge. It’s been estimated that the amount of tax avoided in developing countries is three times the current level of aid. And ultimately what everybody wants to move towards is a system where there is no need for aid, that countries are able to collect all the tax revenue they need to meet all their basic services. So this is a big issue and needs to be very high up on the agenda of the negotiations. HM Paddy, tax will only take us so far though, won’t it? I think in your report you said that even if developing countries raise taxes and use the existing aid there, there will still be a shortfall of about $73bn in terms of the amounts needed to eradicate poverty? PC That’s right. And we were only focusing really on a very small piece of the jigsaw, which is health, social protection and education. So there’s a fundamental problem of a huge shortfall of the resources available to countries in the developing world. And regarding taxation, whilst it makes sense to focus on things that have international solutions, in an international conference such as Addis Ababa it should be remembered that really there’s an awful lot of domestic problems with tax avoidance. And whilst a lot of focus rightly goes on multinational corporations, a lot of the big problems are things like tax exemptions offered by governments in the developing world. It isn’t a matter of tax avoidance or evasion, it’s simply government policy. HM Jean, you talked up the idea of inter-governmental tax bodies in developing countries. Would that be a good idea, would that be the answer? JLS Let me first respond to the previous comment: I do think indeed that there is an issue with the tax policies of countries. And that’s very much related to tax competition. We right now see a race to the bottom in terms of countries basically putting their corporate taxes down to zero or even in the negative to attract investment, particularly foreign investment. Now the only way we’ve seen a way out of this is for greater cooperation, first of all. So we do believe that there is a reason for international tax cooperation to be discussed in a conference like in Addis Ababa, because we assume that recognising that multilateralism isn’t the only way to respond to this problem, there will be an agreement on greater international cooperation. Now we see that the OECD has not yet been able to broker this kind of international cooperation. In fact we’ve heard, time and again, we have evidence, that the current international tax regime is not working particularly for developing countries. Now it is an issue of cooperating on tax rates, but it is also an issue of who sets the standards and norms. And that is why we say that we need a new space, a more open and democratic space – in the UN preferably – where we can have a more, I suppose, democratic discussion on how standards are set, how to negotiate the terms of international cooperation. And that’s what the reasoning and the arguments behind the need for a new international tax body are. HM Tim, what do you think – is that the answer, or even part of an answer? TJ Yes, a UN tax body is definitely part of the answer that there needs to be something created that actually deals with the particular problem of developing countries to tackle issues like companies reporting on their tax payments by country – automatically exchanging that information. And Paddy said, and he’s entirely right, that there’s a major problem of tax exemptions in countries but this all comes from a philosophy for the last 30 years of whatever private sector money you can get is good. And it’s just a nonsense. Private sector investment can mean many things. It can mean buying up assets which already exist. It can be structuring loans in a way in which to avoid tax. It can be actually creating far higher burdens for governments than they would have had if they’d invested themselves. So, unfortunately, in this conference, the western countries like the EU and US are really pushing the private sector as a crucial part of the solution. But that is not being examined as to what actually that means. And there needs to be far more subtlety around what the private sector is and isn’t, and a lot more questions saying these are the government policies that are needed to make development happen rather than just an asset-stripping that is too often the case at the moment. HM And of course the private sector needs to turn a buck, so is that really the answer in developing countries where they won’t have such a return on their investment? What do you think, Paddy?
PC Well, I mean, people tend to throw around the word “private sector” but as Tim has said it can mean an awful lot of different things from just the pure provision of money to entrepreneurs building businesses and employing people. And when it comes to certain priorities I’ve been involved a little bit with Uneca, the UN African Commission for Economics. All they want to talk about is growth, structural transformation, infrastructure, manufacturing and that is all … well it’s not all about the private sector but evidently private sector is a huge part of that. And I don’t think we should think that the emphasis on the private sector is an entirely northern imposition. HM Jean, in New York, what other innovative financing methods do you think could be used and should be on the table in Addis to maybe give the SDG agenda some teeth? JLS If you ask me what my wish was I would think that innovative mechanisms we have been discussing for ages – which would be a double whammy and would not only raise revenues which could be channelled to sustainable development but also have systemic impacts – would be the innovative finance mechanisms on the table. So for a long time we’ve had the Robin Hood Tax, the financial transaction tax that civil society has been calling for implementation. This tax would not only raise billions if it would be a full tax-based FTT. But it would also address very volatile financial flows. Unfortunately what we are seeing in the current negotiations is that these kind of mechanisms are totally off the table, and right now the focus is very much talking about innovation in the kind of financing instruments whereby public money would be used to leverage private finance. I think we can have a debate on leveraging and blending. I do not think there is anything innovative about that. But what we are saying is that we have to tread very cautiously before we rush into considering that. Private investment with a little bit of public money to protect it or to guarantee it will be the only response to the huge financing gaps that we face to reach the SDGs. HM Tim Jones from the Jubilee Debt Campaign, you’ve been to a lot of these conferences and I suppose they’re not a byword for innovative thinking. But were there to be some blue-sky thinking in Addis, what would you like to see in terms of financing? TJ Yes, I mean, just one other innovative financing thing would be the idea of quantitative easing for development. We’ve seen, over recent years, western countries creating money as a response to crisis. That is actually something that could be done globally, and done to deal with the fact that all finance at the moment is cyclical; in the good times there’s more of it around, in the bad times there’s less and so in the bad times to do that. But I think another thing that needs to be part of the debate is the mechanisms to deal with the problems that are created when finance goes wrong. So one of the big things that happened over the previous last period of the MDGs was debt cancellation for 36 countries, which has rapidly cut their debt payments and freed up more resources. The danger is in ten years’ time many of those countries could be back in debt crisis because of the current amount of lending that’s been given and also things like public-private partnerships which hide dangerous amounts of debt for countries. So what we’d like to see is mechanisms to prevent those crises being created – debt resolution mechanisms to deal with debt problems when they arise. And also to tell the private sector they’ll no longer be bailed out if they help cause debt problems. HM Paddy, I think you’ll be going, won’t you? So when they call on you, as I am sure they will, and say suggest something to us that we haven’t thought of in terms of financing, something innovative, what would you say? PC Well, you’re asking me a tough one there – there aren’t that many new ideas under the sun. I’m going to be going there and we will be just making the fact that both in terms of the magnitude and the allocation of international public finance it’s just utterly inconsistent with this stated ambition of no one left behind. Particularly, we show in our report, the very poorest countries, under $500 a year per capita – these countries get the least amount of aid per capita than the slightly richer ones. So the reality on the ground is completely inconsistent with the words in all these agreements. HM So, you’d basically just be asking them to match words with deeds? PC That’s a good way of putting it. HM OK. It’s coming towards the end now, but let’s talk about sustainable development because obviously that can’t be separated from efforts to deal with climate change. They’ll be a separate UN summit in Paris in December to do with climate change, but how do you think that this financing conference in Addis will affect that conference, if at all, or how would you like it to? Tim? TJ Well one of the, if not the crucial issue, in the climate change negotiations has always been the countries that are most responsible for causing climate change historically providing the money to enable countries that will suffer the most from climate change, the poorest countries, to be able to deal with the consequences. And to provide the money to enable countries to grow in a low-carbon way. And so whether or not the Addis conference shows a political willingness to find the mechanisms to raise that money will be crucial for whether the Paris climate conference can actually deliver on signing up to goals that will keep us within safe limits on climate change. HM Paddy, do you think there will be any connection between the two; what connection should there be? PC I’m really not sure what to expect. I mean there are some really intractable problems here. The first one is that everybody wants there to be new and fresh money made available for fighting climate change, but it’s really impossible for governments to convincingly say, “Hey this money is genuinely new and not just substituting for money we would have spent on something else.” And the other one is where the donor grant funds should be spent in countries like China and India to mitigate climate change, because obviously there’s a very strong argument that these are the economies which urgently need to be put on a sustainable carbon path, so that’s very straightforward. But then other people worry that as soon as you open the door to grant money being sent to those countries for those purposes, there’s going to be a huge sucking sound as all the money leaves Africa and goes over there. And I’m glad it’s not me that has to resolve these problems. HM Jean, do you think that climate change is something that they should have high on the agenda in Addis or would that be overload? JLS I think that climate, inevitably, is on the Addis agenda because Addis is about agreements on the international financial system; and whether we like it or not the international financial system – how it is governed, the rules, etc – are going to impact on how we deal with climate. Simply to give an example of how climate finance will be delivered; even though they’re not going to agree on the pot of money for climate finance, if they are going to continue to talk about PPPs, about leveraging, very correctly as Paddy said, most of the money is going to go to the most stable economies, in middle income countries. And we’re going to see fragile states, LDCs, losing out a lot. And this is going to impact hugely on their growth prospects in a climate-challenged world. Also we’re going to see an increase in debt distress, particularly in small island developing countries and this is genuinely going to create problems, not only for them to address the basic human needs of their population, but more broadly, to be able to address greater climate chaos that they are going to be on the frontlines of. There are various ways … I mean if you talk about debt, if you talk about new buffer mechanisms that are going to be discussed to increase their climate resilience – all these kind of issues that are going to be addressed in Addis are going to impact on prospects, particularly for countries that are deeply affected by climate change. HM So there’s a lot for them to talk about. Surveying the prospects there from New York, Jean, just finally – are you optimistic? How likely is it that there will be a positive deal in Addis? JLS Let me say it this way: I would like to be optimistic but if I sit in every day in the negotiations, my heart is sinking deeper and deeper. I think there is still a chance, I still think there is a chance that the outcome of the Addis Ababa conference is saved and we get a strong agreement, which will be absolutely necessary for Paris. But that will take a lot of political will on all sides to reach that agreement. HM Well thank you, Jean. There’s some hope there and we’ll cling to that. But that’s all we have time for. I’d like to thank our guests – Tim Jones, the policy officer at the Jubilee Debt Campaign; Paddy Carter from the ODI; and Jean Letitia Saldanha there in New York.

2015-07-03T06:00:06Z,global-development,Global development,Democracy is not a mystifying western plot – it is a universal value | Anthony Smith,"The slow unfolding of the sustainable development goals continued last month with the unveiling of the zero draft that will be negotiated in the runup to the summit in New York in September. How does the draft of 17 goals look from the perspective of an organisation dedicated to helping countries to strengthen democracy? The answer is not bad, but not good.
On the plus side, it is good that there is a goal 16 at all. The draft goal reads: “Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.” There was no equivalent in the millennium development goals (MDGs), and it is welcome that goal 16 includes a target of ensuring “responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels”. I like all those words, which embody a commendable set of ambitions. The target of “effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels” is a good transposition of text from the UN high-level panel report on the post-2015 development agenda co-chaired by the presidents of Liberia and Indonesia and the British prime minister, which included all three adjectives. On the minus side, there are two main gaps. First, the word “democracy” itself has not been used, nor any variant such as “democratic accountability”. That is disappointing but not surprising, even though the Millennium Declaration, which formed the basis of the MDGs, did make specific calls for these conditions to be included.
My guess is that the word “democracy”, perhaps less popular now than it was 15 years ago, was blocked by the sensitivities of UN politics. The second gap is the failure to address the key instruments of representative democracy, namely parliaments or political parties. Again, this is disappointing but not surprising. There is a presumption in the text that the executive are the main actors, rather than the representatives of citizens. Indeed, the high-level panel called for someone (implicitly governments) to grant rights (such as freedom of speech) to people, rather than for people to act to curb the powers of the executive. So what should be the response of those interested in strengthening democracy? We need to do two things. First, we should demystify democracy. Democracy is not a western plot, it is a universal value. Virtually all countries have aspects of democratic culture in place to some degree, and absolutely every country has room to strengthen the quality of their democracy. I would like to build common ground about the aspects of democracy that are important regardless of region or political grouping. That would make work on achieving the targets in goal 16 much more useful.
Second, the Millennium Declaration is still relevant when it says that we should “work collectively for more inclusive political processes, allowing genuine participation by all citizens in all our countries”. We should rebalance our thinking about national responsibilities, taking up that challenge of putting people and their representatives first. This links back to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The central task of the declaration, and of the Magna Carta for that matter, was to curb the power of the executive – which, unchecked, tends to be abused. In the vast majority of countries, we should look at the role of parliaments, the judiciary, civil society and the media, as well as the executive, when considering how to secure objectives encapsulated in goal 16. A report by Civicus called for new forms of representation and oversight, such as citizens’ panels. Institutions should be “tested on their ability to respond to and achieve progress on issues identified by people rather than just governments”, it added. The sentiment certainly reflects the level of concern many people feel about traditional representative institutions. Building common ground on what democracy means, and helping to improve the quality of representation in our countries, go hand in hand and are both worth pursuing. Goal 16 is imperfect and is almost at the bottom of the list of proposed SDGs. But the glass is half full. Politics and the development community have been uncomfortable partners in many ways, and this is a chance to work together to help political systems do a better job. If we succeed, then we will have fulfilled the promise of the Millennium Declaration – citizens of all countries working together to put sustainable development at the centre of the agenda and hold governments to account for their actions.

2015-07-02T23:01:06Z,global-development,Global development,Investment in child health in world's poorest countries saves 34m lives,"More than 34 million children’s lives have been saved in the last 15 years at a cost, in the poorest countries, of about $4,000 (£2,500) each, say experts who have compiled a scorecard of donor and government spending on child health. The US government has saved the largest number of lives of children under the age of five, at 3.3 million. British funding for child health has also had a significant impact, saving 1.7 million lives –slightly more than the 1.5 million lives saved by donations from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The scorecard has been put together by the world’s leading global health data collectors and analysts, the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in Seattle, together with the UN secretary general’s special envoy for financing the health millennium development goals (MDGs) and for malaria, Ray Chambers. Between 2000 and 2014, they found, low and middle-income countries spent $133bn on child health, saving 20 million small children’s lives. Donors – governments and private organisations – spent $73.6bn, saving a further 14 million lives. “You can spend $4,000 on many different things, but there are very few places where the money would deliver the kind of impact you get by investing it in child health,” said Dr Christopher Murray, the IHME director. “If you invest in the poorest countries, you will see the biggest impact in child health because the costs of things like nutrition programmes, vaccines and primary care are lower.” Murray and Chambers have calculated the cost of saving a child’s life. In the poorest countries, such as Tanzania and Haiti, it is just $4,205. Saving a child’s life in lower middle-income lives in countries such as India and Zambia is more expensive at $6,496, while it costs $10,016 to save a life in upper middle-income countries such as Botswana and Thailand, where the cost of treatments and healthcare is higher.
Putting a price on a life enables them to calculate how many children have been saved and how much it will cost to save more. The scorecard, published with a commentary in the Lancet medical journal on Friday, is both a means of measuring the achievement since 2000 of the MDGs, which had clear targets for bringing down child deaths, and a way of encouraging governments and donors to invest further by providing evidence of clear benefits. When health spending has increased, the number of children dying has generally gone down, but not always. Wars, disasters and changes in the efficiency of health services have sometimes meant that there has not been an accompanying improvement. Chambers and Murray say that these variations in outcomes can all be measured, which allows for greater accountability. “The key point is that changes in death counts and changes in health expenditures – and thus the ratio of expenditures to lives saved – are observable,” they write in the Lancet. The scorecard assesses governments and donors as well as the agencies through which money has been channelled, which include the Global Fund to fight Aids, TB and malaria and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi), the global vaccines funding group. Vaccines are such an effective intervention for children that Gavi saved 2.2 million lives, while the Global Fund, World Bank, Unicef and USAid saved more than one million each. The MDGs set a target of reducing the deaths of children under five by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. Many but not all countries have achieved this target. From 2000 to 2014, the child death rate dropped by 28% in low-income nations. Murray and Chambers are looking to the future as well as measuring past achievements. “We believe that this scorecard can and should be used after the end of 2015 to aid in tracking progress on the sustainable development goals,” said Chambers. “We know that despite the efforts of governments and donors to improve health in low-income and middle-income countries, too many children die before the age of five. Without a way to monitor and publicly share progress regularly, we will miss the opportunity to build on the momentum we have seen since the millennium declaration.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/03/investment-child-health-worlds-poorest-countries-saves-34m-lives,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jul/03/investment-child-health-worlds-poorest-countries-saves-34m-lives
2015-07-02T13:26:40Z,global-development,Global development,Girls' education will only make the grade when intuition gives way to information | Julia Bunting,"Schools have the potential to transform girls’ lives, unlocking the door to future opportunities, better health and greater autonomy. But in many places, schooling falls short of that aspiration. In May, global educators gathered at the World Education Forum in Korea to agree on a post-2015 global education agenda. In June, the US first lady Michelle Obama visited the UK to help launch a UK/US partnership that will invest nearly $200m (£128m) in supporting girls’ education in countries affected by conflict, starting with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Next week, global educators will gather again, this time in Norway at the Oslo summit on education for development. There, they will work to strengthen and renew political commitments on education and improving learning outcomes for children worldwide. And in September, world leaders will gather at the UN general assembly in New York to adopt the sustainable development goals, which will replace the millennium development goals and shape the international development agenda until 2030. Given this growing momentum, now is clearly the time to ensure global organisations are committed to using rigorous evidence to improve education. Girls face more barriers to learning than boys, particularly around the time of puberty. Understanding the relationship between events in girls’ lives and their ability to succeed in school will be key to achieving not only the post-2015 education goals but arguably the other development goals as well. Over the past 25 years, access to school has increased dramatically. The gender gap has narrowed. More girls than ever are in school, and they are staying in school longer. Even in the developing world, adolescent girls are more likely to be in school than out of school. We need to celebrate that success. But as girls stay in education longer, the challenges they face outside school have the potential to disrupt their education. Factors including early pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, child marriage and sexual and gender-based violence all pose challenges. Many girls are grappling with these issues today – and those in the education sector need to know how to respond. For decades, the Population Council and others have been studying disparities in education – disparities between girls and boys, between the poorest and most vulnerable populations and those who are better off. We have looked at what works in girls’ education, and analysed what girls need to complete primary school, and to gain access to a high-quality, safe secondary school where they can complete their education. We have looked at how to ensure girls learn in school and go on to become healthy, productive adults. One thing we have noticed is just how difficult it is to pinpoint what causes girls to struggle in school or to drop out during adolescence. So many life changes happen during this time. A lot can depend on where a girl lives, how she is doing in school, and what pressures her family is facing. But while it is difficult to tease out the exact reasons girls leave school, it’s crucial that we do try, because the causes determine the solutions. Pregnancy and early marriage are not necessarily the only issues. We must look deeper at which girls are most likely to become pregnant, get married or leave school prematurely. For example, if a girl’s family is poor and unable or unwilling to pay school fees, she may not have the support she needs to continue her education. Her parents may decide marriage is a better option for her future security. In 2009, we conducted a review of more than 300 adolescent girls’ education programmes from around the world. The study revealed that the majority of these programmes were not based on evidence and were not evaluated to demonstrate whether or not they were achieving their goals. Of the 11 most common programme interventions for adolescent girls, only two —having female teachers and providing financial help — had been proven to be effective. Too often, the scarce resources invested in girls’ education are going to programmes that lack evidence-based proof of success. These programmes are not being rigorously evaluated to see if they help girls stay in school longer, retain skills, and live healthy, productive lives. To reap the benefits for girls and societies, we need evidence, not just intuition, to guide our efforts. Donors and policymakers must commit to using evidence – about the problem and what works to address it – when developing policies and deciding on funding. Donors and implementing organisations should hold themselves to high standards: let no programme be implemented or funded without a solid base of evidence behind it, or a significant commitment to evaluation within it. As world leaders put the final touches to the post-2015 education goals, a commitment to rigorous evidence must be a top priority. We are heartened by the new US/UK investment in education, because the agreement includes a welcome commitment of £10m from the UK to build the evidence base around adolescent girls’ education. We encourage others to follow this example. . • Julia Bunting is president of the Population Council",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/02/girls-education-will-only-make-the-grade-when-intuition-gives-way-to-information,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jul/02/girls-education-will-only-make-the-grade-when-intuition-gives-way-to-information
2015-07-02T10:35:23Z,global-development,Global development,Minority and indigenous communities turned off own land in growing numbers,"From the stateless Rohingya escaping oppression at the hands of Burma’s government to the Yazidis fleeing advancing Islamic State fighters in Iraq, more indigenous peoples and minority groups are being displaced from their land and pushed into cities, where they face discrimination, a study has warned. The displacement of minority and native groups has risen over the past year, Minority Rights Group International (MRG) said in its latest report. The growing threat of violence and persecution is most vividly illustrated by the terrors the Islamic State has inflicted upon the Yazidi religious group in northern Iraq. “The situation looks pretty dire if you look back at the last 12 or 18 months, particularly with the catastrophic situation facing religious minorities in the Middle East and the large-scale displacement of minority communities like the Yazidis out of Iraq,” said Carl Soderbergh, director of policy at MRG. “Some of the smaller minority communities may no longer even be present in the countries where they’ve resided for millennia,” he added. The hunt for natural resources is also fuelling the displacement of indigenous peoples, according to the study. In Colombia, people of African ancestry have been forced off their land by armed groups seeking to control gold mines, and the majority of Canada’s First Nations people now live in urban areas because they have been forced off their rural land by mining operations, the report said. Greater monitoring of the displacement caused by natural resource extraction is needed, Soderbergh said. “There must be meaningful participation of indigenous peoples and the right to free, prior and informed consent when companies go in to extract natural resources.” The report’s authors also criticised the failure of governments to involve communities in their policymaking processes. “Unfortunately, minorities and indigenous peoples still are not at the negotiating tables – they’re not in the rooms where decisions are taking place,” said Soderbergh. The report highlighted countries where government persecution has threatened minority groups and indigenous peoples. In China, the government destroyed Uyghur traditional housing in Kashgar, raising the prospect of violence in the region, Soderbergh said.Urbanisation across the world has made it harder than ever for governments, urban planners and civil society to protect the rights of minority groups and indigenous peoples in cities. Minorities who arrive in cities often live in informal settlements and can face police harassment and ghettoisation, the report warned. Soaring populations and a lack of rural development is driving record numbers of people to urban centres. The UN has said that two-thirds of the world’s population will live in cities by 2050. Benson Solit, 25, is a Sengwer from Kenya’s Embobut forest. He left his hometown in 2014, when the Sengwer were violently evicted from their land by forest service guards. At the time, the government said the evictions were a necessary measure to protect local water supplies. Solit was forced to flee to Kenya’s teeming capital, Nairobi, where he now lives in an informal settlement. “I don’t really feel safe in Nairobi; we have some worries and I don’t feel comfortable,” he said, adding that he missed his home in the forest. However, he said he was enrolled in college and does odd jobs to make ends meet. Solit’s story is similar to those of people from other groups around the world, many of whom have been forced to leave their land and, lacking other options, ventured to cities. The Kenyan government has projected that Nairobi’s population could rise from its current level of about 3.5 million people to 18.5 million by 2030 (pdf). Resettled minority groups and indigenous peoples usually move to the slums of large cities, which are plagued by poor urban planning, a lack of infrastructure and complicated land ownership systems. “I’m particularly worried that cities like Nairobi – or any number across Asia – are growing so hugely with very little thought for the future in terms of infrastructure and secure land tenure,” Soderbergh said. The UN has predicted that about 40 “megacities”, each with a population of 10 million-plus, will exist by 2030, with Delhi, Shanghai and Tokyo among the most populated. If there is no proper planning, the close proximity of lots of different ethnic groups in informal settlements “can lead to any number of problems, including tensions and violence,” said Soderbergh. Without recognised land tenure, developers are reluctant to upgrade informal settlements, opting instead to evict entire communities and buy land from private owners. “If we don’t get people secure land tenure, especially as cities grow around them, then they will remain in a very precarious situation as developers start eyeing the land that they’re living on,” Soderbergh said. The relocation of minority groups and indigenous peoples into cities has yielded some positive outcomes, according to the report. Soderbergh said: “In a number of cities in Oceania, building techniques, land management techniques that indigenous peoples have will be absolutely vital to tackle the effects of climate change in the very near future.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/02/minority-and-indigenous-communities-turned-off-own-land-in-growing-numbers,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jul/02/minority-and-indigenous-communities-turned-off-own-land-in-growing-numbers
2015-07-02T06:00:11Z,global-development,Global development,Brac's Sir Fazle Hasan Abed wins 2015 World Food prize for reducing poverty,"Sir Fazle Hasan Abed, the founder of Brac, the largest non-governmental organisation on the planet, has been awarded the 2015 World Food prize for his “unparalleled” work on reducing poverty in Bangladesh and 10 other countries. Abed established Brac – formerly known as the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee – in 1972 as a relief operation to help the country recover from its war of independence with Pakistan and the destruction wrought by a tropical cyclone. The organisation’s focus soon switched to finding new ways to tackle poverty and empower women socially and economically, and it is estimated to have brought nearly 150 million people out of poverty since its foundation. Today, it has a staff of 110,000 and works in 11 countries: Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Liberia, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Haiti. Dr MS Swaminathan, chair of the World Food prize selection committee and the first World Food prize laureate in 1987, described Abed as a “strategic thinker, and a man with a future vision”. He also praised the NGO for its constant innovation and bold use of funding.
“While funding was important, Abed realised that the organisation needed some internal financial resources in order to steer its course, rather than become diverted by donor agendas,” he said. “He therefore set up a considerable number of commercial enterprises as part of the Brac ‘brand’. These include printing presses, manufacturing industries, a hotel, conference facilities, retail outlets and the private Brac University, among others. Surpluses from these enterprises go into supporting Brac’s development programmes.” Abed, who was knighted by the Queen in 2010, described the award as a “tremendous honour”, adding: “I’m sure this will be a great joy for our staff and energise them even more. It’s a great satisfaction for us to receive recognition of the work we’ve done for the last 43 years.” He said he was particularly proud of Brac’s work on tackling child mortality in Bangladesh in the 1980s, which saw the number of deaths halved over a decade.
“We went to every household in Bangladesh teaching mothers how to make oral rehydration fluid at home to combat diarrhoeal deaths,” he said. “That also made it possible for Brac to become a very large organisation very quickly and to expand our programmes throughout the country.” Equally productive, he said, had been Brac’s push to raise the rates of child immunisation in the last few years of the same decade. Between 1986 and 1990, the proportion of immunised Bangladeshi children rose from 2% to 70%. In the areas where Brac works, he added, the immunisation rate is now at 95%. Abed said that although Brac’s approach is multifaceted, it was founded on a simple principle. “We have worked on many different aspects of poverty: mortality reduction; maternal mortality and health; family planning; financial services for women; women’s empowerment; agriculture, and all kinds of livelihoods for poor people so that they could come out of extreme poverty and malnutrition,” he said. “Everything we did in Bangladesh we did with one focus: getting poor people out of poverty because we feel that poverty is dehumanising.” With the world preparing to adopt the sustainable development goals – which will replace the millennium development goals and set the global development agenda for the next 15 years – Abed called for a renewed focus on eliminating extreme poverty. He said that Brac’s work with the poorest 8% of Bangladeshis had shown that even the ultra-poor could be reached if sufficient resources and commitment were available. Brac’s two-year programme, designed to help those who are too poor for microfinance loans, involves using grants, monthly stipends and health services to support families while they learn about making money and household budgeting. The programme has since been rolled out in several countries – Ghana, Ethiopia, India, Pakistan, Honduras and Peru –where it has also proved successful. “Taking people out of extreme poverty can be done but you need the commitment to do it in every country throughout the world,” said Abed. “That’s the problem – do we have the commitment in every country to take the extreme poor out of their misery? Do we have good governance in every country? There are many factors that affect development and hopefully these will also be part of the sustainable development goals: good governance and the eradication of corruption from societies.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/02/brac-sir-fazle-hasan-abed-wins-2015-world-food-prize-reducing-poverty,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jul/02/brac-sir-fazle-hasan-abed-wins-2015-world-food-prize-reducing-poverty
2015-07-01T15:45:06Z,global-development,Global development,"Two new Ebola cases in Liberia, seven weeks after country declared virus-free","Two more people have tested positive for Ebola in Liberia, seven weeks after the country was declared free of the virus by the World Health Organisation. They were tested after a 17-year-old male they lived with, who died on Sunday, was discovered to have had Ebola. The town where he lived, 50km to the east of the capital Monrovia, has been quarantined, and the ministry of health is conducting an urgent contact tracing operation to see who the teenager was in touch with in the past 21 days. The re-emergence of Ebola is of deep concern to Liberians and others trying to combat the disease in west Africa. In May, WHO announced Liberia had had no new cases of the disease in the previous 42 days – twice the incubation period of the virus. The Ministry of Information tweeted news of the two new cases on Wednesday. The authorities were investigating whether the dead man had contracted the disease as a result of travel. Numbers of victims have dramatically declined in neighbouring Sierra Leone and Guinea but the disease is persistent in coastal border districts. However there have been no recent cases of Ebola in any of the regions bordering with Liberia. “Although disheartening, the case of Ebola in Liberia is no cause for panic,” said Birte Hald, the team leader for Ebola coordination at the International Federation of Red Cross. The IFRC announced it was expanding its operations in the three countries in a bid to stamp out the virus now that the case numbers have been reduced to between 20 and 27 a week, compared to hundreds a week at the disease’s peak. “These countries will not be able to begin to fully recover until they get to zero cases and stay there,” said Hald. The United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (Unmeer) visited Guinea Bissau last week to inspect its preparedness in case Ebola crosses the border after cases were registered in the neighbouring prefecture of Boké in Guinea. Scientists have said the first Ebola victim, a two-year-old boy from Guinea believed to have triggered the current outbreak, may have been infected by playing in a hollow tree housing a colony of bats. In its latest situation report from June 24, WHO said the disease had infected 27,443, and killed 11,207.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/01/two-new-cases-ebola-liberia-seven-weeks-after-country-declared-free-virus,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jul/01/two-new-cases-ebola-liberia-seven-weeks-after-country-declared-free-virus
2015-07-01T14:00:36Z,global-development,Global development,"Mali's peace deal represents a welcome development, but will it work this time? | Jean-Hervé Jezequel","After months of shuttle diplomacy, the Coordination of Movements for Azawad (CMA), the main rebel coalition in northern Mali, officially signed a peace agreement in Bamako on 20 June. The Mali government and the Algiers Platform, a coalition of pro-government armed groups, had already signed the deal in May. All the protagonists involved in peace talks in Algiers have officially endorsed it. This is a welcome development for Mali and a great relief for the Algerian-led international mediation. However, after previous agreements failed to restore peace in 1992 and 2006, there are reasons to remain cautious. Three stand out.
First, the CMA – an alliance of Tuareg and Arab-led rebels – signed the agreement under huge international pressure. Algeria, France and the UN Mission in Mali (Minusma) pushed hard to persuade the CMA’s leadership not to miss this unique opportunity to join the peace train. The CMA, not wanting to be seen as an enemy of peace, like the al-Qaida-linked fighters who overpowered the Tuareg rebels in northern Mali during 2012, eventually decided to sign up. This form of authoritarian diplomacy succeeded in forging the Bamako agreement. But it came at a price. After negotiations stalled in March, tensions between armed groups in the north escalated. This May was the most violent month since 2013. About 30,000 people fled their homes around Timbuktu because of fighting. Renewed attacks on civilians included summary executions near Gao. Despite the peace agreement breakthrough, distrust between its signatories – the government, the Platform and the CMA – is running high. This will complicate the implementation of any lasting deal. The day after it was signed, a few disgruntled CMA members announced that they had rejected the peace framework and called for an extraordinary meeting of militants and combatants in favour of Azawad, the territory in northern Mali that rebels briefly declared independent in 2012. A second problem is that the agreement focuses on short-term security through disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration. These are important steps, but more is needed. The agreement does not do enough to build solid foundations for a sustainable peace. The deal puts its faith in extended decentralisation – meaning that central authorities will devolve more power and resources to regional assemblies – to stabilise northern Mali. But that can only be part of the solution if it addresses the specific challenges that affect the north. Demilitarisation, for instance, will need to mean more than simply disarming rebels. Political institutions that would allow peaceful resolution of local conflicts must be built as well. Regional assemblies, if adequately organised, supported and funded, could, for example, help address local disputes over territory and power. The lack of more ambitious provisions to strengthen governance leaves Mali in a vulnerable position. This is all the more regrettable as instability has recently spread to areas outside the north.
Since January, military barracks have been attacked and so-called “collaborators” murdered in central Mali. Significantly, no leader from the central region attended the peace talks in Algiers. Their absence at the signing ceremonies casts another shadow on the prospect of lasting peace. Third, implementation remains a huge challenge despite some positive signals. The agreement’s monitoring committee, in which Algeria and Minusma play a leading role, met for the first time the day after the CMA signed. The monitoring committee will play a pivotal role in clarifying contentious provisions in the deal. For example, it remains unclear how many combatants from the Platform and the CMA will be integrated into Mali’s security forces. This could quickly become a major problem.
Past experience shows that integration will not be sufficient to break the cycle of “armed nomadism” in the region whereby individuals become rebels, soldiers or bandits depending on the volatile context in which they find themselves. At best, the deal will buy a few months or years of relative stability, interrupted by short but “acceptable” episodes of violence. But it is unlikely to end the longstanding crisis in northern Mali. The efforts of the mediation team in facilitating a peace process that keeps the CMA on board should be commended. Yet by imposing peace, Mali’s partners have taken a risky approach. There should be no misunderstanding: the 20 June agreement did not end the Malian crisis, it opened a new phase in which peace will have to be won. If mediators and signatories do not invest the time needed to tackle some of the deal’s weaknesses or ensure implementation and follow-up, even the deal’s short-term security commitments will not hold. The danger is that Mali could become a house of cards that seems stable on the outside but risks collapse as international interests shift to other hotspots.

2015-07-01T12:41:39Z,global-development,Global development,"Dominicans of Haitian descent being denied basic rights, claim researchers","The Dominican Republic must halt the arbitrary deportation of Dominicans of Haitian descent while it sorts out the legal and constitutional mess that has left tens of thousands of them in a legal limbo, Human Rights Watch (HRW) has warned. In a new report, HRW says that Dominicans of Haitian descent are being denied basic rights and are unable to register the births of their children, enrol at school or college, work in the formal economy or travel around the country without fear of being expelled. The report, based on interviews with more than 100 affected people, community leaders, legal experts, government officials and human rights activists, documents more than 60 cases in which Dominicans of Haitian descent were detained and, in some instances, forcibly removed from the country despite having the correct documentation. “The Dominican Republic is denying tens of thousands of citizens their right to a nationality, and despite mixed messages, people are being detained and shoved over the border,” said José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. “The government needs to immediately stop expelling Dominicans of Haitian descent, and guarantee them their rights.”
Two years ago, the Dominican constitutional court used a retroactive reinterpretation of the country’s law to strip thousands of Dominicans of Haitian descent of their citizenship. It ruled that while anyone born in the Dominican Republic between 1929 and 2010 was entitled to citizenship, those born to parents who were in the country as undocumented migrants were not. Previously, all children born on Dominican soil, except those considered to be in transit, such as the children of foreign diplomats, were granted citizenship. This included hundreds of thousands of children born to immigrants, once their birth was registered. The 2013 ruling stirred an international outcry and prompted the government of President Danilo Medina to introduce a naturalisation law and allow those whose birth was never registered in the Dominican Republic to apply for residency permits as foreigners. After two years, they can apply for naturalisation. However, only about 300 of the 250,000 Dominican Haitians who applied for permits had received them by the time the application period elapsed last month, and as many as 500,000 undocumented people living in the Dominican Republic now face potential deportation. According to HRW, those caught in legal limbo are being thwarted by labyrinthine bureaucracy that is perverse at best and fiercely discriminatory at worst. It says Dominicans of Haitian descent whose citizenship was already recorded with the government are being denied their original nationality documents while new civil registries are compiled. The report also says Dominicans who have not yet been able to register with the government – mostly children – are having their rights violated by being forced to register as “foreigners”. Even before the controversial constitutional ruling in 2013, the government had introduced a migration law in 2004 that expanded the definition of “in transit” to include the children of immigrant citizens without documentation. That distinction was formalised when a new constitution was passed in 2010. HRW accuses military and immigration authorities of “repeatedly profiling” Dominicans of Haitian descent, of trying to discourage them from registering, and of detaining and forcibly deporting them even when they have valid documents. The rights group is calling on the government to restore the nationality of all those affected by the 2013 ruling and to make sure they are not subjected to expulsion. “In the past year, the administration of President Medina has taken some steps to address the situation of tens of thousands of Dominicans of Haitian descent,” said Vivanco. “While the government’s naturalisation efforts have been positive, it needs to call a halt to wholesale expulsions and threats while it fixes the process.” Although the interior minister, Ramón Fadul, has denied there would be mass roundups, the country’s director of migration, Major General Rubén Darío Paulino, told local press that 2,000 police and military officers and 150 inspectors had received special training for deportations. Last week, the Haitian prime minister, Evans Paul, warned that the Dominican Republic’s crackdown on migrants was creating a humanitarian crisis, with 14,000 people crossing the border into Haiti in less than a week. The situation has also prompted the Dominican-American writer Junot Díaz and his Haitian-American colleague Edwidge Danticat to accuse the Dominican Republic of targeting black migrants, and to call for a boycott. “Starting in the community where we live – how we are spending our money to make these choices, from your sugar to your vacation – to think about what’s being done in your name, what you’re subsidising,” said Danticat. “What your presence means – and what your absence means.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/01/dominican-republic-haitian-descent-deportation-human-rights-watch-report,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jul/01/dominican-republic-haitian-descent-deportation-human-rights-watch-report
2015-07-01T12:10:46Z,global-development,Global development,"'If I go, someone else will claim my land': the stark reality of real estate  in Burundi | Jessica Hatcher","When he was 18, John Nsengiyumva watched from his hiding place among the rafters of his home as gunmen shot dead his father and brothers, then raped his mother and sister before killing them too. Born to a Tutsi mother and Hutu father in Burundi in 1979, Nsengiyumva grew up in Kabonga, in Makamba province on the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika. His family lived on land that had been vacated by a Hutu family who fled the country in 1972, when a series of killings left more than 100,000 people – mostly Hutus – dead. Nsengiyumva’s family was targeted in 1997 because of his mother’s ethnicity. His story reveals how land and its scarcity have exacerbated political and ethnic tensions in this densely populated nation of about 10 million people, who are among the most malnourished in the world.
After his family was killed, Nsengiyumva fled to Tanzania. He spent two years in refugee camps, where he met Esther Maombi, his wife. They returned to Burundi in 2006, after the Arusha peace accords ended a civil war that claimed roughly 300,000 lives. This year – with Maombi pregnant with their seventh child – the couple began to fear their lives were about to be disrupted again. On 25 April, President Pierre Nkurunziza announced he would run for a third term – in violation of the Arusha agreement stipulation that no president should serve more than two terms. Protests broke out in the capital, Bujumbura, and there were reports from rural areas that the ruling party’s youth wing, the Imbonerakure, was intimidating opponents. Political space had already narrowed to the point where opposition politicians in Nyanza Lac faced imprisonment for holding meetings. In April and May, as a protest movement against the president grew and police responded violently, news of killings in Bujumbura by state security forces spread to Makamba. A failed coup intensified fears of more bloodshed, and thousands fled the country. More than 144,000 Burundians have registered as refugees in neighbouring countries since the beginning of April. Hundreds arrive every day in Rwanda, Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In May, Nsengiyumva and his wife decided she should leave and take the children. Nsengiyumva stayed. “If I go, someone else will lay claim to my land,” he explained. Land is one of the main causes of conflict in Burundi, where almost 90% of people are subsistence farmers. The population is growing at about 3% and the average fertility rate is six births a woman. Pressures on land and food security have been exacerbated over the past half century by the return of people who left during the conflicts of 1972 and 1993, many of whom are reclaiming their land. Burundi has been plagued by outbreaks of extreme violence and mass killings since it won independence from Belgium in 1962. In 1993 it held its first democratic elections, and the people chose their first Hutu head of state. But he was assassinated within months, triggering years of Hutu-Tutsi violence in which hundreds of thousands of people were killed. Burundi’s population is roughly 85% Hutu and 14% Tutsi. Today, administrators in Makamba estimate that ownership of 50% of the land is contested. In some cases, three people lay claim to the same piece of land. There is evidence that disputes over land, and land scarcity, have driven people to leave during this latest crisis. Refugees in Tanzania, especially those from Makamba who make up the majority of the displaced, often decry poverty and landlessness more than the threat of insecurity or political persecution. “I’m a farmer. Yet I can’t farm. The land is small and the people are many,” said Moise Ntiranyibagira, 35, who has been a refugee twice and is determined to stay in Tanzania this time. In October last year, in a landmark decision, Tanzania agreed to naturalise 200,000 Burundians. Experts warn that Burundi’s political conflict could cause land disputes to escalate, and vice versa. Although the current crisis is political, land conflicts sparked when refugees return often occur between ethnic groups, reflecting historical divisions. Mike Jobbins, director of global affairs and partnerships at Search for Common Ground, illustrates this point with what happened in Kirundo province, on the border with Rwanda. In April, rumours began to circulate that displaced people who had recently returned to the country and were living temporarily on government land, most of whom were Tutsis, would be targets of violence. The rumour prompted a mass exodus. “It inevitably has a racial or ethnic dynamic, because of the composition of the group and the circumstances around which they fled,” Jobbins said.
Burundi’s national land board, CNTB, was created in 2006 to settle land disputes but it has been criticised in recent years for favouring Hutus in a bid to boost the ruling party’s support base. Since 2011, it has favoured the original landowners – generally Hutus who returned after the violence of the 1970s. Before 2011, the CNTB had generally opted to split land between the current and previous occupants. The change opened a Pandora’s box of land disputes, with many people questioning the way previous cases had been settled. In March, Nkurunziza suspended the CNTB, amid concerns about instability during the pre-election period due to protests in southern Makamba province, where rural communities claimed that it was partial and politicised. Also under threat is the social glue of the Arusha agreement. If the current political crisis undermines the peace deal by violating its ethos, and the land board is seen as being biased, land disputes and conflict could escalate. “The reason that a woman whose land wasn’t big enough to feed her family agreed to divide it in half was because of the Arusha agreement,” says Jobbins. “Beyond the legal document itself, it’s the grand political bargain that all of society arrived at.” Jessica Hatcher and Phil Moore’s reporting was supported by Humanity United",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/01/burundi-land-displacement-conflict-,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jul/01/burundi-land-displacement-conflict-
2015-07-01T06:00:05Z,global-development,Global development,UK aid watchdog's new chief says DfID must prove success to protect budget,"The Department for International Development (DfID) could find its ringfenced, multi-billion-pound budget under threat from other departments unless it can demonstrate a “very clear strategic vision” for helping the world’s poorest people and delivering value for money, the new head of the independent aid watchdog has warned. Dr Alison Evans, the new chief commissioner of the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (Icai), said the move to enshrine in law the UK’s commitment to spending 0.7% of its gross national income on aid had put DfID under unprecedented public and political scrutiny. Last year, the department spent £11.4bn – or about £180 per person – on aid. The department’s protected budget at a time of swingeing cuts across Whitehall has also prompted the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, to suggest that some aid spending could be counted as part of the defence budget, and to argue that DfID should spend more on tackling mass migration from Africa so that the UK does not have to “fish” refugees out of the Mediterranean. Evans said that while interdepartmental turf wars and public scepticism over the aid spending were nothing new, DfID nonetheless had to justify its spending more robustly than before. “If you’ve got a department that is essentially sitting on a ringfenced budget of that nature that’s been written into law, they absolutely have to take the leadership on this,” she said. “There are always going to be questions raised on how you can defend that - and they need to be settled through evidence that this works and that this is making the kind of contribution that the UK public ultimately wants the UK to deliver in the world.” Adding that political battles behind closed doors were inevitable, Evans called on Justine Greening – who was reappointed secretary of state for international development after May’s election – to show both authority and clear evidence of DfID’s successes. “Without a very clear strategic vision for how official development assistance needs to be delivered in the UK, there’s going to be potential possibly for some loss of turf,” she said. “The case needs to be stated clearly and on the front foot … I hope with continuity of secretary of state that what we’ll now see is a step up into that space.”
Evans, a former director of the Overseas Development Institute, who has also worked at the World Bank, was announced as the Icai chief commissioner in December. She said that under her leadership, the commission would be keeping a close eye on DfID claims in key areas such as humanitarian response, improving the lives of women and girls and the increasing involvement of the private sector in development. “We’ll be trying to balance our work programme through some pretty close looks at the evidence on impact and some things that are really much more around the fitness-for-purpose of the organisation: is it really an effective purveyor of aid in this 21st century context?” said Evans. In blunter terms, she added, Icai had a vital role to play “in keeping their feet to the fire about, ‘you claim it works; let’s test it’”. The commission’s reports over the past year and a half have accused DfID of seeing the private sector as “a developmental panacea”, of failing to address petty but widespread corruption in poorer countries and of lacking a clear strategy for engaging with multilateral agencies such as the World Bank, the EU and the UN. Evans said her aims as chief commissioner are to provide the international development committee with the evidence it needs to hold DfID to account in parliament and to see Icai’s work recognised beyond the development community. “We’re not necessarily going to be loved by everyone but as long as we are really recognised for adding value, being credible and being impartial – and touching on the issues that the UK is really wrestling with now about its aid programme – I’ll be happy with that,” she said. “And if we can have some vigorous debate around it, even better. But we’re not a thinktank – we’re a scrutiny body.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/01/uk-aid-watchdog-dfid-ringfenced-aid-budget-under-threat-acai-alison-evans,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jul/01/uk-aid-watchdog-dfid-ringfenced-aid-budget-under-threat-acai-alison-evans
2015-06-30T14:21:07Z,global-development,Global development,"Home Office guidance on Eritrea based on flawed reports, says watchdog","British guidance that Eritrea is a safe country for asylum seekers to return to after leaving illegally is “marred by serious methodological concerns”, a government-appointed watchdog has said in a scathing report that comes as record numbers of Eritreans flee their country. The Home Office updated its country guidance for Eritrea in March to advise that Eritreans are no longer at risk of persecution if they return home after leaving the country without official permission. This guidance is used by UK immigration officials to determine the legitimacy of asylum applications. On Monday, the Independent Advisory Group on Country Information (IAGCI), a group of migration experts tasked with monitoring information about asylum seekers’ countries of origin, slammed the Home Office for basing claims that Eritrea is safe on controversial research by the Danish Immigration Service (DIS). The findings of the Danish inquiry “should not be taken as undisputable facts relating to the current situation in Eritrea”, the IAGCI said. “It is the view of the IAGCI that the two [Home Office country information and guidance reports] are marred by serious methodological concerns,” it added.
The Home Office guidance said that Eritrea’s indefinite national service programme, one of the key reasons young people flee the country, had been shortened to between 18 months and four years. “The only source relating to the length of military service was the Danish source and we found that problematic; if such a claim were based in fact we would expect to see other sources corroborating that claim,” said Laura Hammond, the IAGCI chairwoman. The Danish report, published in December, has been criticised as inaccurate and misleading by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Human Rights Watch and a group of 23 academics, activists and journalists. Jens Weise Olesen, a chief immigration adviser at DIS and co-author of the Danish report, has said the research was rushed out after a huge increase in the number of Eritreans applying for asylum in Denmark. He said the report has deterred Eritreans from seeking asylum in Denmark since it was published. Eurostat, the EU’s statistics agency, reported that 36,925 Eritrean migrants applied for asylum in Europe last year, a 155% increase from 2013. The UK received 3,552 asylum applications from Eritreans in the year to March, more than from any other nationality, according to the Home Office. Human rights groups have said that the Home Office is trying to make it easier for the UK to reject Eritrean asylum applications. Gerry Simpson, HRW’s refugee researcher and advocate, said: “The IAGCI report clearly exposes how the Home Office has tried, but failed, to justify rejecting greater numbers of Eritrean asylum claims: by relying on what the small diplomatic community living in Eritrea’s capital itself says are just its own ‘views’ and ‘speculation’ and, even worse, on Eritrean officials’ unsubstantiated claims of human rights improvements.” The Home Office guidance is at odds with the findings of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in Eritrea, which said the government is carrying out human rights violations so severe that they may constitute crimes against humanity. It also said that Eritreans who fled the country illegally are regarded as “traitors”, usually arrested when they return and detained in harsh conditions. Earlier this month, the Home Office said it would “carefully consider” the commission of inquiry’s findings. The Eritrean government has dismissed the UN’s allegations as “unfounded and devoid of all merit”. Hammond said the Home Office usually takes her group’s concerns on board. “This is unprecedented because, in the past, whenever we’ve gone to the Home Office and said there’s a particular source that our country experts recommend not be used, they’ve accepted that judgement, and for the most part they haven’t used the sources that we don’t think are reputable,” said Hammond. The IAGCI, which was formed in 2009 by the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, has urged the Home Office to review its Eritrea country guidance and issue a statement saying that the guidance should not be used to decide asylum applications until it has been assessed. A spokeswoman for the Home Office said, “Our country information and guidance is based on a careful and objective assessment of the situation in Eritrea using evidence taken from a range of sources including media outlets; local, national and international organisations, including human rights organisations; and information from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.” She added, “Country reports provide guidance to Home Office decision-makers considering asylum claims – but ultimately every application is considered on the basis of each person’s situation and circumstances.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/30/home-office-guidance-eritrea-based-on-flawed-reports-watchdog-asylum-seekers,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/30/home-office-guidance-eritrea-based-on-flawed-reports-watchdog-asylum-seekers
2015-06-30T12:59:02Z,global-development,Global development,Revved and ready to go: Tanzania is set to tackle unstoppable boda boda taxis | Richard M Kavuma,"May is not the best time to tour Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital of Tanzania. Getting around can be a nightmare because of heavy rains, knee-high flooding and intractable traffic jams. At 4pm one Monday the rain was pouring as a friend, Peter, tried to edge his Mazda into a road where the traffic was stationary. For 20 minutes, the car engine remained switched off. At this rate, it would take him until 9pm to drive the 20km to his home. Instead, he returned the car to the office car park, pulled on his raincoat, boarded a boda boda (motorcycle taxi) and arrived home within 90 minutes. That morning Peter and I had been listening to stories of how boda boda drivers had built their businesses in Dar es Salaam’s Temeke district. Yusuf Haidary started working as a part-time boda boda rider in 2010, while still studying for his O-levels. Leaving school in 2012, he was employed by a boda boda owner, whom he paid 8,000 Tanzanian shillings (about $3.50) a day to lease the bike. But he often saved double that amount for himself and within a year, he had bought his own motorcycle. “Today, I can make between TZS10,000 and 12,000 a day,” Haidary says. “But when it rains, I can make 20,000 or 25,000.” Jafari Mrisho, from Bagamoyo district near the coast, joined the boda boda business in 2011, after sitting his O-levels. He says his mother, a single parent, could not afford to keep him on at school and so he asked a friend to teach him how to ride a motorcycle. “Boda boda was the only business that was paying well – so I went straight into it,” Mrisho says. The following year he bought his own motorcycle and today he takes home between TZS20,000 ($8.80) and 30,000 daily. (Not bad for a country where, according to the World Bank, 28% of people live below the poverty line of $1.25 a day.) Across Tanzania, tens of thousands of young men are jumping on boda bodas each year – even as concern grows over their safety and security record. According to government figures, in 2003 Tanzania imported 1,884 private motorcycles. Last year, 185,110 private motorcycles were imported – most of them for boda boda operations. Haidary and Mrisho epitomise the appeal of the boda boda: young men out of school with no clear job opportunities who are able to enter a lucrative industry with only a few days’ training. Yusuf Ghor, chief executive officer of the Automobile Association of Tanzania (AAT), says the growth of boda bodas in Tanzania was inspired by their success in neighbouring Uganda, where bicycles were first used. If that is the case, it is not surprising that Tanzania’s boda bodas are as notorious as the Ugandan ones. According to Tanzania’s deputy traffic police commander, Johansen Kahatano, boda boda operators observe no regulations, including simple ones such as stopping at traffic lights. As in Uganda, many boda boda riders in Tanzania don’t have driving licences, do not wear helmets and have no qualms about driving in the wrong direction on one-way roads. And as in Uganda, the boda bodas are responsible for a significant percentage of road traffic injuries. In 2013, for instance, motorcycle riders comprised 22% of Tanzania’s road accident deaths and 25% of the injured. If you include their passengers, the figure rises significantly.  One challenge to tackling safety is official attitude of derision or neglect towards boda bodas. Officials only speak out about the problem when the latest accident figures are released, or when a major crime is committed by men riding motorcycles. Yet if their growing numbers are anything to go by, boda bodas will only become more important as an employer of young people in Africa. Fred Muhumuza, one of Uganda’s leading development economists, says boda bodas might often be ignored in mainstream economic policy discourse, but they are important actors. “[Boda bodas] are an important source of employment for many youths and the skills required are very few. Almost anyone who can ride a bicycle can ride a boda boda motorcycle,” Muhumuza says. And while other professions may require years of training with no guarantee of a job for graduates, the low-level skills of boda boda riding are matched by a high demand for their vital service in countries with poor infrastructure. But, as Muhumuza points out, boda bodas are also a bona fide form of investment: a worker who buys a boda boda and finds a rider to operate it is no different from another who opens a small shop for extra income. “So, we should not be fighting to get rid of the [boda bodas],” says Muhumuza. “We should be trying to formalise and mainstream them.” Muhumuza points to Rwanda, which has a burgeoning reputation for making the state work, despite criticism of its democratic credentials. In the tiny east African country, Muhumuza says, boda boda riders generally have licences, and are more law-abiding than in neighbouring countries. In Tanzania, as deputy police commander Kahatano says, the task of cleaning up the boda boda industry has been mostly left to the country’s 4,000 police officers. Kahatano believes that owners of the motorcycles should be held more responsible for the conduct of the riders they employ, which perhaps suggests that there should be clear qualifications for people to set up a boda boda business, which could be enforced by a specific licensing government department. In 2013, a Tanzanian government official was quoted as saying that all boda boda operators should form associations. Such ideas need to be given force by tough government action. Instead of being seen merely as irritants of four-wheeled motorists, boda bodas should be ignored no longer.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/30/tanzania-boda-boda-motorcycle-taxis-accidents-lax-regulation,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/30/tanzania-boda-boda-motorcycle-taxis-accidents-lax-regulation
2015-06-30T10:40:39Z,global-development,Global development,"EU needs 25-year plan to deal with migrants, says UN envoy","The European Union needs to plan 25 years ahead as it seeks a strategy for dealing with the increasing numbers of refugees and migrants who are risking their lives to reach the continent, a senior UN migration expert has warned. François Crépeau, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, described last week’s EU migration agreement as “baby steps” towards a proper resettlement plan and said that there were no quick fixes when it came to large-scale migration. Crépeau, who recently suggested that wealthy countries should agree on a comprehensive plan to take 1 million refugees from Syria, dismissed the notion that increasing aid spending to help stabilise turbulent countries would immediately help stem the flow of migrants and refugees.
“Development itself takes time and changing migration patterns also takes time. It may take less time today than it used to, but it will still take 10, 15, 20 years,” he said. “Migration is generational and we can’t have quick fixes. That’s why it’s important for the EU to immediately make plans for the coming 10, 20, 25 years.” In any case, he added, development should not and could not be seen as an expedient way to check the human flow. “You can certainly have reducing emigration as part of your plans, but the main objective is to make sure that the population can find – inside Eritrea or inside Syria or elsewhere – the means to sustain the new generations coming into the labour market by creating new job opportunities and innovation.” His comments came after the British government hinted that more aid money could be used to tackle the migration crisis. On 21 June the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, told the BBC: “Well-focused aid should be used to help stabilise these countries, to prevent conflict, to discourage mass migration, so that we don’t have to fish people out of the Mediterranean later on.” Crépeau said that trying to use aid to halt migration could actually backfire and increase the number of people leaving their homelands for Europe. “Development doesn’t mean less migration in a generational time – it’s almost the contrary,” he said. “If you develop a country, suddenly the generation that has been craving going abroad has the money to do it, so emigration will continue for a generation.” He pointed to Italian emigration to North America – which boomed during the continuous Italian development that took place from 1945 to 1975 – adding that profound economic and social change takes decades.
However, the special rapporteur did stress that development initiatives could pay dividends for everyone if they were properly planned and not driven by fleeting political concerns. “If we do development in order to reduce migration in the short term, we will be disappointed; if we take this immigration trend as a booster for a better organised and more persuasive development programme, then it’s a good thing and we should do a lot more development,” he said. Crépeau renewed his call for richer countries to take in a million Syrian refugees, arguing that a well-managed, multi-agency resettlement programme would put the people smugglers out of business and ensure that the refugees ended up where they were most likely to prosper and integrate well. Perhaps the biggest stumbling block to finding a solution to the Mediterranean crisis, he said, was the fact that migrants themselves are never involved in drawing up migration policies. “Think about trying to make policies about women without consulting women,” he said. “The policies that we made before women got the right to vote were policies based on fantasies – the fantasies that we men had about women. That’s the problem today: most of our immigration policies are based on this nationalist, populist discourse which has been prevailing in Europe and elsewhere now for the past 30, 40 years.” Crépeau said progress was likely to remain elusive as long as politicians lacked the courage to challenge old and discredited myths about migrants taking jobs, carrying diseases and being terrorists. “No one contradicts it because mainstream parties cannot gain any votes by saying anything good about migrants, so they won’t risk votes – and that’s the problem.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/30/eu-needs-25-year-plan-deal-with-migrants-says-un-envoy,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/30/eu-needs-25-year-plan-deal-with-migrants-says-un-envoy
2015-06-30T06:00:07Z,global-development,Global development,Sudan: clean-burning gas stoves are transforming lives in North Darfur | Muna Eltahir,"It is 5pm and 20-year-old Omar is making coffee while his mother and sisters relax. It is a scene totally unremarkable to most people across the world. In a camp in Sudan’s North Darfur, however, this is a sign of a gender revolution. Until recently, Omar’s mother, Batool, 47, had cooked for her family over an open fire in the kitchen and was forced to walk for miles almost daily to collect the fuel. In a region as unstable as North Darfur, this is a risky undertaking. The camp where Omar and his family live is near the city of El Fasher, where the streets are full of UN vehicles, government troops and trucks full of armed men – the legacy of years of civil war. This region lacks infrastructure, rule of law and a structured society. Many people have lost everything – including family members – to raids by armed groups. Collecting firewood leaves women vulnerable to violent, sometimes sexual, attacks, by groups of armed men. After walking barefoot for miles, dragging firewood beside them, many women suffer almost permanent wounds to their hands and feet.
Deforestation has also damaged large swaths of previously fertile land, while the woodsmoke produced by indoor stoves is highly toxic. Although any development against this background is difficult, an estimated 500,000 people in North Darfur have benefited from a set of hugely resilient community networks. These groups – which represent everyone from blacksmiths and farmers to female handicraft-makers and potters – act in a similar way to a union, or trade association. They were set up by the charity I work for, Practical Action, around 30 years ago and their scope extends far beyond the city limits. Those heading these organisations have been given extensive leadership and management training, which has allowed them to continue to operate despite the chaos. In fact, they have proved so successful they have become independent, raising their own funds, delivering training in new techniques and technologies and distributing seeds and livestock.
Each one has links to remote communities and some of the hardest to reach people in Darfur – single women, internally displaced people, marginalised manual workers and remote farmers. Their potential for good once the war abates is endless. Omar and Batool’s family is one of 15,000 households with a new gas stove, distributed via the Darfurian Women’s Development Network. The stoves work from LPG gas, a by-product of the oil industry in Sudan. Batool will pay back the cost of the stove (around $70), over a set number of months agreed with the network, which will manage and administer the loan. Though my staff act as brokers for the initial funding needed to buy the stoves, provide training and monitor the project, the rest is done by the network. The impact of the stoves is summed up by Batool, whom I met just a few months ago. She told me: “It is hard to believe, but this stove has changed our lives. My hands and feet were always painful and wounded but now they are completely healed. My children are also healed from coughing and the eye infections that they used to constantly suffer from. Furthermore, I don’t have to ask my eldest girls to look after the younger ones while I leave the house to get wood, so they are able to go to school and be educated while I can make handicrafts to sell. And look: my son is now making me coffee.” Muna Eltahir is Practical Action’s Sudan director",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/30/sudan-clean-burning-gas-stoves-transforming-lives-north-darfur,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/30/sudan-clean-burning-gas-stoves-transforming-lives-north-darfur
2015-06-29T14:41:37Z,global-development,Global development,Sierra Leone urged to get tough on tax to repair battered health system,"Sierra Leone’s government should reduce tax breaks for mining firms and roll out measures to block illicit financial flows in order to raise funds for its decimated health services and help prevent needless loss of lives, a report has said. Sierra Leone, which has more confirmed cases of Ebola than any other country, could inject an extra $94m into its economy over the next few years if it reduced tax breaks for the five largest mining firms operating in the country, according to a report by Health Poverty Action (HPA). “We urge Sierra Leone, and the UK as one of its main donors, to take a close look at how greater revenue from the extractives industry could be used to deliver a better and more equitable health system for the country’s people,” said Tadesse Kassaye Woldetsadik, HPA’s head of Africa programmes. The report, Healthy Revenues: How the extractives industry can support Universal Health Coverage in Sierra Leone (pdf), examines Sierra Leone’s contracts with Sierrra Rutile, Octea Mining and Sierra Minerals Holding Limited, as well as London Mining and African Minerals, which were both recently purchased by Chinese state-owned firm Shandong Iron and Steel. “An estimate from the Budget Advocacy Network and National Advocacy Coalition on Extractives in Sierra Leone said the country had lost $199m (£126m) a year in recent years due to tax incentives – over three times the health budget for 2015,” the HPA report said. “Extractives industry revenues can provide significant additional contributions to health financing ... the government must look to this sector as a key source of revenue generation in the years ahead,” it added. The Ebola virus has killed 11,207 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to the World Health Organisation. Measures to contain the virus, including border closures and quarantines, have brought trade to a standstill and wreaked havoc on west African economies. The World Bank has shaved $1.6bn off the combined projected gross domestic product (GDP) of the three worst-affected countries as a result of the outbreak. Since the end of a 10-year civil war in 2002, Sierra Leone’s mineral sector has provided a financial lifeline for the government. The extractives industry contributed $109m to the country in 2013, making up 21% of its GDP that year, according to HPA. Diamonds, iron ore, rutile and bauxite are the country’s main mineral exports. But a lax mining code has caused valuable funds to be lost, according to Natalie Sharples, senior policy adviser at HPA and author of the report. She praised Sierra Leone’s efforts to improve its tax collection practices, but said more could be done. “Sierra Leone gives particular tax exemptions to mining companies outside of general legislation, and so it’s almost caught up in its own race to the bottom within the country, because mining companies negotiating new deals see these exemptions and want them as well,” said Sharples. Sierra Leone faced the recent Ebola crisis with just one doctor for every 45,625 people, the report said. If the government had brokered better deals with mining firms and blocked illicit financial flows earlier, Sierra Leone’s public health systems would have been better prepared for the Ebola epidemic, according to the study.Sharples said there was evidence that good infrastructure, low administrative costs and political stability were more important for prospective investors than tax breaks. Health Poverty Action also said illicit capital flight had cost the state about $71m a year over the past decade. “As well as looking at reducing tax breaks, robust action is also needed at the global level to crack down on revenue lost through tax dodging and other illicit financial flows,” said Sharples. “Britain, and all participants in next month’s Financing for Development conference, must take firm action to stop the draining of resources from countries such as Sierra Leone.” The Financing for Development conference will be held in Ethiopia and will discuss funding for the Sustainable Development Goals, which will define development priorities for the next 15 years.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/29/sierra-leone-urged-tough-on-tax-mining-companies-tax-evasion,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/29/sierra-leone-urged-tough-on-tax-mining-companies-tax-evasion
2015-06-29T11:09:01Z,global-development,Global development,How football moved the goalposts for girls in rural India | Alia Dharssi,"Kusum Kumari had no great agenda in mind when she started playing football aged nine near her home in rural Jharkhand in India. She just wanted to have fun. Now 15, she is pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved by girls in a state notorious for human trafficking and child marriage. “People believe girls should fetch water from the well, wash dishes, wash clothes in the pond, work in the field, cut grass for the cows, collect firewood and cook food,” she said at the Girl Power in Play symposium, on the sidelines of the Women’s World Cup, in Ottawa this month. “My team-mates and I know that when we stay together, then our dreams will happen in real life. We see in our family and village that when girls finish the 10th grade, they get married. We don’t want to get married until we can stand on our own feet.” With the support of Yuwa, an NGO that uses girls’ team sports as a platform for social development, Kumari and her team-mates have challenged the widely held idea that girls belong at home. They have gained recognition in their community and on football pitches abroad. In 2013, the team finished third in an under-14 tournament in Spain, and last year they travelled to the US to take part in the Schwan’s USA Cup.
The role of sport in promoting development has gained prominence since the UN established a task force on sport for development and peace in 2001, adopting a resolution two years later on sport as a means to help achieve the millennium development goals. “The feeling of power [that comes from sport], the feeling of accomplishment, the physical strength – that can help change their lives,” says Katja Iversen, chief executive officer of Women Deliver, which co-hosted the Girl Power in Play meeting with Unicef, Right to Play, One Goal and the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition. “That’s why we really need to take sport seriously as a game-changer for girls and women, to empower them and change their status in society.” Yet, despite successful projects like Yuwa, whose programmes have kept dozens of poor girls in school by promoting education in workshops and offering additional classes, experts say sport is by no means a foolproof route to empowerment. “Many of these organisations are unable to tackle the structural inequalities that are marginalising these groups in the first place,” says Lyndsay Hayhurst, an expert on girls’ empowerment and sport at the University of British Columbia. “It takes a lot of time and it takes a lot of funding, and it takes a great deal of social change [to improve women’s rights].” Jharkhand has one of the highest rates of child marriage of any Indian state. Tens of thousands of children are trafficked from the region annually and forced into marriage, prostitution or gruelling labour, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. “The places where we work are very isolated. Families invest in boys, not girls. They pretty much train girls to be wives and mothers,” says Rose Thomson, Yuwa’s education director. Yuwa was founded in 2009, and about 150 girls now take part in its football practices and workshops. At these gatherings, girls discuss issues ranging from human rights to their bodies. They can also attend classes to supplement their schooling. They meet almost daily, sometimes starting as early as 5.30am. Although many locals criticise the girls for wearing jerseys and playing football, Yuwa has created “a supportive community where it’s cool to go to school and be ambitious”, says Thomson. When girls don’t show up to practice, their team-mates often check on them and speak to their parents to ensure they return.
Sanjana Gaind, programme manager at Crea, an Indian human rights group, says that the simple act of getting girls on to the pitch challenges gender norms. Working with organisations in the states of Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, Crea uses football to gather girls for discussions about feminism, health and other issues. Both Yuwa and Crea say their programmes boost confidence and feed aspiration. Yuwa girls say they want to be doctors, lawyers and judges. Their sporting and academic success wins support at home and gives them the courage to tell their parents they want to delay marriage. “Before I joined Yuwa, I did go to school – but at that time I was not going every day,” says Kumari, whose sister dropped out of school to get married when she was about 15. Kumari says she began focusing on her studies after meeting women through Yuwa who had pursued careers as diverse as journalism and hair-styling. It is, however, hard for Yuwa and Crea to tackle some of the social problems. In Gaind’s experience, the pressure to get married is so strong in some rural areas of northern India that for every girl who convinces her parents to let her delay marriage and stay in school, there are many who cannot. Domestic violence is also a problem in Jharkhand. One 18-year-old was forced to stop coaching a team of younger girls for days after her brother, furious at her training activities, beat her up. Yuwa intervened and the beatings stopped, says Thomson. Nonetheless, the story shows that even with knowledge of their rights and support from the group, girls can face frightening opposition at home in a country where violence against women is pervasive and much of it is at the hands of family members. Thomson remains hopeful, however. “If they continue getting an education and pursuing a different future, they will put themselves in a position where they can stand up to abuse,” she says. Persuading parents and community members to support girls’ sports is key to success. Yuwa’s child development officer, Neha Baxla, who is from Jharkhand, deals directly with the girls’ families. “The biggest challenge… is making parents understand why girls need to go for higher education, or why it is important for them to get jobs,” she says. As girls get older, many parents try to pull them out of Yuwa or school. Baxla visits their homes to convince them otherwise. She says she succeeds in about two-third of cases, usually after many meetings. “It’s mainly the social pressure [to keep girls at home], because this is a rural village,” Baxla says, adding that the girls’ mostly illiterate parents struggle to understand the benefits of Yuwa. “They didn’t get a chance to go to school, or they haven’t seen this kind of thing happening in their life.” Kumari’s parents are illiterate, but she plans to attend university so that she can become a social worker and help other girls. “I’ll teach them that education is very important, and I will tell them: ‘If you want to play any sport, that will help you to understand things.’”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/29/football-girls-rural-india-combat-early-marriage-raise-confidence-sport,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/29/football-girls-rural-india-combat-early-marriage-raise-confidence-sport
2015-06-29T06:00:11Z,global-development,Global development,"Afghanistan growing more receptive on women's rights, says British ambassador","For the first time, Afghan leaders seem willing to make sincere attempts to improve the rights of women, according to the new British ambassador to Kabul. Speaking at her Kabul residence, where she took up her post in May, Karen Pierce said the Afghan government has taken bold and important steps towards reconciliation with the Taliban following the drawdown of foreign troops last year.
Pierce sees peace and women’s rights as inseparable. In her previous job as the UK’s permanent representative to the UN, she spent two years trying to convince UN special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi to find practical ways of including women in peace efforts in Syria. It is fitting, then, that Pierce’s appointment to Kabul, where she succeeded Sir Richard Stagg, should coincide with this year’s 15th anniversary of UN Resolution 1325, which urges member states to increase the role of women in peace building. She arrived only weeks after the Taliban expressed support for the right of women to education and work during informal talks in Qatar with people close to the Afghan government. Shortly after that exchange, a Taliban delegation met with Afghan women’s rights defenders in Oslo. “I think it was a sign of success for those of us in and outside Afghanistan who have been pushing the women’s agenda that the Taliban felt it would put them in a good light to meet these women and issue a statement about girl’s education. And even if the Taliban did that wholly cynically, it’s nevertheless a good sign,” said Pierce. The Taliban’s cautious venture into diplomatic waters follows intensive efforts by the Afghan president Ashraf Ghani to reboot relations with Pakistan, long seen as a protector of the militant movement. Ghani and his wife Rula, an atypically outspoken Afghan first lady, have been equally earnest with regard to women’s rights, said Pierce. “What the Ghanis have brought is that they’re not afraid to discuss the problems. I think there was a little bit of a sense before that, because the world had a very negative view of Afghanistan and women’s rights, it was better not to discuss it,” Pierce said. A security policy specialist, Pierce’s remit has included arms control as well as peace processes in the Balkans. Immediately after the September 11 attacks in New York, she also worked on Afghanistan while based in London. The UK’s military role in Afghanistan is limited to about 470 troops who form part of Nato’s mission to train, advise and assist the Afghan security forces. The first batch of UK-trained female cadets graduated from an officers’ academy in Kabul in June. Annual assistance from the UK Foreign Office (FCO) and the Department for International Development also funds education and women’s rights projects, including women’s shelters and a forensics laboratory to detect rape. Diplomatically, Pierce said, the UK lends technical assistance to potential peace talks, and lobbies for reform of the Afghan legal system, which is often skewed against women. Pierce was last in Kabul four years ago. She said the city had developed dramatically since then, with widespread electricity, better food available and more economic activity. In her new capacity she stands out as one of only three female western ambassadors appointed to Afghanistan since 2001. After 15 years of the international community impressing upon Afghan leaders the importance of equal participation in the labour force and politics, does she find that rate hypocritical? “It’s a pity, but I don’t think it’s hypocritical,” she said. “There’s a global issue here with women getting to the top of any diplomatic service profession in their own country.”
Pierce agreed, however, that it was unwise to lecture Afghans. “Especially if you’re trying to influence and get the maximum number of people to buy into a progressive agenda … Leading by example is one way. But I wouldn’t say leading by example is about ambassadors.” Pierce is an anomaly not just in Kabul’s diplomatic corps but also in the UK foreign service. In the 333-year history of the FCO, only six women with children have made it to director general level. Pierce, as the mother of two sons, is one of them. Her husband is a civil servant in the Treasury. She said she doesn’t worry that Afghan counterparts won’t take her seriously because of her gender. Nevertheless, she has had brushes with prejudice in a country where so few women hold leadership positions. When the embassy marked the Queen’s birthday in June, Pierce and a few staff lined up to welcome guests, only to have male guests walk straight past her, assuming she was a spouse. “So then you’ve got a dilemma. Do you do something that might be culturally insensitive and step forward and stick your hand out and say ‘I’m the British ambassador’?’ Or do you not do that and risk that you will be ignored?” She tried both, and then went for handshakes.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/29/afghanistan-womens-rights-british-ambassador-karen-pierce,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/29/afghanistan-womens-rights-british-ambassador-karen-pierce
2015-06-27T12:00:03Z,global-development,Global development,"Gender equality is a founding value of the EU, so why the lack of progress? | Joanna Maycock","We all know we are a long way from living in a gender equal world. Globally speaking, Europe is seen as a leader in moving women’s rights forward, but just how far are European countries from putting men and women on an equal footing? On Friday, the European Institute for Gender Equality published its second gender equality index. This kind of research is essential, because it provides credible and comparable data across EU member states. The index focuses on eight domains relevant to EU policy: money, knowledge, time, power, health, violence, work and intersecting inequalities. The results allow us to see if gender equality policies lead to progress and what additional measures need to be taken. This year’s report, which analyses data from 2005 to 2012, shows that women are only halfway to equality with men, and that progress has stagnated since 2005. In 2010, women were 52.4% equal compared with 52.9% in 2012. The picture is very diverse across the EU, with Sweden achieving an overall score of 74.2% while Romania is at 33.7%. The index also shows women’s rights regressing in eight countries, including the UK and Austria. Progress is particularly sluggish with regard to power and time. Men are still hugely over-represented in political and economic decision-making: more than 75% of parliamentarians and 84% of corporate board members in Europe are men.
At the same time, women’s free time is limited, with an extremely wide gender gap in time spent on care work and educating children and grandchildren, as well as on cooking and housework. There have been some minor improvements on pay and work, significant because these areas have been the focus of the most strategic action at the EU level. The gender gap in monthly earnings has decreased from 22% to 20%, and women’s full-time employment rate has increased slightly. How can we explain this lack of progress? After all, equality between women and men is one of the EU’s “founding values”. As far back as 1957, article 119 of the Treaty of Rome stated: “each Member State shall ensure that the principle of equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value is applied”. But recession and austerity in Europe have led to rapid change. Ideologically driven austerity has contributed to disillusionment with democratic institutions, driving disproportionate numbers of women into poverty, unemployment and precarious, low-paid jobs. This is not inevitable, but results from political choices made by male-dominated institutions. These choices have a worse impact on women than on men. Despite the evidence that progress on gender equality in Europe has stagnated, the economic crisis is used to excuse a lack of political vision and the failure to bring in concrete measuresto support women’s rights, representation and resources. As the international community takes stock of the 20th anniversary of the Beijing Platform for Action, a new post-2015 framework – the sustainable development goals – will be adopted, linking human rights and environmental sustainability. Women’s rights and equality between women and men will be a standalone goal, and overall this new blueprint will provide a renewed opportunity for global, European and national feminist action. To turn these goals into reality, we need more data of the quality provided by the gender equality index, in Europe and beyond. We need evidence about the shape and scope of inequality, the outcomes of political choices and programmes, and the links between gender equality and wider societal wellbeing. We need better communication to make this information more accessible to Europe’s citizens, with more activism to raise awareness. We need the EU to champion legislation, strategies, and programmes in support of women’s rights. We need to build feminist leadership, strengthen women’s organisations and support women to take on political and economic leadership roles. Gender equality institutions and women’s organisations need resources to work with political leaders to build their awareness of what is at stake and what the solutions might be. The European commission must stop stalling on the adoption of an ambitious new strategy on equality , which should set out clear, accountable commitments for EU action to ensure that, five years from now, we are not still only halfway to equality. In Europe we have the experience and we know what works for gender equality. The time to act is now. We must commit, accelerate and invest in women’s rights.

2015-06-26T12:19:16Z,global-development,Global development,Albania makes headway in the battle against corruption,"In Albania, corruption has long been part of everyday life. People talk of taking a loved one to hospital and having to pay the doctor to get the best treatment, or of going to a property registration office and being asked to pay an extra “fee” to speed things up. This culture of bribery has not only kept society’s most vulnerable from accessing vital services but has also damaged Albania’s international image. In a 2011 study, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said Albanian citizens ranked corruption as the second most important problem after unemployment. Since emerging from the decades-long dictatorship of Enver Hoxha, who turned Albania into one of the world’s most isolated states, the Balkan country of 2.8 million people has struggled to deal with corruption and organised crime. When he took office in 2013, Prime Minister Edi Rama, the one-time flamboyant mayor who oversaw the repainting of Tirana’s communist-era grey buildings, made it a priority to tackle corruption and improve Albania’s international standing. The centre-left coalition government’s reforms have focused on improving administrative systems, enforcing the rule of law, and making it easier for people to report corruption. Last February, the government launched an online anti-corruption portal to allow citizens to anonymously record instances of unscrupulous practices. The website covers 12 key areas, including police, health and customs. Since then, 6,840 reports have been logged. Many of these involve complaints about poor service, but 777 cases directly relate to accusations of corruption, with 35 reports referred to prosecutors. Rama insists Albania’s poor international reputation is based on exaggerated stereotypes rather than reality, but admits that combating corruption is key to changing perceptions. “To improve the image of a country, first you have to change the country itself,” he said. “I believe corruption becomes the alternative when a government is not able to serve its citizens in a transparent and efficient way. So we have to modernise, and modernisation is about reforms.” Another anti-corruption programme involves text messages being sent to citizens to ask whether they had to pay a bribe when receiving treatment at state-run hospitals. The scheme, run by the ministry of state for local issues and anti-corruption, and supported by the World Bank, was launched in March and has reached more than 33,000 people, about 20% of whom have provided feedback. “The doctors are always late and the corruption continues as always. Without giving away money, no one takes care of you,” said one person. Another person, who had gone to a hospital in the city of Durres, was more positive: “I have been in hospital before, but this time you could feel the change. No one asked for a bribe.” The World Bank has previously supported a similar programme in Pakistan. “Low trust in government leads not only to informal means of obtaining services and less willingness to pay taxes, it also leads to lower resources for the government to provide public services, thus completing a vicious cycle of mistrust and corruption,” Jana Kunicova and Zubair Bhatti, public sector experts at the World Bank, wrote in a blog. “By proactively collecting citizen feedback and using it for management actions, this vicious cycle can be broken.” In its 2011 survey, the UNODC said on average 28.3% of Albanians aged between 18 and 64 had been exposed, either directly or indirectly, to a bribery experience with a public official in the previous year. But it noted that about 30% of bribes paid were actually offered by citizens themselves. Albania, which ranks 110th out of 175 countries in Transparency International’s 2014 corruption perceptions index, joins a list of other countries using the internet to crack down on corruption, either through “naming and shaming” or by bringing bribery and other corrupt practices into the open. The UN Development Programme (UNDP) is supporting Albania’s anti-corruption drive. The country, which was given a ninth millennium development goal on good governance, is now piloting the governance indicator of the new sustainable development goals, which will frame development priorities until 2030.
Between June and December 2014, the project focused on identifying indicators relevant to Albania. The second phase, which ends in September, will implement systems to measure the indicators. The UNDP says Albania recognises that reforms in good governance are essential if the country wants to achieve European Union membership. Many Albanians are optimistic that acceptance last year as an official membership candidate signals a new start for the former communist country. “The governance indicators are very important for Albania’s EU integration and for strengthening the rule of law,” said the UN’s resident coordinator, Zineb Touimi-Benjelloun. “Controlling corruption and improving good governance remain a challenge here, but being a pilot country has proved to serve as a catalyst for the government to set up appropriate systems and improve service delivery.” After the first phase of the pilot, about 20 indicators were proposed and grouped into three target areas: improvement in governance to meet EU standards by 2030; better service delivery, with a focus on water, electricity and land; and improved economic performance, using foreign direct investment as a measure. Rama believes his government is moving in the right direction. “Albania suffered for many years from lack of reforms and badly made policies,” he said. “We have shown we can make positive changes but, of course, we have not solved all the country’s problems yet. Every month, we have something important scheduled to happen and, less than two years in, we are definitely where I hoped we would be.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/26/albania-battle-against-corruption-organised-crime,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/26/albania-battle-against-corruption-organised-crime
2015-06-26T06:00:01Z,global-development,Global development,Sustainable development must live up to its promise to leave no one behind | Helen Dennis,"When heads of state sign an international agreement on the sustainable development goals (SDGs) in September, the document is likely to include a promise to “leave no one behind”. The principle will be one of the most important in the entire agreement. Implemented properly, it will take the world beyond business as usual, marking an important difference between the existing millennium development goals and the new SDGs.
But if countries make impressive overall progress towards the goals while people suffering the worst poverty and discrimination see little or no change, then the whole project will arguably have failed. So as negotiators resume talks on the SDGs in New York this week, they should push for an agreement that enshrines the principle of leaving no one behind in the outcome document. The concept has obvious appeal. Not only is it a prerequisite for ending extreme poverty by 2030, it can also be applied in every country, rich and poor alike. Nonetheless, some are sceptical about the idea. It does not address the pressing issues of global wealth concentration and international inequality. Moreover, making it a reality will involve hard work. Addressing entrenched poverty and discrimination will require finance, including international funding, and the political will to make difficult decisions. Governments around the world will have to integrate the idea into their own policy and planning and may have to contemplate economic, structural and fiscal reforms. All countries will need to buy into the idea, but if it is to succeed there must be a focus on particular countries, such as least-developed countries, that need additional support. Once agreement is reached, the hard work will begin. Every country should be required to develop national SDG implementation plans, identifying those people and communities at risk of being forgotten. These groups may match up with some already listed in the existing post-2015 draft: women and girls, migrant workers and people with disabilities. But there may be other social groups that should be highlighted in national plans – minority groups, indigenous people and those affected by caste-based discrimination, for example. Country plans should also include interim or mid-term targets. A 15-year timeframe is important for achieving long-term change, but stepping stones are also needed to ensure that the hardest tasks are not deferred. Christian Aid’s new briefing on leaving no one behind tries to bring the principle to life, illustrating its global importance and suggesting how governments might start to implement the idea. The briefing includes some shocking examples of the millions of people left far behind, from a wide range of countries across the world. Ghana, for instance, reduced its income-poverty level from 52% in 1992 to 28.5% in 2006. Yet, while the reduction in the south of the country was 58.66%, in the north it was just 8.87%. Maternal mortality rates are similarly uneven.
Brazil, meanwhile, despite laudable progress towards reducing income inequality, still has one of the world’s most unequal patterns of land ownership, with 3% of the population owning two-thirds of all arable land. Quilombola people, who are descended from slaves, are at the other end of the spectrum from the big landowners. Only 8% of their 3,000-plus communities in Brazil own the land on which they live, leaving them vulnerable to harm from private interests, such as mining companies, as well as government authorities. In south Asia, the briefing notes: “Poverty is overwhelmingly concentrated among those groups who face discrimination because of who they are and the work they do. Discrimination based on work and descent, associated with the practice of caste, is a root cause of inequality and persistently high levels of poverty – worldwide, it is estimated that 260 million people are affected.” Dalit women are particularly vulnerable, the briefing notes. The SDGs have the potential to focus policymakers’ attention on the people who are left behind in their societies. With so many women, men and children so profoundly affected – and with less than 100 days until heads of state meet to finalise the new goals – the challenge of embedding the idea of leaving no one behind in the new development agenda could not be more important or urgent. • Helen Dennis is senior adviser on poverty and inequality at Christian Aid",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/26/sustainable-development-goals-leave-no-one-behind,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/26/sustainable-development-goals-leave-no-one-behind
2015-06-25T14:18:20Z,global-development,Global development,Foreign Office under fire over aid spent on game show and Facebook workshop,"The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has launched a review of its use of aid money following reports it has spent nearly £300,000 on projects including a TV game show in Ethiopia, a Shakespeare workshop in Ecuador and efforts to find mates for fish off Madagascar. While the overwhelming majority of the UK’s £12bn aid budget is administered and spent by the Department for International Development (DfID), the Foreign Office was allocated £343m of aid money last year. On Thursday, the Sun newspaper published a list of projects apparently funded by FCO aid money, ranging from a £7,000 anti-littering campaign in Jordan to a £970 programme designed to promote the safe and responsible use of Facebook in Laos. According to the Sun, the FCO spent nearly £14,000 on the Ethiopian quiz show as part of its drive to “connect with a younger generation of Ethiopians … [and] engage them on UK values of human rights and good governance”. A further £5,000 went on “Hamlet education workshops” in Quito to mark a visit by the Globe theatre in London, claimed the newspaper.
In a box headlined “Fish Called Squander”, the Sun reported that the department also spent £3,400 trying to help find mates for two endangered Mangarahara cichlid fish in London Zoo. Although the FCO pointed out that the projects in question had cost a total of £278,000 – 0.08% of its total aid allocation last year – it said the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, had asked for the spending to be investigated. “The foreign secretary has ordered a review so that we can be sure that every last penny of the FCO’s aid spending around the world is effective and represents value for money,” said a spokeswoman. “Building closer relationships with growing economies is important. The vast majority of aid spending promotes UK prosperity and broader stability but there will be a crackdown on projects that cannot show tax-payers’ cash is being spent wisely.” Scrutiny of the aid budget has intensified in recent months as the UK not only hit the four-decade old UN target of spending 0.7% of national income overseas on aid but also enshrined the commitment in law. Some Tory backbenchers attempted to derail the legislative process, with one dismissing it as sop to “Guardian-reading, sandal-wearing, lentil-eating” do-gooders with a “misguided guilt complex”. On Sunday, the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, suggested that more of Britain’s aid budget should be spent to discourage mass migration from Africa so that the UK does not have to “fish” refugees out of the Mediterranean.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/25/foreign-office-under-fire-aid-money-facebook-workshop-game-show-hamlet-workshop,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/25/foreign-office-under-fire-aid-money-facebook-workshop-game-show-hamlet-workshop
2015-06-25T13:06:45Z,global-development,Global development,Paraguay deploys anti-narco top guns to combat economic need for weed | Laurence Blair,"Néstor was 14 when a local drug trafficker first hired him to help bring in the harvest. “They need 20 to 30 people, because you have to harvest an entire hectare in two or three days while there’s a gap in the rains,” he says. “When the marijuana’s ready, you can’t leave it for long.” Growing up on the outskirts of Pedro Juan Caballero, a lawless town on Paraguay’s north-eastern border with Brazil, wasn’t easy. His father, a ranch manager, was away from home for three months at a time. His mother washed clothes to put food on the table. “Then they approach you, and say they’re going to pay you 80,000 guaraníes [£9.56; $15] a day, with an advance. You know how much your family is in need, so you’re forced to take it. And then you’re committed. That’s why everyone gets corrupted and goes to work there.” Thirty years later, Néstor – not his real name – is still in the business. He has his own plantation up in “the mountains”, the low fists of red sandstone that punch through the jungle of Amambay department. He employs a clutch of workers to live there, growing, guarding, and harvesting the crop. They are farmers who sold their small plots of land out of economic desperation, according to Néstor. They jump on the offer of any work, even if it means cultivating illegal crops. Néstor’s small house in Pedro Juan is dotted with souvenirs from his plantation. A feral baby jaguarundi scurries out from underneath a wardrobe to snatch chunks of meat from his wife’s hand. A pair of parrots sit on a tree out back, and watch as he brings out six bricks of pressed hashish – the potent, THC-heavy resin of the cannabis plant – weighing a kilo each.
It is a fraction of what Néstor can produce from Paraguay’s fertile red soil in two harvests a year. The landlocked nation of 7 million inhabitants is Latin America’s biggest producer of the narcotic after Mexico, and 80% of the country’s marijuana ends up in the megacities of Brazil, transported by criminal enterprises like Rio’s Red Command. Paraguay also increasingly serves as a corridor for Colombian, Peruvian and Bolivian cocaine bound for Brazil, Africa and Europe. The marijuana and cocaine trades are fuelled by the underdevelopment that has dogged Paraguay since independence. Over the past 10 years, successive modernising administrations have produced a GDP boom by supplying Brazil with beef, wheat and soybean. But mechanised agribusiness has left many of Paraguay’s rural communities behind. “Paraguay is a rich country, but full of poor people,” says Eladio Flecha, general secretary of the Partido Paraguay Pyahura (PPP; Party for a New Paraguay), a new political movement made up of several leftwing groups. “The distribution of wealth is very unequal: 80% of land is held by 2.5% of the population, and 161 people control 90% of the wealth of our country. Sure, the economy is growing fast, but it doesn’t reach the most vulnerable groups.” His party’s name is a mix of Spanish and Guaraní, the indigenous language spoken by more than 90% of the population, and as a first language by many. Lack of Spanish, the formal language of politics and business, joins other obstacles – such as low levels of education, poor communications and dirt roads that quickly turn to mud in the rain – to isolate rural communities. Flecha says small-scale farmers scarcely earn 8,000 guaraníes for a 70kg sack of the Paraguayan staple manioc. Over the past decade, more than 1 million small farmers and their families have migrated to informal jobs on the edges of towns, easy prey to the “temptation” offered by traffickers. Stemming the flow of marijuana “Eradication operations are the only real way of diminishing the supply of drugs and financially hitting the plantation owners. Here, in a single day, I can take up to 150,000kg of marijuana out of circulation,” says Captain Oscar Chamorro, from Paraguay’s overstretched National Anti-Drugs Secretariat (Senad), as 60 special forces troops line up in a hangar on the edge of Pedro Juan at dawn. They check their weapons, pile into cars, trucks and helicopters, and make their way out to a rendezvous in the mountains. On the way, Chamorro – who has 21 years of military experience, with 10 in Senad – dismisses the notion that Paraguayans are turning to pot to escape poverty. “They don’t do it to survive, they do it to earn money. Marijuana producers will tell you, ‘No, I don’t have anything else I can do’. But in reality, if the campesino cultivated his 10 hectares of land well, or put 10 cows on it, he’s going to earn enough to live on,” Chamorro says. “They’re just looking to boost their income. There’s not a single small farmer who doesn’t have his cell phone, his motorbike. They can earn more with narcotrafficking, but I don’t believe this is a valid excuse.” It is day three of a nine-day operation. Reconnaissance flights have already identified the marijuana plantations, dotted among private forest reserves. The helicopters drop off teams of six among the green stalks, where they work until the midday heat becomes too oppressive. Major Aldo Pintos jumps out and heads for a camp in the trees. A couple of tarpaulins cover a sleeping area, filled with colorful duvets and sacks of marijuana. A few toothbrushes are in a jar tied to a tree, and a pot sits over some glowing embers.
“They hide when they hear the rotors. They’re probably still nearby,” says Pintos, cradling his assault rifle in one hand. With the other, he pours cooking oil over the tents and touches a match to the plastic. In the next valley, the soldiers burn presses used to make the bricks of marijuana. Then, they form a loose line and take out their machetes, walking forward and hacking the plants to the ground. Chamorro’s men are highly motivated and disciplined: one of his officers was trained at Sandhurst, others by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which paid for the base in Pedro Juan. As they zoom around the hills, a casual observer might dismiss them as cowboys — Chamorro’s ringtone is Danger Zone from the movie Top Gun — but Senad put in the most hours of all of Paraguay’s public employees. It is, says Chamorro, “a vocation”. “You feel very proud knowing that you’re preventing these drugs going out on the streets. We all have a friend, a relative who’s living with the problem of drugs, and we know how much damage it does to society,” says Chamorro. “But we have a more modern drugs policy than many developed countries: we don’t lock up the user, but treat it as a health problem.” Eradication eats into the traffickers’ profits, he explains, and prevents them from moving into the cocaine trade: a trend borne out by Néstor, who has spent time behind bars in Uruguay and Brazil for transporting the powder. Senad agents periodically swoop on hidden airstrips, light aircraft and makeshift laboratories used to bulk up Andean cocaine paste and export it across the invisible border. The rivalry this lucrative business creates plays out to gory effect in Pedro Juan, says Cándido Figueredo, who has two decades’ experience reporting for the national daily ABC Color from his home town. “Here, a life is worth absolutely nothing,” he says. “The police sometimes find a body near the border in the morning, and they dump it on the other side. It’s less paperwork.” According to police figures, an annual average of 105 homicides occured in Pedro Juan between 2009 and 2014. Drug trafficking was a familiar feature under the military dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner. Drug money has further infected national politics since the return to democracy, contributing to endemic corruption and a culture of silence. “Loads of politicians, especially ones from the border, are 100% contaminated by the mafia and receive mafia support for their campaigns. In this country, if you have money, you can buy anyone: from a journalist to a minister,” Figueredo laments. The few independent journalists who speak out do so at their peril: disgruntled narcos have twice riddled Figueredo’s bungalow in Pedro Juan with machine-gun fire, forcing him to accept round-the-clock police protection. He also carries a 9mm pistol whenever he leaves the house with his guards.The mafia has killed four journalists since May 2014, including two within metres of the border between Pedro Juan and Brazil’s Ponta Porã. In October, when gunmen shot Pablo Medina, Figueredo’s colleague, national soul-searching gave rise to a new term: narcopolitica. It emerged that a marijuana-trafficking local mayor, allegedly protected by a congresswoman, had given the order. “Before Pablo Medina died, we believed we were on the right track. We ignored the fact that the marijuana business had grown, and occupied political space,” says Senad minister Luis Rojas in his office in Asunción, Paraguay’s capital.
“We realised that we couldn’t just continue with the strategy of cutting and burning marijuana. We had to investigate the structures behind it, just like with cocaine … And we had to realise that we don’t know how much marijuana there is in Paraguay. We don’t know about its economic and social impact. We don’t know anything.” Senad has since paid more attention to capturing and getting information from the kingpins. Rojas is creating a centre for research into marijuana trafficking, and is boosting rehabilitation and education efforts. The next challenge is to pass laws on campaign finance and property forfeiture, preventing drug bosses from controlling politicians and operating from jail. “It’s painful to admit the reality, but it’s the only way to build intelligent public policies. The rest is bullshit,” says Rojas. For the PPP’s Flecha, the changes – if delivered – will not come a moment too soon. But he disagrees with the claim that poor farmers turning to drug cultivation for survival is a thing of the past, and with the “militarisation” of the countryside. “The Paraguayan campesino’s form of subsistence is under attack from the big latifundistas [landowners] and agricultural exporters,” says Flecha. “There’s no escape, and so he falls under the control of the mafia. To genuinely combat the narcotraffickers, the government should have a policy for small producers, and strengthen traditional production.” Supporting smallholder farmers The southern department of Alto Paraná represents the problem in microcosm. While international agricultural firms show off gleaming rows of tractors and pesticide sprayers at a local trade fair, Francisco Pereira drives around the backroads, engaged in a tireless struggle to encourage local communities to hold on to their lands and forests and resist what he calls the “soybean-isation” of the countryside. Pereira, policy director of the World Wildlife Fund’s Paraguayan chapter, points out the fields of the stunted crop, creeping up on both sides of the road and planted within two metres of a local school’s windows, liberally sprayed with pesticides thanks to minimal restrictions by the state. “From the production perspective, soy brings greater earnings for Paraguay,” he agrees. “But from the point of view of the schools, of the families who are left with the soil, it’s a problem. There’s a real risk of the misuse of agrotoxins having a severe effect on campesino and indigenous communities.” The health concerns and economic pressures prove too much for many farmers, who sell up and move to the towns.
But Pereira and a handful of local NGOs are helping communities diversify into small-scale production for local sale and export. Farmers can secure significant returns from medicinal plants, and crops like watermelon and yerba mate — the bitter leaf drunk nationwide. And such products provide employment for the whole community, planting the seedlings in the village nursery, transferring them to the fields, and eventually harvesting them. Four years of encouragement from the WWF has turned things around in the village of Tavapy, says resident Simeon Luis. “All these trees that are here now are proof, and the houses too. Before there wasn’t anything. We’re thinking about moving into floriculture, and we’ve planted over 200,000 yerba plants. Within three or four years, they’ll begin making money. And then we’ll be able to breathe.” Restoring optimism and technical knowhow to Paraguay’s small farming communities so they can support themselves is “the missing component” in tackling marijuana cultivation, Chamorro admits. The government is already investing more in schools, but improvements will take time. And for some, changing the habits of a lifetime will be hard. Néstor is just getting started again after leaving jail. “I know a guy who owns a favela in Rio. There, a kilogram of marijuana gets 1,000 reais ($300; £191), so a thousand kilograms will earn me a million reais. Then I’ll be back in business,” he says. • This article was amended on 26 June to clarify that hashish is made using the resin of the cannabis plant rather than the sap, as originally stated.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/25/paraguay-drugs-small-farmers-marijuana-cocaine,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/25/paraguay-drugs-small-farmers-marijuana-cocaine
2015-06-25T06:00:11Z,global-development,Global development,Ten reasons why European governments should back a global tax body | Tove Maria Ryding,"In a basement under the UN headquarters in New York, the world’s governments are negotiating an agreement that could strengthen the future course of global tax systems. A deal on this could also dramatically contribute to financing poverty eradication and environmental protection, securing development priorities for the next 15 years. The talks – meant to lead to agreement on how to fund the sustainable development goals – will culminate in a global summit on financing for development in Ethiopia next month. A core issue in this heated discussion is whether developing countries have a right to sit at the table when global tax standards are decided.
Aware that they lose more money to international tax dodging than they receive in aid, developing countries have demanded fundamental changes to the way global standards for cross-border taxation and financial transparency are decided. They want a global body on tax cooperation under the auspices of the UN. Today, global tax standards are decided behind closed doors at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) – also known as the “rich countries’ club”. The result is a set of standards that disadvantage developing countries financially, and a broken global tax system, riddled with loopholes for tax dodgers. This system also creates a race to the bottom whereby governments clash in “tax wars” – fighting to get multinational corporations to pay taxes in their own country, while at the same time providing loopholes for multinationals to dodge taxes in other countries. The victims include national companies unable to compete with multinational corporations, and citizens, who face higher prices and poorer public services. Developing countries want a new tax body to foster global cooperation based on the simple principle that countries should not destroy the tax systems of other countries. This would strengthen the ability of countries to set their own tax rates and decide their own national systems. European states have different positions, but – in particular because of the UK and France – the EU is rejecting the proposal for a global tax body.
Here are 10 reasons why the EU should change its stance: A key step towards a coherent global system. The international tax system consists of a complicated web of legally binding bilateral tax treaties, and parallel international systems to regulate cross-border taxation. A global system offers the only way to remove this complexity. Stronger cooperation between tax administrations. A coherent global system will improve working conditions for tax administrations, enabling more efficient cooperation to ensure multinational corporations pay their taxes. Less unilateral action. Individual governments have resorted to blacklisting and aggressive national laws to protect their tax base. Under the status quo, we are likely to see more self-protective measures, which complicate the lives of ordinary people and those companies not evading taxes. An end to the “race to the bottom”. The fear of losing investments is driving governments to introduce tax incentives, loopholes and harmful tax practices. A better business environment. Diverse, inconsistent national tax systems create heavy administrative burdens, legal uncertainty and high risks for international business. A level playing field. Governments fear that being a “first mover” on tax transparency will push businesses to register in other jurisdictions. Through truly global negotiations, governments can agree coordinated action and ensure a level playing field.
Stronger implementation. No government feels obliged to implement tax standards that were adopted, without consent, behind closed doors. The UN is the only global institution where all governments participate as equals. Less double taxation and double-non-taxation. Mismatches between national tax systems explain why some get taxed twice on the same income while others don’t get taxed at all. Only truly global cooperation can end these problems. More financing for development in the poorest countries. The exclusion of the world’s poorest countries from decisions on global tax standards means that international systems often don’t consider their interests. This means lower tax income and scarcer financing for development. Fair and consistent global action against tax havens. Many governments try to protect their tax base through national blacklists based on criteria that are often unclear and inconsistently applied. The EU’s controversial new “tax haven blacklist” omits countries like Switzerland and Luxembourg but includes, for example, Liberia – one of the world’s poorest countries and not a major player in the offshore world. Action against tax havens must be fair, consistent and globally coordinated to be effective. There is also one last bonus reason. Right now, disagreements about the tax body are preventing governments from reaching an agreement on a wider financing for development accord. This deal, meant to be finalised in Addis Ababa, would be the first step towards the adoption of the sustainable development goals in September and the drafting of a climate treaty in December. Unblocking the stalemate over a global tax body could pave the way for more multilateral breakthroughs. It’s time for EU countries to call their negotiators in New York and tell them to shift position.

2015-06-24T23:01:02Z,global-development,Global development,Development finance's $83bn question: who will pay for gender equality? | Chiara Capraro and Kasia Staszewska,"While a significant number of governments have championed an ambitious standalone goal on gender equality and women’s empowerment in the negotiations on the sustainable development goals (SDGs), discussions on financing have struggled to reach agreement on issues that are fundamental to women. Last week, governments met in New York to draft the outcome document for the third international conference on financing for development (FFD), which will take place in Addis Ababa in mid-July. Negotiations are continuing as governments struggle to agree on key issues such as tax, a critical source of financing for development commitments, human rights and gender equality. The Addis Ababa conference is of crucial importance to women. Decisions made in the Ethiopian capital will determine how the SDGs will be financed. Although no specific costing for achieving gender equality and women’s rights within the context of the SDGs has yet been calculated, in the case of the millennium development goals (MDGs), which expire this year, the gender equality financing gap in low income countries was projected at $83bn (£53bn) in 2015. Because the new development agenda is universal – and far more ambitious than the MDGs – the costs are likely to be even greater. Yet it is not only the quantity of funds that matters but how funds are raised and who receives them. As women and men occupy different roles in society, different sources of money affect them differently.
Across the world, women carry out at least twice as much unpaid care work as men, and this contribution is often invisible and unrecognised. At work, women are worse off too. According to recent research by ActionAid, if women were paid as much as men and had the same access to jobs, they could be $17tn better off. Governments need to value women and their unpaid work when thinking about economic policy. The FFD process can and should address major structural issues such as tax dodging, which deprives developing countries of far more than they receive in aid. Lack of revenue forces governments to spend less on essential public services. This can have a disproportionate effect on women in poverty if, for example, you consider childcare or support for survivors of gender-based violence – both services that are used mainly by women. Governments should take the opportunity offered by the Addis meeting to accelerate progress on global tax reform that works for developing countries. Aid will continue to be a critical source of finance for the SDGs, especially for the least developed countries, but the share of aid supporting women’s needs is still too low. According to OECD GenderNet, in 2012-13 only 5% of aid had gender equality as a “principal” objective. Governments must recommit to meet the long-standing target of devoting 0.7% of GDP to aid, and increase the share of aid dedicated to gender equality, while investing more in supporting the crucial work done by women’s rights organisations on the ground. To date, huge emphasis has been placed on the role of the private sector in financing development, especially multinational companies. While the private sector has a role to play in creating decent jobs and ensuring equal pay for women, the footprint of many companies has been harmful to women’s rights at work.
We need to move away from voluntary corporate social responsibility commitments towards a legally binding regulation to make sure companies are accountable. If businesses did this, and paid their taxes in full, it would send a strong signal that the private sector is serious about supporting sustainable development, gender equality and women’s rights. The current draft of the Addis Ababa Accord starts well by stating a commitment towards gender equality and women’s rights, but falls short on staying true to this vision throughout. Lack of recognition of the structural causes of gender inequality, such as the disproportionate responsibility of unpaid care borne by women and girls, means it risks focusing only on what women can do for the economy rather than on how the economy must work in a way that supports rights for all. As governments continue their discussions, they must reach a consensus on financing methods that can really make a difference for gender equality and women’s rights for years to come. The vision for change is clear – now the money must follow.

2015-06-24T14:00:02Z,global-development,Global development,"There are no quick fixes to warzone rape, but Hague's summit was a vital first step | Madeleine Rees","The article “warzone rape seen as ‘costly failure’”, published on the Global development site earlier this month, raises, perhaps unintentionally, some of the crucial issues that need to be discussed as part of a strategy to combat gender-based and sexual violence in armed conflict. What needs to be prioritised? How do we determine budget allocation? What are the appropriate responses and how should we measure results? These are big questions. The overriding issue, though, is why does sexual violence happen and what can be done to address it? The Prevention of Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) set some very clear objectives, with ending the impunity of perpetrators the foremost. This, however, was merely a starting point.
The reality is that if men think of women as property – if violence at home, or committed by family members, is considered a private matter; if society continues to judge the conduct and dress of women in sexual violence cases; if the state fails to insist upon political, social, economic and cultural equality for women in all fields, and fails to engage with men in resolving the issue – then sexual violence will continue. The former British foreign secretary William Hague publicly asserts that the leading issue of these times is the empowerment of women. He speaks of the need to address the root causes of sexual violence and see sexual violence in conflict as a matter of international peace and security. And he is right. Rape destroys communities and the consequences are international, as peace remains unobtainable. PSVI is a component of a global agenda on women, peace and security that recognises the critical importance of women’s and girls’ empowerment and gender equality.
It is wrong to look at short-term indicators. Results will take many, many years. Rape in the Democratic Republic of the Congo will not end before the conflict does, and even then it will continue unless attitudes towards women also change. Legal frameworks have to be reformed and applied, mindsets transformed, social and economic systems put in place. These things can only be achieved by national governments. Hence the need to bring them on board and keep them committed. Budget is also important. Funding has been provided, and must be spent wisely. Though £5m was spent on the summit hosted by Hague and Angelina Jolie, the investment – tiny in relative terms – got more than 100 states on board. This should be compared with the more than £250m pumped into the Nato conference in Wales in the autumn of 2014 to discuss military deployments. Stopping sexual violence is an obligation under international law, but still it happens. Governments have made commitments by ratifying human rights treaties and the statute of the international criminal court but, as we know only too well, they commit only to walk away, with South Africa’s decision to let the Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir leave the most recent, shameful example. It does not mean that we should stop bringing them together to remind them of what they have to do. It gives civil society more advocacy possibilities and with the protocol, launched at the summit, a practical tool to work with. There was a lesson from the summit for the present UK government too. There can be no serious engagement on sexual violence without respect for, and delivery of, human rights, including economic and social rights and equality. State legal systems must incorporate these fundamental obligations and they must be complied with. PSVI has the potential to make a serious difference; it has started to do so and now needs to be strengthened. The UK must be robust in demanding accountability for sexual violence by peacekeepers and insist on the participation of women in all peace processes. Britain must also ratify the Council of Europe convention on preventing and combating violence against women, to which it committed three years ago. The principles Hague enunciated are above politics and are not negotiable. There is a manifesto commitment to continue with the work he started. Those of us who work in civil society want this initiative to succeed and will give it the support it merits. We also understand that there is no quick fix and that we all need to be in this for the long haul.

It had been expected that the government would lift the ban, imposed in 2010, when schools reopened following the end of the Ebola crisis but the education minister, Minkailu Bah, reaffirmed it. Now, after weeks of talks with the government, senior UN officials and UK and Irish aid representatives say they are on the verge of a significant breakthrough. It is estimated that a third of children in Sierra Leone are born to school-age children and there is anecdotal evidence that the incidence of teenage pregnancy rose sharply during the Ebola outbreak. Plan International, Save the Children and World Vision International have reported that sexual exploitation and violence against girls increased during the Ebola epidemic. In a survey of 1,100 girls and boys between the ages of seven and 18, 10% reported that girls, especially those who had lost relatives to Ebola, were having to engage in transactional sex to cover their basic needs. There were also reports of children being assaulted in quarantined areas. “This report confirms that Ebola has put an incredible strain on children’s lives and it will take time for them to recover. The impact on them has been huge,” said Casely Coleman, country director of Plan International in Sierra Leone. Aid agencies including the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), Irish Aid and the Department for International Development are working with the Sierra Leonean government to find a temporary solution that would involve girls being educated outside the classroom. They are insisting the girls should continue to receive formal education and not be downgraded to vocational studies. “Government and development partners want a way for these girls to stay in the formal education system and we are hopeful that we can find a solution. There is a flexibility and openness to find a solution,” said Sinead Walsh, the Irish ambassador to Sierra Leone. Walsh, who is responsible for discharging Irish Aid, which had a strong presence in the country before Ebola hit, continued: “This not a new problem for Sierra Leone and we have been working to find a solution before Ebola. We’ve looked at a lot of African countries where teenage pregnancy rates are high and there isn’t really a magic solution. “So this could be an opportunity for Sierra Leone to play a leadership role in the region and find something that works.” Aid agencies say off-site education is not a sustainable solution “in concept”, but would be a watershed for a country where the incidence of teenage pregnancy is so high. A senior UN official in New York described the bar on pregnant girls going to school – a policy in many African countries – as irrational and a breach of human rights. Kate Gilmore, deputy executive director of the UNFPA, said the ban would perpetuate the cycle of poverty and hold the country back economically. “Ebola may be going, but its presence and consequences for the country are enduring. This is a sign of how much the situation has deteriorated,” she said. Gilmore said the government should be concentrating on educating pregnant girls and ensuring they delivered healthy babies rather than stigmatising them. “We have a fantastic relationship with Sierra Leone over many many years before Ebola. Sierra Leone was doing an extraordinary amount to achieve a turnaround in sexual reproductive health and reduce infant mortality, particularly as a post-conflict country, so the tragedy of Ebola is intense on so many fronts, with the reversal of such hard-won gains alongside the loss of life,” she said. Sierra Leone is already one of the most dangerous places in the world to give birth, with maternal mortality and child mortality rates among the highest in the world. “These are the most vulnerable, they are at risk of child marriage and maternal mortality,” said one aid worker, who asked not to be named because of local sensitivity on the subject. Gilmore said she can understand that antipathy towards teenage pregnancy in many countries, but said traditional belief systems were not a reason to hold on to a “toxic norm”. She said it was possible to change social conventions: “We have done it with smoking, seat belts, FGM, there is no reason why we can’t do it with teenage pregnancy,” Gilmore said. “You can understand that irrationality might dominate in the early phase but pregnancy is a health issue, not a bar to education. This is eroding their capacity, as future parents, to be literate, to be numerate, to be part of economic society,” she said. “This is about the demographic dividend. There is an economic boom to be reaped here … that is there for the taking for Sierra Leone.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/24/sierra-leone-ban-pregnant-girls-school-attendance-access-education,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/24/sierra-leone-ban-pregnant-girls-school-attendance-access-education
2015-06-24T06:00:03Z,global-development,Global development,"Uganda: NGO bill aims to muzzle civil society, say activists","Ugandan civil society groups are warning that a bill to regulate non-governmental organisations is a blow to basic freedoms and threatens to curtail the activities of some groups, reducing essential services to some of the country’s poorest people. The NGO bill, which was published in the east African country’s official gazette in April, must be debated in parliament before it can be passed into law. That debate is expected to take place in the coming months, but NGOs are urging MPs not to send the bill to President Yoweri Museveni to be signed. Nicholas Opio, a human rights lawyer and the executive director of Chapter Four Uganda, said the legislation “would extinguish the very character of non-governmental organisations and make them puppets of the state. It unjustifiably restricts the space for civic engagement, civic association [and] civic participation in governance and in service delivery.” The new law will replace previous legislation – described by rights groups as stringent. According to its preamble, the aim is to “provide a conducive and enabling environment” for civil society organisations. The internal affairs minister, Aronda Nyakairima, wrote in an introduction to the bill that while NGOs provide key services such as health, education and water, “the rapid growth of non-governmental organisations has led to subversive methods of work and activities, which in turn undermine accountability and transparency in the sector”. Opio estimates there are around 11,000 registered NGOs in Uganda – there are no comprehensive official figures – and activists admit there is some lack of clarity about what they do and who runs them. But they say this opacity is due to the dysfunctional nature of the official NGO board, which is meant to regulate the sector. The board will be given new powers under the proposed law. Opio said Uganda’s efforts to tighten state control over NGOs mirrored similar actions by other governments across the region, citing notably a 2009 law on charity funding in Ethiopia, which included a provision stating that any organisation receiving more than 10% of its funding from abroad was a “foreign NGO”, and thus banned from any activities concerning democratic and human rights, conflict resolution or criminal justice. “It began in Ethiopia in 2009 with an extremely repressive NGO law and it appears many of the countries in the east and Horn of Africa are learning from Ethiopia,” Opio said.
Last year, Kenya shut down around 500 NGOs for non-compliance with the law, accusing some of using their charitable status as a front for raising cash for terrorism. In May, South Sudan’s parliament passed a law that would force aid agencies to ensure that no more than a fifth of their staff are foreigners. The bill is still awaiting the president’s signature. Under Uganda’s proposed legislation, the NGO board will register NGOs or community-based organisations and issue permits. NGOs will have to declare their sources of income and obtain permits from local authorities to operate. Groups that seek to operate without a permit could face fines, prosecution and criminal penalties of between four and eight years in prison for directors. The NGO Board will be able to revoke permits if NGOs contravene their constitutions or the bill, or if “in the opinion of the board it is in the public interest to do so”. The NGOs must also “not engage in any act which is prejudicial to the security and laws of Uganda”. The vague nature of these latter articles, in particular, have raised concerns. Livingstone Sewanyana, director of the Foundation for Human Rights Initiative Uganda, said the bill aims to create fear among activists. “The fight against corruption, human rights abuses and maladministration will be seriously jeopardised,” he says. “It seeks to disable citizens who would have a say in how they are governed – and the outcome is dictatorship.” As well as providing basic services to many communities, NGOs have worked to preserve the land rights of Ugandans living near oil finds and spoken out against government excesses and rampant corruption.
Maria Burnett, a senior researcher in the Africa division for Human Rights Watch (HRW), says government control over civil society risks negating the very essence of freedom of association. “We have documented threats to the operating space for civil society over many years in Uganda, [especially] groups working on oil transparency, human rights, land, governance, corruption and other sensitive issues, particularly when they publicly advocate for change,” Burnett says. Oil has been discovered around Uganda’s Lake Albert but production is not expected to start before 2018. Lawyer Isaac Semakadde, who works in a legal aid centre, says the bill, if it comes into law, will drive NGOs away. “It will make it impossible to establish and operate an NGO; as a result, practitioners will be selectively allowed to stay [in the sector], and those organisations that advocate against the government side will certainly be told to give way,” he said. Under the bill, NGOs are also banned from fundraising or campaigning for any political party or candidate. Ugandans will vote for a new president next year, and Museveni, who has held the job for nearly three decades, is widely expected to run again for his National Resistance Movement party. The 70-year-old leader has been criticized by some donors for hanging on to power, but there are no term limits in Uganda. Cissy Kagaba, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Coalition of Uganda, said NGOs would start to self-censor to avoid losing their permits. “The bill wouldn’t be bad if it intended to kick out quack [NGOs], but when you target whoever opposes the official position, then that does not work,” she said. Ofwono Opondo, a government spokesman, argued that the NGO bill was necessary to force the sector to be transparent and accountable. “There is even duplication of activities; NGOs claim they are providing water and when you go there you don’t find anything. We want them to specify their area of jurisdiction and what they want to do exactly,” he said. He linked opposition to the bill to anti-gay activists in a country with a growing anti-liberal movement, tough laws against homosexuals and a rise in religious conservatism. Opio said the NGO sector was not against regulation, per se. “What we are rejecting is control because we are non-governmental,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/24/uganda-ngo-bill-aims-muzzle-civil-society-say-activists,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/24/uganda-ngo-bill-aims-muzzle-civil-society-say-activists

The annual global trends study by the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, warns that the world is failing people in an “age of unprecedented mass displacement”. The Syrian conflict has led to a significant increase in refugees globally, with nearly four million Syrians living in Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and Iraq. A new campaign called Everyday Heroes of Syria is paying tribute to Syrian refugees and members of host communities who are banding together to support one another. In the latest instalment in our series reviewing the millennium development goals (MDGs), the focus turned to goal six, which aims to combat HIV and Aids, malaria and other diseases. You can learn more about how far the world has come in reducing the spread of disease in this explainer and a list of 15 achievements. There are also stories of hope from Ethiopia, where more children of HIV mothers are being born free of the virus, as well as in Kenya where progress on tackling malaria has been made but threats from climate change persist.

2015-06-23T12:26:59Z,global-development,Global development,Governments accused of ‘perpetrating violence against women’,"Governments are failing to meet their international obligations to protect women from violence by starving women’s groups of funding and closing the space in which they can operate, according to a report by ActionAid. Laws and national action plans introduced to end violence against women and girls are routinely ignored, while efforts by local civil society groups to push for change are being thwarted by threats and intimidation, the NGO said on Tuesday. A survey of 47 women’s rights activists from more than 20 countries, conducted by ActionAid and Women Human Rights Defenders International Coalition, found that more than 60% of women said they felt less safe in their work than they did two years ago. Of this group, 19% said they felt significantly less safe. Activists working on abortion, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights reported feeling particularly under threat. Armed militias, governments, the police and religious groups were identified as the main instigators of threatening behaviour, which includes verbal abuse, sexual remarks, sexual harassment and assault. ActionAid said rather than protecting women’s rights, and meeting the UN resolution adopted in 2013 to protect activists, “many governments are directly perpetrating violence against women, while failing to address cultures of impunity. And rather than supporting women in their struggle, many states are closing down the civil society space which all civil society, including women’s organisations, need in order to be effective.”
“More and more women are facing the fear of violence and its consequences for them and their families,” said Lucia Fry, head of policy at ActionAid. “The work of fearless women standing up against violence is being eroded by increasing intolerance of dissent and the rising influence of fundamentalist agendas that are anti-women’s rights. “As our survey shows, women activists from countries as diverse as Afghanistan, Nigeria, South Africa, Brazil and the US have all seen threats of violence increase, making them insecure and hampering their efforts to improve women’s lives and end violence in society.” The survey marked the launch of ActionAid’s Fearless campaign, which is calling on the UK to take a lead in working with the international community to fulfil its obligations to end violence against women and girls with practical action and adequate funding. Rights activists are hoping this year will be a catalyst for long-term change for women with the adoption in September of the sustainable development goals. A target to eliminate all forms of violence is expected to be included in the goals, which come into force for all countries next year. Speaking at the Fearless launch, the international development secretary, Justine Greening, said the proposed SDGs were “immensely powerful” and had the substance on achieving gender equality that was lacking in the millennium development goals. She added that the issues raised in the campaign were “so important”. “This is a battle that if we’re not winning it, we’re losing it. There are many people in many parts of the world who think women have too many rights, that it’s gone too far and should go back to where it used to be,” she said. “I have a voice and have a responsibility to use it to speak for those who don’t… to make sure we are winning that battle.” Figures published by the World Health Organisation in 2013 estimated that almost 30% of women experience physical or sexual violence at the hands of an intimate partner, despite more countries passing anti-violence laws. According to the World Bank, 76 out of 100 countries surveyed have laws to tackle domestic violence, compared with 13 in 1995.
An ActionAid report published with the survey outlined numerous cases of women being attacked in the course of their activism. These include Atena Farghadani, 28, an artist who was placed in solitary confinement in Iran for posting a cartoon on Facebook criticising a government bill to limit family planning services, and Gladys Lanza, who was convicted of defamation in Honduras when she spoke in defence of a woman who had accused a government official of sexual harassment. Samira Hamidi, former director of the Afghan Women’s Network, said she had been repeatedly threatened by opposition groups in the course of her work. “There are no prevention and protection mechanisms by my government where any women – but particularly women human rights defenders – can be supported.” ActionAid is calling on governments to adequately fund local women’s rights groups, which it said are critical to ending gender-based violence. A survey conducted in 70 countries over four decades found that the mobilisation of women’s rights organisations was the most important factor in turning commitments to end violence into meaningful action – having more impact than the number of women in parliament, or the wealth of a country. But, between 2012 and 2013, of the $28bn earmarked for gender equality globally, the overall funding for women’s organisations was less than $400m, said ActionAid. A global survey of 740 women’s organisations conducted by the Association for Women’s Rights in Development (Awid) in 2010 found the average annual income of these groups was just $20,000 (£12,000). Organisations in sub-Saharan Africa often receive just $12,000 a year.
Doris Owusu Prempeh, a member of a community-based anti-violence team (Combat) in southern Ghana supported by ActionAid, said she had seen a reduction in gender-based violence locally in the five years since her team had been working. The team, comprised of three women and four men, educate people about what constitutes domestic violence and why it’s wrong, and support those who have been attacked, with counselling and reporting the crime to the police. “When we started, we had so many cases [of violence] but now it has reduced to one a month. When we started, we got more than six or seven a month because there was no education about domestic violence,” she said. But there is only so much the group is able to do. Police are sometimes reluctant to pursue an arrest unless they are paid by the victim or the family. “We don’t have money and our work is voluntary so that makes it very difficult for us to report cases,” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/23/governments-accused-perpetrating-violence-against-women-actionaid-report-activists,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/23/governments-accused-perpetrating-violence-against-women-actionaid-report-activists
2015-06-23T12:14:05Z,global-development,Global development,"Economic inequality is greatest threat facing many nations, report says","Economic inequality will make it harder for countries to weather crises such as natural disasters and social unrest in the future, a study has shown. The 2015 Change Readiness Index (CRI) measured the ability of governments, businesses and civil societies in 127 countries to handle economic change and take advantage of investment opportunities. It evaluated each country’s quality of governance by looking at macroeconomic frameworks, business environments and the rule of law. Researchers also considered the freedom and influence of civil society groups. Economic inequality was seen as the greatest threat for many nations, leaving them vulnerable to financial shocks, according to the CRI, which was released on Tuesday by KPMG and Oxford Economics thinktank. A recent study by Oxfam on extreme wealth inequality said 85 of the world’s richest people had the same wealth as half of the world’s population.
Uneven economic growth does not reduce poverty as quickly as growth that is spread across societies, the CRI said. It also warned that worsening inequality can “lead to or exacerbate conflicts and reduce social cohesion”. The 2015 index said Namibia, Haiti and Guatemala had the least inclusive economic growth.
Some low-income countries ranked higher than expected in the CRI. Trevor Davies, executive director of KPMG’s International Development Assistance Services (Idas), said this was because of economic diversification, a strong rule of law, and educational opportunities. “We’ve found that the countries that do well are the ones that actually focus not just on the economic side, but also on bringing about good governance and improving the lot of their people – so making sure that the economic benefit flows through inclusively to their population,” said Davies. Mozambique, which came 80th in the index, performed better than any other low-income country, based on projections of gross national income. Uganda, Cambodia and Tanzania also ranked high in the index. Timothy Stiles, chairman of Idas, said: “Many countries compensate for lesser wealth with robust governance, a strong social foundation, and a positive business environment.” Algeria registered the biggest gain in this year’s rankings, because of “impressive improvements in its enterprise and government capability”, the report said. The Philippines’ strong political institutions demonstrated the importance of good governance in recovering from natural disasters, according to Davies. “Much of the country was devastated by typhoon Haiyan in 2013, but the Philippines’ effective policies and institutions have enabled it to persevere, and it is projected to be one of the world’s fastest growing economies in 2015.” The index showed that the volume of national income is the most significant factor in determining change readiness, with the top 22 spots in the index going to high-income countries. Small countries with high gross national income are the best positioned to handle economic shocks and take advantage of investment, the report said. Singapore came top, followed by Switzerland, Hong Kong, Norway, the United Arab Emirates, New Zealand, Qatar, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.
The report combined data from 22 primary survey questions that were gathered from 1,270 country experts around the world. Data sources included the World Economic Forum, World Bank, Legatum Institute, International Monetary Fund and United Nations.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2015/jun/23/economic-inequality-greatest-threat-facing-many-nations-report-says,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/datablog/2015/jun/23/economic-inequality-greatest-threat-facing-many-nations-report-says
2015-06-23T10:58:16Z,global-development,Global development,Kenyan president's call to arms on self-sufficiency carries health risks,"During the 25th African Union summit from 7-15 June, Kenya’s president Uhuru Kenyatta took to Twitter to urge his fellow leaders to move away from reliance on development aid from donor countries. In his tweet at the conference in South Africa, Kenyatta said that sometimes aid “only appears to be charitable” and “so often carries terms and conditions that preclude progress”.
Kenyatta has been a vocal opponent of perceived Western influence and power in Africa – notably since he was charged with crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. The charges, which related to post-election violence in 2007-2008 and were denied by Kenyatta, were dropped in December 2014 after key witnesses withdrew. But despite Kenyatta’s bold call for increased African self-sufficiency, could Kenya do without aid in the near future? Advocacy group Results has researched health financing in Kenya with the Kenya Aids NGO Consortium (Kanco). The study, Who Pays for Progress?, looks at the balance between Official Development Assistance (ODA) and Domestic Resource Mobilisation (DRM) such as tax, and will be launched in July. The data so far suggests it would be a major challenge to move away from aid in the health sector, and also difficult in other areas, such as education.
Of the overall health budget, 45% is currently provided by donors and 55% by the Kenyan state. In some programmes, the dependency on ODA is even greater. In a series of interviews in March 2015, we learned that the HIV and Aids programmes are funded 70% by donors, and work on nutrition is around 80% funded from ODA. Even these figures do not tell the whole story – for tuberculosis programmes, 23% of funding comes from domestic sources, and 17% from ODA, but 60% of the need is completely unfunded. At present the country needs to increase funding for healthcare if it is to fulfil the ambition stated in the 2010 constitution to achieve universal health coverage. “In the long run, all Kenyans would be happy to see a time when the country does not need aid,” said Allan Ragi, director of Kanco. “But at present, if ODA falls then we will be unable to deliver essential healthcare to the most needy.” In the medium term, there is more cause for optimism. Economists in Kenya see ample scope to increase domestic resources, for example by improving the efficiency of the tax system. The Kenya Revenue Authority has identified a significant number of high-net-worth individuals who could increase their tax payments, and the same is true of some multinational companies. Kenya had around 8,700 dollar millionaires in 2014 and in Nairobi alone, there are at least 65 high-net-worth individuals with wealth exceeding $30m. As well as improving tax revenue, the country could reduce illicit financial flows out of Kenya. According to authoritative research Kenya lost $4.9bn in capital flight in 2010 alone: this is approximately $120 per person. This ties in with global analysis that shows that while high-income countries collect an average of 34% of their GDP in taxes, low-income countries in Africa only collect 17%, or even less.
The government of Kenya has identified ways to close some tax loopholes and thus make more funds available for health and other development programmes. Capital gains tax of 5% was reintroduced on 1 January this year after an absence of 30 years. The National Aids Control Council has said it can increase the domestic funding of the HIV programme from 30% to 85%, but not until 2024. If Kenya can raise more domestic finance through taxation, and devote a greater share of the national budget to health, then the current funding gap for essential health programmes can be filled. Chatham House health economists estimate that around $86 per person per year is needed to deliver adequate health coverage in developing countries. President Kenyatta’s “call to arms” to fellow African presidents came just a month before the Financing for Development conference in Ethiopia on 13-16 July, where the world community will debate how to pay for development priorities over the next 15 years. Kenyatta’s call for self-sufficiency will surely find a great deal of support in Addis Ababa, but health economists will be urging caution, and will want assurances that domestic finance for health is in place before ODA dries up. Steve Lewis is head of policy at Results UK. The report Who Pays for Progress? will be launched during the Addis Ababa conference on Monday 13 July",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/23/kenya-president-kenyatta-aid-african-self-sufficiency-health-tax,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/23/kenya-president-kenyatta-aid-african-self-sufficiency-health-tax
2015-06-22T23:01:03Z,global-development,Global development,"68 million children likely to die by 2030 from preventable causes, report says","Almost 70 million children under five will die by 2030 from mainly preventable causes unless the world is bolder and more strategic about helping the poorest and most vulnerable young people on the planet, Unicef has warned in a blunt final report on the millennium development goals (MDGs). The UN children’s agency says that while the MDGs have yielded significant achievements in reducing child and maternal mortality and improving access to drinking water, they have failed millions of disadvantaged children and even increased levels of inequality within some countries. Unicef attributes the failures to a lack of ambition and planning, but also points to the way in which data was collected and used – and the fact that the MDGs “inadvertently encouraged” countries to measure their progress through national averages. “In the rush to make that progress, many focused on the easiest-to-reach children and communities, not those in greatest need,” says the report, Progress for Children: Beyond Averages.
“In doing so, national progress may actually have been slowed. This is because we were not strategic enough. Though it was once assumed that reaching the hardest-to-reach was unrealistic, we now know that investing in the most disadvantaged children can actually be more cost-effective.” The agency says that the sustainable development goals – which will replace the MDGs later this year and set the development agenda until 2030 – must take into account lessons learned from their predecessors if lives are to be saved and futures altered. Without concerted action to reach the most vulnerable children, Unicef estimates that by 2030, 68 million more children under five will die from mainly preventable causes; 119 million children will still be chronically malnourished, and half a billion people will still be defecating in the open. In sub-Saharan Africa, the risk of a child dying before her or his fifth birthday in the region is almost 15 times higher than the risk facing a child born in a high-income country, while Unicef estimates that, at the current rate, it will take 96 years for all girls from the region’s poorest families to complete their lower secondary education.
The report also notes that neonatal deaths currently represent a larger share of the total under-five deaths than they did in 1990: by the end of 2015, about 1 million children – 16% of all under-five deaths – will die on the same day they were born. Eleven children are predicted to die every minute in 2015. The differences within countries are equally stark: children from the poorest households are twice as likely to die before turning five – and far less likely to achieve minimum reading standards – as children from the richest households. Although Unicef’s executive director, Anthony Lake, insisted the MDGs as a whole had “absolutely not” failed the world’s children, he said the report had to serve as a wake-up call. “If the global community allows the current trends to continue, we will fail millions of children,” he said. “This shows the huge stakes in achieving the goals of the SDGs and we believe that to achieve the most results, most efficiently, we have to focus ever more on the most disadvantaged children.” Lake said targeting the poorest children was the best way to reduce cycles of intergenerational poverty and improve the lives of families, communities and societies. “They are where the needs are greatest and our modelling over the years has shown that it’s the most cost-effective way to achieve results, because the results you achieve in the most disadvantaged areas almost always outweigh the additional costs of reaching those areas,” he said. Despite its bleak assessment of some MDG progress, the report highlighted a series of successes in the fight against poverty, disease and mortality levels since 1990. It pointed out that under-five mortality dropped by 53%; that chronic malnutrition among children under five decreased by 41%; that maternal mortality decreased by 45%, and that 2.6 billion people gained access to improved drinking water sources.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/23/unicef-68-million-children-under-five-die-2030-preventable-causes-report,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/23/unicef-68-million-children-under-five-die-2030-preventable-causes-report

The draft goals call for an end to poverty “in all its forms everywhere” and set the target of reducing “at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions”. But how do countries measure the multidimensional nature of poverty and track progress towards reducing it? Multidimensional poverty measurement has been rapidly evolving over the past five years, both at the national and international level. Since 2010, the UN Development Programme’s human development report office has published a Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), developed with and calculated by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) at the University of Oxford.
The index complements traditional measures of monetary poverty and captures the multiple, overlapping disadvantages poor people can face – such as poor sanitation, malnutrition, poor quality of housing and lack of education. According to the latest updates of the Global MPI, released by OPHI on 22 June and covering 101 developing countries, 1.6 billion people are living in multidimensional poverty around the world. Of this number, most MPI poor people – 69.6% – live in middle-income countries. In addition, looking at the 67 countries for which there is comparable data on both MPI and monetary poverty, 29% or 1.4 billion people are MPI poor, while 1.07 billion or 22% live on less than $1.25 a day. In certain countries, including Mexico, Pakistan and Egypt, the number of those living in multidimensional poverty is twice the number who are living on less than $1.25 a day, and is more than 1 million people. This emphasises how the MPI complements monetary poverty measures, as both together better capture the true reality of poverty. This month more than 100 policymakers and senior officials came together in Cartagena, Colombia, for the third annual meeting of the Multidimensional Poverty Peer Network (MPPN), a group of more than 40 governments and institutions that promotes the use of national multidimensional poverty measures. In a communique released after the meeting, which was hosted by President Juan Manuel Santos and the government of Colombia, theparticipants called for an improved Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI 2015+) to be included in the SDGs.
This index would reflect progress towards tackling different dimensions of poverty, and could also be broken down to show exactly what poverty is like in different areas of a country, or among different groups of the population. Such information would help ensure that no one is left behind by the post-2015 development agenda. The network supports governments designing national MPIs using indicators of poverty that are relevant to their specific country contexts. The governments of Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Bhutan, as well as the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, have already adopted official multidimensional poverty measures. And a rapidly increasing number of countries, including Pakistan, Philippines, Malaysia, Tunisia and Vietnam, are developing their own MPIs. What is electric is how these measures galvanise action. By pinpointing exactly how and where people are poor, national MPIs enable governments to better target their resources and combat poverty more effectively through integrated and well-coordinated policy interventions. The MPPN hopes that the global and national MPIs will receive support at the UN’s conference on financing for development in Addis Ababa next month. It also hopes the MPIs will be recommended as indicators by the expert group that recently concluded its first meeting on the indicator framework in New York. How we understand poverty is changing – its multidimensional nature is now widely acknowledged. But recognising this fact in the SDGs is, in itself, not enough. We must commit to measuring multidimensional poverty to ensure that the many overlapping disadvantages faced by the poor can be energetically and successfully tackled.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/22/end-poverty-measure-development-goals-sanitation-education-nutrition,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/22/end-poverty-measure-development-goals-sanitation-education-nutrition
2015-06-22T06:00:05Z,global-development,Global development,Peru harnesses ancient canal system to tackle Lima water shortage | Dan Collyns,"In the mountains above the Peruvian capital Lima, the world’s second largest desert city, scientists are working with farmers to restore ancient canals, believed to predate the Inca empire, in an effort to tackle the city’s increasing water shortage. The system – known locally as mamanteo, a term derived from the Spanish word for suckling, or amunas – could help the city of nearly 10 million inhabitants to ride the seasonal extremes of floods and droughts. It works by funnelling water from highland streams into the mountain itself, where it percolates through cracks and natural aquifers over months to emerge in springs and natural reservoirs. “It’s all about building in delays in the hydrological runoff of these catchments because if the water continues through this stream it will reach the village downstream in a question of hours. Letting it seep through the mountain, we expect to build in delays of weeks and hopefully months,” says Bert De Bièvre, an expert on Andean water basins working with the Consortium for the Sustainable Development of the Andean Ecorregion, an NGO. The delay means that the abundant wet-season moisture in these highlands at more than 3,500 metres above sea level can be gradually distributed during the dry season, which can last more than half the year. Floods and landslides killed nine people, left thousands homeless and caused major infrastructure damage on the outskirts of Lima in March. Meanwhile, unusually warm autumn temperatures brought drought in other parts of the city, where at least 700,000 live without running, potable water, according to Sedapal, the city’s water board. A third of Peruvians live in Lima and up to 150,000 migrants continue to swell its infrastructure-starved peripheries every year. Authorities are struggling to supply the growing population, dependent on three rivers that flow from the Andes: the Rímac, Chillón and Lurín. Regrouting and maintaining the pre-Inca drainage canals provides a cheap alternative to building modern hydric infrastructure, according to De Bièvre. Experts believe they may have been built by the Wari culture as long ago as 700AD, yet De Bièvre says it is clear they were “developed over centuries by different cultures … and we are just one more of them”. State funding for the project began in March. Peru’s national water regulator Sunass multiplied the proposed budget, diverting 1% of consumer tariffs from Sedapal over the next five years – more than 70m Peruvian soles, or about $22m (£14m) – to green infrastructure. This will include restoring amunas and recuperating highland wetlands. A further 3.8% of tariffs, approximately $89m, will be used for climate change adaptation and disaster risk mitigation. The investment in green infrastructure would mean an increase in Lima’s water volume by at least one cubic metre a second, which makes it “very affordable” in contrast to building a canal, said Fernando Momiy, the president of Sunass. “Lima is a desert city which keeps growing and in five years there will be another 700,000 inhabitants who will need water. That’s why we need to look at combining grey infrastructure with green infrastructure,” said Momiy. “It’s the first time that a regulatory body has promoted this kind of infrastructure in Lima. We see that there’s a lot of focus on grey infrastructure when we should be looking at green infrastructure, so as not to have to invest so much in expensive grey infrastructure.” Pointing to water crises in California, the UK and Sao Paulo in Brazil, Momiy said: “There’s no reason to think that couldn’t happen to us.” With a commanding view of the distant smog above Lima, the small district of Huamantanga feels far removed from the city that houses a third of Peruvians. “Here we count on the expertise of the local people who know all the water sources and springs,” says De Bièvre.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/22/peru-harnesses-ancient-canal-system-to-tackle-lima-water-shortage,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/22/peru-harnesses-ancient-canal-system-to-tackle-lima-water-shortage
2015-06-20T08:00:10Z,global-development,Global development,Aid agencies must rewire their approach to refugees' energy needs | Michael Keating and Rob Bailey,"Many years ago, UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, printed a poster of Albert Einstein with the caption “Einstein was a refugee” – a reminder of the enormous contribution that refugees have made to the world. But this World Refugee Day, instead of celebrating their contribution, we will unfortunately have to focus on finding solutions for an unprecedented global crisis. António Guterres, the head of the UNHCR, has spoken of a world facing “an unchecked slide into an era in which the scale of global forced displacement, as well as the response required, is now clearly dwarfing anything seen before”. There are now nearly 60 million forcibly displaced people in the world: that’s almost the same as the combined populations of Canada and Australia. Half of these displaced people are children, and the overall numbers are increasing rapidly.
Addressing this problem demands coherent migration and refugee policies. Reversing the trend will require effective conflict resolution and prevention. These all remain a long way off. In the meantime, we must find practical, humane and cost-effective ways to respond to the needs of displaced persons. Like everyone else, displaced people need access to safe, reliable and clean energy, whether for lighting, heating, cooking, sanitation, earning a living or communicating. They rarely get this. Every situation is different, but millions of people in camps depend on rudimentary or primitive energy solutions, such as three-stone fires and candles. This has profound human, environmental and economic consequences. Accidents with naked flames can cause injuries and death, such as this month’s tragic example in a Syrian refugee camp in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, where at least four people were killed when dozens of tents caught fire. Indoor cooking with open fires contributes to serious respiratory illness, chiefly among women and children who tend to be most exposed to the fumes. The same women may also spend hours each day gathering firewood, increasing the risk of gender-based violence, especially as areas around camps become deforested and the women are forced further and further afield in search of firewood. Humanitarian agencies try to provide what energy they can but their efforts can often be inefficient and costly. The potential benefits of doing things differently are obvious. They include reduced deforestation, carbon emissions and pollution; improved health and reduced levels of violence; and lower costs. Better energy access can also create livelihood opportunities and could improve relations between displaced people and local populations by supporting enterprise or generating benefits for both communities.
So why is access to sustainable energy not front and centre in responses that seek to address the needs of displaced people? The problem is not technological. A breathtaking range of innovative products and services exists to meet needs for everything from lighting and cellphone charging to cooking and heating, water pumping and cooling. Some technologies, such as solar PV or panels and mini-grids, are highly advanced. Others, such as fuel-efficient stoves, are basic. All offer cleaner, safer and more reliable energy at an affordable price, and represent a significant improvement on the current situation. However, a host of obstacles – political, financial and institutional – constrain humanitarian agencies in their efforts to meet the energy needs of displaced populations. Governments and local authorities in host countries may be reluctant to facilitate energy access for refugees, particularly if local populations have unmet needs, or if they fear increased energy provision may prolong the existence of a camp. Although most solutions offer very attractive payback times, agencies may struggle to find predictable, long-term funding to procure them. Within the humanitarian system, energy often falls through the cracks. Dedicated agencies, organisational arrangements and funding lines exist for basic needs such as food, water, shelter and health. But not for energy. This means that in the rush to save lives and respond to crises, energy provision is often an afterthought – uncoordinated and short-term. The scale of these challenges cannot be understated. Success will require rewiring the humanitarian system, developing new funding models, building capacities and expertise where none currently exist, and persuading governments with responsibilities for refugee influxes to try new approaches. Crucially, it will also require the involvement of the private sector, which is often where the deepest expertise and capacity for innovation lies. The Moving Energy Initiative, a partnership between the UNHCR, GVEP International, Chatham House, Practical Action Consulting, the Norwegian Refugee Council and the UK’s Department for International Development has been formed to address these challenges. Working in different countries and with other collaborators, the project is designing and piloting new approaches and models for energy provision among displaced populations, building the case for reform and developing recommendations for systemic change. This year the international community will agree a new set of sustainable development goals. As currently proposed, the seventh goal is to “ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”. If “all” is to mean everyone, the humanitarian system has to start changing now.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/20/aid-agencies-refugees-energy-access-moving-energy-initiative-unhcr-einstein,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/20/aid-agencies-refugees-energy-access-moving-energy-initiative-unhcr-einstein
2015-06-20T06:00:08Z,global-development,Global development,World Refugee Day: stories of everyday heroes helping Syrian refugees,"With nearly four million Syrian refugees in Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and Iraq, a heavy toll has been placed on local populations. Basic infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and water supplies, has been placed under enormous strain. But despite the pressures, many local communities have stepped in to help new arrivals. Refugees have also banded together to support each other. To mark World Refugee Day, the European commission’s humanitarian aid and civil protection department (Echo) has partnered with the Danish Refugee Council to pay tribute to the everyday heroes supporting Syrian refugees. “There is a lot of media coverage highlighting the negative impact of the crisis on the refugee-hosting countries, but there are also many positive stories that never get reported,” says David Verboom, Echo’s regional head of office in Amman, Jordan. “This is an attempt to redress the balance a little, to shine some light on the generosity and friendship shown towards the refugees, and vice versa, that often goes unnoticed.”
Ahmad Khalif, 42, father of six from Al-Hasakah, Syria, now living in Darashakran refugee camp, Iraq Khalif fled Syria in August 2013 with his wife and six children, taking nothing but the clothes they were wearing. The quietly spoken 42-year-old now lives in Darashakran refugee camp, where he has become a father figure, helping more than 300 families access clothes, food and medicine. “They come here with nothing. [Just] the clothes on their back. Many have not eaten for days and they are scared. The children cry a lot,” Khalif says. “You become aware of those that are really struggling, so I make calls and talk to people and we share what we have. We don’t make a fuss. We leave the clothing, food or blankets at night so it can be found in the morning. “We may not have much, but what we do have we share. Are we not called humans, after all?”
Jawan Rafiq Fathullu, 38, district mayor of Darashakran, Iraq “It is not good enough to give a tent and leave them. We must ensure we offer dignity too,” says Fathullu, one of the few female mayors in Iraq. She aims to offer a personal welcome to each refugee who arrives in the district, and has overseen the construction of Darashakran camp, home to 11,000 Syrian refugees. She says the camp has reliable electricity, water and sanitation facilities, as well as green areas for children to play and families to meet. “Our door here is always open because we, like our brothers and sisters in Syria, are humanitarian people who look after one another. From one human to the next, I offer my support. I want them to feel secure.”
Marian Dirani, women’s resource centre director, Qsarnaba, Lebanon Dirani is the director of one of the few women’s resource centres for Syrian refugees in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley. “The stories I have heard from women I work with are often unbelievably heartbreaking. But at the same time, day by day, I see their strength grow, their heads rise and strength building as they learn new skills that help empower them,” Dirani says. More than half of the 400,000 refugees from Syria living in the Bekaa Valley are women and children. “Most days women just sit in their homes, cook, clean and worry about how they will be able to provide a good future for their children. Some women have been abandoned by husbands who take on younger, second wives. They struggle and even push their daughters into early marriage or pull their children out of school so they can work and earn money,” Dirani says.
Maya Terro, 29, Foodblessed co-founder and director, Beirut, Lebanon With food donated by local restaurants and food manufacturing companies, Terro runs a street feeding programme for refugees in Beirut. In the three years since the project began, Foodblessed has provided more than 190,000 meals to vulnerable people including Syrian families. Terro leads a growing team of more than 400 volunteers who make and distribute meals from food that would have otherwise ended up as waste. “I used to think that people didn’t care, but I’ve found out that people just didn’t know how,” she says.
Ahmad Abu Hamad, 24, Radio Al Balad journalist, Amman, Jordan Journalist Ahmad Abu Hamad is a Palestinian refugee who grew up in Jordan’s Madaba refugee camp. Having experienced life as a new arrival, he says his aim is to bring humanity into the conversation on refugees. “There is a misconception that people believe a refugee has no responsibilities. But to become a refugee, that person has had only three options to choose from – to be killed, to be imprisoned or to become a refugee. It is that simple. “Last week I interviewed a 20-year-old refugee girl. When we spoke I looked at her and thought, ‘What has she done? No home, alone. A refugee because of what?’”
Deema Yaseen, 30, volunteer physiotherapist with Souriyat Across Borders, Amman, Jordan Many things have changed for 13-year-old Salam Al Jundi in the past 15 months, among them being able to smile and walk. In March 2014 the young Syrian was walking with her young brother and cousin to a shop near her home to buy sweets when a bomb struck their path. Her cousin died, her brother was injured and Salam lost her leg. With no treatment available near their home, her parents took the chance and sent Salam and her eight-year-old brother to Souriyat Across Borders, a medical centre in Jordan offering free treatment to Syrian refugees. “These kids do not only need treatment but also love and encouragement. Their disability is a mark in their mind and a lot of them lose faith in a brighter future,” says Yaseen, a volunteer physiotherapist. “I always ask them, ‘Do you need your legs or head to think and attend school?’ That way I encourage them to believe that they can study and achieve their dreams.”
Hala Abu Said, 26, children’s art therapy centre volunteer, Al Badr, Amman, Jordan More than half of the Syrian refugee population are children, and agencies are working to provide psychosocial support for children, both in refugee camps and host communities. One form of support is art therapy, which aims to help children express themselves and share stories with others who have had similar experiences. Artist Hala Abu Said, a Syrian refugee herself, says she hopes she can make a small difference in the lives of the children she works with. “This is the best gift I can give the kids as an artist. Every person has something to help Syrians, regardless of their nationality.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/20/world-refugee-day-everyday-heroes-helping-syrian-refugees,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/20/world-refugee-day-everyday-heroes-helping-syrian-refugees
2015-06-19T14:38:54Z,global-development,Global development,Humanitarian funding is not enough: we must increase people's resilience | Jemilah Mahmood,"International humanitarian assistance reached record levels in 2014, totalling $24.5bn (£15.5bn), according to the recently released Global Humanitarian Assistance (GHA) report. Despite this unprecedented level of support, however, UN coordinated appeals fell short by 38%, or $7.5bn. This trend looks set to continue: six months into the year, the UN’s current humanitarian appeal is only 26% funded. To put it simply, growing funding is not keeping pace with demand. There has been much discussion about “closing the gap”, an objective that the high-level panel on humanitarian financing – announced by the UN secretary general Ban Ki‑moon last month – will be looking at very closely. In preparation for the World Humanitarian Summit in May next year, we must go beyond simply seeking a bigger pot for humanitarian funding. More resources are clearly required, but we also need to diversify the mix of ingredients in the pot, and ensure that we have the right chefs. The GHA report points out that most humanitarian resources are going to a very small number of acute emergencies. In 2014, just five crises – those in Syria, Central African Republic, South Sudan, Iraq and the countries affected by the Ebola outbreak in west Africa – received 57% of total reported funding. The top 20 largest recipients in 2013 received 71% of the total international humanitarian assistance given over the past decade, with four of these – Palestine, Sudan, Ethiopia and Afghanistan – among the top 10 every year since 2004.
Most humanitarian action is no longer short-term. The reality is that 90% of humanitarian appeals last for at least three years – and the average length of an appeal is seven years. In response, humanitarian funding mechanisms are evolving. In December 2012, the UN launched its first multi-year emergency appeal, for Somalia. By March 2015, there were 13 multi-year response plans with corresponding multi-year appeals. Humanitarian actors are also seeking greater efficiencies in the way they work, for example by using cash transfers. In areas where markets are functioning, giving people money instead of goods allows them to choose how best to meet their needs and also stimulates local economies. New technologies like electronic payments can improve the speed and efficiency of the response. In spite of progress and innovation, humanitarian needs are outpacing the response. This is partly because in protracted crises, such as in Syria, where people are displaced by violence that continues with no end in sight, or in the Sahel, where drought recurs every few years, people’s needs are multi-dimensional. Their need for life-saving assistance overlaps with more everyday necessities, such as sending children to school, buying medicine if a family member gets sick, paying rent and keeping the lights on. Humanitarian actors perennially find themselves filling gaps left by the deterioration or absence of development, yet we are not best placed to do so and lack the right resources. To put things in perspective, consider that in 2013 humanitarian funding flows to the top 20 crises totalled approximately $9.6bn. In the same year, foreign direct investment to those same 20 countries was $24.1bn, development assistance was $35.8bn, and remittance flows – money sent home by those living and working overseas – totalled $66.7bn. Domestic government expenditure was $299.8bn. Humanitarian assistance fills a gap that other types of investment do not because it meets the acute needs of the most vulnerable people. Clearly, the disjointed way that we address these situations belies the fact that humanitarian crises are inextricably linked to other factors including vulnerability, poverty, inequality and political and environmental fragility. The simple fact is that these protracted and recurrent crises cannot be addressed through humanitarian action alone. It is not just about better linking of humanitarian and development approaches: a fundamental shift is required in the way we support people living in fragile contexts.
The series of critical global meetings in 2015 and 2016 offers us the opportunity to do just that. We must harness the strengths of multiple actors and multiple sources of finance to reduce vulnerability and dependency on humanitarian aid, and increase people’s resilience to crisis. We should use this pivotal moment to leverage finance in a more people-centred and comprehensive way, including public, private, domestic and international resources. This means scaling up mechanisms to reduce vulnerability, such as cash programming and social protection, and stepping up investments in preparedness. We must deliver on our commitment to gender equality, starting by making the use of gender markers for funding a mandatory requirement for donors.
Alternative funding – crisis insurance cover, climate adaptation finance, and faith-based funding in similar vein to Islamic social financing – should also be explored. Finally, we must mobilise domestic and regional resources to increase investment in the capacity to respond to crises at local, national and regional level. Investment in women and girls should be included. This shift would also enable international humanitarian actors to focus on what they do best: intervening in sudden crises that overwhelm domestic response capacity, and in conflicts where the duty to protect is clear. Let us capitalise on the opportunities offered by the sustainable development summit in September, the climate change conference in December, and next year’s world humanitarian summit. This is the time to accelerate our efforts and work collectively towards a better future for people who are living through crises.

2015-06-19T12:32:09Z,global-development,Global development,Turkey elections mark the start of a revolution for women | Semanur Karaman,"“This victory is the common victory of all women of Turkey, ” Selahattin Demirtaş, co-president of the Peoples’ Democratic party (HDP), said in a television address to millions of citizens awaiting the outcome of the national elections on 7 June. As a young feminist, I was pleasantly surprised when the election results delivered a blow to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s growing authoritarianism. It’s important to be aware of the weight of Demirtaş’s words. In an environment where politicians rarely recognise women in the public sphere other than as someone’s mother, wife or daughter, his words were revolutionary. Official speeches concerning women in Turkey are delivered to console grieving mothers when sons die in the conflict-ridden south-east, when routine gendercide claims the life of someone’s wife, or when a mourning father is interviewed about the rape of his daughter. Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party (AKP) and his socially conservative electoral base does not recognise the importance of female participation in the public and political sphere. Last November, while attending a women’s rights conference, the president said he did not believe men and women are equal and that feminists don’t accept the concept of motherhood. The secular, modern, urban elite is not so promising on gender, either. The Kemalist section of the population still backs a discourse suggesting that Mustafa Kemal Atatürk – a male politician, naturally – “gave” women constitutional rights, but more specifically the right to vote and be elected, in the 1930s. Consequently, until the arrival of the HDP, there has never been a party recognising that women have struggled to assert their rights throughout Turkey’s history. The Kemalists have failed to acknowledge the struggle of Ottoman women, who sought labour rights, political representation and the end of forced marriage and polygamy as early as the 18th century. Islamists and secularists, meanwhile, have failed to recognise that Turkish women acquired their most fundamental rights through setting up associations and trade unions, organising marches and writing in newspapers – even at the cost of imprisonment and violence. It was not because they were helped by male politicians. The record number of women elected as MPs is the result of an enduring struggle over generations, despite entrenched gender violence, institutionalised impunity to perpetrators, and a political system that arbitrarily restricts women’s participation in the public sphere. On election day, the behaviour of one MP, the AKP’s Muzaffer Çakar, was emblematic of the discourse pertaining to women’s place in politics. He told the women of Karahasan village in Muş to go home and send their husbands to vote on their behalf. The HDP’s victory is not just groundbreaking, it’s revolutionary. Not only because Turkey will have the highest number of women in its history in the next parliament – almost a fifth of MPs – but also because a party is attempting to challenge the dominant political discourse and gender discrimination. The HDP is the only party with a “declaration on women”. In its official party documnents, it calls itself a “women’s party”. It promises a women’s ministry to address gendercide and institutional gender discrimination. The election result has given me hope for Turkey’s future. However, this hope istempered by an awareness of the persistent challenges that female politicians face. They will have to operate in an environment where their legitimate roles will be challenged by high-level government officials. They will have to acknowledge Turkey’s role in the Syrian conflict. The newly elected female MPs cannot ignore the suffering of thousands of Syrian women that is partly due to Turkey’s support for radical groups in Syria. Additionally, women will have to play an active role in the suspended peace process with Turkey’s Kurdish minority, to ensure that a gender-sensitive approach is implemented. The responsibility on their shoulders is immeasurable. Filiz Kerestecioğlu, a feminist human rights lawyer who is now an HDP MP, said before the elections: “We deserve happiness and freedom.” Keep an eye on Turkey – a gender revolution that could have an impact on the wider region is on its way.

2015-06-19T10:30:02Z,global-development,Global development,Pope's climate change encyclical glosses over role of population growth | John Vidal,"It’s more than 150 pages long with lots of commentary on climate, water scarcity, waste, the state of humanity, poverty, consumption, justice, morality and technology. But for all the papal encyclical’s reliance on peer-reviewed science and state of the art environmental analysis, there is only one brief mention by Pope Francis of the massive population growth that has overwhelmed many countries in the past 50 years as a direct result of Catholic teaching. And there are just 11 mentions of women. These two whopping elephants in the Basilica of St Peter throw some doubt on whether the encyclical is really a radical analysis of the state of the world intended to speak to everyone, as Francis has said he wants it to be, or is aimed at the upper echelons of a divided church in need of fresh teachings.
The Vatican has never fully grasped that women are the world’s greatest asset for development and environmental protection, or that having 90 million extra mouths a year to feed, almost all in the world’s poorer countries, inevitably puts nature and poor countries’ resources under immense extra pressure. In a passage that could come straight from an academic text or a modern northern liberal NGO eager not to offend, the Pope says to blame population growth rather than extreme consumerism for any of the world’s ills is “an attempt to legitimise the present model of distribution”. However, by declaring family planning off limits in a major discussion about the global environment and development, he may also have weakened his central argument that poverty and environmental destruction everywhere go hand in hand. Instead, his broad popular message is aimed at countries such as the Philippines, Mexico and Brazil which, with about 350 million Catholics between them, dominate the church’s interests. Here Francis the superstar knows his audience and has positioned himself as the most powerful, possibly the only, voice of the global south. Here, too, the encyclical becomes highly political – chiming with the simmering frustrations and agendas of popular mass movements and agrarian groups who are already hostile to multinational companies. But by publicly scolding the financial elites, neo-liberals and the politicians of rich countries who, he argues, have monopolised the world’s resources, the radical Francis links straight to the liberation theologists of the 1960s and 70s. This powerful Latin American movement of priests greatly influenced popular movements in that region before the Vatican, under Pope John Paul II, tried to squash it by excommunicating its leaders.
Liberation theology retreated but it never disappeared and now Francis’s fresh teaching that the church is “for the poor” adds environmental responsibility to the older radical arguments for fundamental political change as a response to the poverty and the ill-treatment of ordinary people. Significantly, too, the encyclical has been welcomed by many of the world’s most influential non-faith organisations and liberal thinktanks, like Oxfam, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth International, the World Resources Institute, UN bodies and academics around the world. For these northern organisations now moving strongly into developing countries, Francis’s moral arguments add weight to the scientific and economic case they have long made to try to persuade politicians and business to act on climate change, pollution and waste. Pointed criticisms of the finance sector, and the “false gods” of consumerism and profit, chime just as well in Berlin and London as in Quito and Manila. Equally, the encyclical will ensure the powerful business and fossil-fuel lobbies pressing for a weak climate agreement in Paris in November are made to squirm.

2015-06-19T06:00:07Z,global-development,Global development,Iraq policy of sending students abroad begins to bear fruit at home,"Sitting in his secluded office tucked behind rows of blast walls in Baghdad’s Green Zone, Zuhair Humadi is busy plotting alternative means of defeating Islamic State. “The situation is obviously very difficult right now. People are divided,” said Humadi, the former secretary general of Iraq’s council of ministers, as he walked the corridors of a building previously used to imprison opponents of Saddam Hussein. “What we really need is to get back to the tradition of excellence, and of getting our best and brightest to boost the country.”
It is to this end that his organisation, the Higher Committee for Education Development (HCED), has been playing a leading role in trying to restaff Iraq’s ailing educational establishments and rebuild the country’s rotten public sector. Since 2009, the HCED has dispatched more than 4,000 young Iraqis abroad to study for master’s degrees and doctorates at universities in the US, UK, and Australia. With funding secured for several thousand more, Humadi believes they are well on their way to creating a new cadre of academics and civil servants. “Already, the students [who have returned] are boosting the ministries. They need quality people, and we are giving them quality people,” said Humadi. Certainly, many of his students are excelling at foreign universities. Forty-two Iraqi scholars were recently recognised at a London event for publishing work in UK science journals, while others have been offered tenure after finishing their degrees. More important, all but 10 of the 300 students who have graduated so far have returned home to work (as their scholarship demands), confounding the programme’s sponsors, who had feared a bigger brain drain. However, questions remain as to whether the HCED, with a budget of $125m (£79m) for 2015 alone, ought to be an immediate priority at a time of war, collapsing public services, and a budget squeeze inflicted by the reduced price of oil, which accounts for about 97% of the government’s revenues. The healthcare system is in such serious disarray that the World Health Organisation recently warned that 84% of medical projects catering for the roughly 3 million people displaced by Isis will be forced to close if they don’t receive additional funds by the end of June. A 2013 analysis of Iraq’s budget by the UN’s Joint Analysis Policy Unit found that the government was investing roughly twice as much – about 13 trillion Iraqi dinars – in its energy sector as it was on health, education, environment, culture, youth, water, and sanitation put together. But with memories still fresh of the successful scholarship programmes of the 1960s and 70s, which supposedly kept Iraq well-staffed with competent bureaucrats during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, Humadi is adamant his country has little chance of emerging from its current crisis if it does not train another generation of professionals. “This [money] is easy to justify because education is the key to development and progress. We have many thousands of people with Iraqi degrees, but Iraqi education had been going downhill for decades. This is just the first step to reviving it,” he said.
Analysts maintain that diverting funds from the scholarship programme to overwhelmed services would lead to little tangible improvement in other sectors. “The healthcare system is certainly underfunded, but even if you gave it more money, I’m not sure you’d see an improvement in results. It’s just badly structured,” said Sajad Jiyad, a senior researcher at Baghdad’s Al-Bayan Center for Studies and Planning. He notes that fuel subsidies, which cost the government up to $10bn a year, might make a more appropriate target. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that the HCED, which answers directly to the prime minister, has avoided most of the problems that have haunted other government higher education schemes. Many students say they were attracted by the transparency and efficiency of the scheme, as well as the apparent lack of the alleged sectarianism that has tainted the higher education ministry’s rival scheme. “I wasn’t tempted by the ministry,” said Zeyad Yousif Al-Shibaany, who last year received a second HCED scholarship to complete a PhD in mechanical and systems engineering at Newcastle University in the UK. “The selection criteria are not clear, the application takes about a year, and it seems to depend not on your marks, but on how long you’ve been at that university.” Nevertheless, some elements of the programme remain to be ironed out. Only 25% of applicants and successful scholars are women (a disparity possibly made worse by some fathers or husbands refusing their daughters and wives permission to study abroad), while applications from some poorer, rural governorates continue to flag, perhaps because they are unable to win over officials to guarantee their financial grants in the event they fail to return to Iraq. But the addition of a rule that requires scholars to have lived in Iraq for at least two years prior to applying, thereby excluding the jet-setting children of the elite, suggests that HCED is on the right track to success in a system where favouritism and corruption are usually pervasive. Humadi, for one, insists he is not at all surprised that his programme is emerging as one of the few positives in Iraq amid the current crisis. “Iraqis, rich and poor, believe that education is everything,” he said. “They’ll sacrifice everything for it. This is entrenched in this country’s society.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/19/iraq-sending-students-abroad-higher-committee-for-education-development,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/19/iraq-sending-students-abroad-higher-committee-for-education-development
2015-06-18T10:00:04Z,global-development,Global development,Colombia's pipes to nowhere: villagers die of thirst as corruption stalls dam project,"A surprise five-minute rain shower falls like a taunt over the scorched riverbed of the Ranchería river: fat raindrops spatter in the dust but evaporate almost immediately. Nearby, a young girl and boy scoop out a bowlful of cloudy groundwater from a makeshift well to wash a few scraps of clothes.
The Ranchería river has run dry after three years of intense drought, decades of overuse and a lifetime of public corruption in the province of La Guajira, one of Colombia’s poorest and most forgotten regions. Crops have long ago shrivelled, babies are dying of malnutrition and livestock are wasting away from thirst. It was for times like this that the El Cercado dam was built on the river, to mitigate the effects of cyclical droughts in the region, home to the Wayuu Indians. At the entrance to the El Cercado dam, a huge billboard pronounces “From here will flow the water that will be the future to the Guajira.” The original project foresaw the dam supplying water to the aqueducts of nine municipalities as well as providing irrigation for agriculture. But the massive pipes that should have made this possible lead nowhere. “They never connected it to anything,” said Octavio Calderón of the provincial potable water office. The reservoir currently stands at 40% of its capacity and local authorities are controlling the flow of the river past the dam to ensure the supply. But the flow hardly makes it past the rice fields, cattle ranches and the world’s largest open-pit coalmine that tap into the river below the dam. By the time it reaches the middle Guajira, where the population is mostly Wayuu, the Ranchería is barely even a trickle.
“There is a lot of demand on the river and very little control over how it’s used,” said Calderón. Javier Rojas, leader of an indigenous association called Wayuu Shipia, puts it more bluntly: “The Wayuu are dying of thirst and hunger because of the dam,” he said. According to official figures, 26 children died of malnutrition in La Guajira in 2013, 48 in 2014 and 11 in the first six months of 2015. But Rojas says the actual numbers are far higher. He says he has verified the death of at least 25 children since February, and calculates that at least 400 children have died in the past three years. “I get weekly reports of the death of at least three children,” he said. The latest such report came from a village known as Hirtú. On 6 June, a two-month-old child, Chepe Uriana, died after receiving treatment for malnutrition at hospital and being sent home with his mother to their village just seven kilometres from the town of Manaure. “A significant number of boys and girls, mostly Wayuu, have died in La Guajira from perfectly preventable causes,” the country’s human rights ombudsman’s office said in a 2014 report.
Thousands more are barely surviving. In the village of Nuevo Ambiente, a young girl dribbles a cup of water over the head of her brother, who sits in a plastic tub under the shade of a open-walled thatch-roof hut. David is three years old, but has not yet learned to walk or talk. Stunted by severe malnutrition, he weighs just 6.7kg and wears diapers normally worn by a five-month-old infant. It means he’s improving, according to his grandmother, Alcira Epieyú. Until a few months ago, he was wearing diapers for a newborn. Rosa is another survivor. For the past two weeks, she and her mother Aines have been at the Centre for Nutritional Recovery in the Guajira capital, Riohacha, run by the child welfare agency. She looks like an infant of about six months but Aines says she’s a year and four months old, her growth stunted by a lack of food and clean water in their village in the upper Guajira. Aines says doctors have told her the water they pull from a well is not safe to drink. “But what can we do if there’s no other water?” she asks as she cradles Rosa in her arms.
Wayuu leaders have now taken their case for water to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, requesting precautionary measures aiming to force the local and national government to ensure their access to water. “We asked for the commission to order the floodgates of the dam to be opened, and that the Wayuu should be given priority in the use of the water. Any surplus can then be used for economic activities,” says lawyer Carolina Sáchica, director of the legal clinic at the Tadeo Lozano University in Bogotá, who petitioned the commission on behalf of the Wayuu. One of the largest single users of the river water is the Cerrejón coalmine, jointly owned by BHP Billiton plc, Anglo American plc and Xstrata Coal. On average, the mine uses 2,700 cubic metres per day of water, drawing both surface flow from the river and groundwaterfrom wells, said company spokesman Carlos Franco, who added that the mine is using just 16% of the river water it is authorised to use. “The problem is not our use, the problem is they have not built the pipelines for the aqueducts,” said Franco. “The money for the aqueducts in La Guajira has been stolen over and over again.”
Alejandro Ordóñez, the inspector general, whose office investigates accusations of corruption and mismanagement by public servants, said on a visit to Guajira last year that the real problem in the department is corruption. “The main problem of the region is not the drought but corruption because royalties have been stolen for many years and the public works needed to face natural events that are foreseeable were not done,” Ordóñez said. On 1 June President Juan Manuel Santos travelled to the region to address the water issue. He made no mention of the El Cercado dam and the aqueducts it was supposed to feed, but he promised 100 new wells for the province by 2018. The Wayuu have heard those promises before. For now Lilia Uriana relies on dreams to find water. From atop the windswept hill where she and her family live in a collection of mud huts and thatched-roof stalls, she can see two jagueyes – traditional reservoirs dug by Wayuu communities to catch rainwater, when it comes. But the earth of the jagueyes surrounding her village of Taluorumana is cracked dry. It was her mother who dreamed last year of a certain spot where, if she left a necklace for the spirits, they would provide water. A 10-metre-deep well at the site has been serving as the family’s source for water ever since. The water at the bottom is brackish and slightly oily. “But it’s what we have,” said Uriana.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/18/colombia-water-drought-rancheria-corruption,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/18/colombia-water-drought-rancheria-corruption
2015-06-18T07:30:00Z,global-development,Global development,Kenya's net gains on malaria prevention threatened by climate change | Murithi Mutiga,"Cradling her week-old son at a neonatal clinic in Nairobi’s sprawling Eastlands estate, where a steady throb from the stereos of battered public minibuses echoes through the streets, new mother Mary Onyango is a picture of concentration. She watches the nurse carefully explain how to use a mosquito net properly, and listens intently when the importance of covering sleeping children is explained. Over the past decade and a half, the level of infant mortality in Kenya has dropped at one of the fastest rates recorded anywhere in the world. The fall has attracted the attention of development scholars and researchers, andinspired gushing headlines in publications such as the Economist, which called the decline in child mortality rates in Africa “the best story in development”. In Kenya, child mortality fell by about 8% annually from 2005 on, with infant mortality declining from 52 deaths for every 1,000 live births in 2008/9 to 39 in 1,000 in 2014. The under-five mortality rate fell from 74 deaths for every 1,000 live births in 2008/9 to 52 deaths for every 1,000 live births in 2014. A World Bank study attributes the continued decline in infant mortality partly to an aggressive mosquito net distribution programme, which resulted in an increase in the use of treated bednets from 8% of all households in 2003 to 60% in 2008. Dr Francis Kimani, head of the malaria unit at the Kenya Medical Research Institute, says that while progress has been made the scale of the burden means the disease remains a long-term problem. “We can celebrate the fact that we have reversed the upward trend in malaria incidences but in terms of absolute numbers the burden is still high. The key challenge is in sustaining the downward trend and improving control measures such as expanding net use, taking care of pregnant mothers and doing away with anaemia in children which can help steer us eventually towards a future without malaria.” About three-quarters of Kenyans live in areas where they are exposed to malaria risk. The disease accounts for 30–50% of all outpatient attendance and a fifth of all admissions to health facilities. The economic toll of the disease is considerable, with researchers estimating 170 million working days are lost because of malaria each year. The UN’s millennium development goals set a 2015 deadline for reducing the global malaria burden by 75%, and reversing the global spread of the disease. But in Kenya and elsewhere in Africa, as well as good news, there is a worrying new challenge: climate change. Rising temperatures have opened the door to the spread of mosquitoes to areas in which they were barely a threat two decades ago. Mosquitoes are notoriously adaptable creatures, constantly developing resistance to insecticides, while the malaria parasite evolves to resist drugs.
Dr Andrew Githeko, one of the leading malaria researchers in Kenya, says the spread of mosquitoes to the traditionally cooler highlands, where previously there were low levels of malaria, was a major problem. “We started noticing this phenomenon in the late 80s and early 90s, with hikes of unusually warm and wet weather in many parts of the country consistent with global warming. The phenomenon peaked with the El Nino rains seen in the early 1990s, and then we witnessed sudden epidemics of highland malaria, which is a particularly severe form considering that the people in those areas will not have developed natural immunity.” Githeko says Africa needs to take steps to deal with this fresh challenge and continue to roll back malaria. Such measures include improving house construction methods by, for example, using screens to stop mosquitoes and building a good distance from marshlands. These techniques have been successfully deployed in countries ranging from Italy to the US. Enhanced research to tackle resistance to insecticides and treatment is also key, he says, although he points out trends are broadly positive. “We can’t be disheartened. When I started research work in 1986, I was astonished to find eight in 10 children had malaria and were consequently anaemic. We used to lose a lot of mothers. The real effort started in 2000 with the distribution of bednets, and things are completely different now. You can just see the children are so much happier and buoyant in the schools now than used to be the case in the past.” Another challenge for Kenya is the lack of general knowledge about how to tackle malaria and over-dependence on donors for health sector funding. Spreading information to young mothers like Onyango remains key to reducing transmission levels, because they are at the frontline in tackling the deadly parasite. “We can spend too much time distributing nets but we need to ensure they are actually used at rates of 80% and above,” says Dr Waqo Ejersa, head of the malaria control unit at Kenya’s ministry of health. “Investing in behavioural change communication, including interpersonal communication is really important because prevention is essential.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/18/kenya-bednets-malaria-prevention-climate-change,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/18/kenya-bednets-malaria-prevention-climate-change
2015-06-18T07:00:10Z,global-development,Global development,Millennium development goal 6: 15 achievements on HIV and malaria,"1) Between 2000 and 2012, deaths from malaria fell by 42%. Health workers attribute much of this progress to the expansion of malaria interventions, including diagnostics and treatment at the community level and greater use of insecticide-treated bednets and indoor residual sprays. 2) The UN estimates 3.3m deaths from malaria were averted between 2000 and 2010. About 90% of these were children under the age of five in sub-Saharan Africa. 3) Uptake on insecticide-treated nets has been high in some countries. In Benin, Madagascar, Rwanda and Tanzania, more than 70% of children under five slept under nets in 2012. But this practice is not as widespread in other countries, including in Chad, Cameroon and Nigeria where about 20% of children under five slept under nets. 4) Greater access to tuberculosis treatment saved approximately 22m lives between 1995 and 2012. 5) TB treatment success rates have risen, and remain above 85%. Despite progress, multi-drug resistant TB continues to pose serious problems, and the number of TB cases that are resistant to virtually almost all drugs available is increasing. 6) South Asian countries are on track to eliminate the neglected tropical disease visceral leishmaniasis, also known as kala azar, by 2020. The disease is the second largest parasitic killer globally after malaria. 7) More than 5bn treatments have been administered for the parasitic infection lymphatic filariasis since 2000. Of the 73 countries where the disease is known to be endemic, 39 are on track to eliminate it as a public health problem by 2020. 8) In 2013, the lowest number of human African trypanosomiasis cases were recorded in 50 years. The disease, also known as sleeping sickness, is transmitted from tsetse flies and can have cause seizures, coma and premature death. 9) The number of new HIV infections among every 100 people aged between 15 and 49 fell by 44% between 2001 and 2012. 10) By the end of 2013, approximately 12.9 million people were receiving antiretroviral therapy globally. Of these, 11.7 million lived in low- and middle-income countries. If current trends continue, the World Health Organisation says the target of placing 15 million people on antiretroviral therapy by 2015 will be reached or exceeded. 11) The number of new HIV infections in southern and central Africa fell by 48% and 54% respectively between 2001 and 2012. Despite this, an estimated 2.3 million people were newly infected. 12) Efforts to reduce the impact of HIV and Aids on children and their families continue. HIV is no longer considered a barrier to education for children who have lost parents to the virus. There is near parity in school attendance rates of orphans and non-orphans aged 10 to 14 years. 13) By the end of 2012, more than 900,000 pregnant women living with HIV globally were receiving antiretroviral treatment. Coverage of antiretroviral programmes for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission increased from 57% in 2011 to 62% in 2012. 14) In India, more than 15 million people with TB were diagnosed and treated between 1998 and 2012, saving an estimated 2.6 million lives. 15) Data indicates the stigma around HIV and Aids is slowly subsiding. In Congo-Brazzaville, 77% of pregnant women receiving prenatal care took voluntary HIV tests in 2011, compared with just 16% in 2003.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/18/millennium-development-goal-6-15-achievements-on-hiv-and-malaria,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/18/millennium-development-goal-6-15-achievements-on-hiv-and-malaria
2015-06-18T06:30:10Z,global-development,Global development,What is the millennium development goal on HIV and malaria all about?,"What is MDG 6 all about? When the millennium development goals (MDGs) were devised, Aids, malaria and tuberculosis killed approximately 6 million people each year. World leaders felt it was imperative to have a goal dedicated to tackling this deadly trio. MDG 6 has two targets on HIV and Aids – the first to halt and begin to reverse the spread of the HIV virus by 2015, and the second to achieve universal access to treatment for all those who need it by 2010. Progress on these targets is measured by a range of factors, including HIV rates among young people aged 15 to 24, rates of condom use, knowledge of HIV and Aids among young people, and the number of people with advanced HIV infection who have access to antiretroviral drugs. A third target aims to halt and reverse the spread of malaria and other major diseases. This is measured by malaria incidence and related deaths, the proportion of children under five sleeping under insecticide-treated nets, and the proportion of children under five with fever who are treated with anti-malarial drugs. The only other major disease mentioned is TB, the spread of which also needs halting and reversing by 2015 under MDG 6 indicators. Why is TB the only other disease mentioned? Some health advocates have argued that by focusing on the big three killers – Aids, malaria and TB – MDG 6 has neglected other diseases, leaving them without the funding required to combat them. Plans to address the burden of other diseases have been rolled out by countries individually. The World Health Organisation has focused on 17 neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) endemic in 149 countries and affecting more than 1.4 billion people. They include dengue fever, rabies, trachoma, leishmaniasis and soil-transmitted helminthiases. These diseases are prevalent in both low-income countries and wealthy regions. Dr Peter Hotez, an NTD specialist, estimates that about 12 million Americans have one or more tropical disease. Meanwhile, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which include diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancers, kill approximately 38 million people each year, with almost three-quarters of deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Despite posing a significant risk to the health and development of poorer countries, NCDs received little attention and health advocates say attracting funding has been challenging. Will the goal be met? UN data indicates that the world is on track to meet its target of halting and reversing the spread of malaria and TB, but will fail to meet all targets on HIV and Aids. Progress on malaria has been significant, but the disease remains a major killer in low-income countries. Global malaria mortality rates fell by 47% since 2000, from 985,000 malaria-related deaths in 2000 to 584,000 deaths in 2013. There was a 54% reduction in Africa. This progress has been attributed to the scaling up of malaria prevention and control methods such as greater access to diagnostic testing and treatment, increased use of insecticidal bed nets and higher rates of indoor residual spraying. The world has achieved its target to halt and reverse the spread of TB, with the prevalence of the disease falling by an estimated 41% between 1990 and 2013. Globally, the TB death rate fell by an estimated 45% in the same period. TB treatment success rates have risen and remain above 85%. Despite this progress, multi-drug resistant TB remains an obstacle. The number of new HIV infections has decreased, but not fast enough, declining by 44% among every 100 adults between 2001 and 2012. Despite this progress, there were an estimated 2.3 million cases of people newly infected with HIV and Aids, and 1.6 million Aids-related deaths. By the end of 2013, approximately 12.9 million people were receiving antiretroviral therapy globally. Of these, 11.7 million lived in low- and middle-income countries, accounting for 36% of people living with HIV in these countries. The WHO says that if current trends continue, the target of placing 15 million people on antiretroviral therapy by 2015 will be reached. Of particular concern, however, is an increase in risky sexual behaviour and insufficient knowledge about HIV among young people. The UN’s 2014 progress report found that in sub-Saharan Africa, only 39% of men and 28% of women aged between 15 and 24 had knowledge of HIV. It also found that condom use among young people who had higher-risk sex was 57% for men and 37% for women, far below the 95% target. How does MDG 6 fit into the new development goals? The sustainable development goals, set to replace the MDGs, feature a far more comprehensive list of global health targets than their predecessors. The new health goal aims to “ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages”, and encompasses 13 targets on issues such as child and maternal health, disease prevention, tobacco control, alcohol abuse, sexual and reproductive health and global health epidemics. The new goal also aims to address concerns that the MDGs sidelined NTDs and NCDs, with both groups of diseases mentioned explicitly. The targets include ending the epidemics of Aids, TB and NTDs by 2030, and reducing by one-third premature mortality from NCDs. Mental health, also absent from most MDG discussions, has been included in the SDGs. The health goal contains a target to promote mental health and wellbeing.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/18/millennium-development-goal-six-hiv-and-malaria-explainer,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/18/millennium-development-goal-six-hiv-and-malaria-explainer
2015-06-18T06:00:10Z,global-development,Global development,Mothers of wisdom: Ethiopian women ensure their babies are born HIV free | Carla Kweifio-Okai,"Abeba sits in the consultation room at Modjo health clinic in central Ethiopia, her seven-month-old daughter, Aster, cooing playfully on her lap. Abeba is HIV-positive, and has travelled 20 minutes by bus to collect the antiretroviral treatment she needs. She is part of a programme at the clinic to prevent mother-to-child transmission, which involves a regimen of medications for mothers and babies during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Tests so far indicate that Aster has not contracted HIV, much to her mother’s relief. “Now I know my daughter doesn’t have it while I have it, I’m very happy,” says Abeba, who does not want her real name used. “It changes everything for me.” Despite global efforts to achieve an AIDS-free generation, in Ethiopia only 24% of pregnant women who are eligible for HIV services receive them. One out of three children born to an HIV-positive mother is infected with the virus. Abeba has three other children at home, all sons, who are also HIV-negative. She says she feels blessed that her second youngest son did not contract the virus, since she did not receive treatment while pregnant with him. “I found out I had this four years ago, but I think my son, who is five years old, was born when I was positive but without me knowing,” she says.
The eldest of Abeba’s sons is 12, and she says she will wait until he is 18 to tell him she has HIV. “I do not mind talking about it, but I want to protect my children. In the village they talk about it like it’s something very severe and something very bad to have,” she says. “But even though I don’t tell people I have it, I do tell them that we are all human beings and there’s nothing to be afraid of.” Next to the consultation room where Abeba makes her fortnightly visits, Sisay Dinku offers counselling to HIV-positive women. The 33-year-old learned she had HIV 10 years ago, and has worked at health clinics for the past nine. She says things have changed for people living with HIV in Ethiopia. “There have been a lot of improvements. When I first knew I was HIV positive, we used to go to the hospitals far away because the services weren’t given at the community centres like they are now,” Sisay says. She also notes the reduction in waiting times for people receiving their CD4 count results, which indicate how well their immune system is able to fight HIV and other infections. A person’s CD4 count determines when they should commence HIV treatment. “When I used to get tested I would have to wait one or two weeks for the test to be sent away. Sometimes you didn’t get results at all, because they would get mixed on the way there,” Sisay says. A new device providing same-day CD4 test results has helped cut waiting times for patients at the clinic. The Pima machines analyse blood samples and print reports for nurses in 20 minutes, meaning patients do not have to return to the clinic to get their results. If the results indicate HIV treatment should commence, patients can do so straight away, making it easier to begin and remain on treatment. The machines were initially funded and rolled out by global health organisation Unitaid, and the Ethiopian government has since opted to expand the programme. Sisay says improvements in HIV diagnostics have made a significant difference, particularly for monitoring pregnant women. “Let me give you an example,” she says. “When I found out I was HIV positive, there were eight other people that day who found out too, but I’m the only one that’s alive and survived. The rest of them died because they didn’t have the support and they couldn’t wait for weeks for blood samples and have to travel back to the clinic again. They got tense, they got worried, and sometimes they quit from the overall treatment. That’s the result of waiting. And I’m lucky I didn’t quit because I have a six-year-old child.” For both Sisay and Abeba, having healthy children has been a precious gift. When asked about the future she envisions for her daughter, Abeba says with a smile: “It is God’s will what she becomes when she’s older, but if you ask me, I prefer that she becomes a doctor – we are alive because of the doctors treating us.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/18/ethiopia-hiv-mother-child-transmission-antiretroviral-treatment,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/18/ethiopia-hiv-mother-child-transmission-antiretroviral-treatment

The annual global trends study by the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, finds that the level of worldwide displacement is higher than ever before, with a record 59.5 million people living exiled from their homes at the end of 2014. UNHCR estimates that an average of 42,500 men, women and children became refugees, asylum seekers or internally displaced people every day last year - a four-fold increase in just four years. By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees – more than half of them children – 38.2 million internally displaced people and 1.8 million asylum-seekers. Were the 59.5 million to be counted as the population of a single country, it would be the 24th largest in the world and one with about the same number of people as Italy.
The numbers are up 16% on 2013 – when the total stood at 51.2 million – and up 59% on a decade ago, when 37.5 million people were forced to flee their homes. UNHCR says the four-year war in Syria is the single largest driver of displacement: by the end of 2014, the conflict had forced 3.88 million Syrians to live as refugees in the Middle East and beyond, and left 7.6 million more internally displaced. In blunter terms, one in every five displaced persons worldwide last year was Syrian. The UN high commissioner for refugees, António Guterres, said that although the world was experiencing “an unchecked slide” into an era of massive forced global displacement, it seemed unwilling to tackle the causes. “It is terrifying that on the one hand there is more and more impunity for those starting conflicts, and on the other there is [a] seeming utter inability of the international community to work together to stop wars and build and preserve peace,” he said. The report also notes that the wealthy countries are relying overwhelmingly on poorer states to take in those who have been forced to abandon their homelands: in 2014, 86% of refugees were in regions or countries deemed economically less developed. Twenty years ago, developing regions hosted about 70% of the world’s refugees; last year, countries ranked least developed by the UN were home to 3.6 million refugees – or 25% of the global total. Guterres called on the international community to show resolve, tolerance and a proper financial commitment to helping those most in need. “With huge shortages of funding and wide gaps in the global regime for protecting victims of war, people in need of compassion, aid and refuge are being abandoned,” he said. “For an age of unprecedented mass displacement, we need an unprecedented humanitarian response and a renewed global commitment to tolerance and protection for people fleeing conflict and persecution.” Guterres’ warning comes a year after the UNHCR reported that the number of people forced to flee their homes across the world had exceeded 50 million for the first time since the second world war. At the end of 2014, 53% of all refugees under UNHCR’s responsibility came from just three countries: Syria (3.88 million), Afghanistan (2.59 million), and Somalia (1.11 million). A further 5.1 million refugees were registered by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.
In Iraq, the march of Islamic State saw the number of internally displaced people jump from 1 million to in 2013 to 3.6 million by the end of last year. In Libya, 309,000 people were newly displaced in 2014. Over the past five years, at least 15 conflicts have broken out or reignited: eight in Africa (Ivory Coast, Central African Republic, Libya, Mali, northeastern Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and Burundi); three in the Middle East (Syria, Iraq, and Yemen); one in Europe (Ukraine) and three in Asia (Kyrgyzstan, and in several areas of Burma and Pakistan). With few of those conflicts resolved and most still forcing people to flee, just 126,800 refugees were able to return to their home countries last year – the lowest number in 31 years. In Europe, the number of forcibly displaced people increased by 51% last year, rising from 4.4 million to 7.6 million. “More than 219,000 refugees and migrants crossed the Mediterranean sea during 2014,” says the report. “That’s almost three times the previously known high of about 70,000, which took place in 2011 during the ‘Arab spring’. Nearly half of these arrivals were coming from the Syrian Arab republic and Eritrea. UNHCR has received information of over 3,500 women, men, and children reported dead or missing in the Mediterranean sea during the year, clearly demonstrating how dangerous and unpredictable this situation has become.” UNHCR noted that the record number of Mediterranean crossings and the huge number of Syrians hosted by Turkey had “brought increased public attention, both positive and negative, to questions to do with refugees”, adding that Germany and Sweden had received the largest volume of asylum applications. Displacement was up 19% in the Middle East and north Africa; up 17% in sub-Saharan Africa; up 31% in Asia, and up 12% in the Americas.
Last year saw Turkey overtake Pakistan to became the largest refugee-hosting country worldwide, with 1.59 million refugees, the overwhelming majority of them Syrian. Pakistan hosted the second-largest number of refugees – 1.51 million, almost all of them from Afghanistan – while Lebanon took in the most refugees in relation to its population, with 232 refugees per 1,000 inhabitants. Iran hosted 950,000 Afghan refugees, Ethiopia 659,500 refugees from South Sudan, Eritrea and Somalia, while Jordan hosted 654,100 refugees from Syria and Iraq. Justine Greening, the international development secretary, said: “It is shocking that nearly 60 million people are now without a home and dependent on the kindness of strangers. One in seven of those men, women and children have been forced to flee because of conflict or persecution in the last year alone. “From Syria to South Sudan, the UK is getting emergency help to people who have lost everything. I have met some of these people and they tell me they just want the chance to return to their homes and get back to normal. “That is why, as we give these families the basics they need to survive – food, clean water and shelter – we must also tackle the root causes of poverty and instability, in particular economic development.” • This article was amended on 18 June 2015. An earlier version suggested that refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and Somalia made up more than half of all refugees worldwide.

2015-06-17T23:01:01Z,global-development,Global development,"Global humanitarian aid hits record high but needs remain unmet, finds study","Global humanitarian assistance rose to record levels in 2014, reflecting the scale and scope of prolonged crises such as the conflicts in Iraq and Syria as well as increased contributions from Middle Eastern donors, according to a study by the non-profit organisation Development Initiatives. A report by the body’s Global Humanitarian Assistance (GHA) programme showed that humanitarian assistance rose to $24.5bn (£15.5bn) last year, an increase of 19% on 2013. Middle Eastern donors contributed nearly $1.7bn, a 120% increase on the previous year. Needs continued to outstrip contributions, however. In its coordinated appeals, the UN fell $7.5bn short of the record $19.5bn it requested to help 87.5 million people. This meant 38% of requirements were not met, even though the world’s leading donors all gave more.
“In a year of global discussions on development and climate change, these unprecedented levels of need and continued shortfalls in funding highlight the need to sustainably address the underlying causes and long-term impacts of crisis,” said Sophia Swithern, head of the GHA programme. Next month, the UN will hold its third international conference on financing for development in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. Member states are expected to draw up concrete plans to finance the sustainable development goals, an ambitious agenda covering the next 15 years that is due to be ratified in New York this September. “We see from the figures in the report that 93% of the world’s extreme poor are in countries that are politically fragile or environmentally vulnerable,” said Swithern. “Unless something comes out of Addis and around the SDGs that looks at the poverty questions around those crisis-related areas, you are not going to end poverty and you are not going to solve crises.” Last year, 10.7 million more people worldwide were affected by natural disasters compared with 2013, while conflict and persecution created a record number of displaced people. The report noted that the Ebola crisis received significant support that was not categorised as humanitarian assistance, so the total amount for the year might be higher than the headline figure. The rise in overall humanitarian funding reflected the fact that there were now more people displaced in the Middle East than in Africa.
The Syria crisis drew the largest appeals; along with the ongoing conflict in Iraq and the situation in South Sudan, it became a significant driver in last year’s $4bn rise in humanitarian funding. “The domestic contributions of countries hosting Syrian and Iraqi refugees, most notably Turkey, also continue to be vital,” the report said. In 2013, Turkey spent $1.6bn helping Syrian refugees. Saudi Arabia joined the list of the top 10 donors after it increased its humanitarian funding by $518m, to $755m. This was the second highest volume increase of all donors, amounting to a trebling of the country’s 2013 commitment. The United Arab Emirates became one of the 20 largest contributors after raising its contribution by 317%, from $90m in 2013 to $375m in 2014.
“[Middle Eastern donors] have been key players for a long time, but with the rise of conflict in the region … we are seeing these donors rising in prominence,” Swithern said. She added that this was partly down to more standardised reporting by these donors, with whom the world should engage to ensure the quality and quantity of the funding stream. Contributions from private donors rose by an estimated 8%, and accounted for a quarter of international humanitarian assistance. As a group, private donors were the largest international contributor to the typhoon Haiyan response in 2013, and the third largest supporters of the Ebola response last year. The report noted that two-thirds of international humanitarian assistance still went to long-term recipients such as Somalia and Pakistan. Despite widespread acknowledgement of the importance of local NGOs in delivering relief, initial data from 2014 found that their direct share of total humanitarian funding had halved, from 0.4% in 2012 to 0.2% in 2014. However, data gaps meant it was very hard to trace money all the way from donors to recipients, making it difficult to measure funding to local and national NGOs. “There is a real groundswell at the moment talking about localising the response in recognition of the role of local and national actors as the first and, in many cases, the best responders,” Swithern said. She added that more analysis was required to determine how to improve these organisations’ access to direct funds. New sources of funding were needed from more diverse donors as well as more efficient methods of delivering the money to those in need, the report said. These issues will be discussed at the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul next year, and Swithern said private funding would be a particular focus. “This resource that we call international humanitarian assistance is just one piece of the picture,” she said. “What we need is a comprehensive solution that involves different mixes of resources for different contexts.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/18/global-humanitarian-response-record-high-needs-unmet-development-initiatives,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/18/global-humanitarian-response-record-high-needs-unmet-development-initiatives
2015-06-17T14:47:02Z,global-development,Global development,"Congolese troops must be disarmed if rapes are to stop, says Denis Mukwege","The Congolese army is mired in a culture of sexual violence and should be disarmed because many of its troops are “completely sick”, according to one of the country’s leading gynaecologists. Dr Denis Mukwege said soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) should be stripped of their weapons and replaced by new recruits who have never committed sexual violence or fought for a violent militia. Rapists in the the Forces Armées de la République Démocratique (FARDC), he added, ought also to be considered “victims” because they were traumatised by involvement in one of Africa’s most brutal and longest-running wars and needed psychological help that was not available. Alluding to the town in eastern Congo where Congolese soldiers committed mass rape in 2012, Mukwege said: “In Minova and other places it is the FARDC who are the ones who were raping instead of protecting the population. The FARDC has shown that the army can destroy its population, it’s a big problem. “If we want to fight against sexual violence then we need to be courageous and say that we need to create an army where people have never been in a militia before or have never been involved in rape or destruction.” Mukwege, 59, who was last year awarded the EU’s highest human rights award, the Sakharov Prize, for saving the lives of thousands of rape victims, also questioned the wisdom of the international community ploughing large sums of money into a military that routinely perpetrates sexual violence.
Mukwege said: “The UK and other countries are spending a lot of money to try and build an army from people who are completely sick and destroyed. They will never succeed.” According to UN estimates, more than a third of the rapes that occur in the eastern part of the country are committed by the army. Mukwege’s comments follow the revelation that, despite spending £5.2m on hosting a high-profile summit on ending sexual violence in conflict, the UK government has committed less than a fifth of that amount to tackling rape in warzones in 2015. A UK parliamentary inquiry will this week begin scrutinising Hague’s initiative and also details of an Observer investigation that found rapists in the army are still operating with impunity within eastern DRC, where Mukwege’s Panzi hospital has helped treat more than 30,000 survivors of sexual violence perpetrated by the military and militias. Mukwege said: “We should be more courageous. Why can’t we start sending the FARDC to do social work like fixing roads, protecting houses or producing food? They can keep their uniforms but not their guns, that way they can be useful for society.” Mukwege added that many military recruits had already fought for violent militia and committed rape, meaning that sexual violence was woven into the mindset of the country’s military. “Many of the perpetrators are themselves victims because many of them were children when they joined the army and there is no psychological support to help them,” said Mukwege. “We are trying to build something with people who are mentally unsafe … studies show that most have post-traumatic stress disorder. How can you give them guns?”
On Sunday an investigation found that the biggest rape tribunal in the country’s history was allegedly fixed by the government and military prosecutors, while rape prosecutions in eastern DRC have fallen and incidents of sexual violence increased despite political pledges at the London summit to act on sexual violence in conflict. The findings raise questions about the UK government’s commitment to the issue, with data from freedom of information requests revealing that last year just one trip was made to the Congo by a member of the UK team dedicated to sexual violence. Funding to the DRC from the Department for International Development (DfID) is £149m this year, a portion of which is dedicated to helping the country’s army “increase their ability to fight against impunity”. Other initiatives aimed at defence reform in the country. In addition, the Ministry of Defence says that a handful of officers are based in the east of the country, “working with the UN and Congolese government”. Despite such efforts, Congoloese troops continue to be implicated in ongoing sexual violence. Rebecca Masika Katsuva, who runs a women’s refuge in Minova, calculates that of the 800 rape victims her centre has helped since the start of 2014, 600 were attacked by the army. Emmanuel Baboo, of the Heal Africa hospital in Goma, which treats up to 10,000 victims of sexual violence a year, describes cases where soldiers from the 10th military region in eastern Congo deliberately rape children to “corrupt” them early.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/17/drc-troops-disarmed-rape-dr-denis-mukwege,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/17/drc-troops-disarmed-rape-dr-denis-mukwege
2015-06-17T13:25:31Z,global-development,Global development,Afghan men urged to support HeForShe campaign at Kabul launch,"In Kabul on Tuesday a group of Afghan men took the very rare step of calling on their male compatriots to take a stand for women’s rights. They made their appeal at the Afghanistan launch of HeForShe, a UN campaign for gender equality known worldwide thanks partly to the actor Emma Watson. “A Brave Man Stands for Women” was the slogan emblazoned on a banner in the hall of a Kabul high school where activists and foreign dignitaries of both genders gathered for the occasion. . The organisers are aiming to enlist manliness and valour in pursuit of the cause, perhaps recognising that gender equality is a hard sell in a male-dominated society shaped by decades of war. “This male bravery that has been created, we should use that to defend women’s rights,” one motivational speaker, Zia Mobalegh, said from the stage. “Men of Afghanistan should be courageous enough to create gender equality.” The campaign signals a change in approach from international donors. Since 2001, gender equality has been a pillar of western aid in Afghanistan, but it almost exclusively targeted women. “A lot of the problems that women face in this country arise from how we men look at society,” Barry Salaam, a prominent activist, said. He was made aware of Afghanistan’s gender gap at the age of 12 when his sister was discriminated against at school. “Looking at her, I always felt guilty,” he said. “Unless we men change ourselves and the way we view women, we won’t be able to bring fundamental changes.” The UN plans to roll out the campaign in five other provinces as well as Kabul: Balkh, Herat, Bamiyan, Nangarhar and Kandahar. But the farther away from the conference halls of the capital, the stauncher the opposition to disruption of the social order. “These things are really sensitive for men here,” said Ramin Anwari, an activist and former journalist. He said many men fear that emancipation of women will cost them their own privileges. “Women’s rights have been framed as absolute freedom for women, which Afghanistan is not ready for. There is a big need to reframe the struggle so it’s not offensive to the men that have dominated society throughout history.”
Ameer Mohammad Dareenori, a tribal elder from Nangarhar, was not worried about losing privileges, and fully supported gender equality in the legal system and the workplace, he said, chastising the few attending parliamentarians for leaving the launch early. “That’s a disgrace,” he said. Dareenori, however, stressed that equality must be contingent on the word of Islamic scriptures, including laws stipulating that a woman’s testimony is worth half of a man’s, as well as family and marital laws allowing men to take four wives, to provide for them. A woman should not have the same right, he said, as more than one husband would create confusion about who was the father of her children. If equality has eluded Afghan women during the past 14 years, it is not for lack of money. As late as October last year, the US launched its largest gender awareness programme, Promote. The US international development agency, USAid, has committed $216m (£137m) to the programme, while other donors are expected to contribute an extra $200m. The programme, has been criticised, however, for not consulting the Afghan women it is meant to support. Lack of consultation has been a problem, said some activists, who see promising signs that foreign donors will now give Afghan organisations more autonomy. Telling Afghans what to do “has created a lot of backlash”, said Mariam Safi, executive director of Drops, a civil society organisation. “Finally, the international community is looking into implementing local ownership,” she said. “That gives local organisations space to implement programs with relation to women’s rights.” Since taking office in September, the government of president Ashraf Ghani has taken a few strides to improve female representation in the political and legal system. His wife, Rula Ghani, has assumed a more public role than any other Afghan first lady of the past 50 years. After appointing four female ministers in April, Ghani on Sunday named the first female judge, Anisa Rassouli, to the supreme court. That is “tangible proof”, said Elzira Sagynbaeva, the representative of UN Women in Afghanistan, that “the unity government is committed to tackling the issues faced by women and girls in Afghanistan”. Asked whether western gender campaigns should have targeted men earlier, Sagynbaeva said: “It’s a very good point … The last 10 years were all about women fighting for women.” HeForShe seeks to motivate local students, elders and religious teachers to create awareness in communities. Real improvement requires deep institutional and cultural changes. Kabul is still reeling from an incident three months ago when Farkhunda, a 27-year-old-woman, was viciously beaten to death by a mob. The incident sparked the largest protests for women’s rights in recent memory, and became a symbol of discrimination of women and their lack of legal protection. To Salaam, the activist, HeForShe finally puts the onus on men in a country where women are often seen as instigators of conflict, even when they are beaten, raped or escape abuse. “That mindset has to change, and it comes from men. It’s a problem of men that should be solved by men. Women are just the victims,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/17/afghan-men-support-heforshe-campaign-kabul-launch,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/17/afghan-men-support-heforshe-campaign-kabul-launch
2015-06-17T08:00:02Z,global-development,Global development,UK expert warns of disaster if lessons are not learned from Ebola outbreak,"Failure to learn the lessons of the Ebola outbreak will have unthinkable consequences when the next global health emergency erupts, the former head of the UK’s Ebola taskforce in Sierra Leone has warned. Donal Brown, who led British efforts to tackle the disease in the west African country, said the outbreak had exposed serious technical and collaborative failings in the international community’s response mechanisms. “We got off lightly on Ebola as a global community and we couldn’t even respond properly to that,” he said. Brown declared that not only was the response late because international alert systems were not working properly, it was also hampered by “an ongoing debate” as to whether the outbreak should be treated as a health emergency or a humanitarian one. “It was both, very clearly – and we need to ensure that we’ve got systems that speak to each other so we’re not in a thing about should it be the World Health Organisation (WHO) leading this or should it be a UN humanitarian response. This is a complex health-humanitarian emergency and our systems need to be able to lead that together,” he said. Brown, a former vet who is now head of the Department for International Development’s (DfID) global funds department, said that the situation would have been immeasurably worse if the world had been dealing with a respiratory-borne infection rather than one spread, like Ebola, through bodily fluids. “I have seen the consequences in animal populations of airborne diseases and I just cannot contemplate that in a human population,” he said. “We have to learn the lessons. There is no option. It is so frightening if we don’t learn the lessons. I will keep going and ensure that whether it’s the Department for International Development in London or anywhere else, it’s something we don’t let drop.”
Brown welcomed David Cameron’s announcement of the creation of a team of “disease detectives” – epidemiologists and infection control specialists who would be ready to deploy in response to outbreaks – but said the challenges of epidemics could not be met by technology alone. “The UK and the international community can bring all the weapons – the labs and the treatment centres – but we’re foreigners,” he said. “We can support you, but we can’t change behaviours. We don’t even understand the subtleties of your culture. I think people underestimate just how difficult it is. You can’t just press a button and change behaviour. You can’t just sign a cheque and change behaviour. It’s about person-to-person engagement. It’s about verbal communication.” Brown pointed to Sierra Leone, which reported 15 cases of Ebola in the week ending 7 June, saying such flare-ups were inevitable because of secret burials – “which have been just a nightmare” – and the reliance on traditional herbalists. “It’s all about behaviour change and cultural practices,” he said. “People still go to herbalists – and you can’t blame them, because in the UK you’ll get people going to herbalists or to alternative medicine when it’s clear that it has its place but it certainly won’t cure certain things. In a quite uneducated, poor population, it’s even harder to change that behaviour.” Equally difficult, if equally understandable, said Brown, was the complacency resulting from people’s desire to reclaim their lives and routines. “That’s what this is all about, complacency from everybody – government, population and so on – because people are so fed up with Ebola they just want a normal life,” he said. “They want their school to function properly, they want to be able to go to shops and restaurants and so on. So you get the complacency and then you get people who still go on with traditional practices, which just fuel it each time.” Despite the new cases, Brown said he was reassured to note that the Western Area of Sierra Leone – which includes the capital, Freetown – had just recorded its first week without a single case of Ebola. “When I left in February, we were down to just under 50 cases a week from 500 cases a week in mid-November and we all agreed that this was going to be a long, bumpy tail,” he said. “We can’t be complacent but I wouldn’t say I’m unduly worried because it’s gone up from 10 to 15 each week. If you look at it, it’s gone up a bit and down a bit. It hasn’t gone up massively.” But Brown added there was still more to be done to make sure more cases were recorded on contact lists to minimise infection and on tackling the disease in Guinea and shoring up its border with Sierra Leone. “We know there’s a lot of movement across that border and we know it’s going to be very difficult to totally eradicate Ebola in Sierra Leone until you get on top of it in Guinea,” he said. Brown, who was awarded a CBE for services to international development in the Queen’s birthday honours list, said he hoped that humanitarian and health agencies would learn to work better together in the wake of Ebola and in the run-up to next year’s world humanitarian summit. “One of the key things we need to do is not only ensure that the lessons are learned around WHO, but it’s equally important that lessons are learned about why the humanitarian response could have been better,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/17/uk-expert-warns-of-disaster-if-lessons-are-not-learned-from-ebola-outbreak,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/17/uk-expert-warns-of-disaster-if-lessons-are-not-learned-from-ebola-outbreak
2015-06-17T04:01:08Z,global-development,Global development,"Global cost of conflict reaches $14.3tn, says report","The world’s steady shift away from peace and into conflict inflicted a $14.3tn (£9.21tn) cost on the global economy last year, as nations ramped up military spending and more people were driven from their jobs, according to the latest Global Peace Index (GPI). Fighting in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan had wreaked havoc on economies and helped push the level of peace in the world to its lowest since 2008, the index showed. Providing services for refugees and internally displaced people was one of the biggest costs of last year’s violence. In 2014, the world spent 13.4% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on costs associated with violence, equivalent to the total economic output of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and the UK, according to the GPI. More than $3tn was poured into military spending. Syria kept its spot as the world’s least peaceful country. Libya, which has seen deepening sectarian conflict since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, slipped more than any other country in the rankings over the past year, followed by Ukraine, Niger, Djibouti and South Sudan.
The index, published annually since 2008, ranks 162 countries on 23 indicators with the aim of painting a portrait of each country’s level of security, conflict engagement and militarisation. This year’s index showed that 81 countries have become more peaceful in the past year, while 78 registered deepening violence. “We use the absence of violence or fear of violence as the definition of peace,” said Steve Killelea, the founder and executive chairman of the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) thinktank, which produces the GPI. Internal and external measures of peacefulness are assessed by an expert panel against themes of militarisation, ongoing conflict and societal and safety measures. The 2015 index shows “an inequality in peace” – with the world’s most peaceful countries showing the most improvements in peacefulness, while the least peaceful countries descending into further violence, said Killelea. The biggest deteriorations in peace resulted from a rise in the number of refugees and in more deaths from internal conflicts. The number of deaths has increased from 50,000 in 2008 to 180,000 last year, Killelea said. But there were encouraging improvements in political stability, he said. Guinea-Bissau, praised in March by the EU for restoring its constitution and holding elections, showed the biggest improvement in this year’s index. Ivory Coast, Egypt, Tajikistan and Benin were among the most reformed countries. However, prolonged conflict continues to pose grave economic problems. The conflict in Syria, where a civil war has been raging for four years, was estimated to have absorbed 42% of the country’s GDP. Afghanistan spent 31% of its GDP on containing violence, while Iraq spent 30%.
Iceland came top of the 2015 index, followed by Denmark, Austria, New Zealand, Switzerland, Finland, Canada, Japan, Australia and the Czech Republic. The UK ranked 39th, eight spots better than last year. The US came in at 94th place, one spot above Saudi Arabia. Europe was the most peaceful region. Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, South Sudan and Central African Republic were the bottom five countries in the index. The Middle East and north Africa bore the highest cost of violence. But Killelea cautioned that “one has to be realistic when looking at trying to measure a complex phenomena such as peace and doing it across the globe”, admitting that gaps in data do exist. The 2015 GPI showed fewer conflicts between states and more within states. Last year, external conflicts were responsible for 74% fewer deaths than in 2008, the GPI showed. Killelea warned that the rise in violence carried out by terrorist groups is likely to worsen in the coming years. Terrorist networks have expanded their scope of operations and carried out 61% more killings last year than in 2008. He said Nigeria, which suffers the second-most terrorists attacks of any country, would bear the brunt of more terrorist violence. “We’re going to see a massive increase in the deaths resulting from Boko Haram,” he said, referring to Nigeria’s Islamist insurgency.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/16/global-cost-conflict-reaches-14tn-says-report,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/16/global-cost-conflict-reaches-14tn-says-report
2015-06-16T11:33:22Z,global-development,Global development,African leaders must take ‘concrete steps’ to end child marriage,"African leaders need to back their political ambitions to end child marriage with effective policies and the money to see them through, according to a global partnership fighting to end the practice. On the annual Day of the African Child on Tuesday, which this year focuses on child marriage, Françoise Kpeglo Moudouthe, head of Africa engagement at Girls Not Brides, said the continent’s leaders had taken big steps in making political commitments to end the practice, but needed to do more. “There’s a lot happening, but not as fast as needed. Part of the problem … there’s a lot of political commitment, which is great, but we have not yet got to the point where we’re organising ourselves to have affected a concentrated approach. It’s time to come together and build on the political momentum and address this issue,” she said. “Many African governments have taken that step politically. But let’s make that a holistic commitment, a social commitment, a policy commitment and a financial commitment.” According to the latest UN estimates, every year around 15 million girls marry before they are 18. Around 40% of girls in sub-Saharan Africa are married before their 18th birthdays, and 12% before they turn 15. As well as robbing girls, and boys, of their childhood, child marriage can also have devastating physical consequences. Young brides are more likely to give birth when their bodies are not fully developed, which can lead to injuries such as fistula.
The UN children’s agency, Unicef, says 15 of the 20 countries identified as having the highest prevalence of child marriage are in Africa. Niger tops the list, with 76% of women aged between 20 and 24 saying they were married or in a union before they were 18. Central African Republic and Chad follow, both with 68%. Some 33 African countries have set 18 as the minimum age for marriage for both girls and boys. Four – Algeria, Lesotho, Libya and Rwanda – have set the age limit higher. In Rwanda, the legal age for marriage for both sexes is 21, while Algeria has set the age limit at 19. Despite these laws, some countries continue to allow girls to marry younger if their parents consent. Last year the African Union launched a campaign to end child marriage in the 10 countries with the highest rates. The AU plans to hold a summit on ending the practice in November. But Moudouthe said the political will needs to be turned into action. “Right now we know if you want to move from commitment to concrete change, and impact on the lives of our girls, we need effective leadership, and civil society and other institutions to work together to advance as fast as needed and required.”
Moudouthe said she wanted to see built a social movement “that involves all of us”, to push for an end to child marriage. National strategies need to be developed to address the problem – such as through compulsory birth registration so there is no doubt about a girls age, and decent education so girls are made aware of their rights and have the skills to exercise them, she said. Poverty, which is often cited by parents as a reason for marrying off their daughters, will also need to be addressed by leaders. Families and community chiefs will need to be mobilised to drive change locally. But all that will require a long-term commitment, says Moudouthe, which needs to be borne in mind by governments setting new policies, and by donors committing programme funds. “Child marriage is not going to be ended overnight. Something we all need to understand is that we’re in for a long fight.” The proposed sustainable development goals, set to come into force in January, include a target to eliminate child marriage by 2030. The Day of the African Child was established in 1991 to commemorate the 1976 Soweto student uprising in South Africa, in which hundreds of young people were killed or injured.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/16/african-leaders-must-take-concrete-steps-end-child-marriage,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/16/african-leaders-must-take-concrete-steps-end-child-marriage
2015-06-16T09:58:16Z,global-development,Global development,Secret aid worker: it's one standard for local staff and another for expats,"While working as an international adviser for an NGO in an African country, I contracted malaria and it got worse as opposed to better with treatment. After one agonising night on a morphine drip in the local hospital, a call was placed to my employer’s insurance provider, and five hours later an air ambulance was on the ground to medivac me out of the country. I was whisked safely to a more developed country nearby, where world-class medical care awaited me. The whole thing cost more than $200,000; insurance paid. Some time later one of my national colleagues – the longest-serving team member – was involved in a road traffic accident on his way home from work. He lay unconscious on the roadside for 15 minutes, his leg shattered. As Ebola ravaged the country and accessing healthcare became harder than ever, he spent nine days in limbo, before being flown to the same country that I had been treated in, and another 11 days waiting there before the necessary surgery was performed. It took 20 days from accident to surgery. Twenty days through which he lay in uncertainty, fear, and excruciating pain.
During this time a number of individuals within the NGO went to enormous lengths to make the necessary happen. They planned, they negotiated, they fundraised. They called in favours, they pulled strings. Meanwhile the NGO prevaricated, debated and delayed. My former colleague’s treatment cost in the region of $40,000. He had no insurance. The NGO eventually contributed $15,000. The rest came from the pockets of current and former colleagues. Two tiers of staff These two tales provide just one example of an issue that runs across much of the aid and development sector. The NGO in question says: “We do not draw any distinction between our international and national staff when it comes to medical insurance – we make strenuous efforts to keep all of our staff safe and well regardless of where they come from. Any suggestion otherwise in this article is incorrect and misleading.” I disagree. And I want to draw attention to the inequality here: to the disparity between the treatment of locally engaged (usually national) support staff and their (usually international) professionally skilled colleagues. This article focuses on the ethical, moral and legal issues involved in determining that some staff members have their lives saved by their employer and others do not. But it is worth remembering that, in many NGOs, much of what follows applies not only to healthcare provision, but to working hours, overtime, days off, notice periods, termination requirements … the list goes on.
Why the inequality? I have heard five reasons for discrepancies in employment terms that mean international staff typically receive medical insurance as standard and national staff typically do not. We can’t afford it. We simply cannot extend a more equitable level of benefits to our national staff because it would cost too much, our funding is restricted and we have to spend our money on our core business. We don’t need to. Our policies are in line with other international organisations, we comply fully with employment legislation and our legal duty of care to contractors. And anyway, our national staff members are much better off than they would be if they didn’t work for us. It’s not an option. International evacuation insurance isn’t even available to cover national staff. There are good reasons for the way it is. It’s unfair yes, but we don’t pay all staff equally either. Doing so would create a harmful dual economy. First things first. We’re a small NGO, newly established. We do the best we can for now, while we focus on our strategic objectives. But these excuses don’t stack up. Let’s consider them one by one: Cost. Morally, this argument betrays a hierarchy of values placed on different lives. There is also a countering reputational cost to be considered. Since the job above, I have worked with international organisations that have evacuated drivers, and paid cleaners full maternity leave without batting an eyelid – in part (I’m cynically sure) because they’re smart enough to know that they risk being associated with failing to do the right thing. Lack of obligation. Just because national staff are often lucky to have their jobs and local economic conditions mean they will not – cannot – complain, does not excuse any employer who takes advantage of their lack of voice. International NGOs should be setting an example. They should be better than that. And equating legality with morality is perhaps the weakest argument of the lot. Lack of options. Where this is the case, it can be worked around. Figure out in advance what’s possible. Find a balance. Set up self insurance. Offer full local health coverage at least. Good reasons not to. Lots of things aren’t equitable, true. But there are good reasons why, for example, some salaries are paid at local rates and others at international ones: this avoids the creation of a dual economy in which drivers working for an international NGO are paid many times more than doctors or lawyers. The same doesn’t apply to health care. Lack of priority. “We do the best we can” is simply not good enough. International NGOs cannot be given a free ride on the claim of well-intended charity: they are part of a global multi-billion dollar business and they need to up their game. This includes getting the basics sorted out from the start.
National support staff deserve better These issues are challenging both ethically and practically. Although they got part way there in the end, it took days for my former employer to work through fiduciary issues, legal liabilities and financial concerns before they were able to decide how much they could and would do to help my former colleague. These issues should have been worked through long before he lay waiting in agony. In the midst of all the development industry’s concerns of “do we really make any difference”, the only thing they can be completely sure of influencing is the lives of the people they directly touch. International NGOs purport to make the world a better place. They have to get their own houses in order first. Do you have a secret aid worker story you’d like to tell?

2015-06-16T06:00:11Z,global-development,Global development,Médecins Sans Frontières head criticises G7 for lack of urgency over Ebola,"Aid donors missed a golden opportunity at the G7 summit in Germany to lay out measures for a far more vigorous response to epidemics such as the Ebola outbreak, according to Joanne Liu, the head of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). “There were strong opening remarks from Angela Merkel at the G7, saying we have failed on Ebola, we take full responsibility, but at the end, the recommendations were all watered down,” said Liu. “With Ebola, there was a fear factor. In September, the world held its breath as a huge terrible threat was over our heads. That sense of urgency has been lost, and I’m concerned things will not change.” Ebola has killed more than 11,000 people in the three worst affected west African states of Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia since March 2014. The World Health Organisation (WHO) did not declare the Ebola outbreak a public health emergency until August, despite 60 different chains of transmission in Guinea and warnings from MSF four months earlier. But Liu said tackling the outbreak was not the WHO’s sole responsibility. “Since the beginning I’ve been asking member states to show political responsibility in responding, but they didn’t and I think they’ve been let off the hook. It’s very convenient to have a scapegoat like WHO,” she said.
Liu wrote to Britain’s chancellor, George Osbourne, before the meeting on 7-8 June stressing how disease control is a public good, but the G7 provided no concrete solutions for fighting epidemics, and showed little will to reform the WHO, despite criticising it heavily. Liu said countries should be rewarded rather than punished for declaring an outbreak. Low-income countries, more prone to outbreaks, are hit the hardest by political and economic sanctions such as travel bans, she added. “If states declared earlier, the machine could move faster. But you see it everywhere, cholera in Haiti, meningitis in Niger, measles in the DRC [Democratic Republic of the Congo]. Each time we have to fight for them to declare, because they’re scared of the repercussions,” she said. “I am absolutely convinced there should be financial and political incentives for states to declare. You shouldn’t be the pariah of the world if you say you have Ebola, but in reality this is what happens,” she said. Liu is open to establishing a rapid response unit, proposed by health leaders ahead of the G7, with an “emergency mindset” working with an agency like the WHO to fight disease, but only if there is a paradigm shift in the way the organisation responds to outbreaks. “In Canada, I’m an ER physician. My hospital director wouldn’t ask me to visit outpatients. They know where I’m best, in ER. Similarly, I would want only people with emergency mindsets, not developmental, to do emergency response.” Ebola vaccines need to be ready before the start of the next epidemic, said Liu. However, she has reservations about measures to increase surveillance or build regional centres to test for infectious diseases. “People have this fantasy that surveillance will help the next epidemic. The reality is, despite not having complete data, we still had enough to know that we had to scale up our response,” said Liu. “But we didn’t.”
Those countries with larger economies had to be prepared to move in quickly after an outbreak and get their hands dirty on the ground, said Liu. Such a response could encourage other states to step up. “When President Obama pledged a 25-bed facility for healthcare workers, I remember having him on the phone and saying: ‘Thank you very much, that’s a good start.’ And it was followed by this long, awkward silence,” said Liu. She added that she told Obama: “If the world’s biggest economy isn’t pledging high, then who will?”. The UN’s financial tracking system shows that the scale of giving among G7 states varied greatly. Italy gave 0.3% of the total Ebola budget, while the US contributed about 45% . The UK gave roughly 10%. But, frustratingly, the $1.7bn of US funding did not reap the rewards it could have, Liu noted. “Unlike the Cubans, the US were not ready to expose their people. So even though they opened 11 centres with 150 beds each in Liberia, they treated just 28 people, because they deployed late, and refused to staff the centres. “Nations don’t have friends, they have interests. The best motivation for a state to act if it is remote from an epidemic is if its own security is at risk. “The downside is you keep waiting for a bigger and bigger monster to come, and by the time it hits you, it has already caused considerable damage elsewhere. As humanitarians, we can’t wait that long to act,” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/16/medecins-sans-frontieres-head-criticises-g7-over-ebola-joanne-liu,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/16/medecins-sans-frontieres-head-criticises-g7-over-ebola-joanne-liu
2015-06-15T14:37:00Z,global-development,Global development,Kenya police and military accused of victimising Muslims over terror attacks,"Kenyan security forces were slow to respond to attacks on villages along the country’s coast last year and afterwards arbitrarily detained and beat Muslims and ethnic Somalis as well as stealing personal property, claims a report by rights groups. Human Rights Watch (HRW) and the Kenya Human Rights Commission urged the government to increase its oversight of police and military investigations, noting that a year after the deadly coastal attacks, for which the Islamist group al-Shabaab claimed responsibility, no one has been held accountable. Kenya is facing its most serious security crisis in decades as al-Shabaab wages a campaign of terror along its border with Somalia, with sporadic attacks elsewhere. In April, the terror group laid siege to Garissa University campus, killing 148 people. In the report, Insult to Injury: The 2014 Lamu and Tana River Attacks and Kenya’s Abusive Response, the rights groups documented assaults on the coastal town of Mpeketoni, near the tourist island of Lamu, and on several other villages in the Lamu and Tana River counties in June and July 2014. At least 87 people were killed in the attacks. The deadliest assault happened in Mpeketoni, where armed men drove into town, threw explosives into the police station and shot civilians at random, killing at least 48 people. In interviews in eight villages in the area in October, the rights groups recorded not only witness accounts of the attacks but also allegations of abuse by security forces. The report, published on Monday, said hundreds of people had been beaten and detained without charge while communities remained vulnerable to further attacks. It criticised security services for failing to respond and for detaining terror suspects on flimsy charges for longer than 24 hours, the maximum amount of time suspects can be held without charge under Kenyan law. “I think they only stopped beating us because they were tired,” one 42-year-old man, who was detained by Kenyan police last year, told researchers. Leslie Lefkow, the deputy Africa director of HRW, said: “There’s a pattern here of the authorities scapegoating the wrong targets in their response to terrorist attacks. Whether that’s beating up and rounding up community members because of their ethnicity or their religion, or what we’ve seen with the way that they’ve gone after some of the NGOs on the coast, who have been working on these issues and documenting human rights violations.”
Thinktanks have warned that the Kenyan government’s targeting of Muslims could drive radicalisation in the country. “A response that ignores basic rights is not effective, and only risks making the situation worse,” said Davis Malombe, deputy director of the Kenya Human Rights Commission. Part of the problem is poor coordination between different government ministries and inadequate police work, HRW said. “The lack of police investigation – questioning of witnesses, taking of statements, collecting of evidence – is a pattern that we’ve observed in a number of different places and at different times,” Lefkow said. “No one here has recorded a statement with police because the police have not asked for statements. We don’t know how they are carrying out investigations if they cannot talk to those who saw the attackers or the survivors,” an employee of the Kenya Red Cross told researchers. Kenya’s inspector general of police, the chief of general staff and the director general of the Kenya Wildlife Service did not respond to requests for comment, the rights groups said. With more power being ceded to security services, including expanded rights to use firearms and detain suspects, the government must improve its oversight of police in order to fend off terrorists and protect civilians, the study said. “Kenyan authorities have not conducted any known investigations into human rights abuses by its counterterrorism forces, despite credible allegations of abuse,” it said. While efforts by Kenya’s Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) to hold police to account were applauded by the report’s authors, they called for further action. “There is an urgent need for political will to undertake the kind of reforms that will improve the security response and make Kenya safer,” Lefkow said. The report said the IPOA should “ensure all those implicated in human rights abuses are removed from their positions and held to account”. Last week, the Kenyan government announced a £180m rise in funding for counterterrorism operations in its latest budget (pdf). Kenya’s security services also receive funding from the US, the UK and other international donors, who have not spoken out publicly against recent reports of rights abuses. “I’m sure there is discussion privately on some of these concerns, but the question is whether the oversight and pressure for reforms is really at the level it needs to be,” Lefkow said. The country’s tourism sector, one of the pillars of the economy, is paying the price of deepening insecurity as governments warn their citizens to stay away from popular coastal resorts like Lamu, Mombasa and Malindi. Kenya said the threat of terrorist attacks could damage its development agenda, which aims to transform the republic into a middle-income country by 2030. “Without security for our citizens, achieving our growth and development objectives will remain a mirage,” Kenya’s finance minister, Henry Rotich, said on 11 June in an address to the country’s parliament.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/15/kenya-security-forces-victimising-muslims-al-shabaab-terror-attacks,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/15/kenya-security-forces-victimising-muslims-al-shabaab-terror-attacks
2015-06-15T13:01:05Z,global-development,Global development,Egyptian activists fear female genital mutilation initiative will fall short,"Egypt has announced an ambitious plan to reduce female genital mutilation by 10-15% over the next five years by mobilising doctors and judges against a practice that still affects more than 90% of women in the country. The national FGM abandonment strategy, announced in the ballroom of the Grand Nile Tower hotel in Cairo on Sunday, calls for doctors to be trained, prosecutors to be mobilised, and a media campaign to be launched to change public perceptions.
The scheme also urges the implementation of Egypt’s existing laws on FGM. The practice has been illegal in the country since 2008, yet there has been only one successful prosecution under that law. The list of institutions involved in the plan is formidable: the ministries of justice, health, and education, the prestigious Sunni Islam seat of learning Al-Azhar, Egyptian church officials, and the public prosecutor’s’ office. Yet some activists fear the campaign will fall short in eradicating FGM, and even the officials behind the new programme acknowledge they face a formidable task. The practice, which often involves the removal of the clitoris, remains prevalent in Egypt due to social and cultural pressures, which experts say are ultimately designed to control women’s bodies and sexuality. In 2014, 92.3% of women aged 15 to 49 who have been married were subject to some form of FGM, according to government statistics contained in the launch documentation. That figure is down from 95.8% in 2005. The vast majority of mutilations are performed by doctors and other medical professionals. “Now we have the political support we need,” said Vivian Fouad, an official with the National Population Council, which is spearheading the anti-FGM campaign. “It’s not just a project – two years or three years and people will be convinced FGM is bad. “It needs sustainable work, from government, from NGOs, from institutions,” she added, noting that FGM had existed in Egypt “for thousands of years”. At the conference announcing the plan, which was attended by officials from the EU and UN, both of which are participating in the initiative, bright orange buttons were distributed bearing the words: “Enough FGM.”A video was shown as an example of the media campaign that will accompany the programme. It showed a young girl being taken to a dimly lit medical facility by her father. Once inside, she screams: “You told me we were getting a doll! Why are you bringing me here?” The father has a change of heart, returning the girl safely home. “You were right,” he tells a woman who appears to be his wife. “I couldn’t do this to my daughter.” Elsewhere in the video, a narrator intones: “Even the prophet did not circumcise his daughters.” Aggressive as the government initiative may be, activists say it is emblematic of a state-centered approach that will face obstacles, particularly in reaching the rural districts where FGM is most prevalent. Reda al-Danbouki, the lawyer who was this year involved in the first successful prosecution of an FGM-related case in Egypt, is among the sceptics.
“They’re looking for a media show but not working seriously. It’s only in Cairo and Giza. I think it’s just words, not serious work,” said Danbouki, who pressed for the prosecution of a doctor after a 12-year-old girl died following her mutilation in Agga, in the Nile delta north of Cairo. “They’re not working in the villages.” Implementation of Egypt’s existing law banning FGM is one of the most intriguing aspects of the new plan. Egypt’s judiciary is a vast and capricious institution that has emerged in recent years as a key ally of the military-backed government in pursuing an abusive clampdown on political opposition. A glossy 43-page document detailing the anti-FGM campaign notes that “effectiveness of the judicial system is key”. But Fouad expressed confidence about the role of prosecutors, saying at least 1,000 had already been trained in connection with anti-FGM policies. Dalia Abd El-Hameed, head of the gender programme at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, said the campaign represented “a top-down approach to dealing with the issue of circumcision, which is extremely problematic”. “That’s emphasising laws over change in perceptions, and in the changing of perception, prioritising religion over other aspects, like gender stereotypes,” she said. “There is no rights-based approach in this strategy, which is very disappointing. There is no emphasis on women’s rights to bodily integrity, to be free from violence, to sexual pleasure.” Soraya Bahgat, a women’s rights advocate, said the plan did not do enough to involve nongovernmental and grassroots groups. “There are barriers to entry to people who want to support these great efforts, and they’re not being acknowledged here. That’s my biggest frustration,” she said. “We’re being told that we’re welcome and thank you and everything, but the reality on the ground is if I go and tell them, ‘I need to get this done’ – with the paperwork and everything – I’m facing red tape. Especially in this time when NGOs are becoming a very bad word.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/15/egypt-female-genital-mutilation-abandonment-strategy-activists-sceptical,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/15/egypt-female-genital-mutilation-abandonment-strategy-activists-sceptical
2015-06-15T06:00:21Z,global-development,Global development,"Ebola in Sierra Leone: 'Remind people not to forget about us, the survivors' | Huw Poraj-Wilczynski","When Ebola broke out in Sierra Leone, Fatmata Sesay was one of the first nurses sent to work at the Kenema treatment centre. “We were trained how to take care of the patients but we only had the Lassa fever protection equipment. It was very light, like paper, and water could get through,” says Sesay, sitting in the front room of her house, with her daughter, Tata, beside her. Sesay contracted Ebola on 28 June last year. “One of my colleagues was infected and came here,” she says. “She was from the same village as me. I was taking care of her.
“She had urine retention and was bleeding from all orifices and had diarrhoea. I tried to save her life. I passed the catheter, cleaned her and then gave her some water to drink. She vomited on my shoulder. I felt the vomit on my skin. That is when I caught Ebola.” Sesay reported the incident to the head nurse and was sent home to monitor herself. At the time, there was no quarantine programme in place. After a week, Fatmata felt as if her skin was itching. It was as if there was something in her blood. She felt it in her hands, up her arms and in her heart. Then the severe abdominal pains and headaches started. She went for the Ebola test and the next day it was confirmed that she had tested positive. Sesay was admitted on 4 July. She was bleeding through her nose and vomited blood for six days. It would take 20 days for her to recover and be discharged from hospital. But Tata caught the virus too. “She is my only daughter. She contracted the virus from me. I felt very worried. But we both survived.” Their survival was celebrated in a series of images taken by the UN children’s agency, Unicef, and published on the Global development site in August. However, the problems of the Ebola outbreak are not limited to the virus itself. Working in the Ebola treatment centre, even before she caught the disease, was a lonely experience, says Sesay. People stopped coming round to see her. Rumours spread about what Ebola was and who was responsible.
“It was very difficult for us nurses at the time,” she says. “People in Kenema said we nurses were the ones who were killing the patients. They thought the president had given us money to reduce the population. They said Ebola was not real. “And when we were discharged, if you saw us you would run away. People were afraid of us. Still some people won’t speak to me but it is getting better.” After Sesay was discharged from hospital she was given a payment for three months, from July to September, but then the money stopped. Physically recovering from Ebola took a long time and both Sesay and Tata look tired, months after their initial illness.
“I started working again at the female medical ward in March. They say we cannot catch Ebola for another 10 years, but I am not 100% sure. When I go and administer an IV line or drugs, in my mind I do not want what has passed to repeat again. “I [do not feel] 100%. I can’t work like I used to. I lost my eyesight for three weeks and still cannot see clearly through my left eye. My daughter is sick and has [high] temperatures. “I am not happy when I think what I went through. The elders sent us to work in the Ebola treatment centre and many of our colleagues have died. Their children and family are suffering. “But no one from the elders has visited us. No one from the medical side has come to ask how we are doing or ‘how is your family?’ “They told us that as we were the first nurses working at the treatment centre, if there [are] any benefits they are supposed to give them to us. But now the money has stopped. “Life is not easy. I want you to remind people not to forget about us, the survivors. We have survived but the challenges are very high. “I am not sure I will be able to give birth again. I hope I will be able to.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/15/ebola-sierra-leone-remind-people-not-to-forget-survivors,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/15/ebola-sierra-leone-remind-people-not-to-forget-survivors
2015-06-13T20:13:34Z,global-development,Global development,Revealed: how the world turned its back on rape victims of Congo,"On an imposing hill above the town of Minova, at the end of a trail down which rivulets of rainwater run past tarpaulin-tented homes, a small women’s refuge can be found. Here, groups of women silently till the land. Others stare warily over Lake Kivu towards the distant mountains, waiting for news of the fighting. Three years have passed since a column of Congolese soldiers entered Minova after being defeated and ousted by M23 rebels from the nearby city of Goma. Many were drunk, firing their guns in frustration towards the sky, but mostly they were humiliated. Over the next three days they took their defeat out on the women and girls of Minova. The town, in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), is the site of one of the darkest episodes of sexual violence in a country that the UN has called the “rape capital of the world”, a place where one study estimated that 48 women are raped every hour. Hundreds of women were systematically raped by the soldiers, an atrocity that drew international outrage and the promise of intervention. A London summit – hosted by William Hague, then foreign secretary, and the film star Angelina Jolie, who is a UN special envoy for refugees – would later pledge to eradicate sexual violence in war zones, with its lead focus on eastern Congo. That summit was almost exactly a year ago. But the Congolese troops in the hills around Minova continue to rape with impunity. A recent army offensive against a nearby militia has prompted a fresh wave of sexual violence.
Every day, muddied and traumatised, new arrivals stagger up the hillside to the only sanctuary around. Masika Katsuva, 47, who runs the local refuge, says: “They keep attacking us, we have no protection, no support.” So much was promised: what went wrong? When Jolie and Hague travelled to Congo in March 2013 to promote the UK government’s campaign to end sexual violence in conflict, details were still emerging of the rapes in Minova. The UN condemned the atrocity as “horrifying” in its scale and systematic nature. Commanders had allegedly ordered subordinates to “go and get women”. Victims were gang-raped in front of their children. At least 30 of those attacked were children themselves. The visit of Jolie and Hague, one a globally renowned star, the other a distinguished western politician, had an electrifying effect on what had been a barely functioning investigation into the crimes. Days after their visit, prosecutors began assembling a case that would become known throughout the world as the Minova trial. It was heralded as the largest rape tribunal in the country’s history, a defining chapter in the creation of a viable legal system in eastern Congo. Leaked excerpts of pre-trial meetings reveal the Congolese army’s senior prosecutor promising “all the big fish will be arrested and prosecuted”, and adding: “This case is being watched by everyone, and the Congolese state cannot afford to stage a parody of justice.” But other confidential legal documents and testimony from several Congolese lawyers – speaking out at great risk to their lives – reveal how the military rigged the trial’s outcome. The sources, speaking in Goma to the Observer on condition of anonymity, reveal that UN officials repeatedly raised private concerns with the Congolese authorities over their approach and at one point “even decided not to support the trial when it started”, according to one lawyer involved. However, the case continued because the international community accepted that something had to be seen to be done. The UN, they claim, raised concerns privately that the trial contained no provision for an appeal by the women, in clear breach of the country’s constitution. Several lawyers involved have come forward to also allege that the DRC government parachuted in a prosecutor from the capital, Kinshasa, to manipulate the direction of the trial.
“The prosecution received orders from the government. In a high-profile case like this, if the line is dictated by the big prosecutor from Kinshasa who has talked to the government minister, then you have the line,” says one lawyer, who receives daily death threats because of his work on sexual violence. “Behind the Minova case you have the executive, governmental actors,” he said. One way the government influenced the trial, he said, was by prematurely curtailing the investigation, exploiting pressure from the international community to act quickly. As a result, evidence was incomplete or contradictory, or no forensics were conducted. Even the number of victims was unresolved. Within the well-guarded Goma offices of the American Bar Association, files detail the names of 1,014 victims. The UN recorded that 126 women and girls had been raped, of which 56 testified in court. “They took advantage of the situation to please the international community, but organised a trial which would achieve nothing,” says another legal source in Goma. The Congolese government, he alleges, made certain that no commanding officer was prosecuted over Minova. Legal correspondence, dated last month, describes how prosecutors refused to level charges against commanders whose men were accused of mass rape. Transcripts of pre-trial meetings between military prosecutors and UN officials show that, when challenged over why no commanding officers had “been bothered [sic] or taken into temporary custody”, the authorities stated that no women could identify their rapists, so there was no point arresting high-ranking officials. Twelve senior officers suspended over the rapes were never brought to trial. Of the 39 Congolese soldiers who eventually appeared in court, only two junior soldiers were convicted of rape. Throughout the trial, exhaustive security measures were introduced, with the women wearing hoods in court to protect their identity. Yet Katsuva and other victims recount being frequently threatened and attacked since, contradicting assurances they would be protected after the trial. Anne-Marie Buhoro, 39, who was raped in Minova, says: “It’s very dangerous now because of the Minova case: it has become very unsafe for everyone involved.” Katsuva says that after the trial they received an anonymous letter saying their throats would be slit. She handed it to the military administrator, but heard nothing. Of the 56 women who testified, 50 have since been threatened, according to Katsuva. So grave is the risk of reprisal that they spend nights hiding in the dense bush. She points north, towards military outposts less than two miles away. “Their units are not very far. We are beaten by the militaries,” she says. Senior officers implicated in the rapes are often seen in nearby Goma. Promises that the women would receive reparations have similarly never materialised, despite the court authorising compensation. Confidential legal documents, dated last month and addressed to Jeanine Mabunda, Congo’s leading government official in the fight against sexual violence, says the Minova rape victims are each entitled to £15,000. From the moment the verdict that no senior officers would be prosecuted was announced, weeks before the summit began, says Charles-Guy Makongo of the American Bar Association in Goma, it felt as if the rapes of Minova were being airbrushed from history.
So much for the domestic investigation. But did the international community at least act upon its expressions of outrage and concern? News of the Minova verdict prompted a statement from Hague urging “the Congolese authorities to continue their efforts to seek out and prosecute the remaining perpetrators”. The British embassy in Kinshasa registered its disapproval. But, according to Goma lawyers, that was the extent of the UK government’s quest for justice. It was left to a solitary Goma law firm to launch an appeal on behalf of the victims – a move that military prosecutors attempted to block and which has made its team, too, the focus of death threats. “When I asked for help from the international community, we got none. We are totally alone,” says Makongo. During the trial he had four armed guards; these days he never walks the streets. “The international community seemed happy just to see the military in court. We cannot afford to fight this by ourself, we don’t have the funds.” The summit convened by Hague, who had been appointed David Cameron’s special representative on preventing sexual violence in conflict, and Jolie, did make headlines, however. The largest assembly of its kind was called last June with the express intention of tackling sexual violence in conflict. As delegates flew in, the hope was of preventing another Minova. Increased funding was promised to support survivors of sexual violence and challenge attitudes to what Hague called one of the “great mass crimes” of modern times. When the Minova women heard about the summit, they hoped to be among the 1,700 delegates from 123 countries invited. But no one – not even Katsuva – was invited to join a three-day convention where the food bill alone reached £299,342.01. Makongo of the, – whose American Bar Association in Goma has received 18,000 complaints of sexual violence since 2008 – says it is scandalous the women of Minova were not invited. “No one wanted to know. The women of Minova should have been there to share their experiences.” Nevertheless, delegates gave Hague a thunderous round of applause as he promised that “we owe it to future generations to end one of the greatest injustices of our time”. In the past year, according to those in eastern Congo, the situation has worsened. This month 19 new cases have arrived at the refuge in Minova. The Panzi hospital in Bukavu has reported a spike of children being raped, while the Heal Africa hospital in Goma, which cares for between 8,000 and 10,000 rape victims a year, says that, although conflict has subsided in some areas, the frequency of rape victims remains constant. As part of their eastern Congo trip, Hague and Jolie visited the Heal hospital, praising its commitment to the cause but neglecting to reveal that the UK’s funding would be extremely limited. “They only gave us money for one year. It’s gone,” says Emmanuel Baabo, in charge of Heal’s sexual violence project. A Foreign Office statement released during the tour announced UK funding of £205,000 to the charity Physicians for Human Rights, based in Panzi hospital. The money was to help “document and collect evidence of sexual violence”. But that funding, too, has run out. One worker says: “The money was crucial, paying for experts to provide training on how to collect and preserve forensic evidence on rape cases.” Some budgetary choices seem quixotic, to say the least. Figures obtained through Freedom of Information requests reveal last year’s entire UK budget dedicated to tackling sexual violence in conflict – £3.5m – was dwarfed by the £5.2m spent on the Hague/Jolie summit. The money spent on hotels and transport over three days, £576,000, was roughly equivalent to the amount earmarked for eastern Congo at the summit. The UK’s funding retreat mirrors a broader trend throughout eastern DRC. There, charities report decreasing donor interest; clinics for rape victims are closing and refuges are becoming vital as the support network shrinks. Tamah Murfet, of the International Rescue Committee’s women’s protection unit in the Congo, says: “Funding is very low for tackling sexual violence: across the board it has decreased. Major donors have dropped out of this area and it’s become very difficult to even get minimal coverage.”
Baabo, who has just lost another major donor from Heal hospital, says: “Victims in rural areas are no longer getting help. Organisations no longer go to remote areas; many rape cases are not being reported.” The short-termism of the funding that came out of the London summit has infuriated those on the frontline. Baabo says that only five-year programmes can deliver lasting change. Makongo accuses the international community of getting bored too quickly, when a long-term commitment to tackling an ingrained culture of rape was required. “You need the will to change a mentality, that takes a generation,” he says. Back on the hills above Minova, Katsuva no longer has any hope that justice will be done. She has been raped twice, on one of the occasions by 12 men. Like the other women in her refuge, she expects to be attacked again, perhaps not by the same men, but probably by a man wearing the same military uniform. “They want me silenced,” she says. Her refuge, above a cluster of grubby, temporary tents and encircled by the smallholdings of rape victims, feels vulnerable, a world away from the brightly lit world stage where Hague aspired to combat sexual violence in conflict. Last week it was quietly announced that he had stood down as the prime minister’s special envoy on the issue. The refuge has repeatedly asked for financial support from London. “I have tried to contact the UK government many times, we have no money to help women or children, but they never listen,” Katsuva says. Despite her penury, she has helped 84 youngsters born through rape and is now caring for 130 women and children at the refuge. Crouched in the shadows of her cramped home, above the sound of women singing outside, she says: “We gave everything to the trial. We trusted them. How could they leave us like this?”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/13/rape-victims-congo-world-turned-away,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/jun/13/rape-victims-congo-world-turned-away
2015-06-13T19:42:32Z,global-development,Global development,William Hague’s summit against warzone rape seen as ‘costly failure’,"The money Britain spent hosting a global summit, headed by William Hague and Angelina Jolie, to end sexual violence in conflicts was five times higher than the entire confirmed budget the UK has dedicated to tackling rape in war zones this year. A year after the high-profile London summit concluded with Hague, the former foreign secretary, pledging “to end one of the greatest injustices of our time”, the Observer can also reveal the initiative has had negligible impact and that British funding has been withdrawn from vital projects. An investigation into the impact of Hague and US film star Jolie’s initiative in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) found that incidents of rape and sexual violence have increased in the region. Evidence of the continued targeting of women and a failure to prosecute perpetrators will inform discussions this week as a new parliamentary inquiry into the “preventing sexual violence in conflict” initiative launched by Hague and Jolie in 2012 takes place. New figures reveal that the three-day London summit to promote the initiative last June cost £5.2m to host. The food bill alone came to more than £299,000, while total expenditure on taxis, hotels and transport reached £576,000. The Foreign Office on Saturday night would confirm only that it had awarded £1m this year to the project, stating that unspecified sums from other schemes would supplement the fund. Marcy Hersh of the Women’s Refugee Commission said: “For an initiative that used such lofty language, I struggle to see what the initiative has tangibly created, other than recognition, acknowledgement and sympathy for the issue.”
Although the high-profile summit was intended to end the impunity of war zone rapists in places such as the DRC, the American Bar Association in the Congolese city of Goma said that prosecutions for rape had fallen recently while a women’s refuge has reported an upturn in sexual violence. Critics said that the rhetoric of Hague at the summit contrasted with the actual resources devoted by the UK government to the issue. No member of the UK’s team of experts on sexual violence in conflict is based in the DRC. Throughout last year just one trip was made to the DRC and that was by a single individual from the UK team. On Wednesday a House of Lords committee will begin examining Hague’s initiative as part of an evaluation into what the project has so far delivered. Baroness Nicholson, the chair of the inquiry, said it would attempt to discover if “we are just flying a kite with lots of wind behind it”. She added: “The Hague initiative was magnificent, a brilliant beginning, but what now? What has actually happened since the summit? What actually did it do? How do we move forward?” Last Wednesday it was announced that Hague had surprisingly stepped down as the special envoy in charge of the initiative, although on Friday he pledged to use his “unusual alliance” with Jolie to continue fighting sexual violence. The Foreign Office said that since last year’s summit they had trained more than 100 military peacekeepers and 700 Kurdish peshmerga in “sexual violence prevention and response” in addition to training “countless human rights defenders on the international protocol.” Outlining funding for this year, the Foreign Office said it had awarded £1m “to local NGOs in a range of countries” – an amount supplemented by funding awarded through the new conflict and stability security fund, and that it would continue giving money to the UN for tackling the issue. This letter from Baroness Anelay was published on 28 June 2015 The assertion that the government’s preventing sexual violence in conflict initiative “has had negligible impact and that British funding has been withdrawn from vital projects” is misleading and ignores crucial facts (“William Hague’s summit against warzone rape seen as ‘costly failure’”, News). The UK has provided more than £14m to PSVI-related work over the last three years. We have supported human-rights defenders and NGOs around the world. We have funded a wide range of UN and international agencies. UK programmes mean 100 African Union and UN peacekeepers, plus 700 Kurdish peshmerga, are trained to prevent and respond to sexual violence. We are tackling this heinous aspect of Islamic State’s crimes in Iraq. This year, we have already allocated a further £6m to PSVI work. The fight is long. Sexual violence in conflict is a complex issue. It will take years to bring about the cultural, political and practical changes required to end it. Last year’s global summit to end sexual violence in conflict was a milestone. It was the largest meeting of its kind, bringing together representatives from more than 120 countries, 100 NGOs and international organisations and more than 900 experts. It galvanised global action. The UK’s leadership makes this possible. Our determination to tackle this scourge is unwavering. We have never shied away from defending those in need. Our commitment continues.

2015-06-12T12:58:34Z,global-development,Global development,Witnesses to Shaimaa al-Sabbagh's killing face fresh Egyptian court ordeal,"An Egyptian court is set to hear an appeal on Saturday in the case of 17 eyewitnesses, including the human rights lawyer Azza Soliman, who went on trial after testifying in the police killing of an unarmed activist in January. Prosecutors lodged the appeal in May after the 17 witnesses were acquitted at an initial trial in Cairo. They had been charged under a law enacted in 2013 that criminalises street protests held without an Interior Ministry permit.
All had offered testimony over the death of the poet Shaimaa al-Sabbagh, who was killed when police fired at a group of unarmed demonstrators marking the fourth anniversary of the uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak. Her death in daylight on a central Cairo street highlighted an upsurge in the use of lethal force against protesters by Egypt’s security forces. Egyptian rights activist say the prosecution of the witnesses illustrates the role of the judiciary in a broad clampdown on defenders of human rights and political opponents of the military-backed government. “This is a big mistake the prosecutor made. The prosecutor is continuing in this mistake,” said Soliman, the founder of a women’s rights organisation, the Centre for Egyptian Women’s Legal Assistance. She had been eating lunch in a cafe looking on to Talaat Harb Square when the shooting took place, and later volunteered to give evidence as a witness. “My case means that the rule of law has become weaker and weaker in Egypt. This is the message,” she said in a phone interview on Thursday. “I am a witness. I am not a member of this political party. I was not a member of this demonstration.”
Unlike Soliman, the majority of those initially charged in the case are members of a small socialist political party that staged the January demonstration in which activists attempted to carry wreaths to Tahrir Square, the symbolic centre of the revolution that toppled Mubarak. The hearing comes after another court sentenced a police officer to 15 years in prison over Sabbagh’s killing. The officer, Yassin Mohamed Hatem Salahedeen, was convicted of actions that “lead to the death” of Sabbagh, a charge considered less severe than murder, as well as wounding other demonstrators. That conviction is a rare moment of accountability in a country where more than a thousand others have died when police have forcibly dispersed protests over the past two years, with few prosecutions of security forces. Sabbagh’s death was a high-profile event that resulted in unusually harsh criticism of the state from Egypt’s official political class and press. The top state-owned newspaper published a front-page editorial with a stern condemnation of the killing and a call for accountability. An iconic photo of Sabbagh’s last moments, her face streaked with blood, embracing a man attempting to help her, went viral in Egypt and in the international media. Soliman’s defence attorney, Salah El Saman, said the prosecution’s case for an appeal was “weak”. However, he said in a phone interview: “We don’t have an independent judiciary, unfortunately.” Since the 2011 uprising that ended Mubarak’s three decades of rule, Egypt’s security forces have often used deadly force in reaction to demonstrations. More than 800 people died during the 18 days of the initial uprising. Instances of lethal force surged after the military deposed elected president Mohamed Morsi in 2013. The new military-backed government engaged sweeping clampdown on Morsi’s supporters, including the killing of more than 800 people in one day during the dispersal of a protest camp in Cairo’s Rabaa al-Adawiya Square. Throughout this period of unrest, successful prosecutions of police and security officials have been rare. “The sentence against al-Sabbagh’s killer would serve justice but past convictions of police have been reversed on appeal, meaning there has been zero accountability for killing protesters,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch, in a statement.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/12/witnesses-shaimaa-al-sabbagh-killing-court-cairo-egypt-azza-soliman,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/12/witnesses-shaimaa-al-sabbagh-killing-court-cairo-egypt-azza-soliman
2015-06-12T09:55:20Z,global-development,Global development,Five myths about child labour,"An estimated 168 million children are involved in child labour, accounting for almost 11% of children globally. While this figure is a third lower than it was in 2000, campaigners say more still needs to be done to get children out of work and into school. Patrick Quinn, child labour specialist with the International Labour Organisation (ILO), says the first step to reducing the incidence of child labour is ensuring that people know what it is. The ILO defines child labour as work that “deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development”. In its most extreme forms, child labour can involve youngsters being enslaved, separated from their families, exposed to hazards and illnesses or left alone on city streets.
“People don’t always understand the seriousness of child labour and many may see it as an acceptable pathway to adult work,” says Quinn. “What we’re focused on is ensuring children are free to access education.” To mark World Day Against Child Labour, we bust five myths on child labour and its impact on children. 1. Every form of child labour is bad The type of work children can be involved in differs greatly, and not all work done by children has been targeted for elimination. For instance, if a child or teenager is involved in work that does not have a negative impact on their health or prevent them from attending school, it is generally considered acceptable. It is recognised that this type of work can be a positive influence on children by contributing to their personal development and the welfare of their families. 2. Most child labourers work in factories ILO global estimates show that 58.6% of child labourers aged between five and 17 work in the agricultural sector; 6.9% work in domestic work; 7.2% work in the industrial sector including mining, manufacturing and construction, and 25.4% work in services including retail trade, restaurants and transport. “Often, most people hear about children working in sweatshops and factories, but in fact the majority of child labour occurs in agriculture, often in very poor subsistence farming areas,” Quinn said.
3. Child labour only exists in poor countries Child labour is a global problem. The largest number of child labourers are found in Asia and the Pacific (77.7 million), while sub-Saharan Africa has the highest incidence of child labour, with 21% of children aged between five and 17 involved in the practice. But beyond these regions, child labour is still an issue. “Of the 168 million children in child labour, 12 million are in upper or middle income countries,” said Quinn. “While clearly the problem is most serious in lower income countries, it is not exclusively a problem for those areas. The stats are harder to find because there hasn’t been the same emphasis on child labour in high income countries, but there are several incidences in Europe and the US where children are working in hazardous work, particularly children aged 15 to 17.” 4. Child labour is a necessary evil for growing economies There is a school of thought that major economies were built partly on the exploitation of child labour, and that the availability of cheap labour is necessary for today’s burgeoning economies. Domestic workers in private households, of which 10.5 million are children, play an important role in the smooth running of national economies, as do garment and factory workers. But the ILO argues that growing economies require quality education and a skilled workforce to flourish. “If you look at a number of countries in Asia, South America and elsewhere, there are examples of economies that have expanded rapidly while making education and social protection schemes a priority. For many, investing in education has helped lead to economic growth,” said Quinn. 5. Child labour helps young people transition into paid work as adults The ILO’s 2015 report on the state of child labour examines the long-term effects of a child workforce, including the employment outcomes of former child labourers. The research found that young people with prior involvement in child labour were more likely to be in unpaid family work or in low-paying jobs as adults, while those who had left school at or below the general minimum working age of 15 were at greater risk of remaining outside the world of work altogether.

2015-06-11T23:01:10Z,global-development,Global development,"Pakistan: 'Son, you brought electricity to the village and added 15 years to my life'","Villages in the foothills of the Hindu Kush mountain range in northern Pakistan are beautiful, dangerous and remote. Close to the Afghan border and far beyond the reach of aid groups and governments, they have long been deprived of technology, ravaged by conflict, and devastated by earthquakes and floods. But by harnessing the small glacier-meltwater rivers that drop steeply off the soaring mountains, one Pakistani non-profit group is said to be laying the foundations for future peace and prosperity – and bringing hope to some of South Asia’s most marginalised and isolated people. Since it started work in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region 11 years ago, the Sarhad Rural Support Programme (SRSP) has constructed 189 village micro-hydro schemes and brought power to around 365,000 people in the area, says its director, Masood Ul-Mulk. In two more years, he says, an additional 300,000 people could have power. “Many communities have been using candles. Electricity means refrigerators in hospitals and schools, and telephones. It transforms lives. When we brought light to one village, one old lady said to me, ‘Son, you have just added 15 years to my life,’” he said.
“We do not see ourselves as energy generators but as an organisation that gives hope to people who have been devastated by conflict and floods. Electricity is a way to harmonise and bring communities together. Providing light is just the beginning of the process of building up communities. The education, energy and social programmes all bring people a feeling of success and achievement.” Hazrat Gul, from the Swat region, said that before the hydro schemes, young people were leaving the villages in droves. “We used to burn wood, candles and lanterns to get light. Now children complete their homework and people have access to the internet and mobile phones can be charged. People used to leave the village as their studies suffered without electricity. When all their needs are met at home, why would they leave?”
But SRSP’s work takes place amid sporadic clan and ethnic conflicts that can displace people from the local communities. The presence of groups of Taliban and tribal militants residing in the area has led to continual tensions. “These are very complex environments that are not easy to decipher from a distance. People can have many identities. You can have a national, ethnic, geographical or village identity,” says Ul-Mulk. The conflict derives partly from the traditional isolation and marginalisation of the area, he says. “One thing that feeds into conflict is deprivation. There is conflict in all the mountain regions of Nepal, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Why? One reason is that they are all marginalised and deprived.” On Thursday evening, SRSP won a prestigious Ashden international award for its work on improving access to sustainable energy. Martin Wright, a judge for Ashden who visited the area this year, was impressed by how electricity was spurring development in such an idyllic location. “Picture snow-capped mountains rising up out of swaths of pine forest like something out of a fairy tale … Deep green valleys, planted out with spring wheat, full of apricot and apple blossom, rushing, tumbling streams; wider, flowing rivers – and spring flowers bursting from the melting snow,” said Wright.
“SRSP is demonstrating the wonderful chain reaction that results from bringing modern power to a community for the first time. As well as providing light at night, its micro-hydro plants are enabling businesses to thrive, health clinics to operate fully and bringing 21st-century communications and education facilities to one of the most challenging parts of Asia,” Wright said. “People are thinking up new ways to use the power. Olive trees grow wild in Swat, and now people are harvesting and pressing the olives for sale. They can sell more now because they can contact markets with their phones and sometimes the internet, all of which is opening up new opportunities. “The most unexpected thing I saw – up in a remote valley in Chitral – was a microwave oven. Some people had electric water heaters and irons as well. So there was a real sense of bringing home comforts – all through sustainable electricity – to distant areas. And that means people might be more likely to stay there.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/12/pakistan-electricity-village-micro-hydro-ashden-award,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/12/pakistan-electricity-village-micro-hydro-ashden-award
2015-06-11T10:51:37Z,global-development,Global development,Home Office weighs bleak UN report on rights abuses by Eritrea government,"The UK is to “carefully consider” the findings of a UN inquiry that concluded the Eritrean government may be subjecting its citizens to crimes against humanity, contradicting British guidance that has deemed Eritrea safe for migrants to return to after leaving illegally. The Home Office updated its country guidance for Eritrea in March to advise that Eritreans are no longer at risk of persecution if they return home after leaving the country without official permission. This guidance is used by UK immigration officials to determine the legitimacy of asylum applications. As long as Eritreans have paid income taxes and sign a letter of apology for leaving the country illegally, they will not face persecution or harm if they return, the guidance from the Home Office said. “Previous country guidance indicated that those who had left illegally were at risk on return to Eritrea. However, up-to-date information from inside Eritrea suggests this is no longer the case,” it said. But the UN commission of inquiry on human rights in Eritrea painted a much bleaker picture for Eritrean returnees in a report published on Monday. It said that Eritreans who fled the country illegally are regarded as “traitors”. They are usually arrested when they return and are detained in harsh conditions. “Returnees who spoke to the commission were held in prison between eight months to three years,” the report said. “[They] are systematically ill-treated to the point of torture.” The UN report also said the Eritrean government is carrying out extrajudicial killings, torture, rape, indefinite national service and forced labour “on a scope and scale seldom witnessed elsewhere”. The Eritrean government dismissed the UN’s allegations as “unfounded and devoid of all merit”. Eritrea has said that huge numbers of Ethiopian asylum seekers, pretending to be Eritrean to increase their chances of gaining asylum, have distorted the actual number of Eritreans arriving in Europe. A Home Office spokeswoman said: “We will carefully consider the findings of the UN report.” She did not specify whether the current Home Office guidance would be changed. She added: “Our country information and guidance is based on a careful and objective assessment of the situation in Eritrea using evidence taken from a range of sources including media outlets, local, national and international organisations, including human rights organisations, and information from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.” European countries are struggling to deal with the arrival of record numbers of migrants and refugees, notably from Syria and Eritrea. Fleeing civil war, persecution and seeking better job prospects, thousands have braved dangerous journeys across the Mediterranean, in the hope of gaining asylum in Europe. Eurostat, the EU’s statistics agency, reported that 36,925 Eritrean migrants applied for asylum in Europe last year, a 155% increase from 2013. The UK received 3,552 asylum applications from Eritreans in the year to March, more than from any other nationality, according to the Home Office. Even more migrants are expected to arrive during the summer months, when the Mediterranean is calmer and crossings are less risky. Last month, the EU announced plans to take in 40,000 Syrian and Eritrean migrants, but this was met with opposition from some member states. Denmark and Norway have also issued new asylum guidance in the past year, making it easier for immigration services to reject Eritrean applications. These moves have been condemned by human rights groups. Leslie Lefkow, deputy Africa director at Human Rights Watch (HRW), said: “In the absence of tangible human rights reforms by Eritrea’s government, host countries, particularly in the EU, should not close the door on Eritrean asylum seekers or send them back to almost certain abuse.”
The Home Office’s March guidance included dozens of citations from a heavily criticised report by the Danish Immigration Service (DIS) used to determine asylum applications to Denmark. The Danish report, published in December, has been criticised as inaccurate and misleading by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Human Rights Watch and a group of 23 academics, activists and journalists. Jens Weise Olesen, a chief immigration adviser at DIS and co-author of the Danish report, has been suspended for speaking out about the production of the study. Olesen said the report had been rushed out after a huge increase in the number of Eritreans applying for asylum in Denmark. He said the report has deterred Eritreans from seeking asylum in Denmark since it was published. “Our head of office was very eager to publish the report extremely quickly,” he said. “You could see the number of Eritrean asylum applications to Denmark going down, because they knew the report was out there and it could be used to reject their application.” A DIS spokesman declined to comment on the report, saying the matter had been closed. A Home Office spokeswoman said: “We are aware of, and have taken into account, criticism of parts of the Danish report, which is only used alongside a range of other sources to produce the guidance.” Eritrea’s indefinite national service, which requires men and women over 18 to serve in the military or work for the government, is cited as the most common reason that people flee the country. EU officials have said that Eritrea has committed to reducing its national service requirement to 18 months, but HRW said there is no sign this commitment has been made. When the new guidance was issued in March, HRW said there was no evidence of any change of policy regarding illegal exits in Eritrea and it urged the Home Office to reconsider its conclusions.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/11/uk-home-office-weighs-bleak-un-report-on-rights-abuses-by-eritrea-government,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/11/uk-home-office-weighs-bleak-un-report-on-rights-abuses-by-eritrea-government
2015-06-11T08:00:05Z,global-development,Global development,Ethiopia's crackdown on dissent drives opposition to push for 'freedom first' | William Davison,"On the very day Ethiopia’s ruling party celebrated another crushing electoral victory, a young blogger on trial under anti-terrorism laws in an Addis Ababa courtroom lashed out at the authorities. “You yourself should respect the law,” said Abel Wabella, 28, from the Zone 9 blogging group, after judges denied him the chance to protest against the tortuous pace of legal proceedings that began more than a year ago. The case of nine journalists and bloggers arrested in 2014 has been decried by human rights groups as an example of Ethiopian authorities’ crackdown on dissent. The nine were detained on allegations that they worked for foreign human rights groups or had used social media to incite violence. Prosecutors have yet to present any evidence of illegal activity against the Zone 9 defendants, who say they merely exercised their constitutional right to freedom of expression. Wabella’s frustration is symptomatic of a generation of politically engaged Ethiopians who have no faith in the ballot box and are wary of expressing dissent through other channels in a country that is regularly criticised by rights groups for stifling basic freedoms.
Opponents of the government despair at this stagnant environment, said one government critic on social media, who did not want to be identified for fear of being harassed by the authorities. “If Zone 9 is not tolerated then it seems there is no political space to engage,” he said. The latest landslide at the ballot box means that Ethiopia will be ruled until at least 2020 by the Ethiopian Peoples’ Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), a former rebel group, which took power in 1991 by unseating a military regime. All 442 constituencies announced so far have gone to the ruling coalition, giving them a majority in the 547-seat parliament. The opposition lost in all 23 constituencies in Addis Ababa last month, including the one seat they had won in 2010. Local newspaper reports suggest the EPRDF increased its share of the popular vote by 10% to 64%. Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn’s government says it has delivered economic development and stability, but critics maintain this has come at the cost of human rights. Yilkal Getnet, leader of opposition rising star the Blue party, says the claims of economic development are “not real”. The Blue party captured 16% of the vote in Addis Ababa this time, but failed to secure a seat under the first-past-the-post electoral system. Getnet says the opposition’s plan is to push for “freedom first” rather than challenging the government’s policies. Abel Asrat, an online entrepreneur who is politically independent, said the Blue party shrewdly capitalised on popular anger over the execution by Isis militants of Ethiopian migrants in Libya in April. But the party, which was formed in 2012, now needs a more substantial and moderate programme, he said. “The vast majority of the voters are in the middle. You have to focus on them rather than those that have made up their mind.” With more than 2 million Facebook users in Ethiopia, the opposition should also use social media more to reach out to young undecided voters, Asrat said.
Blue party spokesman Yonatan Tesfaye said he was encouraged by the “huge” support the party received in the May vote. Now it wants “dialogue with the government on reforming election and press laws in order to create a fairer environment”. If that doesn’t work, “it will be up to people to come out and confront repression,” he said. There are tentative signs that some ruling officials recognise a need for change: privately, individuals fret at the lopsided results produced by the party’s ruthless efficiency and the first-past-the-post system. Getachew Reda, a special adviser to Desalegn, said the overwhelming victory is natural given the EPRDF’s achievements and protest votes against opponents who were “there for the noise and blood of it”, rather than as serious contenders. The most significant challenge to the EPRDF’s domination came in a 2005 vote, when an opposition coalition made significant gains in urban areas. The results were disputed, and thousands of people took to the streets to protest. Security forces killed 193 people and opposition leaders were imprisoned. Seven policemen were also killed. The government said the opposition was trying to use violence to force an unconstitutional change. It enacted laws to restrict dissent and began to solicit investment for projects such as roads, universities, low-cost apartments, hydropower dams and sugar factories. Since then, electoral politics has presented a dilemma for the opposition, which participates in a process it calls undemocratic. Some observers say the opposition must work within this narrow political space to build from the grassroots, aiming to make gains first in local elections in 2017. In addition to the federal parliament, the EPRDF holds almost all other elected positions in the country. Beyene Petros from the Medrek coalition, the main opposition party, disagrees, arguing that peaceful resistance is necessary to “push this group to the negotiating table on levelling the electoral landscape”. The idea of urban disobedience forcing change is anathema to the EPRDF, which styles itself as the party of the rural masses. Addis Ababa University lecturer Nahusenay Belay, who supports the EPRDF, points to what he identifies as the failures of the Arab spring, where elites “mobilised primarily against the incumbent regime rather than for a common set of values or policies”, to warn against any similar attempts in Ethiopia. “The suggestion for every political actor is therefore to stick to the hard but the possible and relevant political path available, ie the formal democratic way,” he wrote in an essay in May. Some opponents agree that new leaders won’t change systemic problems. What is needed is a shift to more consensual politics that accommodates Ethiopia’s diverse viewpoints, said the critic on social media, who did not give his name.Asrat, the entrepreneur, is pessimistic about the chances of change or of increased political engagement, given the EPRDF’s entrenched dominance. Could social media activists like him ramp up the pressure? “I think my own fate would be like [that of] Zone 9, and that scares me a lot,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/11/ethiopia-crackdown-dissent-drives-opposition-push-freedom-first,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/11/ethiopia-crackdown-dissent-drives-opposition-push-freedom-first
2015-06-11T06:00:03Z,global-development,Global development,Nepal earthquakes: rebuilding trust and bridging social divides is key to recovery | Elizabeth Drew,"Most people know Nepal as the country of Everest, Buddha’s birthplace, and now the site of devastating earthquakes that killed more than 8,700 people in April and May. Few trekkers, backpackers or outside observers know much about an earlier disaster: the 10-year conflict that cost more than 14,000 lives. The war, fought largely in the countryside between Maoist insurgents and the then monarchic state, ended in 2006. The peace deal, together with a popular uprising against direct rule by the king, triggered a political sea-change in Nepal. The once-Hindu kingdom was declared a federal, democratic, secular republic and an ambitious reform agenda was set out. Since then, political progress has come in fits and starts: a progressive interim constitution was signed, peaceful elections were held, and combatants were demobilised. The biggest achievement is that Nepal has not slid back into war. This is no mean feat, and research shows that civil wars are highly likely to recur. But there is a need for caution against complacency.
Huge swaths of the population are still excluded from political decision-making, services and economic opportunity. The Nepalese population is divided into a caste system, according to Hindu beliefs and practices. Certain castes are identified as higher, and caste discrimination has permeated social and cultural norms, even though the caste system was outlawed in 1962. High-caste older men still run the country, and thousands of younger men become migrant workers because economic opportunities are so limited at home. Politics in this very patriarchal society is also still organised around patronage, and corruption is a serious issue. These socio-political faultlines overlay the tectonic ones. Nepal had been anticipating a big earthquake for around 50 years. Preparedness was under way, but the scale of the task was overwhelming. Poverty and rapid urbanisation during and since the war have meant that houses are generally built rapidly and cheaply, with little heed paid to building codes. Postwar political wrangling has caused disaster preparedness to suffer from partisanship and stalled decision-making. For example, a disaster management act has been in the works for nearly eight years. The earthquake response has sharpened political divides and produced widely divergent narratives. Many people laud citizen mobilisation in the face of perceived state sclerosis. Individuals and groups galvanised their own networks to fundraise, organise and deliver practical help to people, especially in remote areas. This whirlwind of activity pulled in activists, businesspeople, technology leaders and the diaspora. Rapid people-to-people support helped fill an initial gap left by delays to operations by the government and international aid agencies. Many Nepalese have lambasted their government, citing lethargy, bureaucracy, poor coordination and politicisation. They point to relief being held up at customs; help going to friends and cronies of local government officials; and weak leadership.
Others defend the state. A wave of nationalism has swept up Nepalese fed up with perceived international condescension towards an elected government they believe is doing its best in the face of difficult challenges. They say health workers, police and soliders have tirelessly provided rescue and relief services, while local bureaucrats left with limited resources have struggled to respond to desperate people. There are also those who criticise the international humanitarian response. Donors have delivered only a quarter of the funds they pledged. Aid agencies have been slow to mobilise and coordinate. Support has followed paths of least resistance, with remote and marginalised communities left out – again. Critics say international “experts” displace local capacity and inadvertently worsen community tensions. Helping 8 million people scattered across mountainous terrain is incredibly difficult. But, even given the challenges, the response to Nepal’s earthquakes has not been optimal, partly because of a lack of trust based on social divisions rooted in ethnicity, caste, gender, and religion. Recovery in Nepal will take a long time. But although the task is daunting, it offers opportunities. Aid agencies can engage civil society – youth groups, women’s groups, teachers, activists, lawyers, community leaders – in monitoring the local government’s distribution of relief and management of recovery programmes. The government can engage people directly by running social audits and public hearings to explain how and why resources are being allocated. This could foster citizen checks on local leaders for greater accountability. It could also boost people’s faith in local government officials. The challenges of meeting the need for legitimate local representatives to guide community reconstruction and rehabilitation processes may also bring pressure for local elections, which – due to war and political transition – have been pending for 18 years. Recovery initiatives should also bridge social divides and build cohesion. Poor and excluded people should be empowered with new skills to lead reconstruction. The collective experience of trauma, civic ingenuity and Nepal’s wish to “build back better” could be harnessed to deliver economic, political and social renewal. This would require vision and integrity on the part of political leaders, international donor support to civic leaders and peacebuilders, and the concerted engagement of the private sector to invest in socially responsible businesses. From the depths of despair could come new purpose. Actions over the coming months, by political leaders, international agencies and civil society, will determine whether the country’s social and political faultlines widen, or narrow.

2015-06-10T23:01:06Z,global-development,Global development,DfID under fire from watchdog for 'lack of clear strategy' with aid agencies,"Britain’s Department for International Development (DfID) lacks a clear strategy for engaging with multilateral aid agencies and is not doing enough to let taxpayers know why it spends billions of pounds through the likes of the World Bank, the EU and the UN, the aid watchdog has warned. According to a report from the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (Icai), published on Thursday, DfID spent nearly two-thirds of its budget (£6.32bn) through multilateral agencies between 2013 and 2014. Although the department works with 47 multilateral agencies and has used its “significant influence” to promote reform and help them focus on cost effectiveness, Icai says it needs to do much more. It acknowledges DfID’s push for greater transparency and accountability among multilaterals, but says the department needs to come up with a comprehensive, global strategy and dedicate a greater number of senior staff to managing its relationships with them. “We are concerned that DfID lacks a clear strategy for overall engagement with multilaterals,” said Graham Ward, Icai chief commissioner. “A strategy for engaging with the system as a whole would help guide the UK’s resource allocation and prioritise areas for further reform.”
While recognising that the department has to rely heavily on multilaterals to achieve results and work in difficult areas – as well as to reach its target of spending 0.7% of Britain’s gross national income on overseas aid – Icai says DfID should be more strategic, and more open about the support it gives. In a nod to the controversy that surrounded the previous coalition government’s decision to enshrine the 0.7% commitment in law, Icai says DfID needs to remake its case for working with multilaterals “in an environment that is both critical of the aid agenda and largely distrustful of big global bureaucracies”. It adds: “As the next wave of deficit reduction bites and the political controversy raises new questions as to the impact and value for money of aid expenditure, DfID can expect to face more pressure around its budget.” On the basis of its findings, Icai has awarded DfID a green-amber rating for the impact of its multilateral work, which means that while the programme was performing relatively well overall, improvements needed to be made. In a separate report, also published on Thursday, the watchdog looked at DfID’s efforts to ensure that the £32.8bn of aid it has spent since 2011 has had a long-term and transformative impact. Icai says that while DfID has recognised the importance of demonstrating its results as the aid budget has expanded rapidly, its enthusiasm to show value for money and accountability has “tended to prioritise short-term economy and efficiency over long-term, sustainable impact”.
It also concludes that some of DfID’s tools and processes for measuring results have had the unintended effect of focusing attention on the quantity of results over their quality. “The key message of this report is that it is time to take the results agenda to the next level – to ensure that it focuses not just on the cost-efficient delivery of UK aid but also on achieving genuine and lasting impact for the world’s poor,” it says. Noting that 21 of DfID’s 28 priority countries are affected by conflict or political instability, Icai advises the department to be more modest in its objectives and give more attention “to long-term pathways out of fragility and how to get the right balance of risk and return across the portfolio”. Diana Good, lead commissioner on the report, said DfID had to make sure that it listened to and consulted the people it was trying to help. “If programming were firmly anchored in involving, as much as possible, beneficiaries right the way through the life of programming – from design, through implementation, monitoring, follow-up and evaluation – a great deal of the other issues would flow from that,” she said. “It seems an obvious statement to say that an aid agency should have a clear line of sight at all times through to the people they exist to serve … but it is something that – and this is not peculiar to DfID – agencies and donors can lose sight of.” DfID rejected the suggestion that it did not have a clear strategy on working with multilateral agencies, saying its 2011 multilateral aid review had assessed fully the strengths and weaknesses of its partners – and had been adopted by other countries such as Australia. “The next review will go even further, pushing these organisations to follow our lead and be even more transparent,” a spokeswoman said. She insisted that the department was absolutely right to focus on achieving results and value for taxpayers’ money. “It would be a step backwards to stop doing this and taxpayers rightly expect to see results on the ground,” she said. “It is simply wrong to say we have a short-term agenda. Our programmes build upon each other so a funding cycle should not be confused with our level of engagement and long term commitment in the countries where we work.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/11/dfid-under-fire-watchdog-lack-strategy-multilateral-aid-agencies,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/11/dfid-under-fire-watchdog-lack-strategy-multilateral-aid-agencies
2015-06-10T11:15:24Z,global-development,Global development,Hundreds of lone Burundian children flee to Rwanda,"Jean-Pierre*, whose feet swing freely above the ground as he sits on a plastic chair, looks more like a young boy in his Lego T-shirt than a teenager. Two months ago, the 15-year-old left his parents and four siblings in their home province of Muyinga, in northern Burundi, and walked alone to neighbouring Rwanda. “When I heard that they had started to kill people, I decided to leave,” Jean-Pierre said, referring to the Imbonerakure, the feared youth wing of Burundi’s ruling CNDD-FDD party. “I was afraid that I could be killed.”
Aid agencies say the number of unaccompanied minors, like Jean-Pierre, among refugees arriving in Rwanda is uncharacteristically high, putting an additional strain on the humanitarian response. Of more than 30,000 Burundians who have fled the worst violence since the end of the civil war, in 2005, and crossed into Rwanda, around 1,200 were registered as children unaccompanied or separated from their parents, the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said. President Pierre Nkurunziza’s decision in April to seek a third term in office, despite a constitutional two-term limit, sparked street protests in the capital Bujumbura, and a short-lived coup. In rural areas, people said the Imbonerakure threatened those perceived to oppose the authorities, prompting many to flee. Nearly 97,000 people have left Burundi since the beginning of April, a figure that is expected to increase as the country teeters towards controversial elections. Presidential polls were due to be held on 26 June but were postponed after the protests, in which at least 20 people were killed. In the Mahama refugee camp in eastern Rwanda, where neatly arranged tents cling to the hillsides, 970 under-18s have arrived without their parents or obvious guardians. More than 600 are teenage boys like Jean-Pierre. “There are more boys, reflecting a feeling that they were more at risk in Burundi,” explained Elsa Bousquet, a UNHCR child protection officer. “I knew some children who were beaten [by the Imbonerakure]; as the eldest child in the family I had to go,” said Jean-Pierre, who set off with just 2,000 Burundian francs – a little over a dollar – given to him by his grandmother.
With over 24,000 inhabitants, Mahama hosts the majority of Burundians who have fled to Rwanda. Thousands more have crossed into Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The camp used to receive up to 1,200 people per day, but that number has fallen to between 30 and 40. The explanations for why so many unaccompanied minors are on the move vary. Fear is key. Many arrivals mention the Imbonerakure militias, who have been accused of using violence against opposition supporters – charges that the government dismisses as opposition propaganda. Women and children often seek safety while men stay behind to guard property; sometimes parents simply don’t have the means to travel themselves and so send their children away on their own. Some people in Mahama said the Imbonerakure targets young men and boys, while others said families fear to move together because they think large groups will be stopped by officials in Burundi or at the border. Boys may also outnumber girls because it is seen to be less risky for them to travel. Aid agencies are working to accommodate the large numbers of unaccompanied children. “We immediately try hard to find family links with others in the camp so that the children can remain in a family environment,” said Dr Saber Azam, UNHCR’s representative in Rwanda. “Of the 700 unaccompanied or separated children who have so far been interviewed across the country for tracing purposes, over 300 have found family links,” he said, adding that the UN also tries to set up foster care arrangements for children.
Some of the children do not know how to prepare food, or are looking after younger siblings. Others have had their possessions stolen on the way. For Audriene*, 13, and her brother Beaudieu*, 11, the long journey to Mahama ended with a joyful reunion. In March, their father Zachary told them to leave their home in northern Burundi and to “keep their heads down”. He had twice been badly beaten by men he says belonged to the Imbonerakure. The children said they found work as house-helps in Rwanda’s rural areas until eventually reaching the camp in late April. “But we were living in very difficult conditions and missing our parents,” said Audriene. She and her brother were among the first arrivals in Mahama, having been transferred from another refugee centre six weeks ago. A few days later the rest of the family arrived, having fled Burundi weeks after their two eldest children. But while Audriene and Beaudieu were relieved to be reunited with their family, for their father the relief was tempered by a sense of loss. “I had joined a cooperative,” said Zachary. “We had received some loans to build a small business, to buy some livestock. “We left it all behind – everything. And with everything that has happened, I just can’t imagine how we can go back.” *Some names have been changed",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/10/hundreds-lone-children-flee-burundi-rwanda,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/10/hundreds-lone-children-flee-burundi-rwanda
2015-06-10T08:00:02Z,global-development,Global development,Justine Greening: The days of ignoring poverty because it's far away are over,"The Ebola outbreak in west Africa, the Mediterranean migrant crisis and the enduring terror threat have shown prosperous countries that “the days of being able to simply ignore poverty around the other side of the world are over”, according to the international development secretary, Justine Greening. Greening, who was reappointed following May’s general election, said the international community needs to work harder to “level up” the world by investing more in development, opportunity and equality. “We won’t really tackle some of those issues – whether it’s health security risks; broader terrorist security risks; whether it’s the migration that we’re seeing happen – unless we tackle root causes and the solution to all of that is to see development happening so that countries can take responsibility for their own security successfully,” she told the Guardian.
Greening said that while globalisation and technological advances had shrunk the world, they had also served to emphasise its vast economic gulfs. “Back in the 1980s when the Ethiopia famine hit, we could see people starving and we were shocked by it,” she said. “But those people had no idea what the rest of the world was like – the prosperity and the lives that other people led. They do now and they’re asking themselves why shouldn’t they have the same opportunities and chances? They think about their children and ask, ‘Well, where do I want my children to be born?’” However, Greening also warned that development was about more than aid and trade, saying there could be no meaningful progress in any country unless the rights and prospects of women and girls were protected and improved. She described the focus of the Department for International Development (DfID) on women and girls as “relentless” and said she was determined to continue the department’s work on tackling female genital mutilation (FGM) and child marriage over the next parliament – and in the negotiations over the sustainable development goals, which will replace the millennium development goals later this year. “I want us to dial up that work; I want us to see a new step-change in it to do even more, so that we can get that next strategic step of seeing the sustainable development goals having a standalone goal on gender that really makes a difference for women and girls around the world; that specifically tackles things like child marriage and violence against women,” she said. Greening said last year’s girl summit – and the passing of a bill compelling the government to consider the impact of its overseas aid spending on reducing gender inequality – were clear proof of the Conservatives’ commitment to women and girls.
“I don’t think any country can sustainably develop if half the population are locked out,” she said. “You only have to look at Britain: would Britain be a more successful place if women weren’t in the workplace? No. it’s absolutely critical that women play their role in any country’s development – whether it’s Britain, Zambia or Nepal – if that country’s going to be successful.” She pointed to India, where, she said, the fastest-growing states were those in which women were most likely to be economically active. “Empowering women – whether it’s in terms of their having a voice in their community, having the choice to get an education or into a job, or having control over when they get married and how many children they have – all of that is absolutely vital for women’s rights but it’s also critical for successful development in the long term,” she said. “There are people – there are countries – that would turn the clock back on women’s rights unless we continue winning this battle. My personal view is that if you’re not winning the battle in women’s rights, you’re losing it de facto, because there are those that will just nibble away to take things back.” Greening is equally proud of parliament’s decision to enshrine in law the commitment to spend 0.7% of Britain’s gross national income on aid to poorer nations.
“The 0.7% commitment is a commitment that governments have had for years – for decades – and yet it was the coalition government I was part of that actually turned that promise into a reality and legislated for it as we in the Conservative party had promised in our manifesto,” she said. Asked whether the Tories could really claim credit for the 0.7% law when it had also been promised in the Labour and Liberal Democrat manifestos – and only succeeded thanks to a backbench Lib Dem bill and heavy Labour turnout for the crucial vote – Greening replied: “Actually, it was MPs from all parties, and in the end, I’m still left looking at the 13 years before that [coalition] government and whether during the heyday of Gordon Brown’s boom years – which were unsustainable, it turned out – that opportunity was taken to deliver 0.7% then. And the answer is no.” She said the coalition deserved recognition for hitting the 45-year old UN target during a time of severe economic hardship and said she hoped other developed countries would now join the UK, Luxembourg, Sweden and Denmark in achieving the goal. None of the other major EU countries – Germany, France, Italy and Spain – was close to reaching it last year. Although DfID has enjoyed a ringfenced budget at a time of deep cuts across Whitehall – allowing it to spend £11.4bn on aid last year – it has been criticised for failing to tackle corruption and for concentrating on headline-grabbing humanitarian aid operations rather than long-term development programmes. Greening acknowledged that corruption was a valid concern in some countries, but insisted that DfID operated a “total zero-tolerance” approach and deliberately entrusted taxpayers’ money to tried-and-tested partners including UN agencies and international NGOs such as the Red Cross and Save the Children. “Within the department, I’ve not only increased our internal audit department, I’ve also put more funding against the team that looks at counter-fraud and whistleblowing,” she said. “So across the board, we have a zero-tolerance approach that has fed through into how we structure and operate and monitor our programmes – and I make no apology for spending money on monitoring and evaluation to make sure that every penny is not only getting through to where we want it to but is achieving the results that it’s meant to as well.”
Greening conceded that it was always difficult to balance long-term development against the need to respond quickly – and generously – to humanitarian emergencies such as the Ebola outbreak and the earthquake in Nepal. But she said it did not necessarily have to be one or the other, pointing to the investments DfID had made in helping Nepal improve its disaster resilience programmes, including funding the construction of a humanitarian staging area that sped up the distribution of supplies in the immediate aftermath of the quake. Greening said the Ebola crisis had highlighted the need to invest in strengthening health systems in a number of African countries to help safeguard them from future epidemics. “I think it’s about framing it not in either/or,” she said. “But, at the end of the day, like every department, I’ve got to find that budget and I’ve got to work within that and try to strike the right balance between dealing with these quite short-term crises but also not losing the momentum that we’ve got on the underlying development programmes that are going on.” She counselled against the tendency to view humanitarian and operations and development ones as two separate processes. Look at the conflict in Syria, she said, which has driven millions of people to flee to neighbouring countries where they live in host communities and refugee camps and ponder their children’s futures. “That’s why investing in education is so important, because we should not just expect those children to be able to go back to Syria and go back to [the] classroom,” she said. “Obviously, that’s not going to happen. One of the biggest challenges that we face as a development and humanitarian community is how to work out how you deal with those medium-term crises that are ongoing, not fixed overnight.”
Greening is adamant that DfID has an increasingly important role to play in international affairs – as evidenced by her seat on the national security council. “We do need to understand that development is part of the solution to a lot of the security issues that we face, whether it’s terrorism and the work we have done in Afghanistan, or whether it’s Ebola and the clear health security risk that that posed to the UK – and indeed to millions of people living in Africa who could quite possibly have been affected if we hadn’t stepped up to the plate.” On the migrant issue, she acknowledged that there was a big debate around appropriate short-term measures to deal with “what is a very, very complex situation”. “But there is no doubt that the work that we’re doing on development is ultimately how you tackle some of the root causes of why those people are doing something that so many people in Britain never think of doing, which is leaving their homes, their family, everything, risking their lives – knowing that they are risking their lives – to try to get to somewhere better, somewhere that’s safe.” Greening holds up the swelling of DfID’s ministerial ranks as further evidence of the department’s relevance. Following the election, Grant Shapps was sacked as Tory party chairman and moved to DfID in the lesser role of minister of state. Less than a month before the election, Shapps had been accused of editing the Wikipedia entries of his Conservative rivals – including Greening. He denied the allegations, labelling them “untrue from start to finish”. Asked what Shapps would bring to DfID, Greening described him as “a fantastic communicator”, adding: “What it means is that we have a bigger team: we now have two ministers of state, we have a parliamentary undersecretary and I think that shows the importance as a government that we place on international development now.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/10/justine-greening-interview-poverty-dfid-development-health-migration-empowering-women,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/10/justine-greening-interview-poverty-dfid-development-health-migration-empowering-women
2015-06-10T04:00:09Z,global-development,Global development,India's domestic workers need a break | Lauren Wilks,"Bespangled, sari-clad women thrust their hips and jab their hands in the air to the Hindi pop that blasts from nearby speakers. Mid-afternoon sun catches their faces as they laugh and dare each other to copy increasingly risqué moves. It is the annual social gathering for female domestic workers in Kolkata – organised by Parichiti, a local NGO – and I am crouched down next to Anjali, one of the handful of women enjoying the festivities.
Anjali lives beyond the urban sprawl, in a village in the district of South 24 Parganas. She commutes into the city each day, cramming herself into the packed local trains that rattle back and forth between Kolkata and its rural outposts, reaching the suburban neighbourhood where she works as a cook after an uncomfortable 35 minutes. I was surprised to see Anjali at the gathering. On my last visit to her village, she had confided that she had recently undergone surgery for breast cancer, using up her monthly holiday entitlement to attend check-ups at the hospital. Like most other domestic workers in Kolkata, Anjali works seven days a week, with only three days off a month and no sick leave. Understandably, she had been torn about whether to come to the gathering, knowing that if she did she would have to forfeit holiday from the following month. What if one day she was particularly unwell, or if her daughter was sick and she could not go to work? Her wages could be docked or, worse, she could be fired. I ask her how she manages day after day, in the heat and in the crowds on the train. “It is extremely difficult,” she sighs wearily. “After I come home, I just lie down under the fan. I don’t even have the energy to have a bath or wash my clothes.” There are more than 4 million men and women working in or for private households across India, as cooks, cleaners, drivers, gardeners and caregivers, without the basic protections and entitlements afforded to workers in other sectors.
Employment laws do not apply to domestic workers and, while there has been a shift away from traditional “live-in” forms of domestic service (where workers reside with employers, often working around the clock) – resulting in increased bargaining power for some workers – paternalism continues to shape employer-employee relations. On 18 March this year, India decided not to ratify the International Labour Organisation’s Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No 189) – the first international labour standard laying down basic protections for domestic workers, such as the right to a written contract and minimum wage, limited working hours, and paid annual leave in accordance with national laws and regulations. A national policy on domestic workers is under consideration, but, for now, the responsibility for regulating domestic work and improving conditions for workers lies with state governments – only 10 of which have so far attempted to address the issue. According to Anchita Ghatak – one of the founders of Parichiti – the importance of down time for the incredibly busy women she works with is grossly under-appreciated, both in the households where they work and in their own communities. “The idea of women having time for themselves is not popular,” says Ghatak. “And the poorer you are, the harder it is to get time away from your responsibilities – be it at home or work.” The annual social gathering organised by Parichiti provides a rare opportunity for women like Anjali to socialise and relax away from the stresses and demands of daily life.
Because Kolkata’s domestic workers are scattered, invisible and, in many ways, far from achieving the level of organising that other informal workers have managed, attending such events also enables women to find out about government schemes and initiatives, and constitutes an important first step towards worker mobilisation. However, to attend, women must negotiate time off, using up one of the three or four days of holiday that are given to them by employers each month. With such little time off and no additional sick leave, using holidays to attend social gatherings is a risky option – especially for those with health problems and family members to care for. Meandering back to the main road that evening, exhausted, I wondered what Anjali would still have to do tonight, what time she would get up again tomorrow, and how tired she would be. The day had provided some much-needed respite for women whose daily struggle for survival too often overshadows their need to rest. But as long as their labour remains undervalued and unregulated, the wait for a better future continues.

2015-06-09T12:37:46Z,global-development,Global development,"The future of anti-poverty activism, women's $3tn healthcare contribution, and a lack of leadership on aid funding","The G7 summit has drawn to a close, and as world leaders depart Germany so too do the many anti-poverty campaigners who protested at the summit. But is the public movement to end poverty and inequality as effective as it used to be? Researcher Alex Evans argues that development activism is in decline and anti-poverty campaigners have much to learn from climate change activism, which has attracted a new generation of supporters. We asked readers who protested at the G7 to share their photos; here are some of the best. A study has attempted to place a dollar figure on women’s contribution to global healthcare. A Lancet report found women contribute around $3tn to healthcare, but almost half of it is unpaid and unrecognised. The unpaid work is mostly domestic care for family members, which is only officially acknowledged and compensated in a small number of countries, such as the UK, Turkey and Costa Rica.

But as Jonathan Glennie argues, the conference is missing the leadership required to make funding commitments possible. Instead, Glennie says, “the conference is in danger of not being remembered at all, as lower-level ministers and bureaucrats argue the toss over the jargon, with no era-defining clarion calls to speak of, and few timetables for action”. As part of our review of the millennium development goals, two experts shared their views on the state of progress on reducing child and maternal mortality. The World Health Organisation’s Dr Flavia Bustreo argued that tackling inequality should be the highest priority when addressing preventable deaths in childhood, while Amref Health Africa’s Dr Joachim Osur called for leaders to keep their promises on healthcare funding in order to prevent mothers dying in childbirth.

2015-06-09T11:49:26Z,global-development,Global development,Bangladesh urged to combat ‘epidemic of child marriage’,"Child marriage in Bangladesh is an epidemic and requires the government to act on its promises to tackle the problem, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). Bangladesh has the fourth highest rate of child marriage in the world, behind Niger, Central African Republic and Chad. The UN children’s agency, Unicef, estimates that in 2011, of women aged between 20 and 24, 65% were married before the age of 18, and 29% before they turned 15. In its 134-page report, Marry Before Your House Is Swept Away, published on Tuesday, HRW welcomed the government’s commitment to end child marriage, but said little action had followed pledges to end the practice made by the prime minister last year. It added that attempts to change the law on child marriage threatened to make the situation worse.
The prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, promised to end child marriage of under-15s by 2021 and reduce by more than one-third the number of girls married between the ages of 15 and 18, with the ultimate goal of eliminating the practice by 2041. The legal age of marriage in Bangladesh is 18 for women and 21 for men. Attempts to revise the Child Marriage Restraint Act (CMRA) have sparked concern among civil society groups. While welcoming tougher penalties for those who perform or allow child marriage, draft proposals issued last year include lowering the age of marriage for women to 16 and men to 18. Plan International Bangladesh, Save the Children and HRW are among the groups that have called on the government to keep the minimum age of marriage for girls at 18. Last year, former UN secretary general and chairman of the Elders group of global leaders, Kofi Annan, wrote to Hasina urging her not to go ahead with the planned revisions. For its report, HRW interviewed 114 people, including 59 girls and young women who were married before they were 18 in the past five years. The youngest married girl interviewed was 10 years old. Parents and local officials also took part in the research, which was conducted in five districts between September and November last year.
Poverty was given as the main reason girls were married off at a young age, a situation compounded by the country’s vulnerability to natural disasters, said HRW. Girls are often seen as a financial burden on their families until they are married and live with their husbands, and are more likely than boys to be pulled out of school when money is tight, said the report. “We were very poor. Sometimes we would eat every two or three days,” 15-year-old Lucky C told researchers. “Even though they [parents] really wanted all three of their daughters to study, it wasn’t possible – so they got me married.” Her older sisters married at 11 and 12. Shahana C, who was married at 14, told HRW: “My parents couldn’t feed me so they decided to get me married, so I had no choice.” “Child marriage is an epidemic in Bangladesh, and only worsens with natural disasters,” said Heather Barr, senior researcher on women’s rights. “The Bangladesh government has said some of the right things, but its proposal to lower the age of marriage for girls sends the opposite message. The government should act before another generation of girls is lost.”
HRW is calling on the Bangladeshi government to set a minimum age for marriage for both girls and boys at 18, to publish its action plan to end child marriage, and to better support married children, or adults who were married as children. It also calls on the government to launch a national awareness campaign against child marriage, introduce compulsory marriage registration for all religions, improve efforts to expand birth registration and investigate system abuses, and tackle the drivers of child marriage by, for example, minimising school costs. The organisation has not received a response from the government to its report. In November last year, the UN passed a resolution urging all countries to enact and enforce laws to prevent child, early and forced marriage. A target to eliminate child marriage is expected to be included in the next set of sustainable development goals, which are due to be adopted in September.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/09/bangladesh-urged-combat-epidemic-child-marriage,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/09/bangladesh-urged-combat-epidemic-child-marriage
2015-06-09T10:26:54Z,global-development,Global development,Child marriage: we must urge action to stop girls' initiation rites | Persilia Muianga,"At a recent international conference in the Moroccan city of Casablanca, a light was shed on to the practice of initiation ceremonies in which girls as young as eight are coerced to attend customary rites that “teach” them to please a man in bed as part of the preparation for womanhood. Common in parts of southern Africa, especially in Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia, these ceremonies are held to prepare girls for married life. According to Girls Not Brides – a global partnership of more than 450 civil society organisations committed to ending child marriage – up to 142 million children will be married by the end of the decade if there is no intervention in some of the archaic customs of communities across the world. My own country, Mozambique, has the 10th highest child marriage rate in the world – with 48% of girls married before they are 18 – and Zambia has the 15th highest – at 42%. For me, as a child protection worker in this field for nearly a decade, the Casablanca conference was key in highlighting the issue of child marriage. It was an opportunity to discuss some of the challenges and to urge authorities to put a stop to customs that infringe the rights and freedoms of children – in particular, young girls. Contrary to recent reports in sections of the global media, these initiation ceremonies are not “forced sex camps”.
However, there is no doubt that some communities continue to carry out these “rites of passage” events, which have been banned by authorities. In Mozambique, such ceremonies involve female elders, “matrons”, who educate girls as young as nine on how to satisfy their husbands sexually. Perhaps most disturbingly, the girls are also subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM) in the form of labia minor lengthening and clitoral dilation – both of which are believed to enhance male pleasure. In the Cabo Delgado region of northern Mozambique, this practice is called “Ithuna” , which means deflowering of the smaller labia. It involves the application of castor oil on to the genital area while the girls’ labia are forcibly stretched up to 10cm. In the same process, ash is also used in order to dilate the clitoris. As shocking as it might seem, these ceremonies are very popular in the communities where they are held. Two months ago, I led an awareness workshop with parents in the town of Nchancha where one father told me how the ceremonies – which typically last up to seven days – teach young girls about personal hygiene, sex within marriage, as well as moral guidance and family values. “I would save my whole life to have my children attending initiation ceremonies because it’s important they learn what their ancestors knew, they must be prepared for married life,” he said. As development professionals on the ground, we know that initiation rites lead to early and forced marriages. World Vision works closely with local communities and faith leaders, to understand the reasons behind child marriage; and to assess the impact of initiation rites on girls’ education. We know from our work with teachers in the Muecate district that school drop-out rates increase significantly from 7th to 8th grade. We estimate that more than 40% of 15- to 19-year-old girls are becoming wives and mothers as they leave education for good around this time.
Not all girls are forced to leave school after initiation, but when you consider that 18% of children are married before the age of 15, and more than 50% are married before 18, you can see how widespread early marriage is. These figures, coupled with the fact that more than one in three Mozambican girls are mothers, show the scope of the challenge we face. As one teacher told me: “Most young girls don’t complete education because once they attend these ceremonies they become adults and they don’t care about school any more. Parents save money to pay for these ceremonies, but they complain about investing in their children’s education.” We seek to combat the negative aspects of initiation rites in three ways: raising community awareness through training of community leaders, offering technical assistance to government institutions; and providing economic support for girls at risk or who are already married. It’s no secret that Mozambique struggles with high levels of poverty and illiteracy, but we are determined to improve the lives of girls. We believe girls deserve to have the freedom to choose whom they marry and when they have babies. They need to be treated with respect and the government must increase efforts to make that a reality.

2015-06-09T06:00:06Z,global-development,Global development,Diaspora tax for Eritreans living in UK investigated by Metropolitan police,"The Metropolitan police are examining allegations that the Eritrean embassy in London is illegally using a controversial diaspora tax to “punish and control” Eritreans living in the UK, it has emerged. The Eritrean government has been criticised repeatedly over its use of the 2% recovery and reconstruction (RRT) tax it levies on the earnings of Eritreans abroad. In December 2011, a UN security council resolution (pdf) called on Eritrea to “cease using extortion, threats of violence, fraud and other illicit means to collect taxes outside of Eritrea from its nationals or other individuals of Eritrean descent”.
The same resolution accused Eritrea of using the tax to destabilise the Horn of Africa, saying some of the revenues were funding armed opposition groups in the region, including the militant group al-Shabaab. Accusations that Eritrea was supporting the Somali group as a means of attacking its long-standing enemy, Ethiopia, had prompted the security council to impose an arms embargo on the country in 2009. Concerns that the Eritrean embassy in London is using coercion or illicit means to collect the tax – such as refusing diaspora members basic consular services if they fail to pay it – have led the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to raise the matter with the Eritrean authorities on at least four occasions over the past four years. In May 2011, the FCO notified the Eritrean ambassador that aspects of the diaspora tax may be unlawful and in breach of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, adding: “The ambassador was told that, until it was demonstrated otherwise, the embassy should suspend, immediately and in full, all activities relating to the collection of the tax.” The Eritrean embassy says it no longer collects the tax in London. But UK-based Eritreans claim the tax is still being raised illegally – though they say the London embassy now requires it to be paid on their behalf in the Eritrean capital, Asmara. One Eritrean attempting to conclude his affairs in the country last year was told by the embassy that he needed to pay £350 in Eritrea, and that nothing would be settled without full payment of the fee, which included a £200 charge for the Eritrean military. In March, a group of Eritreans reported the matter to the police and sent a dossier of allegations to the Met commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe.
Although Scotland Yard has not launched a formal investigation, officers from the Met’s parliamentary and diplomatic protection department are understood to be examining the dossier. “The Metropolitan police service have been contacted by members of the Eritrean community regarding the alleged illegal extraction of taxes by their embassy,” said a Met spokesman. “Officers are assessing the information provided to them to establish whether any offence has been committed.” The Foreign Office also said it was aware “of allegations over the use of harassment to collect revenue from members of the Eritrean diaspora in the UK”. A spokeswoman said that while the FCO did not believe the collection of taxes was illegal, “use of harassment and blackmail could be and we encouraged diaspora members with allegations of this kind to raise their concerns with the police”. Noel Joseph, a UK-based Eritrean human rights activist, said the government in Asmara was using the tax to hold the diaspora to ransom. “Basically, anything you need from the state – if you want to write a will or get a power-of-attorney for your family or to send parcels home or get a passport – you need a clearance document and you do not get the document without paying the 2% tax,” he said. “It’s punishing people and exerting control. The message is: no matter how far you’ve gone, we will always find a way of affecting your life.”
Joseph said the Eritrean government was now trying to head off international scrutiny of the tax by instructing members of the diaspora to pay it in Asmara. Calling on the UK and the international community to show “will and determination” in investigating the allegations, he added: “What the Eritrean government is doing is illegal – and they’re clearly flouting it – so they need to take drastic action. Eritrea needs to learn its lesson; it cannot just behave as it is. It’s against the law.” The Eritrean embassy described the allegations as “baseless, ongoing, deliberate and distorted” and said the Eritrean government had never used coercive methods or intimidation to collect the tax. “Although Eritrean tax evaders residing in the country are legally charged and convicted for their failure to comply with the taxation law, Eritreans residing abroad are not legally bound by this regulation,” it said in a statement. “Eritrean citizens that fail to pay the 2% RRT however, are subject to administrative measures such as the ‘denial of business licence, land entitlement and other services’. This does not include basic consular services. These measures are not considered ‘extortion, coercion or intimidation’ by international law.” A UN report published this week suggested that the Eritrean government’s systematic use of extrajudicial killing, torture, rape, indefinite national service and forced labour may amount to crimes against humanity. The 500-page investigation by the UN commission of inquiry on human rights in Eritrea catalogued a litany of human rights violations by the “totalitarian” regime of President Isaias Afwerki “on a scope and scale seldom witnessed elsewhere”. It also accused the government of using a programme of imprisonment, forced disappearance, surveillance and censorship to create a culture of permanent fear and crush all dissent.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/09/eritrea-diaspora-tax-uk-investigated-metropolitan-police,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/09/eritrea-diaspora-tax-uk-investigated-metropolitan-police
2015-06-08T12:30:12Z,global-development,Global development,People's Expo in Milan puts focus on farmers' rights not corporate concerns | Rosie Scammell,"A restored warehouse in Italy’s financial capital might seem an unlikely place for a recent meeting of more than 180 grassroots activists, gathering in Milan to challenge the way the international food market is managed. But the location of the People’s Expo forum last week had been carefully chosen to coincide with the city’s official Expo 2015, a world fair that gathers 140 countries together under a theme of “Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life”. The motto is emblazoned throughout the site of the six-month Expo 2015, an architectural extravaganza where visitors are invited to each nation’s pavilion to collect a stamp in their themepark-style passport. While the fair is likely to increase tourism to the participating countries and boost the profile of its sponsors, including Coca-Cola, critics argue that the multimillion-euro event will do little to tackle global hunger. Giosuè De Salvo, one of the organisers behind the People’s Expo, said the alternative event aimed to fill the gaps left by the official one. “It [Expo 2015] fails to promote the small food producers, the peasants, the fishermen; those who are the first investors in agriculture. They’re the principal actors in the work, but paradoxically they’re also those who suffer first from hunger and malnutrition,” De Salvo said. There was little sign of corporate chic at the alternative Expo, where delegates spent their time sharing ideas in working groups and listening to multilingual speeches about everything from biodiversity to free trade agreements. One of the participants was Elizabeth Mpofu, a Zimbabwean farmer and general coordinator of peasant movement La Via Campesina. Wearing a bright green neckerchief and cap to match, Mpofu spoke for around 200 million members who she said were underrepresented in current plans to manage agricultural trade. “Land is being grabbed away and the peasants are being left with no land to produce food,” she said. “They are introducing new farming technologies, neglecting the indigenous knowledge and farming systems which have been exercised by our ancestors for generations.” Her criticism was aimed principally at the creators of the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition, a G8 initiative launched in 2012 that has seen 10 African states give foreign corporations greater access to agriculture. In a report published last month, the UK’s Independent Commission for Aid Impact (Icai) warned that schemes such as the New Alliance “can serve as little more than a means of promotion for the companies involved and a chance to increase their influence in policy debates”. A Guardian analysis last year found that some companies planned to use the initiative for non-food crops, including cotton and rubber. La Via Campesina is concerned that farming on such an industrial scale will not only squeeze out local farmers, but threaten the environment. Mpofu said that seeds introduced under the New Alliance are GMOs [genetically modified organisms], which demand too much water and are over-reliant on fertilisers. “We have our own indigenous seeds which we think, if supported, will be able to feed the world,” she said.
Josette Combes, at the People’s Expo on behalf of Ripess Europe, says people in wealthy countries should be equally concerned about the current approach to agriculture. “In European countries, we think we are well fed but actually we are not. We are fed products that are completely artificially made, full of pesticides and which are very bad for our health,” she said. “The whole problem of agriculture is not only one for developing countries.” In producer countries, the negative impact of excluding small-scale farmers from decision-making is already starting to show, said Mpofu. She cited the displacement of farmers in Mozambique, a signatory of the New Alliance, and deforestation in Uganda for sugarcane plantations, as just two harmful consequences of a misplaced agenda. Deborah James, director of international programmes at thinktank the Center for Economic and Policy Research, said for decades wealthy countries have skewed the global marketplace to work in their favour. “Developing countries always wanted agriculture to be part of the global free trade system, because if the EU and US were to reduce their protections for their farmers and reduce their tariffs, the developing countries had a better comparative advantage,” she said. James pointed to India’s decision in 2013 to guarantee the right to food of its citizens, through a nationwide programme of subsidised goods, as one way countries can help both producers and consumers without signing corporate deals. But the wealthiest countries still hold a significant advantage, she said, owing to the World Trade Organisation’s (WTO) outdated rules. “What they’ve done is use a rubric that trade is an accelerator for development and growth, never going back to check whether trade is harming or promoting development.” A significant change to the system could come with the sustainable development goals (SDGs), a set of principles to be decided upon in September, aimed at determining UN member states’ actions between 2016 and 2030. One of the 17 proposed goals aims to “end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture”, but it generated little optimism in Milan. De Salvo dismissed the goals as being badly formed, because “states really struggle to think of the common good for humanity”. He and fellow activists at the People’s Expo have outlined their own set of proposals, including the suspension of trade agreements and the creation of a stable market that prioritises local traders. Mpofu predicted that the UN’s plans will fail without a marked shift in approach – “unless they come to the people, they support the peasants, they follow our ideas. Then, from there we can start seeing some changes.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/08/peoples-expo-milan-farmers-rights-corporate-concerns,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/08/peoples-expo-milan-farmers-rights-corporate-concerns
2015-06-08T11:34:06Z,global-development,Global development,"Eritrea human rights abuses may be crimes against humanity, says UN","The Eritrean government’s systematic use of extrajudicial killing, torture, rape, indefinite national service and forced labour may amount to crimes against humanity, according to an excoriating UN report. The 500-page investigation by the UN commission of inquiry on human rights in Eritrea catalogues a litany of human rights violations by the “totalitarian” regime of President Isaias Afwerki “on a scope and scale seldom witnessed elsewhere”. It also accuses the government of using a programme of imprisonment, forced disappearance, surveillance and censorship to create a culture of permanent fear and crush all dissent. The year-long study, which was carried out without the co-operation of the Eritrean government, is based on first-hand testimony gathered through 550 confidential interviews with witnesses in third countries and 160 written submissions.
The report finds gross human rights violations are widespread throughout the state apparatus, and identifies the main perpetrators as Afwerki, his office, the ruling and only party – the People’s Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ) – the Eritrean defence forces, the national security office, the police, and the ministries of defence, justice and information. It says that while the struggle for Eritrean independence from Ethiopia has gone down in history as a “major feat of a people’s fight for self-determination”, the fight has long since lapsed into relentless political self-interest and terror. The report says: “The commission finds that the current situation of human rights in Eritrea is the tragic product of an initial desire to protect and ensure the survival of the young state that very quickly degenerated into the use of totalitarian practices aimed at perpetuating the power of the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front and its successor, the People’s Front for Democracy and Justice.” The report says that state spying and surveillance are conducted to such a degree in the country that Eritreans live in constant fear of arbitrary arrest, detention, torture, disappearance or death. That culture has given rise to a poisonous climate of self-censorship and mistrust that permeates communities and families. “Information gathered through the pervasive control system is used in absolute arbitrariness to keep the population in a state of permanent anxiety,” it says. “It is not law that rules Eritreans – it is fear.” One witness told the commission: “When I am in Eritrea, I feel that I cannot even think because I am afraid that people can read my thoughts and I am scared.”
The report also notes the lengths to which the state will go to stop people fleeing. “Eritreans who attempt to leave the country are seen as traitors,” it says. “For a considerable period of time, the government has implemented a shoot-to-kill policy in border areas to prevent people from fleeing.” Equally feared is the government’s policy of conscription, which can leave young people trapped in indefinite national service. Some interviewees told the commission they had decided to flee the country after spending 17 years as conscripts. Conditions in military training camps – which lack adequate food, water, hygiene facilities, accommodation and medical facilities – are further compounded by abuse and ill-treatment of both men and women. “Sexual violence against women and girls is widespread and indeed notorious in military training camps,” says the report. “Furthermore, the enforced domestic service of women and girls who are also sexually abused in these camps amounts to sexual slavery. The commission considers that these violations of the rights of women and girls also amount to torture.” It accuses Eritrean officials of using beatings and rapes as a way to inflict severe physical and psychological pain, adding: “The purpose of these acts is to extract confessions and information, and to punish, intimidate and coerce detainees and conscripts.”
In addition to draconian limits on freedom of speech, media, movement and assembly, says the report, only four religious denominations – the Eritrean Orthodox church, the Catholic church, the Lutheran church and Sunni Islam – are tolerated. All other religious communities are restricted or attacked by the government. Its publication comes as the international community struggles to find a way to deal with the growing number of Eritreans who are fleeing their homeland and crossing the Mediterranean in search of a better life. Last November, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that the number of Eritreans seeking asylum in Europe had nearly tripled over the first 10 months of the year, rising from 13,000 over the same period in 2013 to nearly 37,000 in 2014. It found that after Syrians, Eritreans were the most common nationality to arrive on European shores, comprising 22% of all people entering Italy by boat last year. The report expresses little surprise at the exodus. “Faced with a seemingly hopeless situation they feel powerless to change, hundreds of thousands of Eritreans are fleeing their country,” it says. “In desperation, they resort to deadly escape routes through deserts and neighbouring war-torn countries and across dangerous seas in search of safety. They risk capture, torture and death at the hands of ruthless human traffickers.” It adds: “To ascribe their decision to leave solely to economic reasons is to ignore the dire situation of human rights in Eritrea and the very real suffering of its people. Eritreans are fleeing severe human rights violations in their country and are in need of international protection.” As well as making dozens of recommendations on how Eritrea can address its human rights violations, the report makes a blunt appeal to Afwerki for engagement with the international community and proper political and social reform. “I sincerely regret that in spite of repeated calls for access and for information related to the human rights situation, your government decided not to engage with us and not to provide any cooperation,” writes Mike Smith, the chair of the commission of inquiry. “We are still ready to engage with you and your government, should you wish to invite us to visit Eritrea and discuss the outcome of our investigation with you and your collaborators.” After collecting evidence from more than 700 testimonies, says Smith, the commission has concluded that “systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations have been and are being committed in Eritrea under the authority of your government”. He adds: “The commission also finds that the violations in the areas of extrajudicial executions, torture (including sexual torture), national service and forced labour may constitute crimes against humanity. The commission emphasises that its present findings should not be interpreted as a conclusion that international crimes have not occurred in other areas.” On Sunday, the British prime minister, David Cameron, said more needed to be done to stop people leaving their homelands and crossing the Mediterranean, adding that the UK could use its aid budget to try to stem the flow. Speaking as he arrived at the G7 summit in Germany and as a British warship picked up at least 500 migrants found in four boats off the coast of Libya, Cameron described Britain as a country with a conscience. “Britain is a country that doesn’t walk on by,” he said. “But we also need to do more to stop these people leaving their countries in the first place. That’s what we are using our aid budget for, that’s why we will be talking here at the G7 about how we try and put a Libyan government together. “We need to deal with the causes of this migration, not simply with its consequences,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/08/human-rights-abuses-eritrea-may-be-crimes-against-humanity-un-report,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/08/human-rights-abuses-eritrea-may-be-crimes-against-humanity-un-report
2015-06-06T17:00:03Z,global-development,Global development,G7 summit: anti-poverty campaigners from across Europe rally in Munich,"An enthusiastic mobilisation of anti-poverty activists in Munich on Saturday called for G7 members to take concrete measures to end extreme poverty by 2030, emphasising the importance of future development goals and the empowerment of women. Campaign groups ONE and Global Citizen pressed for an increase in the rhetoric around poverty at this weekend’s G7 summit in Bavaria, the first of four international development conferences this year. Adrian Lovett, executive director for Europe of the international advocacy organisation ONE, led the call for this year’s participants to finally follow through and pledge 0.7% of their gross national income (GNI) for development aid. The goal was set more than 40 years ago, but has only been implemented by five countries: Luxembourg, Sweden, Norway, the UK and Denmark. “We think that half of that aid should be going to the least developed countries, that is those on less than $1.20 a day. At the moment only a third of aid does so,” said Lovett, representing the organisation’s 6 million members.
He and other rally participants, including the Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Nelson Mandela’s grandson, Kweku Mandela Amuah, and the musician Bono, called for an end to extreme poverty by 2030. This G7, taking place in Schloss Elmau in the Bavarian Alps 60 miles (97km) south of Munich, marks the 10th anniversary of Gleneagles, and the Make Poverty History Campaign, which saw around 100,000 people marching through Edinburgh. By mid-afternoon in Munich organisers were estimating that around 5,000 campaigners had gathered for the rally. In Munich’s gallery and museum quarter, Königsplatz, comedians, musicians and politicians entertained hundreds who met in the neo-classical square in a sweltering heat.
Huge blisters covered the brown-sandalled feet of Elvira Meiboom, 27, a young ambassador for ONE who, to highlight the issues of global poverty, walked barefoot the 21 miles (33km) from her home town of Zandvoort in northern Holland to Amsterdam’s Schipol airport, to catch her flight to Munich to attend the rally. Wearing a David Cameron mask, the cultural science graduate who works for Oxfam said: “It would have been 10km less, except I encountered a dual carriageway which I hadn’t realised was there, and had to go back on myself. “But it was worth every step. Plenty of people stopped me all along the route and asked what I was doing. I told them that in Africa some people walk 6km every day just to get water.” Another of ONE’s 250 ambassadors, Siobhan Palmer, 22, from St Albans in the UK, had spent the runup to the summit lobbying UK election candidates to sign the pledge to end extreme poverty. “When politicians get stuck in the nitty-gritty of day-to-day politics, we can remind them of the promise they made to us,” said the first-time voter, who was clad in a Merkel mask. Many recalled the moving 2005 Make Poverty History message delivered by Nelson Mandela in London’s Trafalgar Square, in which he stated that: “Like slavery and apartheid, poverty is not natural. It is man-made and it can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings.”
Mandela’s own grandson was in Munich to reinforce the message of the late South African leader. “My grandfather made a bold statement on something that was very close and dear to his heart,” said Kweku Mandela Amuah, an ambassador for Global Citizen. “What’s changed since then is that many young people from around the world have picked up that baton and are increasingly trying to ensure that poverty is a high-profile issue. And we all know now that we have the resources and technology to end poverty. The question is, do we have the will and leadership to follow through?” said the 30-year-old. “My criticism of G7 in the past has been that key issues are discussed but they are not followed through, but my hope is that won’t be the case at this G7 meeting.” In a video message from Colorado, the musician and campaigner Bono reinforced what he called the “realistic” goal to end extreme poverty in the next 15 years. “Angie, we’re counting on you,” he said. “This is not nonsense. Let’s call it near zero poverty … No one of us can do it alone, but we can do it together,” he said, calling on the G7 leaders to have mut – German for courage. Conner Andrews from Crediton in Devon, hitchhiked 1,367 miles (2,200km) from Spain for the Munich rally. “I wanted to be here to be part of the voice for everybody who’s outside the castle walls,” the 23-year-old business and economics graduate said. Wearing a mask of Japanese president Shinzō Abe, he was talking to pedestrians on Munich’s Marienplatz ahead of the rally and handing out balloons. “People are amazed when you tell them that only 30% of the aid money goes to those countries that most need it,” he said. “We’d like the leaders to promise more money and more transparency. I hope that one of the outcomes of the summit is that countries like Canada will finally be motivated to give more money to countries not based on the business returns they can expect, but purely on the needs of the countries.” Bishu Chaudary, 21, from the village of Satbariya in western Nepal, highlighted one of the rally’s main messages, Poverty is Sexist, by telling the story of being sold as a slave by her impoverished farmer father when she was just nine to pay for a family building debt. She was saved by the NGO Plan International a decade ago. “My pain is my great teacher,” said the 21-year-old, who is now training to be a teacher. “Girls need to be given equal chances. Empower women through education and then they cannot be enslaved.” Activists in the square practised the ”strengthie” – posing like the icon Rosie the Riveter for photos, which is becoming a recognised symbol of the empowered woman, over the course of the day. From Akoupe, a village in the south of Ivory Coast, came Ake Achi, 39, who appealed to the G7 leaders to improve global access to health. The former child labourer who escaped to Europe in 1986, said he sent around £300 a month to pay the medical bills of his mother. “I want to see the G7 strengthen the global health system, so that my mother does not have to depend on me to send money, so that she can afford a doctor’s visit,” he said. “The truth is my mother lives on way less than $1.20 a day and any improvement in poverty standards has certainly not been felt by my family over the past 30 years.” Alex Louch, 23, from Southampton, said: “This year is the biggest year for development in 15 years, with the millennium development goals up for renewal. We’ve halved extreme poverty since 1990 and now we need to work on ending it.” But on the fringes of the rally, Sirleaf warned that, while Liberia and much of Africa had seen vast improvements in everything from child mortality to the number of girls in school, to access to life-saving antiretroviral drugs, the global development partnership between Africa and traditional donor countries was in peril. “While donors have increased funding in recent years, total aid contributions today amount to just 0.3% of donor income,” she said. “It’s crucial that donors continue to move much closer to the long-standing international goal of 0.7%. At the same time, a larger share of financing should go to the world’s poorest countries. Contrary to what I suspect are the beliefs of taxpayers in the developed world, only about a third of aid goes to the least developed countries. This should increase to half.”
She stressed the importance of raising the momentum ahead of the UN’s financing for development conference in Addis Ababa in July, at which the plan to finance the development agenda for the next 15 years will be hammered out. “Too few nations are taking the issue seriously enough and we’re in danger of missing a historic opportunity to build on this progress,” she added. Lovett described pre-summit talks he had participated in with Angela Merkel as open and constructive.Amid the many sentiments expressed on Saturday, one of the most well-received came from Bavarian stand-up comic Michael Mittermeier, who joked that the 16km fence surrounding Schloss Elmau, contrary to being seen as an elitist barrier, should stay in place until the leaders came up with results. “We shouldn’t worry about the fence,” he said in a thick Bavarian accent. “They should leave it up, and we’ll tell those inside: ‘Just stay there until something worthwhile emerges from your discussions,’” he said, to huge applause.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/06/g7-thousands-gather-munich-for-action-against-poverty,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/06/g7-thousands-gather-munich-for-action-against-poverty
2015-06-06T09:31:32Z,global-development,Global development,Africa sounds the alarm over crucial climate summit,"The world’s least-developed countries have accused richer nations of failing to provide financial backing for a strong new global climate treaty. With little negotiating time left ahead of the UN climate summit in Paris later this year, diplomats from nearly 200 countries meeting in Bonn have reportedly made little progress, raising the possibility of a last-minute diplomatic fiasco, as happened in Copenhagen in 2009. The mistrust between countries that built up in Copenhagen now threatens the Paris talks, said Tosi Mpanu-Mpanu of the Democratic Republic of Congo, who is chairman of the 48-strong least-developed countries group. “The [UN] process is flawed by a complete lack of trust and confidence between rich and poor countries,” he said. “We need time. Because of this lack of trust we have no other way of proceeding. We have to go ahead with baby steps. We are not making much progress, but we are going in the right direction. There are so many issues. It’s a process of attrition. “Every year there is a watering down of the commitments. It feels every year that we are losing out. Twenty countries contribute 80% of emissions, the rest 20%. Yet we in Africa are being asked to cut emissions. OK, we say, but help us. Give us finance, technology.” Concern is growing that rich countries, which have together pledged to mobilise $100bn a year to help countries adapt to climate change, are so far unwilling to discuss how the money will be raised, said Martin Khor, director of the South Centre, a leading intergovernmental thinktank of developing countries. “The developing countries are disappointed that there seems to be little hope that the $100bn will materialise. They have no idea what will be available, so they cannot plan ahead. If countries really wanted a [strong] deal, they would be talking about finance by now,” said Khor. Amjad Abdulla of the Maldives, chief negotiator for the 39-member Alliance of Small Island States – countries highly vulnerable to sea-level rises and extreme weather events – said: “We have an enormous task. We need to speed up the work. The ambition for a good deal has not gone. Our target is still to negotiate to hold temperatures to a 1.5C rise. But achieving it is going to be difficult and may require dramatic efforts by humanity.” Jan Kowalzig, climate change policy officer with Oxfam, said: “The French government [which will chair the Paris meeting] is becoming extremely nervous. It has to show success. Everyone recognises the talks are going too slowly, but the US completely refuses to put anything on the table about finance. The developed countries are not ready to talk about it. Informally, they recognise they need to make concessions, but the big danger is that the $100bn becomes a clever accountancy plan. The developing countries would see through that. A few powerful countries would be happy with a weak deal. The US, China, Japan and India are not very interested in a strong deal because they would be bound by it.” With only around 10 days’ worth of negotiations remaining after the Bonn talks close next week, no discussion has started on three vital issues: whether rich countries should compensate poor ones for the loss and damage done by extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change; how deep the overall emission cuts should be; and how countries should fairly share the burden of cuts. So far, 36 countries, including the world’s biggest emitters, China and the US, have pledged to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, but, given the scale of current commitments, the world is on a path to a 3-4C temperature rise. However, more than 150 smaller countries have yet to submit their carbon pledges. Kofi Annan, UN secretary general from 1997 to 2006, urged all countries to “seize the climate moment”. He added: “Climate change is the greatest challenge facing humanity today. The effects are being felt all over the planet, but not equally. In Africa, millions already feel the consequences of global warming. Yet millions more have never reaped the benefits that citizens in countries with high-carbon economies have long taken for granted. “Climate justice demands that the world seizes the climate moment. The window of opportunity for avoiding a climate catastrophe is open, but it is closing – and closing fast,” Annan said at the launch of the latest Africa Progress Panel report. Leading environment and development NGOs urged David Cameron to act on his climate pledges and use the G7 conference in Berlin to support a global goal to reduce overall carbon emissions to zero. “The Paris climate conference is the biggest opportunity in a generation to create momentum for a safer and more prosperous world. He can use it to build trust in developing countries by supporting a roadmap to $100bn of climate finance and support goals for a global goal to reduce overall carbon emissions to zero by 2050,” said the heads of Christian Aid, WWF, the RSPB and others.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/06/poor-nations-cash-tackle-climate-change,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/06/poor-nations-cash-tackle-climate-change
2015-06-06T08:00:03Z,global-development,Global development,What can G7's dwindling anti-poverty protesters learn from climate activists?,"This weekend’s G7 will mark the 10th anniversary of the 2005 Gleneagles G8 summit – a moment that, in retrospect, seems to belong to another age, when progress was possible on a whole different scale. Back then, more than a dozen countries committed to timetables for spending 0.7% of national income on aid; a landmark deal on multilateral debt relief was secured; a “development round” for trade still seemed possible. Today, by contrast, it feels as if we’re fiddling around on the edges – look, for instance, at the dim prospects for the finance for development summit in Addis Ababa in July. What’s gone wrong? It’s partly the continuing fallout of the financial crisis, of course; partly the rise of a more multipolar world and its accompanying “G-zero” dynamic. But perhaps most of all, the intensity of demands for change from ordinary people has waned.
This weekend, an estimated 20,000 people will march in Munich to press the G7 to act on poverty and development. Hardly a number to be sniffed at – but only half the number of people who turned out for the IF campaign in London in 2013, and a small fraction of the number who rallied for Make Poverty History in 2005. The starkest contrast of all, though, is between the state of development activism on the one hand, and climate activism on the other. Last year’s climate march in New York attracted a staggering 400,000 marchers. Nor was this a one-off; seemingly every week, another large investor capitulates to demands to divest from fossil fuel investments – Oxford University, the Church of England, the French insurance giant Axa, Norway’s gargantuan sovereign wealth fund. In part, successes today are based on learning from mistakes in the past. In 2009, US-based climate NGOs were stunned by the failure to secure legislation to cap emissions, a win they had assumed was a done deal once it cleared the House of Representatives. In retrospect, they realised their key mistake had been to focus on insider lobbying, whereas their opponents in the Tea Party had focused on building a movement. Five years on, climate activists are beating the Tea Party at their own game. To start with, they’ve finally found a story that really resonates. Back in 2009, their messages were technocratic, fact-based, and uninspiring – in stark contrast to the Tea Party’s fiery rhetoric. Now, by contrast, activists are framing climate as a moral issue – a shift that David Roberts explored in detail a few weeks ago in a must-read essay. Development activists have much to learn here, especially given the acutely technocratic tone of the UN’s sustainable development goals agenda. As I’ve argued elsewhere, the scope of the SDGs is right, but the framing is dreadful. We need a much more resonant storyline if we want to fire people up: one that speaks of a larger us, a longer future, a different good life.
Second, the climate movement has realised that big mobilisations are built out of small groups. Just as the Tea Party is built around local chapters, and just as Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign was built around clusters of activists all over the country, so the US climate divestment movement is rooted in groups of college students across the US. The development movement used to do this much more than it does today. It was church congregations that provided the real backbone of Jubilee 2000 and Make Poverty History. Nowadays, by comparison, it sometimes feels as though we’ve become too reliant on celebrities to fire us up, and have forgotten about the need to invest in the grassroots. This leads on to a third point: the power of faith. Progressive activists are often strongly secular in their instincts: as Alastair Campbell put it, we don’t do God. Yet, this is to overlook the extent to which faith groups have been central to so many of the biggest victories of progressive politics: the US civil rights movement, for example, or the abolition of slavery. And this is another thing the climate movement is getting right. Pope Francis – who will publish a papal encyclical on climate change any day now – is emerging as the world’s most important advocate of radical action to save creation from our ignorance. US climate sceptics are, rightly, terrified. Fourth, the climate movement knows what it wants. Unlike (say) the Occupy movement, the climate movement has clear, actionable demands – above all, in its call for a global carbon budget that recognises the reality that we can’t burn all the fossil fuels in the ground and still keep to 2 degrees.
At Gleneagles, the development movement knew exactly what it wanted: more and better aid, fair trade, and full debt relief. Today, its demands are much less clear. Fifth and finally, the climate movement is playing a long game. As Rich Gower and I noted in a recent report we wrote for Tearfund, “political and social change doesn’t unfold in a steady, linear fashion … There is often a long period when our efforts seem to yield few results [but] then comes a tipping point, after which events snowball and things suddenly start to fall into place.” This is now happening right in front of us on fossil fuel divestment. If development activists want to achieve a similar breakthrough, we too will need to think much more in terms of five- to 10-year change processes – and start now to prepare for where we want to get to in 2020. Above all, though, what we need is for the climate and development movements to join forces. There is no realistic scenario in which we successfully address climate while ignoring development, or vice versa. So the movement we really need isn’t a climate movement, or a development movement, but a movement that demands a different way of organising our economy – ensuring that we live within environmental limits, that inequality is kept within reasonable limits – and that everyone is able to meet their basic needs.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/06/g7-anti-poverty-protesters-climate-activists-environmental-campaign,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/06/g7-anti-poverty-protesters-climate-activists-environmental-campaign
2015-06-05T14:40:34Z,global-development,Global development,Religious leaders renew calls for Obama to quash abortion funding law,"Religious leaders in the US this week called on President Barack Obama to take urgent action to give women and girls who have experienced sexual violence in conflict access to safe abortion services. Members of the Christian, Jewish and Muslim faiths joined human rights activists in Washington on Thursday to seek executive action on the Helms amendment, a law that prohibits US aid money from funding abortions overseas, unless a pregnancy is the result of rape, incest or if a women’s life is in danger. However, the Helms amendment, introduced in 1973, has been widely interpreted as a total ban on funding for abortion services, regardless of circumstance or whether national laws allow terminations. Last year, religious leaders demanded that the law be repealed. The World Health Organisation estimates that globally 21.6 million women undergo unsafe abortions each year, the vast majority in poor countries. Some 47,000 women are estimated to die from complications from unsafe abortion each year and, says the WHO, it accounts for around 13% of maternal deaths. Speaking at a conference on Thursday, Jacqueline Mutere, founder of Grace Agenda in Kenya, a Nairobi-based organisation that helps survivors to access post-rape care, said: “As President Obama and the American people support conflict intervention programmes globally, let him act now with compassion to enable women in post-rape situations to access holistic post-rape care, which includes access to safe abortion.” Mutere was raped during the violence that erupted after the disputed 2007 presidential elections, but was unable to access abortion services. “Access to safe abortion is as critical as the peace process in conflict resolution,” she said.
Faith leaders attending the conference, organised by the multi-faith organisation Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice (RCRC) and the NGO Centre for Health and Gender Equity, said abortion was a vital component of post-rape care. “Rape is a tool of war, and in the midst of that hell, women and girls who have survived atrocities deserve access to comprehensive post-rape care, including access to compassionate abortion. That’s what loving your neighbour looks like in this case,” said Harry Knox, president the RCRC. Rabbi Denise Eger, president of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, said the Helms amendment hurt everyone. “It hurts thousands of girls and women around the world who are being subjugated to war and rape, domination and abuse. It hurts everyone who loves them. Our government, and specifically President Obama, can be the compassionate leader we know him to be by interpreting the Helms amendment properly,” she said. “Without proper reproductive healthcare, including at times abortion, our foreign policy is complicit in further inflicting damage on her body, mind and soul.” Ani Zonneveld, founder and president of Muslims for Progressive Values, added: “It is deplorable and morally reprehensible that in light of our government’s capacity to offer some respite and alleviation to the women and girls in Iraq and Syria they refuse to do so. It is time we hold our government accountable.” Addressing rape in conflict was high on the international agenda last year when world leaders and activists met in London for the ending sexual violence in conflict summit, which called for an end to impunity. At the summit, US secretary of state John Kerry said survivors of sexual violence needed support to recover and rebuild their lives.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/05/religious-leaders-obama-quash-abortion-funding-law,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/05/religious-leaders-obama-quash-abortion-funding-law
2015-06-05T13:51:58Z,global-development,Global development,UK development finance arm accused of bankrolling 'agro-colonialism' in Congo,"A Canadian palm oil company part-owned by the British government has been accused of land-grabbing and human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Community leaders in the vast concession area part-owned by agribusiness company Feronia say living conditions on their estates are abysmal and claim that their ancestral land along the River Congo has been taken from them illegally. Feronia, which was owned for nearly 100 years by food giant Unilever, is now 27% owned by the CDC Group, the UK government’s development finance institution (DFI), and about 30% owned by a group of other European government DFIs that have invested in the African Agriculture Fund (AAF). But local and international human rights groups argue in a new report that the British government’s use of more than £14m of public funds to back what campaigners say is a failing company that paid workers as little as $1 a day to work and live in harsh tropical conditions was inappropriate. Government-backed investment funds have a legal mandate to support poverty alleviation in developing countries, and they must operate according to strict policies that prevent them from investing in companies that grab land, violate labour rights or engage in corrupt practices. “Workers are living in crumbling homes, in severe disrepair. There is malnutrition in the communities near the plantations,” said Jean-François Mombia Atuku, a campaigner with RIAO-RDC, a Congolese NGO that has co-written the report with European land rights organisation Grain.
CDC said it was trying to improve the pay and conditions of the 3,500 workers, but their impoverishment had been caused by decades of war, under-investment and by physical isolation. “The company was basically broken when we took over,” said CDC investment director David Easton. “Our mandate is to invest in companies working in the most difficult environments. Feronia is the only employer in the entire vast area. We inherited pay and conditions established... in the 1980s. “We recognise that much has to be done. People want housing, schools and hospitals. We are doing a review of the community situation and the report will be published later this year. We raised pay 50% and expect to raise it again. We have committed to spend $3.6m on housing, hospitals, schools and other social needs. “There is a lot more to do in the community. We are long-term investors and want to improve the situation,” he said. When Feronia bought Unilever’s 120,000 hectares [296,000 acres] of land concessions in 2009, it claimed to have inherited lease agreements for all of the lands where the company had plantations. In the report, however, community leaders at the company’s Lokutu plantations say the only document they were shown as evidence of the company’s supposed rights to the 63,000 hectares concession is an old registration certificate that is riddled with errors and does not confer any legal title.
“All they have is a falsified certificate of registration, signed by an incompetent surveyor,” says the provincial deputy, Gaspard Bosenge-Akoko. “Can you imagine a company grabbing over 40,000 hectares of land from these communities, depriving them of their agricultural activities, on the basis of this kind of flimsy document?” According to the report, land was stolen from communities all along the length of the Congo River under Belgian colonial occupation (1908-1960), to establish oil palm plantations. In recent years, they say, the communities have been excluded from any decisions regarding the expansion of the concession. “We have only suffered from the negative impacts of the plantations, such as the disappearance of caterpillars, mushrooms, wild animals, freshwater fish, and, overall, the near complete loss of the flora and fauna. This has resulted in severe malnutrition among our children and even our elders; the mortality rate for infants and mothers during childbirth is amongst the highest in the province,” says the report. “Community leaders from the areas where Feronia has its plantations have had enough of this company,” says Mombia Atuku of RIAO-RDC. “They want Feronia to give them back the lands, so that they can once again benefit from the use of their forests and farms.” CDC said it was not aware of land rights grievances. “We believe the company has a valid right to be there,” said Easton. He said the DRC government, which has a stake in Feronia, confirmed that the company is working legitimately. “Feronia has a valid title to the area where it operates. But we are looking carefully at the report and are keen to work with NGOs,” said Easton. In a statement, CDC added: “Without CDC’s investment, Feronia would not have survived and 3,500 people would have lost their jobs, as well as the access to schools, hospitals and infrastructure that the company provides to workers and the community. “In the first 18 months of our investment we’ve met our top priorities of helping the company secure its immediate future and deliver improved pay and benefits for all of its workers.” This article was amended on the day of publication to clarify that Feronia is now 27% owned by the CDC Group. The figure that CDC has committed to spending on housing, hospitals, schools and other social needs has been corrected from £3.6m to $3.6m",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/05/uk-development-finance-arm-accused-bankrolling-agro-colonialism-in-congo,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/05/uk-development-finance-arm-accused-bankrolling-agro-colonialism-in-congo
2015-06-05T12:11:22Z,global-development,Global development,Women are the backbone of healthcare with few rewards for $3tn contribution,"Women contribute around $3tn to global healthcare but nearly half of it is unpaid and unrecognised, according to a new study. The report, published in the Lancet, found that women’s involvement in healthcare is undervalued economically, socially, politically and culturally. Researchers attempted to estimate the financial value of women’s contribution to health systems in 2010 by analysing data from 32 countries, accounting for 52% of the world’s population. They estimated the value of women’s paid work was 2.47% of global gross domestic product (GDP), while the value of their unpaid work was 2.35% of GDP. The total is equivalent to $3tn.
The unpaid work is largely domestic care for family members, which is only officially acknowledged and compensated in a small number of countries, such as the UK, Turkey and Costa Rica. In April, a report by UN Women found that on average women do almost two-and-a-half times more unpaid care and household work as men. Combining paid and unpaid work, researchers calculated that women in almost all countries work longer hours each day than men. Professor Ana Langer, from Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health in Boston, who co-led the commission on women and health that carried out the new study, said: “Worldwide, most providers of healthcare are women. But the health systems to which they contribute so much are often completely unresponsive to their needs, despite the fact that they rely heavily on their paid and unpaid contributions. “Women are undervalued and unsupported by the systems in which they work, and this problem is exacerbated by inequitable access to healthcare experienced by too many women worldwide – particularly those in the most vulnerable groups.”
The work is one of the most exhaustive studies on the relationship between women and healthcare, and involved heads of health programmes as well as leading thinkers and activists from around the world. The inquiry examined the links between biological, economic and social factors in improving women’s health, including the effects of rapid globalisation, urbanisation and climate change. It found that, despite being the backbone of the healthcare system, women rarely held management or executive positions in global health. Women tended to have lower-skilled, lower-paid jobs than men. It also highlighted the disparity in the care and support women receive in poorer settings. Particularly in the case of maternal health, poorer women often have to rely on healthcare delivered by frequently under-resourced, underpaid, or unpaid, untrained workers – usually women – such as traditional birth attendants, community health workers or relatives. Louise Silverton, director for midwifery at the Royal College of Midwives, said the findings demonstrate that women “need and deserve” more resources. “Investment in women and girls through ensuring access to resources such as food and education has significant health benefits,” she said.
“Girls who remain longer in education marry later [and] have fewer children, are less likely to die or be damaged as a result of pregnancy and birth and make greater financial contributions to their families. “By not acknowledging women’s unpaid contributions to family and community wellbeing, it is less likely that the often male-dominated governments will allocate resources to women that they need and deserve. “Improving access to education will also ultimately, and hopefully, lead to more women in positions of influence within these governments.” The report called for women’s contribution to healthcare to be adequately compensated and valued in order to advance sustainable development.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/05/women-backbone-healthcare-3tn-contribution,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/05/women-backbone-healthcare-3tn-contribution
2015-06-05T06:00:04Z,global-development,Global development,"Without leadership over development finance, talks in July cannot succeed","Many things have changed since the dawning of the millennium development goals (MDGs) 15 years ago. In many ways, the world is a very different place, with a different power balance and different problems to overcome. However, one thing has not changed and never will: without leadership, nothing that matters gets done. But leadership is the one thing lacking as we approach the financing for development conference in Addis Ababa in July. If leadership means being the first to move, unsure perhaps of the future but nevertheless committed to building momentum for change, what we are currently seeing is the opposite. While exhorting others to act on the myriad financial shortfalls and barriers to development progress, the world’s leaders are hiding behind a variety of excuses for their own failure to jump first. The general sentiment appears to be, “We have problems of our own – can someone else sort this out?” But having set in train a bold and ambitious agenda for a better world in the sustainable development goals (SDGs) – to be acclaimed in their entirety in September – this is not good enough. The Addis conference needs to be remembered as the moment the world lived up to the ambition of the SDGs, setting out a new era of development finance with bold contributions from all sides and commitments to rewrite financial rules to make them more effective and inclusive. Instead, the conference is in danger of not being remembered at all, as lower-level ministers and bureaucrats argue the toss over the jargon, with no era-defining clarion calls to speak of, and few timetables for action – general declarations of intent are preferred.
The rise of the “emerging” (or “emerged”) economies is one of the great differences between this era and that of the MDGs. I have been a firm supporter of the idea that, as the global balance of power shifts, we need to move beyond the language of north-south and developed-developing and treat all countries as responsible for contributing to a better, more sustainable world. But the warning of a wise friend a couple of years ago now rings worryingly true. Be careful what you wish for, she said, because the richer countries will abuse this maturation of the global community by reneging on their historic and present responsibilities to those countries that are poorer and weaker. This appears to be precisely what is happening. In intervention after intervention in UN discussions in New York recently, representatives of rich countries have confused the welcome end to binary north-south language with a carte blanche to forget the meaning of leadership. Take aid - only one part of the development finance mix, but an important part. Last week, EU member countries committed to meeting the historic 0.7% target by 2030, much too late to make the difference it needs to make. The UK is an exception to this rule, and by achieving its 0.7% aid commitment in a recession it has proved there is no reason that other major countries cannot do the same. The US and Japan do not even set out a timetable.
But the fact that the world can no longer be divided easily into country groups doesn’t mean that the richest no longer bear the lion’s share of the burden of global renewal. Countries such as China, India and Brazil are home to millions of people living in extreme ($1.25 a day) poverty – 80 million, 280 million and 10 million respectively. The term “common but differentiated responsibility”, which evolved during the climate negotiations, could hardly be more appropriate for this new world of calibrated capacity. But rich countries resist it. There are two reasons why emerging countries should now sign up to an aid commitment and assume the leadership that they rightly seek. First, because this would shame the richer OECD countries into doing so too. Second, they are already giving large amounts of aid – such pledges in the Addis outcome document would only be putting in writing what is happening already, and committing to improvements over time. The way we talk about aid may make it sound like a gift, but for China, India, Brazil and all other aid givers, it is actually part of a long-term strategic plan that benefits the giver either directly or indirectly. And it sounds odd to refuse to accept global responsibility for sustainable development while simultaneously insisting on a seat at the top global tables. One ambassador of a major emerging economy told me that his country “should commit to a certain amount of money in aid, but we won’t”. How tragic. It is almost the definition of failed political leadership to put rhetoric and positioning before genuine political progress. And the same story is being played out across the board, from commitments on taxes to initiatives to involve the private sector more successfully. So instead of a race to the top, where countries seize the opportunity of this historic year, we have a race to the bottom. Instead of the old-fashioned G7 world, we have a G-zero world, with no powerful core of countries to push things forward. As throughout history, the only way out is for leaders to step forward. It is not clear where they will emerge from but when one or two world leaders step forward, others are likely to follow, and the money needed to meet the SDGs might yet be placed on the table.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/05/without-leadership-development-finance-addis-talks-cannot-succeed-sdgs,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/05/without-leadership-development-finance-addis-talks-cannot-succeed-sdgs
2015-06-04T12:20:10Z,global-development,Global development,"First draft of sustainable development goals exposes gaps, warn NGOs","The new set of development goals that will address global poverty, inequality and climate change over the next 15 years are strong on vision, but weak on the methods to make them a reality, NGOs warned this week. After months of negotiations among UN member states, the first official – “zero” – draft of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) was published on Tuesday. As widely expected, the number of goals (17) and number of targets (169) have not changed since they were first proposed by a UN open working group last year. Some of the targets have been recommended for revisions. The SDGs will replace the current millennium development goals, which expire at the end of the year. However, concerns have been raised about how the new goals will be measured. “WaterAid is concerned that while there is a target to reach everyone everywhere with sanitation and hygiene, there are presently no indicators to measure whether, for instance, homes or healthcare facilities have soap and water for handwashing,” said Margaret Batty, the NGO’s director of global policy and campaigns.
“Without these indicators, the sustainable development goals will not succeed in the goal of leaving no one behind.” Helen Dennis, Christian Aid’s senior adviser on poverty and inequality, added: “We have yet to see strong enough plans for how the ambitious vision will be achieved. It is clear that the sections of the document on financing and implementation, and on follow-up and review, need to be beefed up before September. Achieving the vision will also depend on an ambitious, legally binding climate deal later this year.” Ahead of this week’s publication, worries were voiced about the possible removal of a proposed indicator for the target to eliminate female genital mutilation (FGM). The indicators – roughly two for each target – are currently being reviewed by an expert group. Each indicator is being assessed for its feasibility, suitability and relevance. A target contained under the proposed goal number five calls for the elimination of all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and FGM. However, while the indicator for child marriage – the percentage of women aged 20 to 24 married before 18 – was seen as a good fit in a recent survey among member states, the FGM indicator – the percentage of girls and women aged 15 to 49 who have undergone the practice – was regarded as too difficult a measure. A decision on the indicators for all goals is not expected until March next year. However, the goals and targets will be adopted at a special summit at the UN general assembly in September and will come into force on 1 January 2016.
The zero draft suggests revisions to 21 of the targets, including those on building resilience among poor people, reducing pollution and on child labour. The draft declaration accompanying the goals calls for a global plan of action for people, planet and prosperity, that promotes peace, the rule of law and human rights. Dennis said the draft offered a “welcome vision of a more equal and sustainable world”. Jacqui Hunt, Europe office director at Equality Now, said she welcomed the commitments to end violence and discrimination against women and girls, adding: “We also note the report’s proposal that strong legislation is vital to ensure that gender equality can be realised and hope that all governments adhere to this requirement immediately. “Without sound in-country laws and policies, which can be effectively implemented, we may not be able to achieve this specific goal as quickly as we need to, for the betterment of all society. We do not want to be calling for the same thing in 15 years’ time and urge all governments to move quickly.” But, with more than three months to go before the goals are adopted officially, women’s rights activists warned that nothing can be taken for granted in the negotiations. “The current zero draft outcome for the post-2015 summit in many ways reflects the successful and tireless advocacy efforts of women’s rights and feminist organisations,” said Alejandra Scampini, lead advocacy coordinator at the Association for Women’s Rights in Development (Awid). “The document highlights women’s rights and gender equality prominently, and it is critical that this focus remains. Nevertheless, we are concerned and staying alert to the fact that women’s rights are often used as bargaining chips, to be traded as if they are optional, rather than obligations, especially as negotiations continue. “Our engagement will seek to ensure that there is no roll back at the international conference on financing for development [to be held in Ethiopia in July], and in relation to decisions on the indicators that will measure progress on the SDGs. While pleased with the prominence of gender equality within the document, we are concerned that there is very little that is transformatory in terms of economic and financial governance.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/04/first-draft-sustainable-development-goals-exposes-gaps-warn-ngos,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/04/first-draft-sustainable-development-goals-exposes-gaps-warn-ngos
2015-06-04T10:11:26Z,global-development,Global development,UN pleads for $497m aid to prevent catastrophe for millions of Iraqis,"Millions of Iraqis could be left without food, water, medicine and shelter over the next six months unless the international community urgently comes up with nearly $500m of humanitarian aid, the UN warned on Thursday. Lise Grande, the UN’s humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, said failure to find the money to help those caught up in the war between Islamic State and the Iraqi government would have “catastrophic” consequences that could leave 10 million people in need of life-saving support by the end of the year.
“The crisis in Iraq is one of the most complex and volatile anywhere in the world,” she said. “Humanitarian partners have been doing everything they can to help. But more than 50% of the operation will be shut down or cut back if money is not received immediately.” As the conflict escalates, the UN and its NGO partners are asking donors for $497m to help provide basic support for the 5.6 million people displaced or affected by the violence. Although the UN estimates that more than 8 million people currently require life-saving support – and warns that number could rise by a quarter by the end of 2015 – it said the dangers facing civilians go far beyond aid. “Violence has already forced nearly 3 million people from their homes, leaving them scattered in more than 3,000 locations across the country,” the UN said in a statement. “Human rights and rule of law are under constant assault as sectarian tensions sharpen. Mass executions, systematic rape and horrendous acts of violence are rampant.” It said the funding shortfall had already led to the closure of 77 frontline health clinics and a reduction in rations for more than a million people. Dr Jaffar Hussain, the head of the World Health Organisation’s operations in Iraq, said the health challenges facing internally displaced persons (IDPs) were “enormous”. The WHO estimates that 85%-90% of the IDPs are living wherever they can find shelter, leaving them vulnerable to communicable diseases such as measles, hepatitis and other waterborne diseases. “The scale and scope of conflict in Iraq has expanded and the situation is very challenging due to massive displacement since June 2014 and its effect on the host community,” he said. “With the arrival of summer and temperatures above 50C in the southern and central parts of Iraq, WHO is very concerned about the risks faced by IDP populations and their extreme vulnerability to outbreaks, including cholera and hepatitis.”
Hussain said the WHO was already treating numerous patients with chronic diseases without the necessary infrastructures and or health personnel. He added: “There are three strategic aims for health assistance: ensuring that both preventive and curative health services are available to all IDPs; maintaining the supply chain of essential and life-saving medicine to all health outlets; and ensuring effective preventive measures.” Britain announced on Thursday that it would provide £20m of new humanitarian funding to Iraqi families. The Department for International Development (DfID) said the money would help tens of thousands of vulnerable and displaced Iraqis gain access to water, food and medicine – and go on protecting women and girls. The latest DfID pledge brings the UK’s total humanitarian response to the Iraq crisis to £59.5m. The international development secretary, Justine Greening, said Islamic State’s “indiscriminate persecution” had left millions of Iraqis in need and forced many people to flee the region and risk their lives by crossing the Mediterranean. “That is why the world cannot ignore the terrible plight these people find themselves in, caught up in conflict,” she said. “It is so important that the international community provides people not only with immediate, life-saving help where they are - whether in refugee camps or living in nearby communities - but ultimately with hope for a better future and the prospect of rebuilding their lives.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/04/united-nations-497m-aid-prevent-catastrophe-millions-iraqis,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/04/united-nations-497m-aid-prevent-catastrophe-millions-iraqis
2015-06-04T09:09:48Z,global-development,Global development,Attack on aid workers reflects rising danger in Afghanistan,"As the conflict in Afghanistan shows no sign of abating, local humanitarian workers are finding themselves increasingly in the line of fire – or at the mercy of violent criminals. The latest such attack came early on Tuesday, when unidentified gunmen shot dead nine Afghan employees of the Czech NGO People in Need in northern Afghanistan. Ross Hollister, country director for People in Need, said the attackers stormed the organisation’s guesthouse in the district of Zari, in Balkh province, at around 1.30am, where they killed two drivers, two security guards and five project workers, including eight men and one woman. Two others survived the attack. Hollister said the victims had been killed “execution style”, with several of them shot as they slept in bed. The organisation has suspended its Afghanistan operations temporarily. The incident adds to grim statistics that make Afghanistan by far the deadliest country in the world for aid workers. According to the UN, 57 aid workers were killed in Afghanistan last year.
This year is set become even more brutal, with 26 aid workers killed and 17 injured so far, according to statistics released by Acbar, a coordinating body for NGOs in Afghanistan. “Killing an aid worker is killing support for the Afghan population,” Justine Piquemal, Acbar’s director, said. “There [has been] a real difference from last year – an awful and real increase.” As international NGOs gradually scale down activities in Afghanistan, their local staff have remained in some of the country’s most dangerous regions. Hollister said People in Need had worked for 12 years without security incidents in Balkh province, which is not a hotbed of insurgency, “so it [the attack] really came out of nowhere”. However, Zari district is ethnically diverse, with deep-running, political faultlines and armed groups belonging to various factions. While its motives are unclear – and the Taliban has denied responsibility – the attack reveals the complex set of risks that face aid workers in Afghanistan, where ideology, local politics and historic grievances all play a part, as does simple criminality. “What we can say with clarity is that humanitarian workers are more vulnerable,” said Mark Bowden, the UN’s humanitarian coordinator in Afghanistan. “They work on the frontline in many cases. Secondly, they are more noticeable in terms of what they do in the community, and in some instances, some groups believe they are on the wrong side.” He added: “If you’re working for an international organisation, people know that you have international backers, and you can be an easier commercial target or criminal target.” Apparent disagreements within the Taliban about who should be regarded as civilians are also a factor. Senior Taliban leaders are said to have a broader definition than some younger militants of which humanitarian workers deserve protection. However, the Taliban generally seemed to approve of the killing last December of 12 deminers in Helmand province, as well as the kidnapping of 19 deminers in April. The mine clearers worked for Sterling, an American commercial contractor, which is likely to have classified them as foreign agents in the eyes of the Taliban. The Taliban also claimed the attack on a hotel in Kabul on 13 May, which killed 14 civilians, including six aid workers, on the basis of targeting “foreign dignitaries”.
Following the attack, Georgette Gagnon, the UN’s human rights director in Afghanistan, said the Taliban’s actions could amount to war crimes. “Taliban statements on avoiding civilian casualties ring hollow when we set them against the latest killings,” she said. With cash-strapped militants looking for funds, kidnappings are also becoming more common. Acbar said 40 aid workers have been abducted so far this year. The bodies of five of them, who worked for Save the Children, were found in April in the mountains of Uruzgan province, 40 days after they had been kidnapped. Relatives of the victims said the kidnappers first demanded the release of five Taliban prisoners. When the authorities refused, they demanded the equivalent of £400,000 in ransom, which the families didn’t have. “I was proud that my son worked for his own people … He never thought it was dangerous,” said Mualem Rahmatullah, the father of 27-year-old Rafiullah Salihzai, in a recent interview at his home in Tarin Kot. Mohammad Tawoos Penham, whose brother’s corpse was found with one eye gouged out and bullet wounds to his chest, buttocks and back, urged humanitarian organisations to continue their work, despite the dangers. “[The] Taliban and terrorists don’t want Save the Children to continue their activities in Uruzgan,” he said, “but they should help the children who are still here.” He asked organisations to provide better security, such as armed guards, for their local staff. But equipping NGOs with that level of security would defy their purpose in the first place, said Bowden. “They wouldn’t participate in the community and do what they set out to do,” he said. People in Need’s Hollister agreed: “The cornerstone of our security here is acceptance by the communities where we work. We remain neutral, impartial and not religious. But on some level there is nothing you can do.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/04/afghanistan-attack-aid-workers-danger-gunmen-humanitarian-staff,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/04/afghanistan-attack-aid-workers-danger-gunmen-humanitarian-staff
2015-06-04T06:00:04Z,global-development,Global development,"Dear G7, it’s time to put girls and women at the top of your agenda","The Ebola outbreak has served as a prolonged and revealing stress test, exposing countries’ deep vulnerabilities well beyond the disease response. In particular, Ebola’s relentless and disproportionate toll on girls and women has highlighted how precarious their health and rights are worldwide — and how much work will remain even after Guinea and Sierra Leone join Liberia as Ebola-free. Women have borne the brunt of Ebola. It’s estimated that 56 women have been infected for every 44 men. But that’s not all. Ebola-stricken nations have witnessed a dramatic rise in gender-based violence, with the number of rapes reportedly doubling in some regions. Reproductive health services have also suffered devastating setbacks. Fear of Ebola infection has deterred pregnant women from seeking care in health centres and health personnel from assisting deliveries, triggering an upsurge in women dying during childbirth. These troubling trends are symptomatic of a bigger problem: gains for girls and women are often the hardest won and the most easily lost. In times of crisis, women’s rights hang in the balance. For this to change – it can and must – governments must increase investment in girls and women, especially in their sexual and reproductive health and rights.
With Germany set to host the 41st annual G7 summit in June, seven leading nations are in a position to set the tone for international commitments to girls and women. This year will mark the start of a pivotal chapter for development as the UN finalises ambitious goals this autumn to improve all lives and secure a healthy planet. The G7 summit will result in a declaration confirming the group’s priorities. The world will be watching to see if, and how high, it raises the bar for women. The G7’s track record on female health and rights makes us hopeful. Last year, the UK held the first Girl Summit to end female genital mutilation and child marriage; in 2012, it hosted a groundbreaking global Family Planning Summit. The country also stands out as the first G7 country to sign international aid targets into national law. Canada has also taken encouraging steps. Last year, it declared maternal, newborn and child health its top international priority. More important, Canada put muscle behind this commitment, pledging $3.5bn over the next five years to end preventable deaths of women and children. While the G7 countries are doing more for girls and women, the challenges are growing tougher. According to the World Economic Forum, all of the world’s regions – from North America to sub-Saharan Africa – have wider health gaps between women and men today than a decade ago.
These disturbing trends should do more than raise a few eyebrows. Time and again, data has shown that when women have equal rights and lead healthy lives, individuals, communities and nations thrive. If we fail to invest in women now, we risk losing more ground. Future stresses and shocks – whether from epidemics like Ebola, conflicts or climate change – will continue to exert pressure on health systems, communities and national economies. When they do, girls and women’s health and rights will be first to fall by the wayside if governments fail to sustain or increase investments. At the G7 summit in June, these countries have a chance to drive progress. What would it look like for the G7 to prioritise girls and women at this year’s summit? First, words matter. The health and rights of girls and women are far too important to be listed 21st and 40th out of 43 priorities, as they were in last year’s summit declaration. G7 countries must put women at the top of their agenda. They must also embrace gender equality and the full range of female health needs, from access to modern contraception to stronger health systems that ensure they can access quality health services and nutrition in times of crisis and calm alike.
More crucially, these goals need to be matched by equally bold financial commitments that will turn the ambitious sustainable development agenda into tangible progress for the health and rights of women. The stakes are high. It is impossible to eradicate poverty, build resilient health systems and take care of the planet if women are not healthy, thriving members of society. The world has long looked to the G7 for cues on which priorities really matter, and the answer is straightforward: healthy girls and women. These seven countries have a unique opportunity to step up their commitments and convince others to do the same. Advancing the health and rights of women is the right – and smart – thing to do for any nation hoping to remain or emerge as a leader on the global stage.

2015-06-03T13:49:21Z,global-development,Global development,Award for group creating hope amid Burundi's political turmoil,"For Deogratias Niyonkuru, hope fuels development. It may sound like idealistic whimsy, but Niyonkuru says defeating a widespread sense of fatalism allowed him to create a grassroots-driven model of empowerment in his native Burundi, now locked in crisis after weeks of protest and an attempted coup. This week Niyonkuru’s organisation Adisco was awarded the King Baudouin Foundation’s African Development Prize for its work in encouraging entrepreneurship and creating cooperatives and health insurance societies to give Burundians more financial independence.
While European leaders debate how much of their wealth to devote to aid, Niyonkuru sings from a different sheet – advocating self-sufficiency and an agenda that prioritises a sense of dignity. “The difference between us and [other organisations] is that we work to reinforce the population’s skills so they can take control of their own development,” said Niyonkuru, who was in Brussels this week to receive the foundation’s prize. “We help people shake off a feeling of fatalism ... we help them think about ways of changing their situation, to organise themselves, define their projects,” he said. Adisco helps people form small “groups of self-promotion and solidarity”, known as IGGs in the Kirundi language. They then mobilise local resources and decide on projects, usually agricultural schemes, to add value to the work they are doing. These groups later coalesce into cooperatives to gain greater influence.
Adisco also runs health insurance schemes, trains young people to become leaders in their communities, and works to eradicate ethnic tensions between the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis who fought a bloody 12-year civil war in the 1990s. In its citation, the King Baudouin Foundation said IGGs represented 17,100 households, accounting for around 97,000 people, in four hillside regions in Burundi. Around 25 health insurance groups cover more than 113,000 people. The idea of agency is important to Niyonkuru as it offers a sense of dignity to people who have endured years of paralysing uncertainty. “This sense of powerlessness ... is linked to poverty. People are so poor that they can’t see any way out ... this feeling was worsened by the war. When a person has lost everything again and again, they despair, and they see no reason to continue to invest because they do not know what will happen tomorrow,” he said. Some of the 90,000 people who have fled Burundi over the last month – since President Pierre Nkurunziza said he would stand for a third term, prompting protests and a short-lived attempted coup – said they would not return this time, having already fled the country during the civil conflict.
Burundi is one of Africa’s poorest countries, ranking 180 out of 187 states in the 2014 UN human development index and it relies on foreign aid for about half of its national budget. Niyonkuru said humanitarian intervention had created a culture of hand-outs. “(After the war) around 40% of the population were living on humanitarian aid. They got healthcare for free, they got food for free, they got water for free ... Many people felt comfortable in this situation, and decided to wait for international aid to feed them, to give them seeds,” he said. This idea that things could be had for free had become a structural problem, Niyonkuru said. Adisco has limited external financial support, and mobilises local resources through subscription fees for the health schemes and the sale of shares in cooperatives, among other initiatives. “This is the only model that can allow a homegrown, durable development in Africa ... this model mobilises people around leaders who are chosen by the community and in whom they have confidence. It is rooted in African culture,” he said. However, Niyonkuru did see a role for the international community in Burundi’s current political crisis. “We need help so the different parties can negotiate to end these cycles of violence. The international community must absolutely use all methods to put pressure on all the parties – the government, civil society, the protesters and the opposition,” he said. “If the international community turns its back on Burundi at this time, the country will sink into violence and there will no possibility for development,” he said, adding that unemployed youths with few options were responsible for much of the current violence. “There are some who say, in Kirundi, ‘in any case, I am already dead’.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/03/king-baudouin-foundation-award-adisco-hope-burundi-political-turmoil,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/03/king-baudouin-foundation-award-adisco-hope-burundi-political-turmoil
2015-06-03T11:58:08Z,global-development,Global development,Anti-poverty protests: tell us your experiences of campaigns for change,"In 2005, more than 200,000 anti-poverty campaigners, clad in white, took to the streets of Edinburgh to protest for debt cancellation, increased aid and global trade reform. The Make Poverty History movement attracted the attention of world leaders who were in Scotland for the G8 summit held at Gleneagles. The summit achieved significant progress, including a consensus to drop $55bn worth of multilateral debt for 18 of the most highly indebted countries. Leaders also committed to double aid to Africa by 2010, a pledge that fell short of its target but helped the public hold governments to account for their aid promises. The Edinburgh march built on campaigning efforts in 1998, when the UK hosted the G8 summit in Birmingham. That year, an estimated 70,000 campaigners formed a human chain around the city centre to protest for debt cancellation, their chants audible to negotiators inside the summit meetings. Campaigners say the protest was a seminal moment for the anti-poverty movement around the world. As the G7 in Germany approaches, anti-poverty campaigners will once more be protesting for a fairer deal for the world’s poor. Activists estimate a crowd of 20,000 people, a figure dwarfed by the number of attendees at previous G7/8 summits. If you attended the debt-cancellation protests in Birmingham, Edinburgh, or elsewhere in the world, we’d like to hear from you.

2015-06-03T06:00:02Z,global-development,Global development,"On the shores of Malawi’s lake of stars, activists raise uranium fears | Santorri Chamley","The sun rises over Lake Malawi. As fishermen bring their overnight catch to shore, the purring motors of their dugout canoes spread ripples across waters once dubbed the “lake of stars” by David Livingstone. On the beach, a group of young men mend fishing nets. Women smoke fish to sell, including chambo, utaka and matemba. For many of the tens of thousands of people living in Karonga, a lakeside district in northern Malawi, life revolves around fishing. So when dead fish began to wash ashore last December, they were worried. Some blamed pollution from the nearby Kayelekera uranium mine, the country’s biggest foreign investment. “People are fearful because there are a lot of fish dying in the lake, so people are suggesting that they are dying because of the discharge from the Kayelekera mine,” said Harry Hudson Mwanyembe, the chairman for health and environment on Karonga’s district council. The Australian company that owns the mine, Paladin Energy Ltd, says it has complied with all its environmental obligations and routinely monitors aquatic life in the Sere River and elsewhere. It denies any responsibility for the dead fish. In a statement dated 10 January, Malawi’s government said it was investigating the causes of the fish kill in Karonga district – the first case of localised fish kills in recent times. It noted that fish kills had been observed four times on a large scale in Lake Malawi since 1999. Others had occurred 40-50 years ago. Previous fish kills had been caused by changes in the oxygen composition in the waters after heavy winds. It also stated that Kayelekera mine had never released effluent into the environment from its storage facilities. Paladin’s operation in Kayelekera has been beset by controversy since it was opened by the late president Bingu wa Mutharika in 2009. The disputes, legal battles and public concern over the mine go to the heart of what many call Africa’s resource curse. As one of the continent’s poorest countries – ranking 174 of 187 countries in the UN human development index – Malawi desperately needs foreign exchange, as well as employment and infrastructure. But its pursuit of extractive wealth has been stymied by a lack of adequate regulation and transparency as well as by corruption, activists say. In Kayelekera, the pitfalls associated with launching a multi-million dollar enterprise, with government backing, in an area where people lack access to both information and power, are evident in the many rumours, claims and counter-claims surrounding the mine’s operations. Harris Mweso, the village headman, says the mine initially created jobs in a deprived area, with several thousand people hired when it opened – although the number has since dropped. “There was money to be made here,” he said. “The village has benefited from the mine.” But another resident of Kayelekera, Philip Simbowe, said the government had sold the lives of Malawians for cash. “Foreign companies like Paladin see that here in Malawi, we are naive and take advantage of us,” he said. “Knowing what we know now, we would advise other communities against allowing foreign mining companies in their areas because the benefits are not worth the risks.” Reinford Mwangonde, who has challenged the mine’s operating procedures since before the licence was granted in 2007, says the multifaceted Paladin case highlights the importance of a strong regulatory environment. “The government gave the mining licence for extracting uranium first and the laws came second. What sense does that make? You have to first introduce policies and instruments, beef them up, make sure stringent regulations are in place, then allow the industry to operate,” said Mwangonde, executive director of Citizens for Justice, who chairs the Natural Resources Justice Network (NRJN), a coalition of 33 civil society groups. The NRJN took Paladin and the government to court in 2007, arguing that Malawi did not have the appropriate laws in place for uranium mining. The case was settled: Paladin agreed to a number of concessions, including the payment of $10m (£6.5m) for social development projects. The government agreed to enact new legislation for uranium mining, to review the 1981 Mines and Minerals Act, and to invest earnings from the mine in the local community. During the case, NRJN activists claim they received threats and were intimidated by the police, government officials and traditional chiefs. “There was a lot of divide and rule, which multinational corporations are good at. At times the police, instead of defending us, harassed us,” said Kossam Munthali, NRJN’s board chairperson and executive director of Focus, a Karonga-based NGO. Paladin has since faced criticism over a spill caused by heavy rainfall in January, and its recent decision to treat and release run-off water into the Sere river, which eventually flows into Lake Malawi, a Unesco world heritage site. The discharge, which began in April, was approved by the government, but NRJN has tried to block it.
Paladin says the run-off water has been treated in line with international standards and needs to be discharged because the mine suspended production in May 2014 due to low uranium prices. When the plant was operating, rainfall run-off water was used in production, but because of the closure – which the company says will last until uranium prices pick up again – the water needs to be discharged, the company says. “We’ll be discharging this year and next year and until such a time when the mine re-enters commercial production, until the end of the mine life,” said Greg Walker, Paladin’s general manager for international affairs, in Lilongwe. Ben Botolo, Malawi’s secretary for natural resources, energy and mining, said the government would independently test the discharge waters. He also said the government had learned a lot from the Kayelekera process. “The Kayelekera project has assisted Malawi’s government to understand some of the dynamics in a project of this nature and has assisted in the improvement of our legislation, inspection procedures etc,” he said. But criticism has also come from an external source. Conscious of their relative lack of expertise, NRJN activists enlisted the help of Bruno Chareyron, a French nuclear engineer who came to Kayelekera in February to monitor the mine and present the findings of a 2012 survey to the people. Chareyron, who is head of laboratory at the Commission for Independent Research and Information about Radiation, or Criirad, told a packed hall in Karonga town that he was worried about Paladin’s decision to discharge treated water. “Paladin says the discharged water will have a uranium residue below the World Health Organisation’s 30 micrograms per litre for drinking water. It’s been well known for decades that, in the case of a chronic discharge, for some living species – depending on the chemical conditions in the river – a safe limit may be 0.3 micrograms per litre. So there is a scientific dispute,” he said. Chareyron also raised concerns about worker safety, saying that although radioactive doses were below international limits for workers, they were still high. “Following our visit to the mine [in February], we have serious doubts regarding the radiation protection practices and the accuracy of the evaluation of doses performed by Paladin,” he added. Walker said that all workers in exposed areas were equipped with dosimeters to measure exposure and results were regularly sent to an international laboratory. “Workers at the mine are in fact exposed to very low levels of radiation of the order of between 2 to 4 millisieverts per year. Now, the international standard for exposure in any year is 50 millisieverts. So the question of there being a long-term radiation exposure, health issues and so on is simply fallacious and is recognised by anybody who is truly an expert in the area,” said Walker. The biggest problem, according to Chareyron, is the stability of the mine’s tailings dam. Tailings – a sludge-like waste product – contain hazardous chemicals, including acid used in the processing of uranium concentrate, known as “yellow cake”. “It’s shocking that Paladin has disposed of millions of tons of radioactive and chemically hazardous waste on a plateau with very negative geological and hydrogeological characteristics,” he said. “When we asked its staff if there was an emergency plan … they said no … There should at least be an emergency response plan in case of dam failure.” Walker said the dam had been designed to high standards and had survived an earthquake in December 2009. Before the arrival of the mine, the people of Kayelekera were mainly subsistence farmers. Many hoped the mine would bring prosperity, but the area still lacks paved roads and has neither a hospital nor a water treatment plant. Ironically, it is also without electricity. Tiyowayechi Msiska, a pregnant mother of three children, said she was concerned about pollution in the Sere river and the impacts of dust from rock-blasting at the mine. “We’ve heard that uranium can cause deformities in babies. We’ll have lots of problems if uranium poisons the Sere river. We eat fish, wash our clothes and irrigate our crops, including maize, from the river,” she said. Many residents also complained that Paladin failed to build a promised hospital, although they said the company had dug boreholes, refurbished the under-fives clinic and primary school, and built a community hall. Walker countered that Paladin had never promised a hospital. “What we did say was that we’d build a health clinic in Kayelekera village and that’s something we’re undertaking. We’ve spent in the order of a quarter of a million dollars upgrading the hospital in Karonga township. We spent over $10m building a water-supply scheme,” he said. As the saga rumbles on, NRJN campaigners fear the government may make the same mistakes with other large-scale projects. “It’s giving away licences to explore for oil and gas on Lake Malawi in the absence of a stringent petroleum exploration act … With an old and weak regulatory framework, there’s potential for mining operators to abuse it in their interest to maximise profits,” NRJN’s Mwangonde said. NRJN campaigners say their activism has, at least, given them a voice. The ministry of natural resources, energy and environment is reviewing the draft mines and minerals bill, and is consulting the campaigners on changes. The battle has been long, but Mwangonde says it is necessary. “Someone has to keep the government and industry in check because if we don’t, who’s going to raise critical questions on behalf of the people of Malawi? It’s a risky environment to operate in. But if you stick to the facts and do your job right and don’t say things which are not true, who would challenge the facts?” This article was amended on 3 June 2015, Kossam Munthali is NRJN’s board chairperson, not vice-president. It was further amended on 5 June to clarify that the fish kill was in December 2014 and that the Malawi government had issued a statement to say it was investigating.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/03/lake-malawi-activists-uranium-fears-paladin,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/03/lake-malawi-activists-uranium-fears-paladin
2015-06-02T15:50:07Z,global-development,Global development,Tax dodging by big firms ‘robs poor countries of billions of dollars a year’,"The international corporate tax system is outdated, unfair and will continue to cost developing countries tens of billions of dollars in lost revenues each year unless it is completely overhauled, a coalition of charities and civil society organisations has warned. In a report published on Tuesday, the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (Icrict), which was initiated by the charities and other organisations, argues that globalisation has rendered the century-old global tax system obsolete as more and more companies trade within related corporate structures. “Tax abuse by multinational corporations increases the tax burden on other taxpayers, violates the corporations’ civic obligations, robs developed and developing countries of critical resources to fight poverty and fund public services, exacerbates income inequality, and increases developing country reliance on foreign assistance,” says the report.
On a more basic level, it adds, the tax policies of one country can have a dire effect on other countries’ ability to raise taxes that could be spent on education, healthcare and safe roads. The report calls for the abolition of the separate entity principle, arguing that it allows huge multinational companies to dodge their tax obligations by presenting their operations in different countries as completely independent of one another. The principle permits them to shift their profits to countries with low or zero tax rates – and to move their losses into countries where taxes are higher. “The primary enabler of international corporate tax abuse is the separate entity principle – a legal fiction that enables the flow of vast amounts of taxable income away from the underlying business operations,” it says. “We believe the only effective way to stop this abuse is to treat multinational corporations as single and unified firms and divide the taxable profits between the countries where the income generating activities are located. If multinational corporations were taxed as single and unified firms, there would be no transfer pricing because global corporate profits would be consolidated, and thus no profits would be gained or lost through intra-company transactions.” The report, which was released as G7 leaders prepare to meet in Germany for their annual summit, also calls for rich countries to agree a minimum corporate tax rate to stop “the global race to the bottom”. “While each country is responsible for its own tax system, no country is unaffected by the tax system of others,” it says. “In addition to evaluation of the effectiveness of tax preferences, countries should also examine spillovers caused by their tax preferences for multinational corporations.” Toby Quantrill, principal economic justice adviser at Christian Aid – which is part of the Icrict coalition – said drastic action was required when it came to retooling the international tax system.
“These ideas will be seen by many as radical,” he said. “Such changes will not be easy to implement and will not happen overnight. But as many people know, acknowledging the reality and severity of a problem can be the first step to recovery.” Quantrill said that although the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) had launched a plan to tackle multinational tax dodging, it was focusing on the symptoms rather than the causes. “As a number of reports and analyses are showing, its work so far will be limited in its impact in richer countries and simply will not deal with the fundamental problem for poor countries,” he said. “As an organisation often described as a ‘rich countries club’, it is hardly surprising that the OECD has not prioritised the problems faced by the poorest countries. And let’s be clear, these problems are significant.” A recent report by the UN Conference on Trade and Development estimated that profit-shifting by multinational companies costs developing countries $100bn a year in lost corporate income tax. Another report, by IMF researchers, estimated that developing countries may be losing as much as $213bn a year to tax avoidance. Oxfam – which published its own report on tax avoidance on Tuesday – says that corporate tax avoidance in the form of trade mispricing by G7-based companies and investors cost Africa $6bn in 2010 alone. According to the NGO, the sum is more than three times the amount needed to improve the healthcare systems in the Ebola-affected countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and at-risk Guinea Bissau. Oxfam and others are calling for the British government to introduce a tax-dodging bill that would oblige UK companies to pay tax in the countries where they operate – and would also make it harder for big companies to avoid paying tax in the UK. “Multinational companies, many with headquarters in the UK and other G7 countries, are cheating African countries out of billions of dollars in vital tax revenues that could help vulnerable people get decent healthcare and send their children to school,” said Nick Bryer, Oxfam’s head of UK campaigns. “To fund the fight against poverty and to tackle worsening extreme inequality, we need action to ensure big companies pay their fair share, here and in the world’s poorest nations.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/02/tax-dodging-big-companies-costs-poor-countries-billions-dollars,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/02/tax-dodging-big-companies-costs-poor-countries-billions-dollars
2015-06-02T11:32:15Z,global-development,Global development,Global ranking on corruption and justice aims to promote good governance,"Denmark topped the list in a new study ranking countries on how the rule of law is experienced by citizens. Britain came 12th and Venezuela trailed in last place. The World Justice Project (WJP) says that its Rule of Law Index, which ranks 102 countries, is the most comprehensive of its kind and the only one to rely on primary data. The scores are based on responses from 1,000 people in each country, who were asked questions about corruption, basic freedoms, regulation and other governance issues, and on testimonies from local legal experts. The reports’ authors said their work had informed ongoing discussions around the post-2015 development agenda, which places greater emphasis on good governance and rule of law as agents of economic and social progress. The proposed sustainable development goals (SDGs), meant to guide development priorities until 2030, include commitments to promote the rule of law, ensure equal access to justice, end corruption, and ensure transparent and accountable institutions.
Juan Carlos Botero, executive director of WJP and one of the report’s authors, said the study could help countries produce their own indicators on these issues. “Areas of rule of law tend to be sensitive ... but just as countries measure economic indicators and health indicators with certain levels of uniformity, they should be able to measure justice and corruption and governance in the same way,” Botero said. Alejandro Ponce, chief research officer at WJP and co-author of the report, said rule of law and justice were critical for development but admitted this idea still faced opposition as countries hammer out the details of the SDGs and their specific targets ahead of a summit at the UN in September to ratify the goals. “Several countries still do not agree that this is an issue that should be taken into account in the SDGs. There has been a lot of push back and forth on whether this is a topic that really needs consideration and really needs to be included in this framework,” he said. “Without progress towards stronger, more efficient institutions … rule of law, justice and government accountability, other aspects of development cannot progress. There is growing recognition of that fact … and there is growing awareness among governments that those issues are measurable and that they impact development goals.” WJP noted that its survey did not include countries in conflict, such as Syria and Libya, or nations where state institutions were particularly weak, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The indicators used in the study were: constraints on government power; absence of corruption; open government; fundamental rights; order and security; regulatory enforcement; civil justice; criminal justice and informal justice.
Each indicator encompassed several elements. For example, within constraints on government power, was the question of whether government powers are effectively limited by legislative and judicial bodies, whether officials are sanctioned for misconduct, and whether transition of power is subject to the law. The US stood in 19th place in the rankings, just below France (18). Russia was in 75th place, below China (71) and Ukraine (70). Turkey stood in 80th place, just below Mexico at 79. Afghanistan was the second-worst country, with Zimbabwe ranking 100th. Botero said Venezuela had occupied the last place for several years. “The situation has continued to deteriorate … In various aspects of the rule of law – from police brutality, police accountability, freedom of speech, checks and balances on government, corruption – the government of Venezuela and the institutions, in general, are lagging behind the rest of the countries,” he said. The survey also sought to gauge perceptions of corruption: people from sub-Saharan Africa held the most negative view of corruption in institutions, while 47 countries identified parliament or congress as the institution with the most corrupt members, with 32 countries putting the police in first place.
“That was a little surprising to me,” said Botero. “People interact with local governments and the police much more often than they do with national institutions.” When asked if they had to pay a bribe when stopped or detained by the police, 58% of those questioned in sub-Saharan Africa said yes, compared with 43% in eastern Europe and central Asia, and 23% in the Middle East and north Africa. In Europe, it was just 9%. “The rule of law is not the rule of lawyers and judges; all elements of society are stakeholders,” the report said. “It is our hope that, over time, this diagnostic tool will help identify strengths and weaknesses in each country under review and encourage policy choices that strength the rule of law.” Botero said countries had to tackle issues such as corruption and access to justice by themselves. “They should be able to make progress in the absence of external influences because at the end of the day, it is a homegrown culture of rule of law that we are trying to promote. It’s not the west, or anybody else, telling other countries what they should do.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2015/jun/02/global-ranking-corruption-world-justice-project-aims-promote-good-governance,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/datablog/2015/jun/02/global-ranking-corruption-world-justice-project-aims-promote-good-governance
2015-06-01T23:05:01Z,global-development,Global development,The phone app challenging violence against women in a Mumbai slum | KumKum Dasgupta,"Bhanuben lets out a throaty laugh when asked if the men of Dharavi are scared of her and her team. “Not yet ... but they are a tad wary of us these days,” says the 42-year-old community worker for SNEHA (Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action), a Mumbai-based NGO. Mumbai’s Dharavi slum is home to anywhere between 300,000 and 1 million people. Bhanuben was born and brought up here and knows the place like the back of her hand, and the challenges of surviving in this “teeming slum of 1 million souls”. “There is a high incidence of gender violence here, but I have been lucky,” says Bhanuben, a mother of two sons, adding: “My husband is a good man.”
Violence against women is pervasive in India and much of it – domestic violence, dowry deaths, acid attacks, honour killings, rape, abduction and cruelty – is at the hands of family members. Data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) shows that an Indian woman is most unsafe in her marital home: 43.6% of all crimes against women are by husbands and relatives. In multi-ethnic Dharavi, the problem is compounded by the fact that most women are poor and uneducated. The relentless pressure to survive, lack of space and unhygienic living conditions lead to malnutrition, deprivation and disease – and often abuse of vulnerable women and children. SNEHA started working with women in Dharavi in 2001 and has since supported 300,000 women and mobilised 130 women’s groups to educate and support survivors of violence. “While the number of cases of domestic violence has been increasing every year in the slum, we felt there was a gap in reporting of such incidents thanks to lack of a support structure and societal norms that force women to keep quiet,” says Nayreen Daruwalla, director of SNEHA’s prevention of violence against women and children programme. To improve reporting of violence, SNEHA launched the Little Sister Project in 2014. Funded by the UN development programme, the project trained 160 local women to identify and report incidents of gender violence using Android smartphones that are loaded with an open data kit (ODK) form and an app called EyeWatch. “Earlier we would write the case details in a register... it was cumbersome. But now with ODK, we do it electronically,” explains Bhanuben. The information is then stored in a central database maintained by SNEHA. The identity of survivors is kept private. The EyeWatch app, which has been developed by a firm called Indianeye Security, is a mobile-based platform that allows the community workers, known locally as sanginis, to take audio and visual clips if they witness an incident. Once the app is activated and an alert has been raised, a call goes through to an SNEHA employee who can offer assistance. “This technology helps us crowdsource cases of violence, track cases of repeat violence and understand more about the prevalence of violence in Dharavi,” says Daruwalla. “We believe reporting violence is the first step in preventing violence.”
The app, SNEHA believes, encourages increased reporting of violence, lets community members know what assistance is available, and helps NGOs understand more about the prevalence of violence in Dharavi. The interaction is two-way: sometimes sanginis come to know about a case and approach the survivor; at other times, survivors seek out sanginis to report incidents. “Our volunteers are trained to advise survivors on [the] availability of medical help and also on how to approach the police.” Once cases are brought to SNEHA’s centre, counsellors help survivors file police reports and offer legal support, says Daruwalla. Earlier this year, SNEHA promoted its work at the inaugural Dharavi biennale. Using scrap denim pieces and discarded objects, sanginis created an art project called Mapping the Hurt, an innovative visualisation of gender violence in the slum. But if tracking and reporting violence is one part of the challenge, the next big hurdle is getting the police to act. “Whenever we go to the police to report on domestic violence, they are reluctant to file a case. They say such issues should be settled at home,” explains Bhanuben. Even if a case is lodged, low conviction rates strengthen the impression that there is little point in reporting the crime. Further, a lack of understanding of gender issues, violence and entrenched views about women’s status among lawyers and judges often encourages outcomes that favour reconciliations, overlooking a woman’s needs and demands. Data collected from July to December last year by SNEHA showed that of the 345 cases analysed, only 19% were reported to the police.The NGO’s outreach programme has trained 4,500 police officers and cadets in Mumbai and more than 2,100 public hospital staff to help them identify evidence of violence among patients. Bhanuben says that along with being a support group, sanginis are friends with whom women can sit and chat. “Sometimes we go for an outing … to get some fresh air. To outsiders, this camaraderie may not mean much, but for us this is oxygen to survive in this challenging atmosphere.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/02/phone-app-challenging-violence-against-women-mumbai-slum-dharavi,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/02/phone-app-challenging-violence-against-women-mumbai-slum-dharavi

Share your photos and stories,"As G7 leaders meet for their annual summit on 7 June, hundreds of anti-poverty campaigners are expected to travel to Germany this week to call for action to stamp out tax evasion and increase aid for the world’s poorest countries. The G7 member countries – the UK, US, France, Germany, Italy and Japan and Canada (it should be the G8, but Russia has been excluded) – will meet in the Bavarian village of Schloss Elmau to discuss global and economic policies. African heads of state will join leaders on the second day of the summit for talks on growth and development in the lead-up to adopting the new sustainable development agenda in September. Among the campaigners set to gather at the talks will be 250 young people calling for greater action on extreme poverty and inequality. The contingent of youth ambassadors will travel to Germany from around the globe as part of their involvement in One campaign’s movement for more aid to be allocated to the world’s poorest. One campaigners were in Dresden for the G7 finance ministers’ meeting last week, where they installed large balloons bearing the faces of heads of state as they demanded “more than hot air” from the talks.

2015-06-01T06:00:12Z,global-development,Global development,EU draws fire for failing to set date for 0.7% aid target,"The EU has come under fire for failing to set a deadline for its own financial commitments to aid, a move that activists say could threaten wider talks on funding an ambitious development agenda. A critical funding summit in Addis Ababa in July is meant to agree how to finance development priorities for the next 15 years. The sustainable development goals (SDGs), which will replace the millennium development goals when they expire this year, will be ratified in September. But campaigners say that, without concrete progress in Addis Ababa, the entire process is in jeopardy. “The EU is absolutely central for any global agreement, and unless the ministers become more ambitious, there is a very real risk that the international negotiations will collapse,” said Tove Maria Ryding, head of tax justice and financing for development at the European Network on Debt and Development (Eurodad). “This would not only be a missed opportunity to repair the broken financial system and mobilise the funding we need to end poverty. It could also cost us the new sustainable development goals as well as the climate treaty, which is supposed to be adopted at the end of the year,” she added in a statement released after a meeting last week of the EU’s Foreign Affairs Council on Development. The council set out the EU’s vision of a new global partnership for sustainable development, including a renewal of member states’ pledges to commit 0.7% of gross national income to aid. But it gave no concrete deadline, saying the target would be achieved “within the timeframe of the post-2015 agenda”.
Concord, the European confederation for relief and development, described the pledge as “vague and non-binding” and said 2020 should be the new deadline. “[EU member states] clearly couldn’t reach an agreement and this was a diplomatic fudge, which says nothing really,” said Jean Saldanha, the chair of Concord’s financing for development taskforce. She said the draft outcome document for the Addis meeting set 2020 as a deadline for the 0.7% target. “The question now is whether the EU is going to kill that 2020 deadline at the international level. It would really be a scandal if they did,” said Saldanha, who also works at Cidse, an alliance of Catholic development agencies. Donor nations have generally failed to fulfil the promise made at the Gleneagles G8 summit of 2005 to meet the UN target. Only five countries – Sweden, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark and Britain – achieved the 0.7% level in 2014. The council’s new global partnership also emphasised the role of the private sector in ending poverty and the use of public funds to subsidise or “leverage” private investment in a process known as blending. This reliance on the private sector was also a concern for campaigners, with Eurodad decrying a “controversial and problematic reliance on private finance”. The European parliament has said that “blended finance must not replace state responsibility for delivering on social needs and should be aligned with national development objectives and with development effectiveness principles”. It also called for the adoption of international standards and debt risk analysis for blending projects and public-private partnerships that attract private finance and support local businesses. “The EU’s continued and uncritical focus on private finance is extremely worrying,” said María José Romero, policy and advocacy manager at Eurodad. “There is a serious lack of evidence that the existing investments are reducing poverty in any significant way … Companies are mainly attracted to middle-income countries where they can make profits.” For Saldanha, the EU placed too much faith in the private sector as an “engine for transformation”.
“We have heard from private sector actors that they do not see this role for themselves, so our question is: who is going to drive this transformative agenda?” she said, adding that EU officials at the Addis preparatory talks in New York were pushing blending hard, describing it as innovative finance. “That’s making the whole discussion on innovative finance really toxic. As civil society, we are really furious that lumping innovative finance and blending together has made it really difficult to push the boundaries on the intentional consensus on progressive taxes like financial transaction taxes,” she said. The UK’s aid watchdog recently said that Britain’s Department for International Development was failing to capitalise on partnerships with the private sector because of a lack of concrete targets and detailed operational plans. Eurodad also criticised the EU policy document for failing to back a push for an intergovernmental body under UN auspices to set global standards on tax. “It will look strange if the European Union, which prides itself on being democratic, defends the right of an exclusive club of countries to decide the global tax standards behind closed doors,” said Ryding. In a report last December, Eurodad said that the world’s poorest countries had lost more than $2 for every $1 gained since 2008, with illicit financial flows, profits taken out by foreign companies, debt repayments and lending to rich countries responsible for most of the outflow. Saldanha said she feared the Addis meeting would deliver a weak agreement with low-level political support, noting that few European states were planning to send high-level delegations. “The EU is just going to play the negotiations with whatever tactics they can to weaken the agreement to the lowest common denominator, so that whatever we get out of Addis will be so weak that we might as well have not had an agreement at all.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/01/european-union-aid-target-deadline-2020,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jun/01/european-union-aid-target-deadline-2020
2015-05-29T12:13:19Z,global-development,Global development,Nigeria's free and fair elections are an inspiration for nascent democracies | Kofi Annan,"For the first time in Nigeria’s history, an elected president is today handing power to another elected president following an election that was, by and large, free, fair and comparatively peaceful. President Goodluck Jonathan, in particular, deserves much credit for conceding defeat promptly and elegantly.
I was present when, just three months ago, Jonathan and his main opponent, the incoming president General Muhammadu Buhari, agreed to peaceful presidential elections by signing an inter-party agreement. This committed them and their parties to taking active measures to prevent electoral violence before, during and after the elections. They also agreed to respect the outcome of the ballot. It was an important message, reassuring to both Nigerians and their neighbours, and my foundation and I were pleased to add our support to the electoral effort. But was this message heard beyond Nigeria’s borders? The spread of elections across the world has been one of the most dramatic changes I have witnessed over the course of my career. In country after country, people have risked their lives to be able to vote. Elections are the indispensable tool of democracy. But in recent years, flawed elections have often eroded the trust of citizens in the democratic process. Election-related violence in countries as disparate as Egypt, Ukraine, Thailand and more recently Burundi demonstrated how elections, which are meant to promote stability and facilitate the peaceful transfer of power, can become divisive if the process is not handled professionally, transparently and with integrity. It is not surprising that when elections are seen as a mere technical exercise enabling a person or a group to accede to or remain in power in an otherwise wholly undemocratic context, they quickly become a source of disillusionment and violence. While no election is ever perfect, not even in the most developed and stable democracies, people want their elections to be fair and credible.
The lesson we are learning is that elections alone are not enough, even if all technical and organisational procedures are respected. The reason is simple: democracy is not just about legality, critical though the rule of law is for a peaceful society; it is about legitimacy. Elections must offer genuine choice. On the other hand, if the elections that brought a government to power are seen as rigged or unfair, and the subsequent government does not govern in a democratic manner, it will not enjoy any of the benefits associated with democracy. Indeed, it will find it ever harder to govern at all. The challenge facing nascent and established democracies alike is to ensure that elections are couched in a democratic spirit, and backed up by strong institutions that can ensure and sustain electoral integrity. The outgoing president has paved the way for peaceful transition. It now befalls president-elect Buhari to govern in a democratic spirit, strengthening public institutions and ensuring that forthcoming elections at local or parliamentary level do not revert to the old ways. Let us hope that Nigeria’s recent elections were not a lucky exception but instead signal a new democratic departure from which other countries in Africa and beyond can draw inspiration as they too face the complicated and sometimes perilous challenge of managing political transition.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/29/nigeria-elections-free-fair-democracy-kofi-annan,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/29/nigeria-elections-free-fair-democracy-kofi-annan
2015-05-28T18:30:10Z,global-development,Global development,Asian refugee crisis: trafficked migrants held off Thailand in vast 'camp boats',"Thousands of Bangladeshi and ethnic Rohingya migrants are being held in huge cargo ships by human traffickers in the Andaman Sea, according to testimony collected from survivors. First-hand accounts indicate that trafficking syndicates trading in vulnerable migrants have responded to a recent crackdown by authorities in Thailand and Malaysia by holding their victims in large vessels close to international waters, where they are ransomed for their freedom in return for money from relatives.
The practice, which has been accompanied by violence and other abuses, mirrors the fate of victims held in camps recently discovered by officials in southern Thailand and Malaysia, where dozens of mass graves have yet to be unearthed according to survivors who spoke to the Arakan Project. There is one crucial difference, however: the bodies of the dead were dumped overboard into the ocean, with no hope of being recovered.“The traffickers will not abandon their business, so they have now started putting ‘camps’ in the sea,” said Chris Lewa, founder of the Arakan Project. “Since the end of February, we now have thousands and thousands of people stuck at sea, and I think we already have more death than even at the camps in Thailand.” A survivor from one ship who agreed to be interviewed on condition of anonymity described an ordeal of violence and sexual abuse accompanied by demands for ransom payment. She described a ship containing “six storeys in total: three above deck, three below. The men and women were separated.”As a result of this arrangement, the women on the ship were targeted by sexually predatory crew members, she claimed. A girl “around 12 years old” who was “very beautiful” was taken to a room by a group of men and was “not released from the ship”, she recalled.
Other women onboard were subjected to similar treatment, she said, adding: “If the women did not go, they were beaten.” Recalling other aspects of her ordeal onboard the vessel, the woman said: “Food rations were not enough … when I asked for more, they beat me.” She was accompanied by her three children during her time on the ship. In other testimony collected by the Arakan Project, a 19-year-old Rohingya man from Burma’s northern Rakhine state described his journey on one of the boats last year. After nine days at sea on a Burmese cattle ship, his vessel joined with a bigger boat not far from the Thai shore. He estimated there were more than 1,000 people onboard, roughly one-third of whom were women. “I spent 14 days on this ship. Three days after we were transferred, three smugglers arrived from Malaysia and boarded our ship. They carried mobile phones. They first asked who had phone numbers and, one by one, we started calling our relatives. Those [who did not provide] phone numbers were beaten,” he recalled.
“The smugglers ordered passengers to beat them with engine chains wrapped in plastic and plastic pipes with something heavy inside. Even those with phone numbers were beaten,” he said. The abuses continued until families sent money, after which survivors were taken to shore by small fishing boats. “Before I left, I witnessed three men who had become paralysed and one dead body was thrown overboard,” he added. A survivor from northern Thailand who spoke to the Guardian by phone described similar treatment. “I stayed on the boats for three months from February this year until April. I remember people were beaten every day, sometimes two or three times a day. Those who could not pay were beaten. “I think there were more than one-and-a-half thousand people on that boat,” he estimated. Abdul Kalam, an adviser to Thai police, told Channel 4 News that refugees were being taken offshore for months. He said that a tanker ship has been deployed as a camp. “It has been out for two months and is moving all the time. The ship has got 2,000 people on it. The traffickers are relocating their camps because so much money is involved.” The testimony of survivors has been reinforced by the accounts of Rohingya helped to shore by fishermen in north and east Aceh, Indonesia, after being stranded at sea. Visitors to the tightly-controlled camps containing the refugees heard multiple accounts of the use of large “camp boats” at sea.
“I have just spent a week in Aceh working in three camps with my local humanitarian team, and we have conducted interviews with dozens of Rohingya and Bangladeshi survivors. Many of them spoke of being held in offshore camps on big ships in international waters,” said Lilianne Fan, a research associate with the Humanitarian Policy Group. Htike Htike, co-founder of the Bangkok-based Equal Harmony Together project, who also went to Aceh, offered a similar account. “ I conducted 30 interviews in Aceh. During that time many people spoke of the use of ‘camp boats’ where they were forced to call their family to ask for money,” she said.A 15-year-old survivor recalled seeing 34 people die from sickness during a 40-day stay onboard one of the huge camp vessels. “Crew members threw the dead bodies overboard,” he said. He even saw the dead from other ships. “About the 20th day of waiting in the Andaman Sea, another two cargo boats arrived. They were smaller than our boat and they anchored near our boat … I saw people who had died in those two boats: eight bodies were thrown overboard from one boat and the following day another 13 bodies were thrown from the other boat. I do not know how they had died.” This article was amended on 29 May 2015. The original stated that Rohingya had been helped by fishermen in Banda Aceh. This has been changed to north and east Aceh.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/28/asian-refugee-crisis-trafficked-migrants-held-off-thailand-camp-boats,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/28/asian-refugee-crisis-trafficked-migrants-held-off-thailand-camp-boats
2015-05-28T15:09:25Z,global-development,Global development,Sri Lanka accused of waging 'silent war' as Tamil land is appropriated by army,"Six years after the end of Sri Lanka’s long and bloody civil war, a “silent” conflict is being waged across the island, with tens of thousands of government troops continuing to occupy the north and east and the army expanding its property developments on land belonging to displaced Tamils, a new report claims. Although the 26-year-long conflict between the majority Sinhalese government and Tamil separatists finally ended in 2009 with the defeat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE), the study by the US-based thinktank the Oakland Institute finds little meaningful evidence of reconciliation.
It says hopes of peaceful coexistence are being thwarted by the enduring displacement of Tamils, the appropriation of their land by the military, the new government’s refusal to take the country off its war footing, and the delay in investigating allegations of war crimes committed by both state forces and the Tamil Tigers. “Six years later, a silent war continues under a different guise,” says the report, The Long Shadow of War: the Struggle for Justice in Postwar Sri Lanka. “One major issue is the continued displacement of people from their lands and homes as a result of persistent military occupation of the northern and eastern provinces.” The study says thousands of Tamils are still internally displaced and without homes and livelihoods, adding that those who have been “resettled” through government schemes have often been moved involuntarily to areas that lack proper infrastructure. Equally disruptive is the Sri Lankan army’s ongoing occupation of what the government terms “high security zones” in the north and east of the country. The reports estimates that in 2014, there were at least 160,000 almost entirely Sinhalese soldiers stationed in the north. With the area’s population standing at a little more than 1 million people, the occupation means there is one soldier for every six civilians. One woman, whose husband was arrested by the army in 1990 and has not been seen since, told the report’s authors that she and her family had been forced from their home by the army the same year and were still unable to return. “Today, my home is still occupied by the army, which pays LKR 300 [$2.25; £1.60] a month for the land,” she said. “I went to the human rights commission … and to the district officer to protest the continued occupation of my home. The army says, ‘If the government asks us to move, we will vacate the lands.’ But there is no legal procedure to obtain my land back.” Having lived in a camp for internally displaced people and then a village that was destroyed by the 2004 tsunami, the woman now relies on a charity to put a roof over her head. “I have no hope of my husband returning – I hear there are mass graves of the missing – nor that the government will return my land,” she said. “I hear that the UN is investigating. I want the UN to know and investigate what I have gone through.” The report argues that the military occupation has long ceased to be about ensuring security.
“The army has expanded non-military activities and is engaged in large-scale property development, construction projects, and business ventures such as travel agencies, farming, holiday resorts, restaurants, and innumerable cafes that dot the highways in the northern and eastern provinces,” it says. “The army officially runs luxury resorts and golf courses that have been erected on land seized from now–internally displaced peoples.” It says tourists can book holidays at luxury beach resorts by calling numbers at the ministry of defence, adding: “These resorts and businesses are located on lands that were previously home to the local Tamil population, who were displaced by the war. They see no sign of return, despite numerous demands and petitions.” The study says the recent land grabs fall into an old and familiar pattern that has resulted in the marginalisation of Sri Lanka’s Tamil population through violence, pogroms, repressive laws and a “government-orchestrated colonisation of the northern and eastern parts” of the island, traditionally the Tamils’ homeland. Despite the optimism that greeted Maithripala Sirisena’s surprise victory over Mahinda Rajapaksa in January’s presidential election, the report says the new administration has shown little sign so far of abandoning the battlefield mentality that was the hallmark of Rajapaksa’s regime. In February, President Sirisena extended an order made by his predecessor that transferred police powers to the armed forces. “The notification … calling out the armed forces to exercise police powers under the pretext of public security does not bode well for a return to civilian administration,” says the report. “Instead, the notification suggests concerns around public security and the inadequacy of the police to deal with the situation.” It also noted that Sirisena’s administration had succeeded in persuading the UN to delay the publication of its report on war crimes and human rights abuses, which were alleged to have been committed by both sides in the final stages of the civil war. The government said the six-month postponement would “give space for the domestic investigation process”. The report concludes that it remains to be seen whether Sri Lanka’s new government will deliver on all the promises it has made the international community. “The determination and willingness of the international community to ensure justice for the minorities in Sri Lanka, especially the Tamils, is also an open question,” it says. “One thing is clear: the human rights situation in Sri Lanka will not improve until the culture of impunity is replaced with a culture of responsibility, accountability, and fulfilment of full rights of the Tamil community and all other minorities in the country.” The Sri Lanka High Commission in London rejected several of the report’s assertions, saying the Oakland Institute had overestimated both the number of troops in the northern province and the extent of the military’s property development programme. It said the number of soldiers deployed in the north was “much less” than 160,000, adding that troops were deployed in different provinces of Sri Lanka according to local security assessments. The high commission went on: “The reference to the army being engaged in ‘large- scale’ property development, construction projects and business ventures is an exaggeration. However, it may be noted that the new government has pledged to ensure that the military does not engage in civilian areas such as commercial activities – which was permitted by the previous government – and steps are being taken in this regard.” As a first step, it said, 1,000 acres of land in the Palali high-security zone in the far north of the island were released in March from the control of the army and air force to allow the resettlement of families displaced by the conflict. Similar releases were under way elsewhere in Sir Lanka, it added. The high commission said that while the armed forces had operated some “welfare shops” in resettlement areas where there was no commercial activity, the shops had now been closed. On the president’s decision to extend policing powers to the military, it said: “The public security ordinance which confers police powers to armed forces had been in place for many decades … President Maithripala Sirisena only extended it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/28/sri-lanka-army-land-grabs-tamil-displacement-report-oakland-institute,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/28/sri-lanka-army-land-grabs-tamil-displacement-report-oakland-institute
2015-05-28T13:38:17Z,global-development,Global development,Kyrgyzstan strives to make inroads on poor maternal health record | Liz Ford,"Aiperi Isaeva, 23, travelled to Bishkek from her village in Issyk-Kul to give birth to her second child. The distance to the Kyrgyzstan capital is about 400km, but there is no maternity hospital in her village. Isaeva, a primary school teacher, experienced no complications during labour and gave birth to a healthy baby girl. “The birth went well, everything was good, and I had very experienced doctors,” she says, speaking through a translator in a small, warm, three-bedded room in maternity hospital no 2.
In the room next door, Elvira Dairbek, 24, is recovering from the birth of her son, who arrived the same day. It’s her third child, and the birth went without a hitch. Dairbek, who is in the final year of a finance degree, says she will be leaving hospital the next day. Her grandmother has arrived to help take care of her and her two other young sons. Her husband and parents live and work in Moscow. “The service here is very good,” she says, cuddling her newborn son. Both women’s experiences are testament to the work being done in Kyrgyzstan to improve health services over the past decade, and in particular to decrease maternal and child deaths. The country has successfully reduced under-five mortality from more than 40 deaths for every 1,000 live births in 1990 to 23 in 2012. But lowering the maternal mortality rate is proving considerably harder. Kyrgyzstan has the highest maternal mortality rates among eastern European and central Asian countries, and is way off track to meet the 2015 deadline for the millennium development goal (MDG) on maternal mortality, which aimed to reduce by three-quarters the number of women dying as a result of childbirth.
Figures vary, but the latest data from the World Bank estimates that the number of women dying in childbirth for every 100,000 live births in Kyrgyzstan is 75, down only slightly from about 85 in 1990. The country’s MDG target is 15. A 2013 report from the UN development programme found that most maternal fatalities were avoidable, with deaths from haemorraghing, acute sepsis, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia remaining stubbornly high. Previous health programmes, including free healthcare for pregnant women and improvements to obstetric and gynaecological services, have made some inroads. But positive change has been largely dependent on where you live and whether you have money. Women’s lack of economic independence – particularly in rural parts of the country, where two-thirds of the population live – has a significant bearing on maternal health. In poorer, rural areas, women were less likely to receive adequate prenatal care. Fear of being sacked from their jobs made them less inclined to take maternity leave, and they also had difficulty affording drugs, such as iron tablets for anaemia (which can lead to premature births if left untreated). According to the country’s national statistics committee, 64% of women in Kyrgyzstan have anaemia, more than twice the number in 1990. Funding for maternal health services has increased, largely thanks to donor funding. Between 2004 and 2011, funding rose from 213.5m soms (more than $3.6m, or £2.35m) to 761.1 million soms. But as a percentage of the entire health budget, the amount is small, and has fallen over that period from 9.9% to 7.9%. But a three-year, $11m programme between the World Bank and the ministry of health, launched last year, aims to address the disparities and accelerate progress on cutting maternal deaths. Bishkek’s maternity hospital no 2 is one of more than 40 health centres around the country involved in a pilot, a key part of which will involve training to improve staff skills. “90% [of maternal deaths] were found to be preventable, the result of the levels of skills of the staff and the speed of getting medicine to people,” says Arsen Askerov, president of the Kyrgyz Association of Obstetricians, Gynaecologists and Neonatologists. “We need more skills than resources.” While international guidelines on antenatal care – which stipulate that women should receive at least four visits with a health professional – are widely adhered to in the country, the quality of that care is poor, adds Askerov. “There are not enough competent specialists,” he says. “We have young specialists who don’t have a high level of skills. In rural areas there is a lack of specialists.”
Although the programme is still in its early stages – it ends in 2017 – Askerov is optimistic it will produce results. “We hope that improved services will reduce deaths. We will be trying over the next three years as much as possible to strengthen these services.” But another element that needs attention is raising awareness around reproductive health, not least by ensuring that women know the danger signs of pregnancy and, crucially, have access to decent family planning services that – as well as reducing the number of teen births and decreasing the number of abortions – would allow them to space pregnancies. Kyrgyzstan is one of the 69 priority countries under the Family Planning 2020 global partnership, which is working to increase access to modern forms of contraception for 120 million more women and girls globally by 2020. The percentage of women of reproductive age using a modern form of contraception in Kyrgyzstan is about 24%. Sitting on her bed in the maternity hospital, Dairbek, who was married at 18, says she didn’t use contraception. “We’re not allowed to take contraceptives in our family,” she says. “My mother didn’t use it.” It was not in her plans to have children so quickly after marriage – her eldest son is four – and although she says she’s “very happy” to have three sons, she adds: “For the next five years, no babies.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/28/maternal-mortality-kyrgyzstan-poor-record,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/28/maternal-mortality-kyrgyzstan-poor-record
2015-05-28T12:08:43Z,global-development,Global development,Inequality has transformed surviving childhood into a global postcode lottery | Flavia Bustreo,"You may already know the grim statistics: every day, 17,000 children under the age of five die; nearly half of them are newborn babies. Almost all these deaths – which occur in just a handful of countries – could be prevented. The inequalities between countries are stark. A child born in Angola is 84 times more likely to die before the age of five than a child born in Luxembourg.
Contrary to what you might think, this is not just an issue in poor countries. It applies to poor communities everywhere, including those in some of the richest countries. Every child’s life is precious. But right now, a child’s chance of survival is determined almost entirely by luck: where he or she is born, the income and education level of the parents, and other social and environmental factors that have a direct impact on health. This means that despite the progress achieved, we have failed to reach the ones who need it the most – the poorest, the most disadvantaged, the most vulnerable. It is inexcusable that so many children die because they miss out on basic, cost-effective health services. So what do we need to fill this equity gap? A skilled health workforce. Many newborn deaths can be prevented by having a trained birth attendant nearby, someone with knowledge of simple, life-saving methods such as kangaroo mother care and exclusive breastfeeding, the latter of which is the single most effective intervention in high mortality settings. Skilled health workers are critical for providing care during childbirth and in the crucial week that follows, when more than 40% of child deaths occur. Bringing care close to home. A key strategy in reaching the “unreachable” in remote areas is to make care more readily available by training local community members to give basic healthcare and treat common childhood illnesses. Antibiotics would prevent most child deaths from pneumonia and other infections. But access to these medicines remains difficult in the places where child death rates are highest. Removing legal barriers that prevent health workers from administering antibiotics for pneumonia would also save children’s lives.
Political commitment. Most important is political will and providing universal coverage to vulnerable populations. Countries such as India and Brazil, with strong economic disparities, are tackling inequalities and have set up special programmes to ensure free essential care to pregnant women, babies and young children. The results have been remarkable. Brazil’s infant mortality rate dropped from 47.1 deaths for every 1,000 live births in 1990 to 20 in 2007. And in India over the same period, under-five child mortality dropped 54.4% – from 118 to 52 deaths for every 1,000 live births. I was recently in New York, where the UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon convened world leaders to commit to a strategy for women’s, children’s and adolescents’ health. Ban brings strong global leadership to this approach, which looks to save lives through a focus on equity and human rights, and will serve as a platform for implementing the sustainable development goals, which will be adopted at the UN general assembly in New York in September. As we move beyond the era of the millennium development goals, we, the global community, must seize the opportunity to work together. The gaps created by inequality must be bridged, and the conditions created for a healthy, sustainable future for every infant, child and person, regardless of where they live. We need action at the highest level, with commitments and resources to back it up. Let’s not forget that action does not only rely on political commitment or the availability of medical knowhow. It must be founded on a recognition that our newborns and young children are not mere recipients of care, but are “rights holders” of their own, with legal entitlements to survival and the highest possible standards of health and care. Both in law and in practice. For all children. Without discrimination. Dr Flavia Bustreo is assistant director general for family, women’s and children’s health at the World Health Organisation.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/28/infant-child-death-inequality-surviving-childhood-global-postcode-lottery,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/28/infant-child-death-inequality-surviving-childhood-global-postcode-lottery
2015-05-28T09:35:26Z,global-development,Global development,Your stories on childbirth and maternal healthcare around the world,"While progress has been made on ensuring that more women survive childbirth, basic maternal healthcare remains out of reach for millions of women. Around 800 women die each day from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. As the UN prepares to phase out its millennium development goals, which included the target of cutting maternal deaths by 75%, we asked readers to share their stories of maternal healthcare provision. Here are some of the responses we received. ‘I gave birth on my wedding day. The baby was three months early’ Toyin Ojora-Saraki, Nigeria
I gave birth to twins – on my wedding day – in an urban maternity hospital in my home country of Nigeria. The birth was three months premature, and midwives and doctors were present, but there was a fatal delay in finding an anaesthetist to enable an emergency caesarean section by general anaesthetic since an epidural was neither offered nor available. I had been preparing for the birth in the UK, receiving prenatal care in London from consultants. As it was a multiple birth, prenatal consultants provided consistent care in the months leading up to my due date. However, I had to prepare for my wedding in Nigeria and had to travel to the country before my due date. I was assured that it should be fine to return home, get married, and make it back to London in time to give birth. Yet on my wedding day, and within only 24 hours, I got married, gave birth three months prematurely, and lost one of my twin babies in childbirth. We were fortunate, however, that as soon as the emergency arose, I immediately received two of an indicated three steroid injections to help my babies’ lungs mature faster. I came close to death myself, having become severely anaemic. I had to fight to save my life and the life of the surviving twin. In getting through this harrowing process, my child and I are very lucky to be here today. The care following the birth was diligent, but uncomfortable and difficult due to a lack of modern resources. Three days after giving birth in the hospital, I suffered from painful engorgement and had to express my breast milk. The nurses treating me handed me a white plastic bucket, without explaining what I should do. They began pressing my breasts to pump milk into the bucket, leading to a lot of crying and pain on my part. Knowing that an experience like mine is all-too-common for mothers and infants around the world is heartbreaking, but it could have been worse, because, in fact, 14% of Nigerian women give birth without anyone present. Some of these women – if they survive – suffer permanent birth injuries. Stillbirths often go unrecorded, let alone lead to counselling. This is why I started the Wellbeing Foundation Africa, which works to improve maternal, newborn, and child health across the continent.
‘Healthcare is underfunded in Poland, but I got the care I needed’ Claudia, Poland I decided to share my story because I was very satisfied with the care I received in a public hospital in eastern Europe and I thought this might go against the usual complaints we hear about public healthcare in this part of the world. At 35 weeks of pregnancy, I was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis [a liver condition], which meant I had to stay in hospital until 37 weeks, when a baby is considered full term, and have an induced labour. I received excellent care for the almost three weeks while I was in hospital, from a team of midwives in Warsaw. I even got to choose a vegan diet. At this hospital, women in labour are taken to newly renovated rooms, where conditions are very good: there is a bath, a private toilet, birthing balls and mattresses and many other items to use for finding comfort during labour. I gave birth with the midwife on call, who was extremely patient and discreet. I’m just happy to say that we got this very warm, thoughtful care at a public hospital despite health systems in Poland and the rest of eastern European countries being systematically underfunded. While I was in the hospital, I read a notice on the wall which said that state support for this hospital covers about two-thirds of the cost of a birth and that they do need support from donations and philanthropists, but it seems that they do manage in the end to find the funds they need. Or they manage somehow to compensate with love and care. ‘My mother didn’t see a doctor for her entire pregnancy’ Name withheld, Malawi This is not my birthing story but my mother’s. She had my brother at age 16 and me at 18 in Malawi. My mum never talked about her pregnancy or childbirth experiences, and it was only recently, on a return home to see her, that I found out she had given birth at home with both of us. She was with her mother-in-law and older sister both times, and she was in labour for two days with my brother. Living in the UK, my idea of homebirths is very different from my mother’s experience. She didn’t see a doctor or health professional for her entire pregnancy or labour. There was a health clinic about an hour’s drive away on public transport, but she says she never considered it an option. Her friends had all given birth at home with traditional birth attendants, and her mother-in-law had said that going to the clinic went against the family tradition of women delivering in their villages. Things were tense with her first labour, but luckily my brother didn’t require vital care when he finally arrived. Mum says she felt that God had watched over her during that labour. She says that now women in Malawi don’t have to go through the same thing, and it is the norm to go to a clinic for at least one visit, even if you are delivering in your village. All of my friends still in Malawi have received all the basic care that I would receive here in the UK, but they’re mostly in the city. My hope is that every woman gets the choice to get the care they need.
‘The public health system is very good in Germany’ Anna, Germany I had monthly pre-natal check-ups up to two months before delivery, then bi-monthly check-ups until delivery, done by my gynaecologist-obstetrician. There was a week-long prenatal class to prepare for the delivery, paid for by public insurance. We hired a housekeeper as I was too large to do the usual share of domestic work. Also, privately I got weekly massages, weekly lymphatic drainages, weekly private antenatal lessons, bi-weekly pre-natal yoga classes, weekly osteopathy and acupuncture sessions, weekly prenatal pilates and aqua fitness classes. I also saw a personal trainer every week. After the delivery and two nights in hospital, we were discharged to go home. A midwife visited every day for 10 days after we arrived home. We had also hired a maternity nanny to look after the baby. A paediatrician close to our house checked the baby after two weeks. For my personal antenatal care, my insurance paid for one weekly class. Privately, I attended four others. The public health system is very good in Germany, although we live a comfortable life in an affluent part of Germany’s wealthiest city. Instead of buying a new car or expensive furniture, we paid for excellent care. ‘My sister-in-law gave birth in an overcrowded refugee camp’ Samantha, Kenya and Canada My husband spent 10 years in Daadab refugee camp in Kenya, and his sister gave birth there. She was one of the lucky ones who received care at a clinic, and that saved her life because she had to have an emergency caesarean. Most of her friends gave birth in their homes in the camp, sometimes for cultural reasons and sometimes because they simply didn’t have a choice. The camp is so crowded, and is growing with around 1,000 births each month, apparently. I’m so grateful that my nephew survived and is now a healthy little boy in Tanzania, where they were able to emigrate. In comparison, I gave birth in Canada with a midwife present throughout the birth. I had weekly check-ups and had visiting home-care for the weeks after. I always felt safe and cared for, and knew that if any complications arose there would be help at hand. How is it fair that my son had a much greater chance of survival at birth than his cousin? ‘I could have saved my first child if I had had the chance to learn about maternal and child health’ Daw Nwe Nwe (sent via World Vision), Burma
I had never heard about antenatal and postnatal care for mothers when I was expecting my first three children. I did not understand the importance of immunisations and nutrition. When World Vision started working in our community, I got to learn about the importance of maternal and child healthcare. I think I could have saved my first child if I had the chance to learn about maternal and child healthcare earlier. Now, I always attend maternal, child health and nutrition awareness sessions. I also received iron tablets. I realised that I was not eating properly while I was expecting my first three children. But while I was expecting my fourth child, I ate nutritious foods and followed what I had learned, so there were no problems during delivery. I only breastfed my daughter until she was six months old. She is healthier than my other children. Now, I promptly go to the clinic when my children are sick. I am afraid I might lose them like my first child. ‘I lost two brothers at a young age due to no access to basic medical facilities’ Darjat, Pakistan I was born in a mountain village 750km away from Islamabad, Pakistan. My grandmother was there but no health worker was present. During the time of my birth in 1959, [we] only [had] the indigenous knowledge of elder women, but during my kids’ time, they were provided with all the preventative vaccines and check-ups before and after birth in the small village, and later in the town and city. My wife also had access to basic check-ups before and after deliveries. I wish we had had basic medical facilities in the village where I was born. I lost two brothers at a young age due to no access to basic medical facilities. ‘My baby had to be resuscitated but I had full trust in the medical team’ Lotte, Australia We had public healthcare and it was fabulous. Prenatal care was uneventful and I felt informed. When I was admitted for labour, a midwife was with us the entire time, even when there wasn’t much happening. She was there unobtrusively in the background doing paperwork if we didn’t need her, and was right there to assure, advise, and answer questions when we did. As labour progressed, things got complicated – the baby’s heart rate dropped and he had to be brought [out] quickly with forceps, then resuscitated – but the wonderful care we had received up until that point meant that I had full trust in the medical team. I am so happy with the birth, even though it was complicated. How would you describe the provision of maternal healthcare in your country?

2015-05-28T07:00:01Z,global-development,Global development,Millennium development goals 4 and 5: 15 achievements on reducing child mortality and better maternal health,"Between 1990 and 2012, the global child mortality rate almost halved. The UN has referred to this decline in preventable child deaths as “one of the most significant achievements in human history”. About 17,000 fewer children die each day than in 1990. The mortality rate for children under five is declining faster than ever before. The annual rate of reduction has more than tripled since 1990. Afghanistan has made significant progress in reducing child deaths. The country’s under-five mortality rate dropped from 257 deaths for every 1,000 live births in 2002, to 97 for every 1,000 live births in 2012. In 2013, global measles immunisation coverage was 84% among children aged 12 to 23 months. It is estimated that measles vaccines have averted more than 14 million deaths since 2000. Globally, 90% of children receive immunisations for tuberculosis and 82% receive protection from neonatal tetanus. Since 1990, every region has lowered its under-five mortality rate by at least 44%. However, the pace and scale of regional progress varies, and deep inequalities remain within countries and regions. Bangladesh, Nepal, Ethiopia, Malawi and Liberia are among the 10 countries that recorded the largest absolute declines in neonatal mortality rates from 1990 to 2013. The two best-performing regions in reducing under-five deaths were east Asia and the Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean, where rates have been cut by more than two-thirds since 1990. Between 1990 and 2013, maternal mortality decreased by 45%. Despite this progress, the figure is well short of the MDG target. In Guinea, 95% of pregnant women received prenatal care from a skilled-health worker in 2012, an increase from 83% the year before. The number of 15- to 19-year olds giving birth declined globally between 1990 and 2011. In southern Asia, the adolescent birth rate dropped from 88 to 50 births for every 1,000 girls. This decrease was accompanied by a rise in school attendance, increased demand for contraception and lower marriage rates among teens. The global rate of skilled attendants present at a delivery rose by 12% between 1990 and 2012 and has accelerated across all regions since 2000. Despite this, progress is too slow and skilled birth attendant coverage remains inadequate. In Burundi, 25% more women gave birth at health facilities in 2011 than in 2010. In the same period, prenatal consultations rose by 20%. The proportion of women delivering in a health facility rose from 37% in 1990 to 63% in 2012. East Asia and the Pacific, south Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean registered the most progress.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/28/millennium-development-goals-4-and-5-15-achievements-child-mortality-maternal-health,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/28/millennium-development-goals-4-and-5-15-achievements-child-mortality-maternal-health
2015-05-28T06:30:00Z,global-development,Global development,What are the millennium development goals on child mortality and maternal health all about?,"What are MDGs 4 and 5 all about? MDG4 aims to reduce child mortality, while MDG5 is focused on improving maternal health. The child health goal has one target: to reduce the under-five mortality rate by two-thirds by 2015. At its inception in 2000, the maternal health goal was also limited to a single target : to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three-quarters. In 2005, global leaders added an additional target to achieve universal access to reproductive healthcare. Progress on th e latter is measured by the prevalence of contraception, adolescent birth rate, antenatal care coverage and the unmet need for family planning, which refers to the number of women who want but do not have access to contraception. Will the child health goal be met? There has been substantial progress in reducing child mortality over the past 15 years, but not enough to achieve the goal of a reduction by two-thirds. Between 1990 and 2012, the child mortality rate almost halved, meaning that 6 million fewer children died in 2012 than in 1990. But while child mortality rates ha ve fallen, progress has been too slow. According to UN figures, it would take until 2028 to achieve MDG4 globally. Less than one-third of all countries have achieved or are on track to meet the goal by the end of this year.
What are the leading causes of child death ? Globally, the most dangerous day in a child’s life is the day it is born. Data indicate that preterm birth complications are now the leading cause of under-five deaths, accounting for 17% of all deaths in this age group. Prematurity, which applies to babies born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy , is a global problem that is increasing in almost all countries with reliable data. The majority of premature babies in high-income countries survive, but a lack of basic and cost-effective care such as breastfeeding support, warmth and treatment for infections means the chance of survival is reduced in low-income countries. Also, women who were undernourished during their own childhood and pregnancy are more likely to deliver babies who are preterm or small at birth.
Other leading causes of under- five mortality are pneumonia, diarrhoea and birth asphyxia – a failure to establish breathing at birth. Between 2000 and 2012, deaths due to measles fell by 80% and there were also considerable reductions in deaths due to HIV and Aids (-51%), diarrhoea (-50%), pneumonia (-40%) and malaria (-37%). In contrast, relatively little progress was made in reducing the number of deaths due to prematurity, which had a decline of only 14%. Will the maternal health goal be met? The world is likely to fall far short of the targeted 75% reduction in the number of women dying due to complications from pregnancy or childbirth by 2015. The data collected so far is from 1990 to 2013, and shows a 45% drop in the global maternal mortality rate. The World Bank says that, of the eight millennium development goals, the one on maternal health has made the least progress. Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest maternal mortality ratio of developing regions, with 510 deaths for every 100,000 live births, followed by southern Asia, Oceania and the Caribbean.
The reproductive health target is a similar story of progress achieved at too slow a rate. The number of women in developing countries who saw a skilled birth attendant at least once during their pregnancy increased from 65% in 1990 to 83% in 2012, but only half of those women received the recommended four antenatal check-ups. Access to antenatal care differs widely from region to region – 80% of women in south-east Asia and the Caribbean reported at least four antenatal care visits, compared with 50% in sub-Saharan Africa and only 36% in southern Asia. Improved access to safe, affordable and effective methods of contraception has led to an increase in its use. In sub-Saharan Africa, the proportion of women between the ages of 15 and 49 who were using contraception doubled between 1990 and 2012, from 13% to 26%. Tthe unmet need for family planning has decreased, but the issue remains problematic. In sub-Saharan Africa in 2012, 25% of women aged 15 to 29 who were married or in a partnership and wanted to avoid or delay pregnancy did not have access to any form of contraception. What still needs to be addressed? While significant progress has been made in tackling child mortality, experts say closer attention must be paid to growing inequalities within countries. In its report, The Lottery of Birth, Save the Children found that country-level statistics on child mortality often masked inequalities between different social and economic groups, including children from the poorest sections of society, those from disadvantaged regions, those from rural areas and those belonging to ethnic minorities. Campaigners argue that women’s sexual and reproductive rights must be at the centre of any discussion about maternal and reproductive health. Women’s rights groups say that provision of health services is not enough . They argue that girls and women must have the ability to decide if, when and how many children they have, and to have control of the reproductive healthcare services they receive. How do MDG4 and 5 fit into the next set of goals ? The sustainable development goals, set to replace the MDGs next year, will aim to resolve the unfinished business of the maternal and child health MDGs and drive further progress. The three health-related MDGs, which focus on child health, maternal health and diseases, will merge into one sustainable development goal to “ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages”. The 13 proposed targets include an aim to reduce the global maternity mortality ratio to less than 70 for every 100,000 live births. The goal also includes a target to end all preventable deaths of newborns and under-five children.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/27/millennium-development-goals-child-mortality-maternal-health-explainer,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/27/millennium-development-goals-child-mortality-maternal-health-explainer
2015-05-28T06:00:00Z,global-development,Global development,Empty promises mean African mothers are dying of preventable diseases | Dr Joachim Osur,"At a dispensary in Nyaluoyo village in western Kenya, there is just one midwife on duty. There are three women in labour, about 40 children waiting to be vaccinated, and another 15 people with other ailments. It is 3pm and the lone midwife has yet to take lunch. She does not earn enough to buy school books for her own child, and she cannot meet other basic monthly needs. She has participated in health worker strikes in the past to push for higher salaries, but to no avail.
Africa has taken great strides in developing a favourable policy environment for reproductive and maternal health. But this positive environment has not translated into better health for African women, because it has not been supported by the funding required for implementation. In 2001, 189 African heads of states and governments met in Abuja, Nigeria, where they committed to spending at least 15% of their annual budgets on improving the health sector (although it is important to note that even this level of commitment is not adequate to meet needs across the continent). Ten years on, only six countries had kept this promise. Fourteen years later and the vision seems to have been lost altogether, with 11 countries actually reducing their relative contributions during the period. The consequences are tragic, with maternal health epitomising the impact that underfunding can have on a health system. Too many Africans, including mothers, are dying of preventable diseases. The main causes include weak health systems characterised by poor infrastructure, inadequate supplies of drugs and equipment, a critical shortage of health workers, and weak management capacity. A woman living in sub-Saharan Africa has a one in 16 chance of dying in pregnancy or childbirth, compared with a one in 4,000 risk in a developing country. The major causes of maternal deaths are preventable ones, including haemorrhage, infection, hypertensive diseases and unsafe abortion.
For reasons beyond their control, more than half of African women deliver at home without the services of a skilled birth attendant. It is estimated that sub-Saharan Africa needs 551,000 additional midwives by the end of 2015 to bridge its deficit, a tall order that cannot be met with the meagre resources currently committed to health systems. In fact, at the current rate of increase in midwife numbers, it will take an estimated 29 years to reach the World Health Organisation’s recommended numbers in Africa. As 2015 progresses, it is becoming increasingly obvious that countries in Africa will not meet millennium development goal five, which aimed to reduce maternal mortality by 75% between 1990 and 2015. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, the figure has been reduced by 41%; in northern Africa, by 66%. Amref Health Africa works to bridge this gap by training cadres of community health workers, nurses and midwives – strengthening the provision of care at facility level, linking communities to formal health services and supporting the realignment of these services to community needs. We’re successful in our field, but in itself this – and the work of numerous NGOs – simply isn’t enough. It is imperative that governments devote more resources to their health systems. Almost all African governments, for example, are yet to meet the target of committing 15% of their national budgets to health. Donor funding is estimated to account for more than a quarter of total healthcare funding in about 35% of African countries, while in 5% of countries more than half of all healthcare funding comes from external sources. While this support is important, it is not sustainable. The lack of domestic resources devoted to healthcare is undermining the positive policy environment for maternal and reproductive health.
The Continental Policy Framework on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights and the Maputo Plan of Action are key instruments guiding Africa’s efforts to achieve maternal health goals. The Campaign on Accelerated Reduction of Maternal, Newborn, and Child Mortality in Africa, an initiative of the African Union, serves as a critical advocacy platform for improvement of maternal, newborn and child health, and has been launched in more than 40 of the 54 AU member states. The campaign has motivated national ownership of significant maternal, newborn, and child health initiatives. Without adequate funding, however, these laudable initiatives lack teeth. Saving a mother is the most definite pathway to giving children the future they deserve. To eradicate poverty and underdevelopment, we must all commit to breaking the vicious cycle by making pregnancy and childbirth safer.

2015-05-27T13:56:52Z,global-development,Global development,"Social protection schemes hold key to beating world hunger, says UN","If targets to end world hunger by 2030 are to be met, governments and donors in developing countries must spend more on cash transfers to poor farmers, school meals and other social protection schemes, a UN report has said. Economic inequality, which is particularly acute in rural areas, is a key reason why 795 million people do not have enough food enough to eat, according to a report released on Wednesday by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (Ifad).
“What we need is to put in place a more distributive [mechanism] of growth, and we have learned from Latin America a very important tool, which is social protection. Expanding social protection schemes helps a lot to tackle undernourishment,” said the FAO’s director general, José Graziano da Silva. About 150 million people have been kept from falling into extreme poverty because of social safety nets, but roughly 70% of the global population lacks access to some form of social security, the report said. The world’s next development agenda, the sustainable development goals (SDGs), includes a target to “implement nationally appropriate social protection measures” by 2030. Since 1990, the number of people who do not receive enough nutrients to live an active and healthy life has been cut by 216 million, according to the State of Food Insecurity report, which covers 129 countries in the developing world.
At least 72 countries have met the millennium development goal (MDG) to halve, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of undernourished people, the FAO said. In the past year alone, eight countries – Bolivia, Costa Rica, Laos, Mozambique, Nepal, the Solomon Islands, Suriname and Uzbekistan – met the MDG hunger target, according to the report. But the global average has failed to drop to half of the 1990 rate, meaning that the world will not meet the hunger goal, said Da Silva. Development targets should also help people in rural areas to access jobs and education, which will contribute to lifting them out of poverty and create lasting food security, said Ifad’s director, Kanayo Nwanze. “We must invest in rural areas so that our nations can have balanced growth and so that the three billion people who live in rural areas can fulfil their potential,” Nwanze said. About 80% of poor people depend on vulnerable jobs in the informal economy, according to the report. Promoting enterprise in rural areas of developing countries will help to spread economic growth more evenly, said Josefina Stubbs, Ifad’s associate-vice president. “We need to encourage business in the rural sector as a way of distributing the benefits [of economic growth] to the society.” Most of the world’s poor live in Asia or Africa, with only a small number in Latin America, the Middle East or the Americas, according to the report. “Across the developing world, the majority of the poor and most of the hungry live in rural areas, where family farming and smallholder agriculture is a prevailing – albeit not universal – mode of farm organisation,” the report said.
China has succeeded in reducing hunger by combining government investment in rural areas with agricultural subsidies and tax exemptions. China accounts for almost two-thirds of the reduction in the number of undernourished people in poor countries since 1990, the report said.
East Asia and Latin America have made the most progress in reducing the amount of hungry people over the past 25 years, according to the FAO. Mostly because of China’s success, east Asia’s hungry population fell from 295 million in 1990 to 145 million in 2016. Sub-Saharan Africa and western Asia, areas struggling with several ongoing conflicts, have been slow to reduce hunger, the report said. Sustained unrest has wreaked havoc on food security in countries such as Central African Republic, Syria and Somalia. About 19% of the world’s hungry live in areas affected by protracted crises. More aid needs to be directed towards long-term development projects that aim to boost infrastructure and services that help people afford to buy food. Prolonged crises have diverted 80% of all development aid away from long-term development projects, which are needed to bring about food security, Da Silva said. “We cannot compromise the long-term aid for developing countries, especially for the poorest countries.” At least 24 African countries are facing food crises, which present serious challenges to meeting the SDG hunger target. About 19 of these countries have been struggling with severe food shortages for at least eight of the past 10 years as a result of internal conflicts. Da Silva said: “The near-achievement of the MDG hunger targets shows us that we can indeed eliminate the scourge of hunger in our lifetime. We must be the zero hunger generation. That goal should be mainstreamed into all policy interventions and at the heart of the new sustainable development agenda to be established this year.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/27/hunger-social-protection-schemes-food-insecurity-fao-inequality,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/27/hunger-social-protection-schemes-food-insecurity-fao-inequality

MB We believe that including women… it’s not about including women for more representation, it’s about including women to transform those exact systems of exclusion. The women are excluded from peace processes and that is why there continues to be unsustained conflict prevention. HM Hello, and welcome to this edition of the Guardian’s Global Development podcast. My name is Hugh Muir. This month we’re talking about conflict and resolution and we’re looking at the main drivers of conflict, as well as the role of women and the UN in peacekeeping. We also hope to look at how the sustainable development goals may help us tackle the issue of conflict. So let’s start off by listening to a report from Clár Ní Chonghaile, the Guardian’s Global Development assistant editor, on the main drivers of conflict. CNC There are many factors that can drive a population into conflict. Arguably one of the main drivers is militarisation. Since the end of the cold war, spending on arms has remained high while the nature of conflict itself has evolved. GdC In the last 20 years there has been a change in the dynamics and trends in the ways the conflicts operate. We see less types of intrastate conflicts like what we used to see during the Cold War. My name is Gustavo de Carvalho, and I’m a senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies in South Africa. So a lot of the types of conflicts that we see are internal within borders, which of course in terms of militarisation then you have in different types of groups – and also access to arms and to different sources of arms then becomes a particular challenge. We’re not seeing that type of traditional type of engagement of military actors like we used to see. CNC The availability of weapons is one factor. Last week UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon told the security council that the widespread availability of small arms and light weapons, as well as their ammunition, was the common factor in over 250 conflicts around the globe in the last decade. This proliferation of weapons can also serve to normalise violence in societies. LH I am Laura Hammond. I am a reader and head of the Development Studies Department at SOAS, the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. For instance, the Horn of Africa – the proliferation of small arms is everywhere. The fact that they exist not only on the battlefields and on the frontlines but as well in villages, in homes, leads to a whole kind of heightening of the role of violence within society generally, where violence becomes much more a tool than would otherwise I think be the case. CNC The normalisation of violence is tied in also to the sidelining of women. Conflict tends to be driven by men and some analysts have noted that leaders can exploit masculinity myths, such as the idea of the man as protector. LH Militarisation tends to be a process of really stressing some aspects of masculinity in particular and what tends to happen in militarised processes is that women’s activity, their contributions, their activism, their roles in peace and in conflict tend to be sidelined, so militarisation processes almost by definition tend to write women out of the picture and out of the story. CNC Economics can also play a part, both by driving a population towards violence and in the aftermath when poverty caused by conflict can lead vulnerable and destitute populations back towards violence again. LH Sometimes people start fighting partly to get access to territory or natural resources, or maybe it’s just because joining the military is a paid job in a place in which there aren’t very many paid jobs. So impoverishment comes about as a result of conflict for civilians and it is very much intrinsically tied to the experience of conflict. GdC I think what we’ve seen, and especially in countries that have had some sorts of conflict and that are going through the post-conflict settings, what we see is that the economic recovery then becomes a very important issue. Economic recovery then gives the population availability and access to resources, it gives opportunities to be able to have a more productive engagement within society. What we see then is that the idea of creating sustainable conditions for peace then goes hand in hand to economic recovery. CNC Notwithstanding the broad trends we have identified –economics, militarisation and myths of masculinity – many conflicts are routed in much more complex local dynamics. LH That’s one of the difficulties, I think, of conflict studies is that one needs to take a very finely grained sort of localised approach towards understanding what are the nature of the grievances that are being expressed, what is the nature of the local economy that is perhaps driving people to be more likely to fight or not to fight, and to base an assessment on that rather than to have sort of grand overarching theories. GdC It’s very important when issues are being addressed around identifying root causes of conflicts and what we need to do to avoid a lapse, a relapse, into conflicts, that we need to be very cautious and to develop strategies that are enabling the population to actually become a productive part of society. HM Joining us on the phone now to discuss this is Radhika Coomaraswamy, the former under-secretary general at the UN; Maria Butler, director of the PeaceWomen project, which is hosted by the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom; and Colin Archer, secretary general of the International Peace Bureau. Welcome to all of you. You heard that report of the three drivers of conflict: militarisation, economics and the myths of masculinity. How would you rate each of them in terms of prioritisation, in terms of weighting, how much they actually add to the proliferation of conflict? Radhika, let me start with you. RC Well of course if you take a long term view all of this is very interconnected, but I notice that one driver is not mentioned and that’s ideology – political, religious, national, ethnic, what I would call ideology. And in the old days of course influenced by leftist thinking or Clinton’s famous “It’s the economy, stupid”, everybody believed it was the economy and that the ideologies were dependent on whatever economic system you had. But we know looking around the world at the way religions and political ideologies proliferate that ideologies have a momentum of their own. So my sense is that it is economics and political and social ideology that are the true drivers of conflict, and that both militarisation and masculinity are the by-products of that. So that if you have, for example, a fascist, nationalist ideology with sort of state-oriented capitalism you will have a very aggressive military with men with very high levels of testosterone taking the lead. But if you have a more sort of democratic, pluralist, sort of a Gandhian kind of ideology you will find it to be with less emphasis on the military and with more sensitive men. In fact it is argued that the man who assassinated Ghandi actually was not a madman but a man who believed in the former kind of India, that India should look like that – aggressive and male. That Ghandi was really kind of a feminine version and he found that offensive. So again, I think it’s economics and ideology that drive conflict and that masculinity as well as militarisation are by-products that that initial combination puts together. HM Maria, let me bring you in there. So that’s Radhika. She adds –to our list of militarisation, economics and the myths of masculinity – ideology. How would you weight those various factors? MB Yes, I agree that we now are living in a period of a culture of violence where we are faced with a spectrum of conflicts and what interlinks these systems of patriarchy with male dominance or economic exploitation or militarism and ideology is the interconnected issue of power that’s constituted. And I think what we’re seeing as a women’s peace organisation is that women activists are living and surviving and challenging these structures of power today. For example our partners in the Middle East have faced in a way this distortion between choosing between extremist ideology and extremist military action and what they’re saying and what we’re saying is that there is still a voice for peaceful political revolution today but that voice is being marginalised. And I think the power dynamics play out in a broad spectrum from violence in our homes – where women are directly affected and targeted and their rights violated – and to on the streets and we see this through many examples. When women went to the streets in Egypt they were directly targeted, not because they were powerless, but because of the message they were bringing to challenge the power structures that were in place. So we just held a large convening of women activists and they brought the demands to the table again that the majority, the peaceful majority, should not be silenced by the powerful minority. And there was innovative calls, for example, to adopt real feminist foreign policy by governments today, and what that would mean would be challenging those exact structures of power, so making human rights more valuable than economic gains. So stopping arms trade where the violating country continues to perpetrate gender race violence. So taking our words and actions into foreign policy was the demand of women activists today. HM Colin Archer, the secretary general of the International Peace Bureau, is that roughly the assessment? Would that be your weighting too? CA Well, if I could say, I do support very much what the two previous speakers have said. My organisation has historically focused primarily on disarmament and in the last ten years, particularly on military spending by governments, which is, if you like the root of the spending that gets made on armaments. The governments are the clients, the customers, they are the ones who are putting up money for this militarisation that we see all around the world. I mean it is extraordinary that 25 years after the end of the cold war as a global society the total amount of money spent on the military sector is higher even than the highest peak of the cold war period. And that has been driven by, of course, many factors, for example the impact of 9/11 and the whole transformation of American ideology regarding terrorism, the global war on terrorism, and now increasingly confrontation with Russia and China at the same time. The US is now facing three fronts, if you like, and most of the western world is falling in behind that definition of where the threats are. But having said that for us the question of armaments and the huge amounts of money spent – and in many ways wasted – on the arms industry, I don’t think it’s necessarily the root cause. And when you ask to give a weighting to all of these different factors I think that’s almost an impossible task, but I do think that there’s a couple of additional things that could be mentioned. One is the fact that we’ve neglected very often the weight of history, the sort of long shadow of colonial rule and the resentments that have grown up and have in many ways been intensified by the globalisation process. We’ve seen a reaction against globalisation, against western values, and many nationalist and ethnic assertions have come in their place and that’s combined with a sense of humiliation which comes from having been bombed, occupied, invaded and so on by western powers who claim to be democratic. And so that is in a sense a framing of what we could regard as the struggle for geopolitical domination which brings in this fight between the big powers as well as the smaller local powers. And I think you can’t grasp what’s going on in so many of these conflicts without getting a sense of the global picture. And I would just, as just a small comment on the intro, I would somewhat contest the idea that most conflicts nowadays are intrastate. It’s true that after the cold war that became the fashion for describing things, but just have a think about recent conflicts and see where there are outside powers and including super powers. Ukraine, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Libya, Mali – they’ve all had to some extent or other major involvement from outside powers. So we’re dealing in a world where there’s a mixture of intrastate and interstate conflict. HM Well of course these are all very complex interlinked issues and we will try and explain them as best we can. Thank you for that, and those are some of the drivers, perhaps, of conflict, so what to do about that? What might be some of the possible agents of change here? Let’s go back to the Guardian’s Clár Ní Chonghaile. CNC Given the myriad causes how can we tackle global conflict? Experts say one possible agent of change is an increased role for women in peace-building processes. The United Nations’ Resolution 1325 on women and peace and security, which was passed in 2000, attempts to address this directly. Laura Hammond from the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. LH 1325 is quite an amazing document in some ways because it tries to do so many different things. It’s trying to really take on board the challenges of promoting peace at all levels. It says we need to engage with women at all levels of society, and we need to work towards greater emphasis on peace-building processes, greater inclusion of women in all aspects of civic and political life. CNC Gustavo de Carvalho is from the Institute for Security Studies in South Africa. GdC Resolution 1325 is very important because it brings the idea of women not only as victims but also as potential providers of solutions. I think the last 15 years we’ve seen an increased attention to the role of women as a positive actor within issues of peace and security. CNC Leymah Gbowee is a Nobel peace prize laureate and Liberian peace activist and she spoke to us at the Women’s Power to Stop War conference in The Hague this April. LG What I would like to see in different conflict contexts, women being given the space to exert all of their energy in promoting peace, not just at the grassroots level but also at the national, international level, sitting at the table and bringing some of those unique qualities to bear on the processes of peace-building. And I feel and strongly believe that once we do that we can make some of the biggest gains in building peace globally. CNC If activists, both male and female, have an important role to play in reducing conflict, so too does the United Nations. In 2015 the United Nations’ wider role will come under intense scrutiny during a series of major reviews, including an assessment of Resolution 1325 and the launch of sustainable development goals to replace the millennium development goals which culminate this year. At this critical time some are asking whether the UN itself needs to reform to become more effective in reducing conflict. LH Well is it the UN that needs to reform its own structures or the member states and particularly the donor countries – who as you say are major arms manufacturers and who stand to benefit quite significantly economically from the manufacture and sale of weapons to whatever customers will take them – who need to be much more committed to the rules that they set, the arms embargoes that they set? The rules about who they can sell to are broken regularly. So you can’t sign on to this kind of a commitment on one hand while at the same time continuing to carry on business as usual with the other. GdC If they want to promote changes on the ground and the recommendations that all of those reviews will bring the member states need to get a strong buy-in and to really be able to push that in terms of their own discussion. CNC Some observers hope the drafting of sustainable development goals may drive change. Goal number 16 will recognise the importance of peace, good governance, justice and security – all elements which were absent from the MDGs. GdC So in a way, including a goal that relates to issues of peace and security and to conflict issues helps in the way that the sustainable development goals will be an assisting tool to planning processes at a national, international level. So we’ll be able to channel efforts, we’ll be able to channel resources to particular areas, but we also need to be cautious to not create too much emphasis on one tool that will resolve all of the problems. We still need to be very aware of the fact that conflict dynamics are very specific to different situations and the responses are generally going to be related to the specifics of the contexts that we’re operating under. HM So if we look first at the role of women in conflict, Radhika, can you first explain UN security council resolution 1325 and what that means for women in peace-building and in conflict resolution? RC Well, you know, the first time women ever came on the international stage was in the 1920s and they came on the platform – and it’s Maria’s organisation, actually – of peace. It was the Women for Peace movement and a demilitarisation movement. And therefore this women and peace equation has been there since the 1920s, they’ve been present at practically every international gathering and they inspired a lot of the women for peace movements from Vietnam right up to the security council resolution. Now what 1325 did… as you know the security council really never dealt with human rights issues. Russia and China were firmly objecting to that. But the wars in Bosnia and Rwanda really were so horrific that they changed toward the end of the 1990s and in the famous resolution in 2000 they said human rights humanitarian violations are a threat to international peace and security. It was only in 2000 – the UN was formed in 1947 – that the Security Council accepted that human rights are humanitarian aspects. And then they moved on to three areas that they began to look at more in-depth: one of them women, the other children in armed conflict and the other protection of civilians. So the women foot had this 1325 resolution as well as a lot of resolutions on sexual violence and conflicts. Women negotiators realised the Security Council being such a hard-nosed place that they would have to give up just the call for peace per se and demilitarisation, which actually was the Faustian contract that we made with the council and now we may regret it, given the figures that were just mentioned, that maybe we have to now think of going back. And my global study is I think going to emphasise the need that we just go back to peace per se. But a lot has been done with 1325, especially as an empowerer of groups at the local level to force governments to do various things.
HM OK, let me talk to Maria about that. Maria, would it be fair to say that women have been empowered by 1325 to play a more active and effective role in conflict resolution? MB I think from our perspective, from their perspective, women have been forces for change. They have been empowered but they’re using women and peace and security as a tool from conflict prevention at a local level to peace-building. So it’s how they’re using it and how they’re organising where we’ve seen the most impact in terms of implementation of the resolution in the hands of civil society. And for example last month women organised in Nigeria to implement a process to prevent violence and unrest around the elections. They initiated, they led and they implemented the Women’s Situation Room in Nigeria. They received thousands of phone calls from civilians. They documented election violence, they prevented violence on the street and also at the elections ballot box, and this is the sort of work where we really see the impact, the local powerful work, of women’s peace organisations. Yes, they use the tools of women’s peace and security where they need them and when they need them with decision makers, but there’s also been a clear frustration – and I think Radhika has heard this in her consultations on the global study – that women are and continue to be marginalised in those official processes, in decision-making processes. And this is what 1325 demanded of the international community, was to reprioritise gender, was to include women in peacemaking, and we have not seen that implemented. For example we were involved in supporting Syrian women activists in the peace negotiation. They were not recognised or allowed at the table. Although they continued civil society activities in the margins, it’s still not recognised as official. And what we hear as civil society organisations continue to be similar rhetoric than there was years ago – that we will deal with that later, we will deal with women’s rights and gender inclusion later. Right now, it’s hard politics. And what women activists are saying and what Wilpf is saying is now is about transforming the system and the systems of power that we discussed earlier is what we want to transform. And we believe that including women – it’s not about including women for more representation, it’s about including women to transform those exact systems of exclusion. The women are excluded from peace processes and that is why there’s continued to be unsustained conflict prevention. HM Let me bring Colin back in here. Colin, moving on to conflict resolution in general it’s clear that – as we heard from the first package – that the nuances of peacekeeping are very much unique to the situation locally. Would you say that there’s a need to concentrate on those local issues? CA A lot of peacemaking has to relate to the fact that the framework for conflict is often national but as we said earlier that includes international players but also regional players in the sense of parts of the country that may wish to, for example, secede or to contest power, so often you have this scenario of governments versus rebels. Now the rebels might be occupying an enormous chunk of the country – that’s hardly just local, we’re not just talking about the village level here. So I think there has to be peacemaking initiatives and that clearly must include women all the way from the village level right up to the national and global levels. That’s what 1325 is about, and we’ve just heard very good examples of that. But I think that the place where the most important politics has to be done nowadays is national and subnational, and the difficulty is that women are not just excluded from peace negotiations, they’re excluded from politics per se because of the patriarchal nature of those societies. And I think it would have been surprising if, even 15 years on from 1325, one resolution and its associated forces had been able to transform societies that have been patriarchal for thousands of years. So I think it’s a tool that has helped peacemaking and peace-building and peacekeeping but it’s only one tool. And one of the points that I would make is that where are the resources for peacemaking processes, when you consider that there’s $1.7 trillion being spent on military forces around the world? And, well, for example, to compare it with the aid budget, $135bn for aid and even less for the UN’s work on peacekeeping. So we’re talking about a David and Goliath type of situation, if you like, to take two male images, that peacemaking has to find ways to be effective even though at this stage we still have far less resources and most of those resources are devoted towards male-dominated institutions. There is potential for the United Nations to play a far more effective role, but it’s in the hands of member states, and in the current mood if we look around the world there’s not much appetite for giving the United Nations that power. One can dream of a brilliant secretary general, a kind of new Dag Hammarskjöld or hopefully a female version of that, but even that person would find it difficult to resist the pressures by powerful nation states for their own interests to be taken into account. So I’m somewhat pessimistic but I think that 1325 and the women’s effort that that represents is our best hope. HM Of course the UN’s drafting an ambitious set of targets, the sustainable development goals, to replace the millennium development goals. Sustainable development goal 16 refers to the need to reduce all forms of violence. Do we think this target will bring any effective results or is it just more an expression of hope? Radhika?
RC Well, let me just begin by saying that I agree that the UN at the moment, especially at the global level, looks ineffective. So one of the recommendations of our study is going to be localisation; let’s go local, let’s make the difference there. The UN was started with the whole notion of swords into ploughshares –now they’re doing the opposite. $9bn is the budget of DPKO. But let’s be very clear, women have been absolutely key to peacemaking and peace-building. They may not have been at the formal table but they create the atmosphere that makes it possible. As you know in Liberia, in Bosnia, the Women in Black, the Mothers of the Plaza in Argentina… we can go and on and even now in Syria at the local level they are absolutely key to peacemaking. Now I agree – I mean aiming against violence is sort of like getting rid of motherhood, people will say, or whatever, but one has to have an aspiration to work toward and this is one aspiration. And our argument is that not enough is done about prevention and also finding nonviolent means of protecting people, because often the excuse used is we’re going in to protect somebody. And what we mean about prevention is mediation – not only between combatants, you know, Dayton-style, lock them all up in a room and throw away the key, we mean at the local level, at the community level, with women, everybody, a much more broader sense of the political. So prevention means effective, proactive diplomacy by the UN and others at all levels of that society, at the local civil society actors, all stakeholders. HM Radhika, of course the UN’s role here is crucial. I mean some people point to the role of UN members though in the armaments trade and say that the problem is exacerbated by those UN members and the scale in which they continue to trade in arms. RC Yeah, but one can only fight them if one goes local. they’re not going to be fought in the security council. They can only be forced through social movements. And one of the things that we are going to advocate at the end of – it’s a very non-UN report – we’re going to advocate massive funding to women peace-builders at the local level and the creation of a global movement for peace that uses the networks that women have created at the local level. No state has ever just stood up one day and got the political will to get rid of its arms, I mean that’s just ga-ga land, but they respond to social movements so we have to create that social movement. HM Colin Archer, is the UN doing enough to stop its members from dealing in arms? CA Well I think you have to ask whether the member states are doing enough. I mean the UN is only an instrument that can operate within the framework established and the policies established by the member states. So yes the problem is at the level of nation states. Having said that I think, I mean there’s a huge debate about the… RC I just want to say one thing, excuse me, can I just interrupt? This is wrong. HM Let him finish and then I’ll bring you back in. CA Well I was just going to say I think that the MDGs have a mixed record. There’s a huge debate about whether they’ve been successful or not and whether the things that have been achieved would have happened anyway without them. This is one of the sort of counter-factuals – you never really know what would have happened if that initiative had not taken place. But it seems to have focused energy on a whole range of key development targets and there’s evidence to say that in the period of the MDGs there has been some real progress. Now the SDGs looks like being a much more complex and sophisticated set of goals which will cover many more of the angles. It doesn’t cover disarmament, it doesn’t cover many of the peace dimensions that we would like to see. There’s no mention of military spending – which, by the way, would be an enormous resource available in order to fund the SDGs. Nobody mentions that, that’s an issue we’ve been campaigning on for a while, that if we move some of the money we could in fact finance the SDGs. But still, goal number 16 does talk about violence, reducing death rates, particularly against children, and it does mention illicit arms flows but of course it doesn’t mention the legal arms flows. HM OK, I want to end with Maria Butler, but first I did say I would let Radhika come back in. RC No, it’s a very quick point which is that people constantly say the UN is made up of member states. We keep pointing out that the UN charter begins, “We, the people, are tired of war” and the whole human rights movement and humanitarian part of the UN, which is often neglected by the media, comes out of that statement. So we have to pull that up again, you know, member states have been very successfully telling the world that the UN is a member state organisation and it’s important to remind them that it begins, “We, the people” – that’s all I wanted to say. HM OK, well thank you for that. So Maria, let me end with you. SDG16, is this basically wishful thinking or do you think it can actually have a meaningful impact? MB I think the sustainable development goals, the impact and effectiveness of them will depend on, I think, two major things in the next few months. One is how progressive member states are in September in the adoption of the sustainable development goals and civil society – independent civil society has been key in pushing for progressive goals to include targets such as reducing military spending to ensure that women’s meaningful participation is tracked across the goals. And the second factor really depends if and how this policy framework is implemented beyond New York, and that’s a big challenge for member states, but also in the hands of a civil society afterwards.
HM OK, well can I thank all of our guests here, Radhika Coomaraswamy, the former under secretary general at the UN; Maria Butler of the PeaceWomen programme, director at the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom; and Colin Archer, the secretary general of the International Peace Bureau. Thank you all for your contributions today. And it’s worth remembering that in the coming months we’ll be covering the international debates and consultations around the sustainable development goals, including key events such as the financing conference ahead of the September meeting at the UN to finalise the targets. It’s worth remembering too that all of our programmes are available on the Guardian’s website, theguardian.com/global-development and on iTunes, SoundCloud and all podcasting apps.

2015-05-27T11:29:20Z,global-development,Global development,Child marriage in India finally meets its match as young brides turn to courts | Amrit Dhillon,"Santa Devi Meghwal was married off when she was 11 months old. She knew that, on turning 16, she would move in with her husband and his parents. The reality hit her when they turned up at her house in Rohicha Kallan village in Rajasthan’s Jodhpur district on a scorching day three years ago to take her away. It was the first time she had set eyes on her husband, Saanval Ram. “My strongest emotion was the unfairness of it. Why should I go along with something I wasn’t party to, or even aware of? I couldn’t face being treated like a parcel to be picked up by a man I didn’t care for,” she said, speaking on the telephone from Jodhpur. Under the 2006 Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, it is illegal for girls under 18 and boys under 21 to marry in India. Those convicted of involvement face up to two years in jail and fines of up to 200,000 rupees (about £2,100). However, 2014 figures from Unicef, the UN children’s agency, show that 47% of girls in India were married before they turned 18. The practice is common in rural areas. “Almost all the people know that there is a law in place against child marriage – however, it still takes place as societal norms and pressure pushes people into breaking these rules,” said Dora Giusti, a child protection specialist with Unicef in New Delhi. Child marriage can result in girls dropping out of school, early pregnancies, and mothers who are ill-equipped to raise children, activists say. Parents sometimes marry off their daughters because they fear that later, as teenagers, they might have sexual relations and bring shame upon their families. Another factor is peer pressure: parents worry that unless they act, they won’t be able to find their daughters a husband. Opposition to change is entrenched. “Villagers don’t like city people coming and telling them their customs are wrong. Changing attitudes is a slow process,” said Kavita Srivastava, a Jaipur-based women’s rights activist. Meghwal found herself hemmed in by these traditions. During that first visit by Ram and his family she made an excuse not to leave with them. The excuses continued as she turned 18, then 19. Ram’s family grew angry. Elders in Meghwal’s village imposed a fine of 1.6 million rupees on her parents. With no way to pay such a colossal sum, the family moved to Jodhpur. Running out of excuses to go to her husband, Meghwal called Kriti Bharti, a child rights campaigner who runs the Saarthi Trust in Jodhpur. Bharti, 27, made headlines in 2012 for obtaining India’s first annulment of a child marriage. Since then, she has won 27 more annulments in the family courts. A child psychologist, Bharti says the law on child marriage makes provision for annulments, but previously it had never been tested in court. She describes her first petition as “a stab in the dark”. Laxmi Sargara, who was married off when she was one, was Bharti’s first case. That victory set a legal precedent and gave hope to other girls. The case made it into school textbooks. When Sargara was 16, and about to move to her husband’s house in Rajasthan, she heard that another girl, who married into the same family, had killed herself after years of abuse. She decided not to go, and contacted Bharti. India still has one of the lowest divorce rates in the world. Ending a marriage still carries stigma in rural areas, where a woman will find it very hard to remarry. Divorce also takes longer to rule on in India’s overburdened courts and is very expensive. For an annulment, however, one only has to prove that the bride was underage at the time of marriage. A birth certificate or school certificate can prove this. Bharti said this process can take between three days and six months. In Sangara’s case, the Jodhpur magistrate was sympathetic, and her husband also consented. The marriage was declared null in April 2012. Two years ago, when she reached 19, Sargara married a man of her own choosing. “Kriti saved me from misery. Child marriage is a form of abuse and exploitation of helpless children,” said Sargara. Bharti is still in touch with her. “She is the queen of her home. Her husband gives her so much affection and respect that she always looks like a radiant bride,” she said. With Meghwal’s marriage, however, annulment proceedings may not be so straightforward. Ram opposes the annulment and has threatened to abduct his unwilling bride, Bharti said. He has also warned Bharti that her “health” is at risk if she persists with the case. But Meghwal refuses to be cowed. She says she has glimpsed a better future and is now studying to be a teacher. “Kriti has given me a new life. I can’t wait to see what it holds for me,’ she said. “It will take longer than we would have wanted but it will happen,” said Bharti. “His [Ram’s] so-called honour has been slighted. But all he can do is drag it out. In the end, Santa Devi will win because the law is on her side.” (Additional reporting by Zeeshan Mukhtar)",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/27/india-child-marriage-annulment-brides-go-to-court,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/27/india-child-marriage-annulment-brides-go-to-court
2015-05-27T06:00:30Z,global-development,Global development,Cholera biggest threat as Burundi refugees crowd into Tanzania camps,"Barantiriza Deudeone did not want to make the same mistake as his parents. He was one of the first to sign up for the grim voyage across Lake Tanganyika and into the mushrooming refugee camps packed full of fleeing Burundians in neighbouring Tanzania. “In 1997, during the civil war, my father and mother said they would not leave. They had survived the war in 1972 and told us there was no reason to run. They were both killed. I could not wait for the same fate and will never go back. If we die here, that is fine.” The political crisis in the small east African country of Burundi, sparked by President Pierre Nkurunziza’s bitterly contested decision to run for a third term, has translated into a growing humanitarian crisis, with more than 100,000 men, women and children fleeing from what they describe as a campaign of intimidation by armed Nkurunziza supporters. The Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda have taken in scores of refugees, but it is the lake port of Kigoma on the western tip of Tanzania that has seen the greatest number of arrivals. Thousands of villagers have trekked for days to a UN-run, cramped holding camp in the Burundi-Tanzania border town of Kagunga before boarding the MV Liemba, a century-old German ship that has ferried refugees into Tanzania during each of the country’s deadly bouts of conflict over the past three decades. A cholera outbreak in the holding camp where the refugees are cleared for entry into Tanzania has claimed 31 lives. The World Health Organisation said this week that the situation appears to be improving, but the risk of transmission remains high. Aid agencies warn that far more help is needed to avert a bigger catastrophe. About six in 10 of the refugees are women and children, all trying to get onto buses transporting refugees to a bigger camp inland. Many of the women clutched small charcoal-powered stoves known as jikos, while men carried transistor radios. “The predominant emotion among them is fear and tiredness,” says Aimee Brown of Oxfam. “Many have walked for days and weeks and fear what will happen to them if they go back. The key thing they need now is water and clean water vessels to beat the threat of disease.” Burundi experienced a 12-year civil war from 1993, which claimed around 300,000 lives. Protracted negotiations led to the signing of a peace accord in 2005, with Nkurunziza nominated as president. Opponents accuse the former rebel leader of tightening his grip on power and indulging his appetite for amateur football instead of improving the lot of citizens.
Nkurunziza was expected to stand down this year after serving two terms but a decision to contest the election due in June – despite pressure from regional leaders, the European Union and the UN – has sparked weeks of protests in which at least 20 people have been killed. Many of the refugees who spoke to The Guardian at the Kigoma stadium – a 20,000-seater football arena that has been taken over by hundreds of civilians – said the death toll from the crisis was far higher than has been reported, especially in rural Burundi, where there are few independent journalists. “They kill people at night and in the morning you just see blood,” said Innocent Kuguimana, a 34-year-old farmer. “Nobody knows where they take the bodies. Two of my friends were killed in the last two weeks.” All the refugees blamed the Imbonerakure, a feared militia allied to Nkurunziza’s ruling CNDD-FDD party, of being behind the campaign of killings. The militia is primarily composed of youths, who made up the ranks of the rebel group that later turned into Nkurunziza’s political party. It has been accused of carrying out a relentless campaign of intimidation against government critics by Amnesty International. A leaked April 2014 cable to UN headquarters described efforts to arm the militia to fight government opponents and warned that the Imbonerakure was “one of the major threats to peace in Burundi and to the credibility of the 2015 elections as they are responsible for most politically motivated violence against opposition”. Clutching his small transistor radio, Joseph Msihoku Mbugayo, a 65-year-old father of six, said the climate of menace created by the roaming bands of party supporters had made life unbearable. “They go from house to house saying our sons must join the war against opposition supporters or die.” The regularity with which people have been forced from their homes and livelihoods have left many vowing never to return. Neema Minani, a 23-year-old mother of two sons, said she could not bear the thought of tilling her field to take care of her young family and then losing everything due to political conflict. “I am a young person but I have fled my country twice. The UN is a big agency. Let them give us farms in another country so we can build new lives.” Women and children have been given first priority to escape the difficult conditions in the holding camp on the Burundi-Tanzania border. The first priority for many families when they arrive at the larger sea of faded brown canvas tents and claustrophobic aluminium shelters at the Nyarugusa camp is to trace friends and family. Odisto Nyandui, 30, said he was desperately looking for his wife Elizabeth Nyasabandi, and their four children. Like almost everyone interviewed, he vowed never to return. “These people in Bujumbura care about power and nothing else. They will never change. I have to find a new life elsewhere.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/27/cholera-biggest-threat-as-burundi-refugees-crowd-into-tanzania-camps,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/27/cholera-biggest-threat-as-burundi-refugees-crowd-into-tanzania-camps
2015-05-26T16:25:29Z,global-development,Global development,Extreme violence 'blighting a generation' in Central African Republic,"Almost two-thirds of school-aged children in the Central African Republic are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) because of the violence they have seen or experienced during the country’s two-year conflict, according to Save the Children. A new study from the international children’s NGO suggests that more than 60% of CAR’s children have witnessed or been subjected to acts of extreme violence since March 2013, when the mainly Muslim rebels of the Seleka alliance seized the capital Bangui and installed the country’s first Muslim president, Michel Djotodia. The Seleka went on to terrorise the majority Christian population, killing men, women and children until they were ousted in January 2014. Predominantly Christian forces known as the anti-balaka (anti-machete) militia retaliated by slaughtering thousands of Muslims and forcing hundreds of thousands from their homes. “Close to three quarters of the children, aged between five and 16, are said to have directly witnessed beatings, killings, artillery fire, or machete attacks on either their own relatives or members of their community during … months of violence and suffering,” says René Yetamasso, programme quality director at Save the Children in CAR. The study – which directly consulted 111 children, 113 parents and 66 teachers – found that 91% of children interviewed had feared that they would be killed or seriously injured. Some 43% of children reported being victims of being physical abuse, shootings, or death threats; 65% said they often felt afraid, and 25% said they were too frightened to go to school. More than half of parents said they felt their neighbourhoods were dangerous environments for their children, while almost two-thirds of children either described themselves – or were described by their parents and teachers – as suffering from emotional, behavioural, learning or relationship difficulties. Yetamasso said the traumas they had experienced would blight not only the children’s individual futures but also the future of their country. “These numbers underline the disastrous impact the conflict is having on CAR’s children,” he said. “If we don’t ensure those affected get the appropriate support to move on with their lives, an entire generation runs the risk of suffering for years to come, unable to get over their experiences or contribute to building a better Central African Republic.” Among the report’s recommendations are: the establishment of after-school support groups for children suffering from PTSD and other emotional disorders; training for school counsellors; improvements to school security; promotion of positive discipline in schools to end physical and emotional punishment for misbehaviour; creation of school safety plans, and emergency training for children. The new study was published as donors gathered in Brussels at an international fund-raising conference for CAR. Save the Children is calling on those present to step up their efforts, pointing out that the humanitarian community has received only about a fifth of the total funds required for the UN strategic response plan, while the education plan is almost completely unfunded. “We must urgently restore schools as physical and emotional safe places for children, as well as training communities, parents, teachers, and health practitioners to identify children with psychological difficulties and help them resume a normal life at their homes and in schools,” said Yetamasso. On Tuesday the European Union announced a new assistance package for CAR worth €72m (£51m). The new package comes in addition to the €377m the EU mobilised for CAR between 2013 and 2014. In July last year, the union also launched the first European trust fund, the Bêkou Trust Fund for the Central African Republic. The fund, which began with original funding of €74m, is intended to support actions linking humanitarian response to reconstruction and mid-term development programmes. “We live in turbulent times, where new crises hit any time and anywhere,” said Christos Stylianides, the commissioner for humanitarian aid and crisis management. “But our attention must not shift from ongoing humanitarian crises such as this one. The people of the CAR continue to need our help to survive and rebuild their lives.” Last month, the UN warned that the CAR crisis was becoming the largest forgotten humanitarian crisis of our time. According to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, 2.7 million people are in need of aid in CAR, 436,000 are internally displaced, while more than 460,000 people are living as refugees in neighbouring countries.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/26/extreme-violence-blighting-a-generation-in-central-african-republic,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/26/extreme-violence-blighting-a-generation-in-central-african-republic

2015-05-26T12:04:04Z,global-development,Global development,How clamping down on tax avoidance can unlock billions for development,"Tax evasion is a major cause of underdevelopment. Against the backdrop of Greece struggling to plug budgetary holes, aggravated by rampant tax evasion, the upcoming UN financing for development conference to support achievement of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) is giving increased attention to cultivating domestic resources to promote development. Rather than adopting new initiatives to bolster tax bases and reduce evasion, UN members ought to focus on making existing tools work better. Among the most powerful instruments available is the anodyne-sounding convention on mutual administrative assistance in tax matters, which was developed under the OECD and Council of Europe, but is open to all jurisdictions. The convention is the result of tough negotiations and constitutes a major breakthrough, but has yet to achieve its potential. With governments worldwide losing an estimated $3tn (£2tn) annually to tax dodging, making this agreement effective —particularly for developing countries — could help unlock billions of dollars for national development efforts. There are many reasons why taxation is central to development. Most obvious is that taxes give states resources to invest in essentials such as education, roads, and healthcare. As countries become wealthier, taxes fund social welfare and pensions, reducing poverty and inequality and evening out aggregate demand. Less appreciated is the role of taxes in the development of states themselves. Historical scholarship, such as John Brewer’s classic work on18th-century Britain, shows that revenue collection builds governments’ bureaucratic competence and institutional integrity. The need for revenue drives capacity to collect taxes, which leads to improvements in state administration overall, thereby supporting broader economic growth. One of the sad ironies of public finance is that countries’ level of development is positively correlated with the share of gross domestic product (GDP) represented by taxes. In other words, wealthier states take a greater percentage of national income in the form of taxes than poorer countries. Within the OECD, the percentage of GDP taken up by the state ranges from 26-48% , while in developing countries the state typically receives only 5-20% . This is where the convention can make a major contribution. Developing countries’ relative inability to tax effectively has a variety of causes but lack of information tops the list. To avoid scrutiny by domestic tax authorities, wealthy persons and companies routinely shift their funds to foreign jurisdictions. Lacking legal means to demand the information from their counterparts overseas, national revenue authorities have often been without recourse. Until now. The convention is meant to reduce the need to enter individual bilateral tax information-sharing agreements, while streamlining the actual exchange of information. The process is quite simple. A tax authority in one country suspects a taxpayer of having income or assets in a foreign jurisdiction. The authority sends a request for information to the equivalent foreign body. Subject to procedural protections, including assurances of confidentiality, that authority processes the request and transmits the information to the requesting authority, which can then take steps to assess taxes owed. While the convention’s mechanisms are straightforward, a number of steps are needed to make it effective and the UN financing for development conference should back these. First, developing countries need to sign and ratify the agreement. Until now, although 85 jurisdictions have joined, only 26 are developing countries and in only 15 of those has it entered into force. If developing countries don’t enter, they can’t use the treaty’s mechanisms. Indeed, as more countries enter, the convention will become more useful because the pool of jurisdictions from which others can obtain tax information will be enlarged. Next, to encourage ratification and improve implementation, the convention should be prioritized in development activities. With OECD figures showing that support for tax administration represents less than 1% of all official development assistance, much more emphasis should be placed on making theconvention work. Above all, these initiatives should focus on building developing countries’ administrative capacity. Training and technical assistance are essential. Rather than being a vaguely defined ambition, these efforts must achieve demonstrable results. Specifically, they must help to upgrade national standards to a level that allows other participating countries to disclose confidential taxpayer information with certainty that its integrity will not be compromised. Official development proclamations regularly pay homage to goals of financial sustainability, while doing little to achieve it. Foreign aid can contribute to development but it will never rival states’ own tax and revenue-generating capacities. Developing those competencies, in relation to international revenue cooperation, will have spillover benefits for overall domestic revenue collection. And this will put governments firmly in charge of their own development efforts. As a legally binding treaty, the convention can catalyse activity by all stakeholders. If it is fully operational, there will be more chance of achieving the SDGs. It’s time to put this task at the top of the development agenda.

2015-05-26T10:59:56Z,global-development,Global development,"2015 is 'year of fear' for children worldwide, warns Gordon Brown","Children are bearing the brunt of escalating worldwide refugee crises, armed conflicts and natural emergencies with 2015 – dubbed “the year of fear” – already the most dangerous since 1945 for the youngest and most vulnerable in society, according to Gordon Brown, UN special envoy for global education. Delivering an impassioned call for urgent international action in a briefing in New York, the former British prime minister and Labour party leader said more than half the world’s record numbers of 38 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) and 16.7 million refugees are children.
An estimated 825,000 children are being trafficked each year and 5 million girls under the age of 15 are forced to marry. In total, according to UN figures, about 168 million children are used for unskilled labour, 85 million of whom are engaged in hazardous work. It is estimated 8.6 million children are in slavery, Brown said. “This is not the year of the child but the year of fear, with 2015 already the worst year since 1945 for children being displaced, the worst year for children becoming refugees, the worst year for children seeing their schools attacked,” he said. “We expect the figure to rise in crisis zone after crisis zone as even school-age children who were once at school are being forced into child labour. Today in some of the world’s most troubled spots it is open season for traffickers, with girls snatched from the streets in Nepal to adolescents forced into marriage in Syria, Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.” The extreme impact on children of the four-year-old civil war in Syria has received more international attention than many other crises. According to Save the Children, 10,000 Syrian children have been killed since the conflict began, 5.6 million are in need of humanitarian aid and 3.5 million have been forced from their homes. Nearly 2 million children have fled the country, while 3 million are unable to go to school. But 2015 has also seen an alarming spate of new, or renewed, crises including those in Burma and Bangladesh, where many of the Rohingya and Bangladeshi migrants who have fled by sea in recent weeks are unaccompanied children under 18.
In northern Nigeria and Pakistan, schools have been attacked and schoolgirls abducted by Islamist extremists. In Burundi, more than 100,000 refugees, mostly women and children, have fled current political unrest. Many are now at risk from a cholera epidemic affecting makeshift camps in Tanzania, with 400 new cases being reported daily. In South Sudan, children are being forcibly recruited as child soldiers as internal conflict has flared in the wake of the country’s 2011 declaration of independence. In Nepal, meanwhile, homeless young girls have become increasingly vulnerable to people traffickers in the wake of the recent earthquake disaster. “This week, Nepalese state radio messages are confirming what we already know,” Brown said. “In the midst of the fallout from the earthquake, the government is directly warning half a million girls – now on the streets – and their parents, to beware of suspicious gangs trying to recruit them and traffic them out of the country.” Brown said improved educational opportunities provided the best way to help vulnerable children, and called for the creation of a new international fund to help quickly target and assist young people caught up in wars and emergencies. He called on governments, aid agencies and development organisations to back the proposed “global humanitarian fund for education in emergencies”, which he said could be launched at the UN general assembly in New York in September. The UN’s World Education Forum, held in Incheon, South Korea, this month, heard that worldwide, 58 million children currently have no schooling at all, while 250 million are not learning basic skills even though half have spent at least four years at school.
The forum adopted targets intended to provide “inclusive, equitable, quality education for all”, underpinning the new Sustainable Development Goals that will supersede the 15-year-old Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) when the general assembly meets this autumn. Significant progress has been made in some least developed countries in improving early life education but many aspects of the MDGs on education, including universal access to primary education, remain unmet, the forum was told. Anthony Lake, executive director of the UN children’s fund (Unicef), said: “If this generation of children is to someday reduce the inequalities and injustices that afflict the world today, we must give all our children a fair chance to learn. This must be our collective vision and commitment.” Kishore Singh, UN special rapporteur on education, called for new strategies focusing on girls and women, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities and children living in conflict-affected areas, rural areas and urban slums. He said: “It is the weakest among us who need education the most and we cannot stand by as they are being excluded.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/26/2015-is-year-of-fear-for-children-worldwide-warns-gordon-brown,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/26/2015-is-year-of-fear-for-children-worldwide-warns-gordon-brown
2015-05-26T06:00:01Z,global-development,Global development,Refugees at Lebanon camp rely on 'hell water' that turns metal to rust | Peter Schwartzstein,"Water at Shatila refugee camp in Beirut’s southern suburbs is now so salty and ridden with chemicals that metal cutlery rusts after less than half an hour’s exposure to the brine. “Imagine having water so bad that you can’t have metal cutlery? It’s hell water really,” says Ahmed, a resident at the camp. Gesturing at the salty, foul-smelling liquid oozing from a nearby tap, his friend Moussa Deeb, an electrician originally from Damascus, adds: “Have you ever woken up and tried washing your face with sea water?”
Camp authorities now have to bring in water for bathing and cleaning from outside. The site of a brutal massacre during the Lebanese civil war, Shatila’s population has doubled to about 40,000 in the four years since the conflict in Syria began. At least 1.5 million refugees are estimated to have spilled over the border into Lebanon, with many seeking affordable housing in the populous coastal strip. The water infrastructure was already reeling from decades of over-pumping, and the effect of these new arrivals has been devastating. Families who used to receive four subsidised gallons of clean drinking water a week must now make do with half of that as cash-strapped camp bosses struggle to meet demand. Few communities in Lebanon have seen their water quality deteriorate as dangerously as Shatila, but the camp’s problems point to the country’s difficulties in coping with a sudden 30% growth in population. “People just don’t realise how critical the status of our water resources is,” said Nadim Farajalla, a professor of hydrology and water resources at the American University of Beirut. “Refugees arriving when there was already a drought really killed us.” Unlike Jordan and Iraq, both of which have also taken in hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees, Lebanon usually enjoys a long rainy season and receives ample recharge from melting mountain snows, although rains are beginning to become less predictable because of climate change. But poor management of water sources and the additional refugee demand have set the country on a destructive path. “Because of the Syrians, a water balance that should have been negative in 2030 is negative now,” said Fadi Georges Comair, general director of hydraulics and electrical resources at the ministry of energy and water. “We were organised to fulfil water demand management for about 4.5 million [people]. We were not ready to deal with the one-and-a-half to two million extras that have come already.” Over the mountains from Beirut, and alongside the Syrian border, residents of the agricultural Bekaa Valley are experiencing their own water crisis.
Water demand from the thousands of makeshift refugee tent settlements has meant rivers are drying up earlier than usual. Farmers, who previously resorted to using expensive wells for water in the hot summer months, are now having to pay out for these earlier in the year. According to Farajalla, the effects in a country that already imports 80% of its cereals, and where the amount of land devoted to food has fallen by 45% in 20 years, are obvious. Many farmers have simply given up. “Every week, there’s a bad pump here or a revolution there, so agriculture is not easy in Lebanon,” said Mohammed al-Arigi, who grows wheat, radishes and a variety of vegetables within earshot of heavy shelling and bombs three miles away across the border. The crisis has had some compensations, farmers say. The glut of young, desperate men has meant there’s plenty of cheap labour. But the tide of wastewater seeping from the haphazardly built refugee shelters has forced some to shift away from growing vegetables that are usually served raw, such as lettuce, due to concerns about exposure to contaminated water.
Water experts acknowledge that no country of Lebanon’s size could cope easily with such an influx of refugees, but they say infrastructural neglect by Beirut’s paralysed political class has left it particularly poorly placed to handle the crisis. “Water establishments are highly understaffed, lack financial means, technical competence, and effective internal organisation,” said Marie-Hélène Nassif, a consultant for the International Water Management Institute, who has conducted extensive research in the Bekaa. A national water strategy proposed in 2010 was never implemented properly due to political disagreements. Authorities are left to practically guess how much water they can count on because they lack the equipment necessary to gauge snowmelt. Shatila’s residents have tried to offset the terrible water quality by stocking up on rust-proof plastic cutlery. Nearby shops are doing a roaring trade selling water filters that offer the promise of usable tap water. But civic leaders fear that conditions in the camp, where children are at risk of electrocution by the low-hanging mess of water pipes and electrical wires, will only worsen as more Syrians seek sanctuary among its creaking tower blocks. “For sure, the population will increase as the Syria war continues,” said Abu Moujahed, director of the camp’s Children and Youth Centre. “And the water and services will, of course, just get worse and worse too.” • Peter Schwartzstein is a Cairo-based journalist.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/26/syrian-refugees-lebanon-shatila-camp-hell-water,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/26/syrian-refugees-lebanon-shatila-camp-hell-water
2015-05-25T23:01:05Z,global-development,Global development,"Western donors must pinpoint aid at poorest countries, says ONE","The battle to eliminate extreme poverty will require rich western nations to step up their financial help and spend at least half their aid budgets in the world’s poorest countries, a leading development campaign group said on Tuesday. ONE, the organisation co-founded by U2 frontman Bono, said donor nations should reverse the trend of recent years that has seen only 30% of assistance go to the 37 least-developed countries (LDCs). “Total overseas development assistance flows to the least-developed countries have been in worrying decline in recent years. In 2014, total overseas development aid to LDCs fell by 2% compared with 2013 and by 6% compared with 2010,” ONE said in a report designed to pressure the G8 leading western nations before their summit in Germany next month. It added that only one country directed more than 50% of its overseas development aid to LDCs in 2014 – Iceland. If the 24 rich countries that sit on the OECD’s development assistance committee had allocated half of their budgets to LDCs in 2014, it would have made an additional $26.5bn (£17.1bn) available to the world’s poorest countries, the report added. Donor nations have generally failed to fulfil the promise made at the Gleneagles summit of 2005 to meet the UN target of spending 0.7% of national income on aid. Only five countries – Sweden, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark and Britain – achieved the 0.7% level in 2014, and aid budgets were skewed to parts of the world where western nations had strong historical links or where there was geo-political or security reason for providing help. ONE said that 2015 would be a crucial year, with a conference in Addis Ababa on providing the finance for development followed in September by a meeting of the UN that will set 17 Sustainable Development Goals to be achieved by 2030. “A new set of global goals … will set out the path to a fairer, more prosperous world and an end to extreme poverty. But goals alone are not enough – need a clear plan of action and the determination to deliver it.” ONE added that the conference in the Ethiopian capital would be the “pivotal point of the year”. It would require governments, civil society and businesses to provide additional aid, curb the illicit financial flows and corruption that strip countries of precious development resources, and improve transparency and accountability. The campaign group called for a mutual accountability pact to meet the basic needs of the poorest people, which would require the mobilisation of international and domestic resources. The pact would include minimum spending levels on essential services of $300 per person in the 27 LDCs by 2020; increased domestic government revenues; increased aid targeted at the poorest countries; specific investments in agriculture, infrastructure, energy and technology; and mechanisms to ensure commitments are kept to. ONE added it was important that anti-poverty efforts concentrated on improving the lives of girls and women. “Poverty and gender inequality go hand in hand: girls and women in the poorest countries suffer a double hardship, of being born in a poor country and being born female. Put simply, poverty is sexist. Across virtually every measurable indicator, life is significantly harder for girls and women in LDCs compared with men, and compared with girls and women living in other countries,” it said.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/26/western-donors-must-pinpoint-aid-at-poorest-countries-says-one,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/26/western-donors-must-pinpoint-aid-at-poorest-countries-says-one
2015-05-25T08:00:09Z,global-development,Global development,Peace in Colombia relies on tackling systemic violence against women,"After more than 50 years of conflict marked by widespread and systemic sexual violence, Colombia has established a national day to remember the appalling suffering experienced by so many women, whose plight has until now been largely ignored. The first National Day for the Dignity of Women Victims of Sexual Violence caused by the Internal Armed Conflict takes place on Monday 25 May. The establishment of this special day and the inclusion of survivors of sexual violence in the peace talks in Havana aimed at ending the conflict demonstrate how public awareness of the issue is growing. It is hard to quantify the numbers affected. One survey estimates that between 2000 and 2009, almost half a million women suffered some form of sexual violence in areas affected by the conflict. But that is just an estimate. The truth is, in Colombia, as in many other countries with poor prosecution records, most women tend not to report acts of violence against them. According to the same survey, some 82% of women who have survived sexual violence in Colombia, domestic and conflict-related, have not reported the attacks. One of those at the forefront of demanding public recognition of this form of violence, and the impunity enjoyed by perpetrators, is Colombian journalist Jineth Bedoya Lima, who 15 years ago was abducted, tortured and raped by three paramilitaries while investigating a story about arms trafficking. For years after the attack she had remained silent. The UN security council recently commended Colombia for introducing a landmark law that recognises that sexual violence can constitute a crime against humanity, and enhances the status of sexual violence survivors so that they can receive reparations, psychosocial support and free medical care.
But the problem remains as marked as ever, if not worse, despite the fact the government and the Farc, the main insurgent group, have been engaged in peace talks for more than two years. Following a freedom of information request made by Claudia Mejía, director of NGO Sisma Mujer – a Christian Aid partner – the National Institute of Forensic Services revealed that they recorded a 93% increase of sexual violence in the context of the conflict. They also disclosed that there were 30% more killings of women by partners or ex-partners, and a sharp increase in threats against women’s human rights defenders. Explaining this apparent escalation of gender violence is not straightforward. One suggestion has been that more women are coming forward to report violence. Also, as more women dare to speak up, more may be facing a backlash. To women’s rights experts like Mejía, the persistence of violence against women, however, shows that there are other forces at work. She believes that the root causes are the deeply entrenched discrimination and inequality that condones gender violence and, crucially, the almost complete impunity, particularly of military perpetrators. For this reason, Sisma Mujer and other organisations recently filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court, calling for sexual violence to be recognised as a deliberate strategy and war crime, and condemning the failure to prosecute perpetrators. There is reason to hope that the final peace deal may bring some change. Thanks to relentless pressure by women’s groups, the negotiators in Havana have established a special gender sub-committee and listened to testimonies of victims of sexual violence. These are positive and innovative steps, although long overdue given numerous, unfulfilled international commitments to incorporate women and gender perspectives in peace negotiations.
Yet, because these are negotiations, and because all parties continue to deny their responsibility for such crimes, there is a very real risk that perpetrators may get away with some form of amnesty, as has happened with a number of other peace deals in Latin America. Failure to deal with abuses and allowing perpetrators of war crimes to walk free risks allowing such violence to become normalised, although the country may officially be at peace. The peace deal that is sought is the opportunity to introduce radical change, and to shape a more equal society, tackling the root causes of the conflict. Guaranteeing justice and reparations for women and girls is an essential step towards a peace that is lasting and meaningful. The work of women’s rights groups including Sisma Mujer, alongside initiatives such as choosing a national day to recognise victims of sexual violence are vital to maintain pressure on the peace negotiators.

2015-05-24T23:01:02Z,global-development,Global development,Nepal one month after the quake: 'The emotional impact has been devastating' | Sam Jones,"Somewhere among the immense spew of mud brick and broken timber that Bachulaxmi Shrestha now surveys is the home she shared with her family, the fruit and veg shop that was her livelihood, and the treasured keepsakes she had picked up over her 60 years. All of it was lost, instantly destroyed and commingled with two neighbouring houses, when the first 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck the Nepalese village of Chapagaun at lunchtime on 25 April. Shrestha was at work when it hit. “I ran outside and seconds later, the building collapsed behind me,” she says. “It fell and then the others next to it fell.”
Dizzy and terrified, she stood, looked at what had been her house, and wept. “Soon, lots of people came to the open space where I was and we all stood and cried for a long time while the earth shook,” she says. “We were so scared.”
A month after the disaster that killed more than 8,000 people and left thousands injured and homeless, Chapagaun, which lies half an hour’s drive from Kathmandu, remains a village trapped in an anxious limbo. Many of the houses that withstood the quake and the dozens of aftershocks that have followed are too badly cracked to be habitable and their owners too fearful to set foot in them. In the absence of permanent shelter, 200 villagers have established a temporary camp in a square, where they eat and sleep together. While the men scavenge the ruins and try to demolish them brick-by-brick, the women work if they can. Children, meanwhile, play in child-friendly spaces (CFSs), hundreds of which have been set up across Nepal by NGOs. Part-creche, part-school and part-psychosocial treatment centre, the spaces are designed to give children a fragment of the normality destroyed by the quake. At the Chapagaun CFS, run by the youth-led NGO Restless Development, girls sing hill country songs and dance while the boys do jigsaw puzzles made from bits of cut-up calendars. Neeva Shrestha is a 19-year-old student who was about to sit her exams when the quake struck. She spends her days helping the other children and attempting to reassure her mother, who is permanently dizzy and worried that the earth will split open again at any moment.
“I’ve been trying to keep my mum calm; I’m afraid too, but I am trying to be strong for her,” she says. “We feel safe in the camp even though everyone is too afraid to go back home.” Unlike many of the camps set up in the aftermath of the quake, the temporary shelter in Chapagaun has become a genuine refuge: the closeness of the community has been reinforced by the disaster. The women there have no fear of sexual assault and the children no anxiety about the traffickers who use such catastrophes to lure them away from their parents and into orphanages or sexual exploitation. “We eat and pass the time together,” says Neeva. “The earthquake has made the future very dark, but it’s nice to see the young children laughing and playing again.”
The situation elsewhere in Nepal is far bleaker. A helicopter flight across the central Sindhupalchok district – one of the worst-affected areas – reveals an ugly tapestry. Crows swoop over tumbles of brick and concrete that were once homes and schools, beams protrude through shattered roof tiles like open fractures and entire villages lie flattened. Orange, blue, yellow and white tents and tarpaulins confetti the steeply terraced hillsides, while people and animals stare up shyly from dwellings that look incapable of sheltering any life at all. Chautara municipality, the district’s headquarters, has the look of a war zone. Many of its taller buildings list at vertiginous and improbable angles, cricket stumps smashed by a brutal ball. Around and beneath them, the hills of rubble disclose the occasional door, window and sheet of twisted corrugated iron. High up on what must have been the second floor of one house, a kitchen cupboard clings to an external wall, tins and packets of food still sitting on its shelves. Krishna Gyawali, chief district officer of Sindhupalchok, sums up the damage with a handful of numbers: 4,242 people killed across the district, 4,000 injured, 44 still missing and 95% of homes destroyed. “We’ve lost schools, health facilities and government offices,” he says. “Most of our villages are in very remote areas; it takes five days to walk to some of them with relief items, but we’re trying our best. People are in a very difficult situation; they’ve lost their family and their children are suffering. They want to go to safe places.”
About 400 people are camped out around the Norwegian Red Cross field hospital, sleeping 12 to a tent. With the monsoon season expected to arrive within a few weeks, Oxfam, Save the Children, the International Organisation for Migration, the Red Cross and others are working with the police, army and government to keep people as safe as possible. Among the technical discussions of the relative merits of different kinds of tarpaulins and the possibility of upgrading to corrugated iron-roofed shelters, there is a familiar and nagging concern. “The areas affected by the quake have traditionally been high-traffic areas for taking girls to Indian brothels, but they’re also used for internal trafficking,” says Bimal Rawal, a child protection adviser for Save the Children. Although he praises the Nepalese government for putting a moratorium on international adoptions and banning the registration of new orphanages following the quake, Rawal says people are still trying to take children to orphanages in Kathmandu, where they are used in funding appeals. “All the agencies need to keep an eye on children,” he says. “Everything is important but it’s easy to overlook children in the relief efforts.”
His warning is echoed by Virginia Pérez, chief of child protection in Nepal for Unicef, the UN children’s agency. Sitting on the concrete stands of Tundikhel, a military parade ground in the centre of Kathmandu that is now home to hundreds of displaced families, she stresses the importance of keeping families together over the coming months. “The best thing we can do is make sure that kids stay with their parents,” she says. “The Nepalese government has put together a package to help vulnerable children – those who have lost their homes, are being looked after by neighbours, lone girls – and that needs to be properly targeted.” However, it is not just children who are at risk. Saraswoti Gautam, whose house was destroyed, brings her children to the Tundikhel camp each day but is too worried about the threat of sexual violence to stay there overnight. “We go back to another camp each night because we don’t want to share a tent with the men here,” she says.
Justine Greening, the UK’s secretary of state for international development – who visited Nepal last week – said some of the £33m the British government had pledged to help Nepal would be spent on protecting women and children, with £10m earmarked for primary healthcare and rebuilding hospitals. “We know that primary care has been hugely disrupted by this earthquake – children not getting the immunisations and vaccinations they normally would do and pregnant women not able to give birth in a safe place with skilled midwives,” she told the Guardian. “There’s also family planning, which is critical for women.” She added: “We’re doing a lot of work around women and girls and making sure that children can stay safe. In these situations women and girls and children are always vulnerable.” Greening said that the earthquake highlighted the importance of working to prepare for natural disasters. She pointed to efforts over the past four years to preposition emergency supplies in Nepal and improve the country’s healthcare capacity. She also said £2m contributed by the Department for International Development to the construction of World Food Programme humanitarian staging areas in Nepal had proved key to the emergency response. One such area was opened close to Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan airport just four weeks before the earthquake struck.
“Had the staging base for humanitarian supplies not been [in place] before the quake, the World Food Programme estimates the whole relief operation would have been pushed back three weeks, because all of that stuff would have come into the airport and been stuck on the tarmac and clogged up an already small airport even more,” she said. Although the talk has already turned to learning lessons from the quake and focusing on “building back better”, managing the psychological aftershocks of the disaster has emerged as one of the main challenges for relief workers. For Pérez and her colleagues – and chief district officer Gyawali – the second, 7.3 magnitude quake that hit Nepal on 12 May was almost as shattering as the first, despite being weaker. “The emotional impact of the second quake has been devastating on all levels,” says Pérez. “It’s delaying the recovery process and people are losing faith. The geologists may just call it an aftershock, but we call it the second quake: it’s been a double quake.” Gyawali refers to 12 May simply as the day “everything went back to zero”: within seconds, 1,000 people were running to the flat ground where the Norwegian Red Cross hospital in Chautara sits; 45 minutes after that, the first battered pick-up truck rolled into town, carrying casualties from the surrounding area. In Chapagaun, the close community suffers fresh agonies with each new tectonic twitch. A little before 3pm on Wednesday, a 4.4-magnitude tremor shook the village, sending the birds screeching into the air and the children screaming into the cover of their tarpaulin camp. It was yet another unnecessary reminder of what had happened – and what may yet lie ahead. “I’m still very frightened and nervous,” says Bachulaxmi Shrestha. “I lost my home and my family has lost everything. We don’t know what will happen next or if the government will come to help us. All we can do now is try to reclaim whatever we can from our house.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/25/nepal-one-month-after-earthquake-emotional-impact-devastating,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/25/nepal-one-month-after-earthquake-emotional-impact-devastating
2015-05-23T14:10:03Z,global-development,Global development,"3,000 children enslaved in Britain after being trafficked from Vietnam","Hien was 10 when he arrived in Britain. He did not know where he was or where he had been. He knew only that he was here to work. Since he emerged from the back of a lorry after crossing from Calais seven years ago, his experience has been one of exploitation and misery. He has been a domestic slave, been trafficked into cannabis factories, been abused and beaten and was eventually prosecuted and sent to prison. It has been a life of terror, isolation and pain. Hien’s story is not unique. He is one of an estimated 3,000 Vietnamese children in forced labour in the UK, used for financial gain by criminal gangs running cannabis factories, nail bars, garment factories, brothels and private homes. Charged up to £25,000 for their passage to the UK, these children collectively owe their traffickers almost £75m. While there is growing awareness of the use of trafficked Vietnamese people in the booming domestic cannabis trade, child trafficking experts are now warning that the British authorities are unable to keep up with the speed at which UK-based Vietnamese gangs are recruiting and exploiting children for use in other criminal enterprises such as gun-smuggling, crystal meth production and prostitution rings. “By our calculations there are around 3,000 Vietnamese children in the UK who are being used for profit by criminal gangs,” says Philip Ishola, former head of the UK’s Counter Human Trafficking Bureau. “The police and the authorities are now aware that trafficked children are being forced to work in cannabis farms but this is really only the tip of the iceberg. Often the same child will be exploited not just in a cannabis farm but also in myriad different ways. This is happening right under our noses and not enough is being done to stop it.” Police admit that they are struggling with the speed at which Vietnamese criminal gangs are diversifying and expanding their activities across the England and into Scotland and Northern Ireland. “Right now we are just fighting in the trenches, fighting in the nail bars,” said detective inspector Steven Cartwright, who heads Police Scotland’s human trafficking unit. “It is vital that we that we understand new methods being deployed by the gangs because we need to stop demand at one end or limit their ability to make money at the other.” Hien’s journey to the UK started when he was taken from his village at the age of five by someone who claimed to be his uncle. As an orphan, he had no option but to do as he was told. He spent five years travelling overland, completely unaware which countries he was going through, from Vietnam before being smuggled across the Channel and taken to a house in London. Here he spent the next three years trapped in domestic servitude, cooking and cleaning for groups of Vietnamese people who would come in and out of the property where he was held. The men in the house beat him and forced him to drink alcohol until he was sick. Other things happened to him that he still cannot talk about. He was never allowed out of the house and was told that if he tried to escape, the police would arrest him and take him to prison. During his time in that house, Hien says, many other Vietnamese children were brought in. They told him that they were here to work and to pay off debts for their families back home. They would stay for a few days and then be taken away, and Hien never saw them again. He became homeless after his “uncle” abandoned him. He slept in parks and ate out of bins. He was eventually picked up by a Vietnamese couple, who offered him a place to stay but then forced him to work in cannabis farms in flats in first Manchester and then Scotland. In his testimony to police, he says he still does not understand exactly what the plants were, although he understands now that they are worth a lot of money. He looked after the plants, using pesticides that made him ill, and only left the flat when he helped transport the leaves to be dried elsewhere. He was locked in, threatened, beaten and completely isolated from the outside world. “I was never paid any money for working there,” he says. “I did not stay there for money but because I was afraid and I hoped the whole thing would end soon.” When the police came, they found Hien alone with the plants. He told his story to the police, but was still sent to young offenders’ institution in Scotland, where he spent 10 months on remand, charged with cannabis cultivation. He was released only after the intervention of a crown prosecutor led to him being identified as a victim of trafficking. Vietnamese children such as Hien are easy pickings for the increasingly sophisticated trafficking gangs operating between the UK and Vietnam. Children make up nearly a quarter of the estimated 13,000 people trafficked into the UK every year, and Vietnamese children are the largest group of children trafficked to the UK. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that 30 Vietnamese children arrive illegally in the UK every month, on well-established smuggling routes. “Children are an increasingly valuable assets to criminal gangs because they are easy to get hold of, easily intimidated and exploited, and easy to keep isolated and unaware of what is really happening around them, which makes it far less likely for them to be able to disclose anything of use to the police,” says Ishola. When it comes to Vietnamese children, he says, the culture of seeing a child as the “golden egg”, who will be sent to work abroad and provide for their families still prevails. This attitude is exploited by gangs, who deceive families into believing that there is legitimate work in Britain for their children. “During their journey to the UK, the traffickers keep charging the children more and more money, and by the time they arrive, the pressure to pay back this enormous debt is a key factor in their vulnerability to ending up trapped in forced labour,” he says. “Upon arrival the children are faced with a highly organised system of criminal activity, with methods of control ranging from extreme physical brutality to debt bondage. Before they even arrive, that trap is set for them.” Members of the Vietnamese diaspora in London told the Observer that they had seen an explosion in child trafficking by criminal gangs operating on the peripheries of their communities in recent years. “Some of these children and victims have told me that it cost them £25,000 to get to the UK,” said one Vietnamese community leader in London, who did not want to be named. “They come with a debt and they are not allowed to leave until the debt is paid. That is slavery and exploitation.”
Like Hien, many of the children end up working on cannabis farms. The link between child trafficking and the UK’s domestic cannabis industry has been increasing, with Vietnamese children the main group at risk. According to a 2014 report by the NGO AntiSlavery International, almost all potential victims of trafficking linked to cannabis are Vietnamese, and more than 80% are children. Many of these children are subsequently prosecuted by the UK justice system, despite many being identified as potential victims of trafficking. This has led to Vietnamese children becoming the second-largest ethnic group held in youth detention centres across the UK. Vietnamese gangs have historically dominated the UK’s £1bn cannabis trade and have been instrumental in the proportion of domestically grown cannabis in Britain rising from 15% in 2005 to about 90% now. While the trade remains enormously profitable – the number of Vietnamese cannabis factories in the UK has grown by 150% in the past two years – their grip has been weakened thanks to increased law enforcement and under competition from British growers. Now they are finding new and more efficient ways of doing business. “In terms of law enforcement, I think we’re about two years behind the curve,” says Daniel Silverstone, a criminologist at London Metropolitan University who has written extensively on Vietnamese gangs in the UK. “Traffickers have changed their modus operandi in recent years in direct response to the attention and interventions of law enforcement. A few years ago it was almost exclusively cannabis farms, but their business interests have now become much more diverse. So we’re seeing an expansion into Scotland and Northern Ireland, the use of nail bars for forced labour and money laundering, and moves into drugs like crystal meth.” This means that children, who are an integral part of the gangs’ business operations, are also now being moved into other areas of exploitation. “As their grip on the domestic cannabis trade slips a little, they are looking to maximise their profits from these children in whatever way they can,” he adds. The Metropolitan police say that there is now much more awareness of the complexity of tackling the UK’s child trafficking problem but that the closed nature of the Vietnamese community has made things difficult. “What has persistently been a challenge for us is making inroads into this community,” says Phil Brewer, who heads its new human trafficking and kidnap unit. “We usually only find out about a child when we make a raid and find someone in a cannabis factory or nail bar, but often this person has been through multiple forms of exploitation before we reach them.”
Parosha Chandran, a leading human rights barrister and UN expert on trafficking, has represented Vietnamese children charged with cannabis cultivation who have gone through many different trafficking situations before being moved into cannabis farms. “Trafficked Vietnamese children have rarely faced just one type of forced labour,” she says. “I’ve come across cases where young people have been subjected to a spectrum of exploitative practices. In one of my cases, for example, the child was forced to look after people’s homes and care for their children, when he was just a child himself, then he was taken to work cleaning a nail bar, then moved to another place where he was forced to sew labels on to clothing – and all of this happened before he even arrived in the cannabis factory.” In March the UK passed its first Modern Slavery Bill, designed to increase the prosecution of traffickers and give better protection to victims of modern slavery in the UK. However, Chandran says that Vietnamese children continue to be prosecuted for cannabis cultivation while their traffickers remain free. “The Modern Slavery Act’s central focus on prosecution is misguided and its provisions fail to fully protect the rights of trafficked children,” she says. “We as a democratic country need to find durable solutions to ensure these children remain protected from harm for the rest of their lives.” At safe accommodation for child trafficking victims run by the charity Love146, Lynne Chitty, its UK care director, says that she has helped between 40 and 50 Vietnamese children try to rebuild their lives after trafficking experiences. “We have seen children starting to be exploited in multiple ways, to maximise the profit that can be gained from them,” she says. “We recently had a client who was in domestic servitude, forced to work in a nail bar during the day and every evening taken to a brothel and exploited there all night.”
Methods used to lure children from Vietnam to the UK are also becoming increasingly sophisticated, including use of social media. “Vietnamese children are brought to the UK, taken in by Vietnamese adults and put to domestic work,” says Swat Pandi, from the NSPCC’s child trafficking advice centre. “The child feels indebted to the adults for food and shelter and is told they need to return the favour by looking after cannabis plants. These children suffer high levels of neglect, emotional abuse and, in the absence of any protective factors, are highly vulnerable to physical and sexual abuse.” Despite the government’s pledge to end modern slavery and the UK’s first modern slavery bill, passed in March, Chitty says she has seen no change in the numbers of Vietnamese children coming through her charity’s services. “It’s very much business as usual,” she says. “We still have a problem with immediate safeguarding and appropriate placements for trafficked children. And young people are still being criminalised by the courts.” Even when a child has been taken out of trafficking and come under the care of a local authority, he or she is likely to return to the control of the traffickers. In 2013, a report by independent thinktank the Centre for Social Justice concluded that 60% of trafficked children in local authority care go missing, nearly a third of them within a week of arrival. Most are never found again. There are increasing reports of children being retrafficked from foster homes or when they have been given asylum status. “I don’t think we understand the entire enterprise,” says detective inspector Cartwright. “Despite our best intentions I think we’re not offering them anything that would persuade them to stay. Many will get retrafficked because we didn’t offer them a better alternative to what the traffickers are providing.” Hien is trying to rebuild his life after being given asylum in Scotland, but is struggling to find peace after years of trauma. “I still worry that the traffickers may find me and come to my house. But I know this time that I will ask for help,” he says. “I think they have justice here but I wish they hadn’t kept me in prison for so long. By telling my story, I want people to understand what I have experienced here.” Additional reporting by Neil Loughlin and Kieran Jones MODERN SLAVERY IN NUMBERS 10,000 The Home Office estimates that there are between 10,000 and 13,000 victims of modern-day slavery in the UK. 100 Estimates suggest that there could be 100 children trafficked every week into the UK. Albanian and Nigerian females, including adults, make up the largest groups being referred to agencies as potential victims, while Vietnamese people make up the largest number of males referred. British children make up the largest group of trafficked young people, while Vietnamese children are the largest number of foreign nationals exploited in the UK. 34% The National Crime Agency has reported a 34% rise in potential trafficking victims in 2014 compared with a year earlier. Adults are predominantly victims of sexual exploitation, while minors are exploited for labour. 51% The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) says that 51% of all the young people referred to itschild trafficking advice centre from Vietnam have been reported missing at one time. 96% Anti-Slavery International says that of the potential trafficking victims who were forced to cultivate cannabis, 96% were from Vietnam and 81% of those were children. 25% Nearly 25% of all trafficking victims are children. £30,000 Agencies report that victims are being sold on, along with their debt, for as much as £30,000, to other traffickers for multiple exploitation, including sex trafficking, domestic servitude and cannabis cultivation. 58% Of the trafficked children who have disappeared, the NSPCC reported in its 2012 all-party parliamentary groupreport that 58% were being exploited for criminal activity and cannabis cultivation.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/23/vietnam-children-trafficking-nail-bar-cannabis,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/23/vietnam-children-trafficking-nail-bar-cannabis
2015-05-23T06:00:10Z,global-development,Global development,Ethiopia's election is a wake-up call on human rights and sound governance | Daniel Calingaert and Kellen McClure,"On Sunday, millions of Ethiopians will line up at polling stations to participate in Africa’s largest exercise of political theatre. A decade-long campaign by Ethiopia’s government to silence dissent forcibly has left the country without a viable political opposition, without independent media, and without public challenges to the ruling party’s ideology. For most Ethiopians, these elections are a non-event.
The one potential dividend of these sham polls, however, is the international attention they will garner for the government’s growing political repression. The blatant disregard for internationally recognised standards for free and fair elections just might convince Ethiopia’s largest donors that it is time to rethink their relationship with an increasingly authoritarian government. As long as democratic governance and respect for human rights are pushed aside by donors in favour of economic development and security cooperation, Ethiopia’s long-term stability is at serious risk. Since 2005, the ruling Ethiopian Peoples’ Revolutionary Democratic Front’s (EPRDF) has cracked down on independent media and human rights groups. In 2009, parliament passed the charities and societies proclamation, which placed restrictive regulations on non-government organisations, including limitations on foreign funding. Today,only a handful of these groups exist, and most are struggling to survive. The preferred government strategy for eliminating independent media is to file criminal charges against publishers, and to impose hefty fines and prison terms. When lawsuits do not succeed, the government simply arrests journalists, as occurred last year when bloggers and journalists affiliated with the Zone 9 blogging collective were apprehended. The group remains imprisoned and charged as terrorists. Post-election, the EPRDF, secure in its hold on power, might be willing to allow a small degree of dissent: Ethiopian officials are increasingly wary of reactions by the international community to the crackdown on critics and in 2013 published a national human rights action plan.
The US, UK and European Union – Ethiopia’s largest donors – need to increase their support for democracy and human rights because much can be done right now. Despite years of political repression, a new generation of human rights defenders is slowly emerging. The Zone 9 bloggers represented this new generation, using new technologies to educate fellow Ethiopians on exercising and defending their rights. The human rights and democracy groups that remain are finding creative ways to conduct their work. This includes working with traditional development organisations, which the government generally tolerates, or focusing on seemingly apolitical issues, such as government accountability and corruption, that are important in strengthening Ethiopia’s democracy. Donor countries fall short in their support for these groups. In the US, President Barack Obama’s latest budget request includes some $400m (£257m) in assistance to Ethiopia – but only $2m of it is for democracy and human rights programming. The UK is equally parsimonious in democracy support. One reason is that the EPRDF makes it difficult for domestic groups to accept outside aid. Donors could take concrete action right now. First, supporting off-shore programming allows activists to travel outside Ethiopia to get technical and strategic advice. Second, donors’ strategies for Ethiopia should include funds specifically dedicated to strengthening independent media outlets and journalists; the EU intends to take this step after the election.
Also, donors can find ways around foreign funding restrictions by pushing for the creation of funding pools considered local under Ethiopian law. The EU did this in 2011, when it created the Civil Society Fund, providing assistance to local human rights and democracy groups. The US should use its economic and diplomatic leverage to do likewise, a move that would provide a much-needed lifeline for these groups. Greater funding for human rights will be vital for Ethiopian activists, whose reach has been limited by the charities and societies proclamation. Before that came into being six years ago, the country’s leading human rights organisation, the Ethiopian Human Rights Council (EHRCO), operated with a budget of $400,000 and 60 employees. Today, its budget is less than half that figure, and staffing is down 80%. The only thing keeping EHRCO alive is financial aid from the EU Civil Society Fund. Ethiopia receives nearly $4bn in official development assistance. This is more than any other country in Africa and makes up a significant portion of the government’s annual budget. If the US, UK, EU and Canada coordinated policies, Ethiopia would have to respond to their human rights and democracy concerns. Ethiopia’s election should be a wake-up call for the international community. With each successive election that does not allow genuine choice, both apathy and resentment grow, and Ethiopia risks falling prey to the same instability that has plagued its neighbours.

2015-05-22T13:58:17Z,global-development,Global development,Uncovering unheard voices of Brazil...,"I wrote last summer about our plan to run citizen reporting programmes in different parts of the world. The aim is to train marginalised people and communities to bring forth burning issues and stories that, perhaps, the national and international media are overlooking. In June we visited South Africa, and October India. Now we’ve just returned from Brazil. Twenty people came from all parts of the country to take part in a two-day workshop. The training covered storytelling, evidence-finding, verification, ethics, social media and the ways participants can connect to us directly through digital platforms such as GuardianWitness. The stories they brought in were extraordinary, covering indigenous rights in the Amazon, Olympic relocations, young people in the favelas, sex workers during the World Cup, and life for Bolivian and Syrian migrants. One of our trained citizen reporters, Luis Adorno, collaborated with our Latin America correspondent Jon Watts on a murder story in Sao Paulo. We plan to use their work as part of a big piece on violence across Brazil. ‘A Year in a Favela’ will chart the period immediately before the Olympics, with our newly trained citizen reporters in Maré, Alemão and Rocinha delivering monthly updates. We have also commissioned a ‘How I Go to School’ video series with children from rural areas in Brazil. Several participants said education was their priority, especially the problems that many children face getting to school. One landless worker told us of students who had to walk for two hours across a river after their old school was shut down. Favela residents described long bus journeys even to reach city schools. Indigenous groups spoke of the challenges faced by children who have to go by boat through the forest. Our correspondent is in touch with citizen reporter Tonico Benites in order to plan a visit to Guarani Kaoiwa for a feature article about Brazil’s other indigenous people, and how they are not the photogenic jungle-dwellers of the world’s imagination, but live in much worse conditions. Finally - for now - we also commissioned an opinion piece about the threat posed by miners and loggers to the village of Itaituba.

2015-05-22T12:58:32Z,global-development,Global development,Ethiopia's elections are just an exercise in controlled political participation | Jason Mosley,"Ethiopians will go to the polls on 24 May. Few observers doubt the outcome, with the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) expected to remain in power. While symbolically significant – this is the first general election since the death of the long-serving prime minister Meles Zenawi in 2012 – the polls are more of a logistical hurdle for the ruling party than a competitive, democratic exercise. What happens after the elections is more important for stability than the conduct of the polls themselves.
The prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, will lead the EPRDF into the elections, but there is intense speculation about how long he will remain in charge. Senior figures in the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, Meles’ former party and the core constituent group of the EPRDF, are assumed to be competing to succeed Desalegn as national leader. However, Meles had begun a generational shift in the EPRDF’s leadership, bringing new leaders to the fore – including Hailemariam as his deputy – in the two years preceding his death. The continued dominance of ethnic Tigrayan leaders (such as Meles) was creating a challenge for the EPRDF as a multi-ethnic coalition. Hailemariam, an ethnic Wolayta from southern Ethiopia, is thus a symbolically significant choice. Retaining Hailemariam would reflect recognition within the EPRDF executive committee that stability rests on maintaining a truly multi-ethnic party. The EPRDF values stability, given its ambitions. It came to power with a vision of itself as a “vanguard” party, setting the agenda and pulling the country’s population along with it. In the past decade, that agenda has focused on an intensive campaign of infrastructural development – especially roads, railways, and electrification – which has underpinned a surge in headline GDP growth (which averaged 10.8% between 2004 and 2013). The impacts are visible, although poverty reduction in a heavily agrarian and rural society remains a challenge. The government is expected to unveil its next five-year economic plan by June, following the 2010-2015 growth and transformation plan – probably maintaining a focus on infrastructure, including links to neighbouring economies. Boosting exports is at the core of Ethiopia’s economic strategy.
The EPRDF sees elections as an opportunity to engage the population in an act of political participation, albeit non-competitive. Last year, the government conducted a series of training sessions for mid-level and senior civil servants, university lecturers and students, during which the goals of a developmental state were set out, and a case was made for the EPRDF’s continued leadership – perhaps for decades. The government also adapted its “one to five” network, which had underpinned massive expansion in EPRDF membership – now at about 7 million – since 2005. Instead of one member recruiting five, one public sector worker is now responsible for reporting on the “developmental activities” of a group. Beyond “participation”, the mobilisation and social control aspects of this network help entrench EPRDF control. Although opposition parties are participating in the election, their competitiveness has been undermined by internal divisions and bureaucratic obstacles. The main block, the Ethiopian Federal Democratic Unity Forum, emerged before 2010 but has failed to move beyond a strategic coalition and forge a common political platform. The Blue party was established in 2012, and has managed to organise some demonstrations. Divisions within and between parties have enabled the government-controlled national electoral board of Ethiopia to establish bureaucratic hurdles. For example, the sole opposition MP will not stand for re-election after the board registered a rival faction of his party.
Demonstrations have emerged as an alternative outlet for dissent. Since 2011, Muslim leaders have organised intermittent protests against government involvement in religious affairs, after the EPRDF sought to promote the influence of al-Ahbash, a perceived moderate school of Islamic practice. Protests have triggered crackdowns by security forces. Significant demonstrations also took place in May 2014, in a largely spontaneous response to a draft of Addis Ababa’s city expansion plan. The Ethiopian capital is at the heart of the EPRDF’s economic development strategy, but its footprint effectively extends throughout Oromia, the state in which it is located. A proposal to absorb some of the neighbouring administrative districts under the Addis Ababa authorities prompted a wave of regional protests and another crackdown. A few weeks ago, EPRDF critics took advantage of demonstrations against the apparent execution of 30 Ethiopian Christians in Libya by Islamic State to voice frustration with the government. In the absence of formal spaces where political dissent and grievances can be aired, there is a risk that spontaneous demonstrations of this kind could escalate. In this balance, the EPRDF’s relations with donors are a crucial factor in maintaining its position. Ethiopia remains structurally dependent on aid, with the country receiving more than $3 billion a year from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. However, all indications are that external support will remain strong, regardless of electoral openness. Ethiopia is a key partner for countries concerned about security in the region, especially the US, UK and the European Union. Consequently, political reform will need to come from within the system.

2015-05-22T10:54:06Z,global-development,Global development,South Sudan close to economic collapse as famine fears resurface,"South Sudan is on the verge of economic collapse, sparking renewed fears of famine as continued fighting takes a heavy toll on people’s livelihoods, a top UN official has warned. Toby Lanzer, the UN humanitarian coordinator in South Sudan, said there is a “very high probability” that soaring inflation will cause the South Sudanese pound to collapse.
“It’s not only that South Sudan has some of the lowest human development indicators of anywhere. It’s not only that you’ve had 17 months of pretty brutal violence. It’s that we’re also in the midst of economic stress, which – to be clear – is on the verge of economic collapse,” said Lanzer. “That will add significant pressure to people who are trying to eke out a living, and it will certainly send some people who have managed to get by over the edge, and turn them to just about surviving. People will be spending 80-85% of what income they have on food.” South Sudan slid into civil war in December 2013, when president Salva Kiir accused his former deputy, Riek Machar, of launching a rebellion. Fighting has mostly been waged across ethnic lines, pitting Kiir’s Dinka against Machar’s Nuer. About 3.5 million people – nearly 40% of South Sudan’s population – will require emergency food assistance by June, according to the famine early warning systems network (Fews Net). In March, fresh skirmishes broke out, putting 650,000 people beyond the reach of aid agencies. Recent fighting has prompted NGOs to evacuate their staff from Leer, Koch, Nyal, Ganyiel and Mayendit, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha). The army said on Wednesday it had taken Leer, the town where Machar was born, from opposition forces after an almost month-long assault that has come at a huge cost to civilians. Paul Critchley, head of mission in South Sudan for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), told Agence France-Presse: “I managed to make contact yesterday with one of our South Sudanese employees in the Leer surroundings, who told me that he had been immersed in muddy water for up to nine hours to avoid bullets flying overhead. He recovered the bodies of two dead children from the swamp and reported that a woman from the group had been abducted. Someone else was looking after her baby.” Rebels last week launched a major counterattack, including an assault on Malakal, the state capital of Upper Nile and the gateway to the country’s last remaining major oil fields. There has also been heavy fighting in vital oil zone areas north of Malakal, around the town of Melut, where two mortar bombs hit a UN base, killing four civilians including a woman and child. Children as young as seven have been killed amid the rising violence; others have been raped, abducted, mutilated or recruited to fight. Survivors told the UN children’s agency, Unicef, that whole villages were burned to the ground by armed groups, while girls and women were raped and killed. At least 19 boys and seven girls were reportedly killed, said Unicef. Critchley said: “The escalation has left people in conflict areas exposed to violence and without much needed medical care and humanitarian assistance.” Much of the recent violence took place in Malakal, in the north-east of the country, where MSF has established a safe haven for about 30,000 civilians. “The highly volatile situation continues to prevent teams from being able to enter Malakal town itself,” MSF said. Heavy rains are expected to spread across the country by the end of June, turning roads to mud and making it more difficult for aid agencies to provide assistance. Fighting has also prevented farmers from planting new crops in time for the country’s rainy season, lowering expectations for future harvests. “[Recent violence] bodes very, very badly for the coming three to six months. I see the number of people who are severely food insecure growing sharply in the coming months,” said Lanzer.
Huge numbers of people already facing severe food insecurity will be unable to grow food, meaning the possibility of famine “cannot be excluded”, Lanzer said. “In a way, we are already very, very worried because the last place to have a famine was Somalia, but actually many hundreds of thousands of people died well before the famine was officially [declared],” he added. There is mounting frustration, both within South Sudan and among the diplomatic community, over the slow progress of peace efforts. Talks brokered by the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development floundered in early March. “We don’t have any concrete news that [peace talks] are likely to begin in the foreseeable future,” Lanzer said. “There are so many of us here in Juba and on the ground in South Sudan who are really frustrated by the situation and the tragedy unfolding in front of our eyes. The greatest frustration is that we do not sense urgency and a will to foster reconciliation from the political leadership.” On 16 June the European commission and Ocha will hold a conference in Geneva to raise money for humanitarian operations in South Sudan. Lanzer is hoping to raise at least $600m (£383m) for aid and logistics. “That will be a very important moment for the aid operation in South Sudan. It will be crucial that we raise a significant amount of money in mid-June to help tide us over during this lean season, when we really need to step up the aid operation.” But what the country really needs is a lasting peace deal, Lanzer said. “In the absence of peace, I find it difficult to see a way out of this.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/22/south-sudan-conflict-economic-collapse-famine-fears,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/22/south-sudan-conflict-economic-collapse-famine-fears
2015-05-22T09:15:10Z,global-development,Global development,"When disaster strikes, cash transfers can offer older people a vital lifeline | Toby Porter","Khamraj*, 87, lost everything when his home collapsed in front of him during the earthquake in Nepal. He was given $75 (£48) from HelpAge International and can now afford the labour to build a temporary shelter. He is one of 10,000 people over the age of 60 who have received this support.
Cash relief, which complements in-kind humanitarian assistance as well as offering a potential alternative to it, is increasingly common. It is often preferable to relief items, allowing individuals and families to spend money on what they need, and to make these critical decisions for themselves in a dignified manner. Cash spent locally and on useful things has a positive impact on the economy, and can greatly assist the process of markets re-establishing themselves. Money in the hands of the most vulnerable disaster victims has been shown to support traders all the way down the supply chain. For the donors who fund humanitarian assistance and the agencies that deliver it, cash offers obvious advantages. Less expenditure on transport and warehouse costs means more funding where we all want to see it. Imagine the terrain and logistical challenges in Nepal at the moment, and think how much easier it would be – assuming food is available to buy locally – to transport money for people to buy food, rather than sending in supplies by truck. Cash distributions can greatly reduce logistical costs, meaning more money can go directly into the hands of those who need it.
Older people often face specific challenges during the distribution of relief items. Long waits can be a hardship for the elderly – and perhaps completely impossible – while for those with reduced strength, large, heavy items can be difficult to carry home. Chaotic scrambles for blankets or food dropped off by helicopters or trucks, scenes we know all too well from our televisions, tend to reward the strongest in a community, not the weakest. Older carers of children – and there are many in Nepal because of the widespread migration of young adults to cities in Nepal, India and the Gulf for work – may find it hard to attend food distributions unless they can find someone to fill in for them. But cash puts older women and men back in control: in most towns and villages, goods can be paid for at a store and then delivered to their door. In addition to physical relief efforts, we’ve been working with the government of Nepal and the World Food Programme to ensure that households with older people can be included in cash-for-work programmes. These schemes are widely used, and rightly so: they put money in people’s pockets, and enable critical “clear-up” tasks – debris clearing, road opening and so on – to be completed quickly. Such work is far from easy, and not everyone in a community is strong enough to do it. About 8% of Nepal’s population is aged 60 or above, and approximately 650,000 older people in Nepal have been affected by the disaster. In many past clear-up operations, we have seen older and disabled members of the community miss out on cash-for-work programmes altogether. Not in Nepal, though: international guidelines now ask all relief agencies running schemes of this type to find light labour tasks such as childcare, record-keeping or fetching water. Even more significant, they are asked to make compassionate, unconditional payments equivalent to a day’s work if a person is truly unable to do tasks of any kind due to age or infirmity. This could impact positively on hundreds of thousands of older or disabled people in the coming months.
Cash distributions are not suitable for every context, and not without risks. Agencies need to understand the local economic and security context. If there is no food or shelter material to buy locally, cash will not put food on the table or a roof over someone’s head. Agencies distributing cash must obviously do all they can to ensure the safety and security of everyone involved, so we think about the time of day when money is given out, checking whether older people will be able to return home in daylight and that due diligence has been undertaken to ensure the security of both recipients and staff. Individual agencies donating cash with a specific aim – for example, to achieve a positive nutritional outcome or to help children resume their schooling – must be prepared to accept that, in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, a family may not share the NGO’s priorities. The very element that makes cash so empowering for those who receive it can challenge the well-choreographed and rehearsed narratives within our sector about the relationship between inputs and outcomes. Importantly, however, fears that people will spend the money they receive on “negative products” such as alcohol and tobacco are almost never found to be justified. That they persist is to the discredit of an overly paternalistic humanitarian system, rarely to the families receiving cash. * Names have been changed.

I’ve only been able to leave the hospital twice since then. The first time was to refer a patient to a specialised hospital as his life was in danger. Thankfully, he is now alive and well. The second time was to participate in the burial of a dear friend who had died. He was an administrative employee in a local hospital but was working as a volunteer to provide first aid to the injured. One day, he was transferring an injured patient to the hospital. The car was going fast – there was no ambulance and they were using an open pickup. My friend fell from the car and was taken to a hospital. I was not able to visit him, as I was busy here; we were receiving many cases and it was important for me to stay in order to supervise the nurses, nursing assistants, cleaning staff, and others. On the third day after his injury, I received news of his death. The second time I went outside the hospital was to say farewell to my friend and participate in the burial. He was a pleasant, hard-working and brave person.
My family left with our neighbours to an area outside Aden for their own safety. I wasn’t able to see them or say goodbye. My house is not far from the hospital, about 3km away, but it feels like thousands of kilometres. I cannot go and check if everything is OK there. I heard from some neighbours that our neighbourhood has been affected by shells, but I don’t know the condition of my house. Is it locked? Have the windows been broken? Has it been robbed? All I do is work and eat and take some rest if I can. Often, I try to sleep but am woken by an emergency and have to make sure everything is going as planned in order to receive the injured. We are still receiving significant numbers of patients despite the fact that many have difficulties reaching the hospital. Some patients told me they had to pay 10 times [more] for transport compared with prices before the clashes, so they are the ones who make it to the hospital. So, for a trip that used to cost 500 Yemeni rials (about $2.50), some people are now paying 5,000-6,000 rials to come to the hospital. This amount is difficult to afford in the current circumstances, especially as so many people have not received their salaries due to the bank and post offices and foreign exchange centres being closed, and the extreme difficulty of movement in the city. Food and water are additional problems, besides fuel shortages and the deteriorating security situation in Aden. Some of my neighbours say that they are taking two meals and sometimes only one meal a day after having to wait in long queues to buy food.
It is the same problem with water, with people having to queue with jerrycans. We are facing all this in the hot summer of Aden, which gets hotter every day. Though we usually have food for the people in the hospital, sometimes we face problems providing it as we cannot go out. Restaurants and grocery stores are closed in areas where there are clashes. Our biggest fear is that the fighting will surround the hospital. Many times, when the clashes intensify, we go down to the basement. But this creates a different problem. Before we save ourselves, we move the patients who are in beds near windows to a safe place. This has happened many times. We hear the sound of gunshots and shelling or air strikes and we move all the patients to safe areas before finding a safe place for ourselves. Windows at the hospital have been broken more than once and bullets have entered, but no one has been hurt inside the hospital.
Some of our medical team in Aden have lost family members due to the fighting. Some have lost a father, a brother, a friend. Sometimes members of the team leave the hospital to check on their families and we hear nothing about them for a week or two due to the bad telecommunications coverage or the unstable security situation, which forces them to stay home. I have no idea how long things will stay like this. I am very sad to see what has happened to Aden. A friend of mine tells me that I will not believe my eyes if I go to the Crater district of Aden now. Crater is my favourite place in Aden and I have many beautiful memories of being there. We have to forget about our pain and motivate ourselves to continue working and providing healthcare to patients. As for the ceasefire we heard so much about, we have not felt it here in Aden.

2015-05-21T11:32:53Z,global-development,Global development,Privatising public services is no way to fund sustainable development | Mark Dearn and Meera Karunananthan,"This week in New York, UN member states are discussing implementation and review mechanisms for the sustainable development goals (SDGs), which will become the focus of the UN development agenda for the next 15 years. In its 2014 world investment report, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) estimates the SDGs will require between $3.3tn and $4.5tn (£2.1-£2.9tn) a year to implement. Proponents of privatisation have used this funding gap to promote the case for greater private sector participation, particularly in the global south.
But before the UN creates a new channel for foreign investments in public services it needs to take a closer look at the history of the private sector “leaving behind” the most marginalised and vulnerable. This is particularly salient in a global context where investment treaties increasingly limit the ability of states to uphold human rights commitments when they are deemed to interfere with profits. In March this year, an Indonesian court annulled a 17-year-old private contract with the water corporations Suez and Aetra on the basis of human rights violations resulting from a fourfold rise in tariffs since the utility was privatised, lower service coverage than promised, and water leakage levels of up to 44%. Jakarta is the largest of 186 municipalities worldwide that have brought water and sanitation services back into the public sector over the past decade. In May 2014, Greece’s top administrative court prevented the privatisation of Athens Water, ruling that it would violate human rights. In July 2012, Italy’s constitutional court blocked plans to privatise water. Uruguay and the Netherlands have adopted outright bans on private water services. For the most part, these were outcomes of public outrage at corporations profiting from astronomical rates as they shortchanged the public on service quality and diminished environmental, public health, and labour standards. Research shows that the estimated $260m financing gap in water and sanitation will be best met through public financing, which currently accounts for more than 90% of global infrastructure investment. Conversely, without an economic incentive to serve poor communities, the private sector will not ensure universal enjoyment of the human right to water and sanitation. A Public Services International Research Unit (PSIRU) study shows that private sector investment results in very few new connections in parts of the world where the need is greatest, such as sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia.
Requiring ever-increasing returns on investments, for-profit operations are far more expensive than public financing through progressive taxation or bonds. PSIRU data demonstrates that the vast majority of states have the capacity to deliver universal access to strong public services. Even countries with the highest number of people in need of water and sewerage connections could deliver these services over a 10-year period with less than 1% of GDP a year. For the few countries where needs cannot be met through progressive taxation, the gap can be filled by aid. Foreign investment poses an increasing threat, due to the rapidly expanding web of trade and investment deals that incorporate investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanisms. ISDS undermines state sovereignty by allowing investors to make recourse to a separate court system that enables them to sue states when policies threaten present or future profits. ISDS arbitration is beholden to the terms of trade treaties, which are designed to protect investments. This means that in any case of doubt, provisions are interpreted in the investor’s favour, over and above any concern for democratic decision-making for the public good. There has been a sharp increase in the use of ISDS. Unctad records indicate that, in the 50 years to the end of 2014, there have been a total of 608 known ISDS cases, with 58 new cases in 2012, and 42 in 2014. A new investment agreement is concluded every other week.
Argentina has been sued more than 40 times for actions it took during its economic crisis in the early 2000s. Faced with mass unemployment and 70% of children living in poverty, it fixed the price of water, gas and electricity, and later nationalised utilities to stave off threatened price hikes. In a ruling last month, the country was ordered to pay Suez $405m. While Argentina argued that it acted to ensure the human right to water for its population, the tribunal found that human rights cannot override investor rights. This fundamental premise of ISDS means southern countries must absorb the double impact of privatisation and investment treaties. Last month, Alfred de Zayas, UN special rapporteur on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, warned that secret investment agreements threaten human rights and violate international law. In March, more than 100 US law professors signed a letter highlighting the threat posed by the unaccountable ISDS system to the rule of law and domestic sovereignty. If the international community is truly concerned about “leaving no one behind,” the SDGs must ask why so many have been left behind in the first place. With the rise of investment treaties giving primacy to “corporate rights”, and no legally binding international mechanisms to hold these corporations accountable for human rights violations, greater private sector participation in water and sanitation projects through the SDGs will only exacerbate the water and sanitation crisis around the globe.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/21/privatisation-public-services-sustainable-development-investor-state-dispute-settlement,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/21/privatisation-public-services-sustainable-development-investor-state-dispute-settlement
2015-05-21T06:00:00Z,global-development,Global development,Burundi's turmoil points to a shifting social and political landscape | Clár Ní Chonghaile,"The upheaval in Burundi may bear many of the hallmarks of a classic African military coup but, for some analysts, the crisis is indicative of a newfound public hunger for good governance, and a reaction against administrations run by political strongmen who cloak repression in the trappings of democracy. As global leaders work on the sustainable development goals (SDGs), a blueprint for governing development over the next 15 years, young people in Burundi are making their own demands, of their leaders as well as international donors. Their appeals for democracy and abuse-free institutional processes mirror the call in SDG 16 to promote the rule of law, ensure equal access to justice, and develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions.
Burundi’s crisis began in late April after the ruling CNDD-FDD party nominated President Pierre Nkurunziza to run for a third term in the country’s June elections, despite a two-term constitutional limit. Protesters took to the streets and clashed with police. Then, on 13 May, Major General Godefroid Niyombare told reporters that he had dismissed the president. The attempted coup was short-lived, however, and Niyombare is now on the run. Nkurunziza is back in charge, and fears of reprisals are widespread. Rights groups say at least 20 people have been killed and more than 110,000 Burundians have fled to neighbouring countries, raising fears of a “severe humanitarian crisis”. Some observers predict a drawn-out period of uncertainty and violence, with particular risks for opposition activists and the media. Protests continued on Wednesday, while the government said local and parliamentary elections would be delayed for a week but the presidential elections would go ahead as planned on 26 June. Some elements of the crisis – the timing of the coup to coincide with the president’s absence at a regional summit, the fear of ethnic tensions exploding – seem to hark back to Burundi’s unstable past. But Jesper Bjarnesen, senior researcher at the Nordic Africa Institute, says the dynamic is different this time. Bjarnesen visited the Burundian capital Bujumbura recently and met with young activists who style themselves “the Arusha generation”, a nod to the peace accords that, in 2005, brought an end to a 12-year civil war between Hutu rebels and the mainly Tutsi army. For these activists, ethnicity is no more the issue than Nkurunziza himself: rather, they feel the president has violated the constitution. “It’s about political principles,” says Bjarnesen. “That is remarkable. It’s not that long ago that ethnicity was in many ways the … defining split. What I got from [the activists] was this sense that formal politics are just not a useful medium for those not in power.” Yolande Bouka, a researcher in conflict prevention and risk analysis at the Institute for Security Studies, says Burundi’s government has long shown a disdain for the Arusha peace accords that has chipped away at trust between political actors.
“Should the conflict drag on and erode inter-ethnic trust … it is possible to see a flare-up of ethnic tensions,” says Bouka, adding that the international community should have acted sooner on warning signs that the authorities were cracking down on dissent after the 2010 elections. Nkurunziza is not alone in attempting to use almost absolute political power to extend his rule. Next door, Rwanda’s president, Paul Kagame, is said to be considering another term despite a two-term limit. Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni, already one of Africa’s longest serving leaders, has already changed the constitution to allow him to run again. There are more cautionary tales. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Joseph Kabila was forced to withdraw a bill seen as an attempt to extend his term after protests in January. Nkurunziza may also be mindful of Burkina Faso’s former president, Blaise Compaoré, one of Africa’s longest serving leaders, who was forced from office after he tried to change the constitution and run for another term. End of Africa’s ‘big men’? The idea that the “big man” model of rule is running out of steam may be gaining traction among the continent’s leaders. At a regional summit this week, west African heads of state discussed a proposal to limit presidential mandates. The proposal was rejected because of opposition from Gambia and Togo, where there are no term limits, Reuters reported. But the discussion did not go unnoted. “The protestors and the opponents to Nkurunziza’s third term are trying to evoke an African spring, with Burkina Faso setting the precedent. They are trying to use public protests to end a regime that has used both legal and illegal ways of reinforcing its grip on power,” says Bjarnesen.
Thierry Vircoulon, project director for central Africa at the International Crisis Group, says Burundi’sproblems are in the 2010 elections, which most opposition parties boycotted. “The first mandate of President Nkurunziza was about the consolidation of his power within the ruling party, and his second mandate was about the consolidation of his grip over the institutions and the preparation of his third mandate. This is a pattern that we see in a lot of post-conflict regimes in the region,” says Vircoulon. A former Belgian colony, Burundi is one of Africa’s poorest countries, ranking 180 out of 187 states in the 2014 UN human development index. It relies on foreign aid for half its national budget. Britain’s Department for International Development ended bilateral aid in 2012, and has been criticised by a parliamentary committee for doing so. Bjarnesen says that while donors are in a catch-22 situation, suspending assistance will only hurt the poorest. This month, the EU said it would withhold €2m ($2.2m) of aid, while Belgium also announced a suspension of electoral aid. “Cutting aid in itself just does not work,” says Bjarnesen. “The threat now of cutting funding to the elections, who is that serving?” For Bjarnesen, elections now would be devastating for the opposition but perhaps palatable to international partners – a situation that encapsulates an ideological tug-of-war between the merits of stability versus true democracy. “To a large extent, the international community would rather have some sort of elections and then relative stability rather than continued political instability with the threat of conflict,” he says. “That’s the biggest weakness of the response from the international community: it’s so short-sighted and focused on visible symptoms … whereas what is actually keeping the status quo is this kind of structural violence that has been in place since Nkurunziza came to power.” Bjarnesen is critical of “international lenience” towards African governments. “The argument would be these are young democracies, they need time to develop … I think that moment has passed. I don’t see any reason why you would measure democracy in Burundi against standards other than those you use in the UK or Sweden.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/21/burundi-turmoil-shifting-social-political-landscape,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/21/burundi-turmoil-shifting-social-political-landscape
2015-05-20T23:01:06Z,global-development,Global development,UK aid watchdog criticises DfID over partnerships with private sector,"Britain’s Department for International Development (DfID) is failing to capitalise on partnerships with the private sector because of a lack of concrete targets and detailed operational plans with a clear focus on reducing poverty, the UK’s aid watchdog has said. While recognising the potential for development agencies and private businesses to work together to boost livelihoods in the developing world, the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (Icai) said these collaborations must identify more clearly how they will benefit the poor.
DfID has described its partnerships with the private sector as an “engine of growth”. But the study, which was released on Thursday, said the department must “work with businesses which want to invest in developing countries in such a way as to maximise benefits for the poor”. The watchdog gave DfID an amber-red rating – its second worst – for its work with businesses. Icai’s report assessed the impact of DfID’s work with private sector firms on economic and human development, environmental sustainability and humanitarian assistance. Graham Ward, Icai’s chief commissioner, said: “[DfID has] clearly stated their intention to work more with business and there are great potential benefits for the poor from this collaboration. We are concerned, however, about how DfID will translate these goals into practical actions without more strategic oversight of business engagement activities and without concrete targets.” This year, DfID is projected to ramp up its financing to private sector firms – in the form of loans, equity investments and guarantees – to an estimated £580m, up from £68m in 2012, the report said. Between 2012 and 2015, DfID spent about £494m of its budget on alliances, financing and partnerships with UK and foreign businesses, the study said. Examples of these relationships include the Business Action for Africa network; the Safety, Health and Education and Employment for Girls and Women alliance; a partnership with Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor; and the Food Retail Industry Challenge Fund. Poor leadership has made the development objectives behind DfID’s private sector partnerships unclear, according to Icai. “We didn’t get the sense that this new and really important agenda is being steered by senior management,” said a spokesman for the watchdog. Part of the problem is that DfID’s poverty reduction targets are out of sync with the profit-making imperative fundamental to private business. The financial incentives for businesses to work with DfID mean that the agency must agree with private sector partners on reachable targets, the study said.
This is further complicated by DfID’s remit to reduce poverty in the world’s most fragile countries, which often have challenging business environments, the study warned. An Icai spokesman said: “The markets that most business are going to be interested in are going to be in the more developed countries. The very poorest countries, by definition, are going to offer slim pickings for businesses, and therefore there’s going to be less opportunity for DfID to do this direct engagement with [businesses].” According to the report, DfID’s spending on challenge funds – competitions for funding – is particularly problematic. “In some cases … we are not confident that DfID’s support is additional to what businesses would have done anyway, especially in the case of challenge funds,” the report said. The report echoes criticism by some NGOs, who say DfID’s private sector partnerships don’t translate into development gains. “This report raises serious questions about DfID’s ideological drive to work more and more with the private sector when there’s so little evidence of the development benefits,” said Polly Jones, head of policy and campaigns at Global Justice Now. Beck Wallace, a private sector policy analyst at the Catholic aid agency Cafod, said: “DfID needs a clear oversight mechanism in place when working with private firms that goes beyond just cash flow and considers who bears which of the economic, social and environmental costs, risks and benefits of projects. By identifying specifically what value it adds to partnerships with private firms, DfID can help drive forward thinking about how best to deliver poverty reduction through profit-making enterprises.”
The report did not take into account spending by the UK’s CDC Group, formerly the Commonwealth Development Corporation, or the Private Infrastructure Development Group, in which DfID invests. Icai said this is because the UK’s National Audit Office (NAO) has recently reviewed PIDG’s spending. The NAO had been scheduled to review CDC’s spending, but this review has since been cancelled, Icai said. A DfID spokesman said: “Our relationship with business has never been closer and this is delivering real results, whether working with the London Stock Exchange to boost markets in Africa, partnering with Unilever to set up social enterprises that improve the lives of millions of people, or getting new vaccines to market quickly and safely.” He added: “This report comes a year into our groundbreaking new strategy and only reviews a small cross-section of our work. It would be wrong to rush to conclusions on projects that are intended to deliver over a five- to 10-year timeframe.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/21/uk-aid-watchdog-dfid-public-private-partnerships-icai,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/21/uk-aid-watchdog-dfid-public-private-partnerships-icai
2015-05-20T11:05:00Z,global-development,Global development,Out of Africa: e-learning makes further education a reality for tens of thousands | Mark Anderson,"Zuhur Yasin has never been to the US, but she holds a bachelor’s degree from an American university. Part of Yasin’s studies in Somaliland, a self-declared independent country in Somalia, were spent in a special classroom, lined with rows of computers equipped with webcams and microphones. The 29-year-old watched videos and took part in live virtual classes at Indiana University as part of her journalism programme at the University of Hargeisa. “We had discussions and shared any challenges or questions,” she says. The African Virtual University (AVU), an intergovernmental organisation, connected Yasin with Indiana University. The AVU says it has used virtual learning to train 43,000 students since its creation in 1997. Last year, it announced 29 new distance learning centres like the one Yasmin used to take part in seminars nearly 8,000 miles away. Professors use programmes and apps including Skype and WhatsApp to communicate with students, but classes are taught using special software. The AVU is considering plans to make lectures accessible on mobile phones, which would tap into Africa’s estimated 112m smartphones. Like Yasin, many students in sub-Saharan Africa are looking for opportunities to attend university. In 2008, the region had the lowest university attendance in the world, with just 6% of secondary school-leavers advancing to higher education – well below the world average of 26%, according to the UN’s Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco). On Wednesday, the African Union (AU) opened the eLearning Africa conference on ICT for development, education and training at its headquarters in Addis Ababa with the aim of closing that gap and nurturing the human resources necessary for economic development. About 1,200 government ministers and business representatives are expected to attend. Rebecca Stromeyer, founder of eLearning Africa, says: “Now is the time when technology can really help to entrench the progress many African countries have made in education. If the right decisions are taken now, they will help to sustain long-term economic growth.” Experts say online learning tools can connect Africa’s students to massive open online courses (Mooc) such as Coursera, an education platform that provides free virtual tuition from some of the world’s top universities. In March, the AVU enrolled 1,698 African students in its first Mooc, which explored using technology to enrich learning. Mark West, a mobile learning expert at Unesco, says: “[Virtual learning] is a portal into educational opportunities that, frankly, hadn’t existed before, and some of those opportunities – if you can afford the broadband connection and the hardware to use that connection – are free. For really self-motivated learners, it’s remarkable.” However, high dropout rates still plague virtual universities. The best use of online learning is to pair it with some practical instruction and assessment, West says. “A lot of people start but they never finish – they don’t finish individual courses and they definitely don’t finish entire areas of study.” Yasin had to work hard to follow the online curriculum. “In a regular class you have a teacher who is in front of you who makes you concentrate,” she says. “With the online environment, you have to have discipline, make your own timetable to listen to the lectures, and submit the assignments online.” Virtual learning is an ideal solution to the barriers that face African students in accessing university education, according to Bakary Diallo, rector of the AVU. Taking classes online can address some of the bigger challenges for the continent, he says. “In Africa, the need for education is so important. Poverty, violence, extremism – I think the root of these problems is lack of education.”
The AVU partners with dozens of African universities and foreign institutions to help students get degrees in ICT, maths and science. Starting next year, the virtual university will offer its own degrees, but for now it simply links students to local and regional universities. Some programmes are taught completely online, while others require attendance at classes and practical assessment at nearby campuses. While Diallo says his aim is to drive the cost of learning down, the AVU doesn’t have any control over fees at their partner institutions. But that could change when the AVU becomes an accredited university and is able to offer its own classes and charge its own fees. Unsurprisingly, many of the classes currently offered by the AVU are related to technology. Josiah Mugambi, director of Nairobi’s iHub, a meeting place for east Africa’s tech entrepreneurs, says virtual learning appeals to students who want to land a job at a tech startup because of its flexible schedule. “The AVU is definitely cheaper than the conventional approach, plus one can be doing something else [while enrolled].” Africa’s politicians are awakening to the potential of virtual learning. So far, 19 African countries have signed a charter that establishes the AVU as an intergovernmental organisation and the AU has prioritised virtual learning in its long-term development strategy. But with many parts of Africa still facing irregular power supply and poor internet access, Diallo accepts that it will take some time for virtual learning to be rolled out across the continent. Nevertheless, he’s encouraged by mounting political recognition of the role that online learning can play in African development. “I’ve been working on [virtual learning] for the last 15 years and what I’m seeing today … I’ve never seen before. Governments are really interested in [virtual] learning now.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/20/elearning-africa-conference-addis-ababa-further-education,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/20/elearning-africa-conference-addis-ababa-further-education
2015-05-20T08:00:07Z,global-development,Global development,Climate of fear in Dadaab refugee camp leads many to consider repatriation,"For Ibrahim Hussein, it was the final blow. When the Kenyan government ordered the closure of the Dadaab refugee camp following the al-Shabaab terrorist attack in Garissa in April, Hussein gathered his courage and went to the UN refugee repatriation office to ask to be resettled back home in Somalia. After years of living in the largest refugee complex in the world, Dadaab had become an open-air prison to him, with little more to offer than a daily dose of anxiety. “I came here because of the famine in 2011. I am a farmer. There is nothing for me here, I cannot work. We are not getting much food either,” says Hussein, seated in the office of the UN refugee agency, the UNHCR. “And now they accuse us of being responsible for the attack. It’s not bearable.” Located halfway between the Somali border and the Kenyan town of Garissa, and home to an estimated 334,600 Somali refugees, Dadaab has once again become the focus of the Kenyan government’s response to terrorism after the massacre of 147 students at the University of Garissa last month.
Ten days after the attack, Kenya’s vice-president, William Ruto, gave the UN until July to relocate all the refugees and close the camp, saying that Dadaab has become a hideout for al-Shabaab in Kenya. “The group which attacked Garissa earlier this month … they stayed in the refugee camps,” said Bunow Korane, the chair of Kenya’s Refugee Affairs Commission. “They assembled their arms there.” According to security experts, however, there is no evidence linking Dadaab or refugees to al-Shabaab and the Garissa attack. Although this is not the first time that Kenya has demanded the closure of Dadaab following a terrorist attack, and despite government assurances that Somali refugees would not be forcibly repatriated, the announcement has created panic in the camp. Issa Maaciye, a UN repatriation officer, says he has seen an increase in the number of people turning up at his office since the government’s statement. “It is not voluntary repatriation,” Maaciye explains. “It is fear.” Hussein says he knows there is insecurity in Baidoa, the Somali city where he intends to relocate his family. Since December 2014, the UNHCR has run a pilot project for voluntary repatriation to areas of Somalia deemed safe for refugees, including Kismayo, Baidoa and Luuq. Resources are scarce in these areas, including land, and experts fear that the return of refugees en masse could create further tensions. Before leaving Dadaab, Hussein will have to take a fitness test. He will be given $80 (£50) for each member of his family, and will be offered some practical advice. He will also be told that he can change his mind about boarding the UN bus out of the camp up until the last minute. “Above all, I want to be free,” he says. More than 2,000 people have made use of the repatriation scheme so far, and a 2014 survey found that less than 3% of Dadaab’s refugees intended to return to Somalia within the next two years. Meanwhile, more than 3,000 new refugees have arrived in the camp since December.
Across the yard from the repatriation office where Hussein is organising his return, Maryan and her husband Ali are registering their baby son, Hassan, so that he is added to their food ration card. Both Maryan and Ali grew up in Dadaab, and have no recollection of life in Somalia. Over the years, more than 100,000 babies have been born in the refugee camp, and today half of the camp population is under 18. “Those who were born here don’t want to go to Somalia. They would be facing a new world. They could be easily radicalised by al-Shabaab, as they would have to take arms or be killed. There is no freedom in Somalia right now,” says Mohammed Yusuf, an 80-year-old Somali elder.
There is not much freedom in Dadaab either. Under the camp’s dystopian system, Maryan and Ali were able to survive living in tents made of plastic sheeting distributed by the UNHCR, and eating food distributed by the World Food Programme. It has been a life of acronyms, monotonous rations, and dependency on humanitarian aid, confined to a few kilometres square in the middle of the desert. Maryan gave birth to Hassan in a hospital run by Médecins Sans Frontières, receiving a level of healthcare that she could not have had in Somalia. But if “going back” means nothing to her and her husband, staying does not seem a viable option either. “We have a son now. He cannot live like we did. But no one offers us any real option. Where are we meant to go?”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/20/dadaab-refugee-camp-kenya-repatriation-somalia,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/20/dadaab-refugee-camp-kenya-repatriation-somalia
2015-05-20T06:00:05Z,global-development,Global development,"Nigeria's bill targeting FGM is a positive step, but must be backed by investment | Stella Mukasa","The Nigerian senate recently passed its violence against persons prohibition (VAPP) bill, which seeks to eliminate female genital mutilation (FGM) as well as all other forms of gender-based violence. Women’s rights groups, practitioners and activists in Nigeria have been pushing for the law for the past 13 years. It is a major boost not only for Nigeria’s women, but for the nation as a whole. The question is: will it make a practical difference? Women and girls cannot reach their full potential when their basic rights to health and security are not honoured. FGM is most often carried out on young girls – robbing them of the chance to have a healthy life – with severe immediate and long-term health complications, often leading to death. In parts of Africa where medicine is not advanced, such as in areas of Sudan where antibiotics are not available, an estimated one-third of girls who undergo FGM will die. Those who survive face lifelong problems including increased risk of infections, cysts, complications during childbirth, and newborn deaths. It is estimated that 25% of girls and women between the ages of 15 and 49 have undergone FGM in Nigeria. The practice is most widespread in Africa and the Middle East, where it has been carried out on an estimated 125 million girls and women alive today, but it is prevalent around the world. In the UK, where FGM has been outlawed for more than three decades, an estimated 60,000 girls below the age 15 could still be at risk. It is also illegal to take British citizens or residents out of the country to undergo FGM, yet it continues to happen. Such laws are a must. They are particularly critical for organisations working tirelessly to end FGM. In Nigeria, this law provides them with a legal framework and backing to tackle the problem. The legislation sends a clear message on impunity and serves as a basis for holding government to account. However, criminalisation of entrenched cultural practices has its limitations. While legal safeguards are an important step towards ending FGM, they are not enough to eliminate it. Ending violence against women and girls requires investment, not just laws written in statute books. This is why we must emphasise community engagement, with a view towards shifting social norms, as a critical component of the eradication of FGM.
It is crucial that we scale up efforts to change traditional cultural views that underpin violence against women. Only then will this harmful practice be eliminated. Doing so involves laws and policies, as well as community level engagement and programmes that work to empower girls directly. Education is crucial, and must work in conjunction with school systems. It is also important to promote reporting of the practice, ensure perpetrators are prosecuted and address stigma. Change will not happen overnight. Investing in research is key to developing effective, sustainable and evidence-based solutions. Harmful practices such as FGM not only affect women and girls, but are also a major impediment to global development efforts to end poverty. A case in point is a flagship programme from the UK’s Department for International Development, entitled what works to prevent violence against women and girls. The scheme will build evidence on effective solutions to prevent violence against women and girls. One branch of the programme involves adding to existing data on the economic and social costs of violence against women and girls, which will create a better understanding of the far-reaching consequences of violence at all levels. Producing new evidence is crucial in strengthening the case for resources to implement laws, provide health and social support services, and encourage communities to move away from social norms that support violence. It has been 20 years since the Beijing declaration and platform for action, a blueprint toward achieving equality that denounces all forms of violence against women. Prioritising the rights and wellbeing of women and girls is long overdue. Violating their right to a safe and productive life not only has a profound effect on them, it has an impact on every one of us. Ensuring that the human rights of women and girls are protected means flourishing economies, healthy communities and a brighter future for us all.

2015-05-19T13:59:28Z,global-development,Global development,Poverty in Nicaragua drives children out of school and into work | Nina Lakhani,"Strolling through the coastal town of Bluefields on a school day, the number of children out and about is striking. Young hustlers sell cold drinks and sweet breads, teenage mums push snoozing infants in prams, while small groups of adolescents idle away hours on shaded park benches listening to the latest dancehall hits. Boredom is one reason these young people give when asked why they are not in school. Among a group of nine- to 15-year olds, others explain: “My family can’t afford the books”, “I prefer to work and earn money” and “I was kicked out when I got pregnant”. None of the children had plans to go back to school. Bluefields is the biggest town in the isolated autonomous provinces on Nicaragua’s Atlantic coast – the poorest region of a very poor country where figures for school dropout and child labour remain worryingly high. As leaders meet in South Korea this week for the World Education Forum, Bluefields – and Nicaragua as a whole – offers a snapshot of the huge challenges that still remain to get children into school. The links between leaving school and child labour are multifarious, but poverty plainly drives both. Nicaragua – a country of 6.1 million people – is the second poorest in the Americas after Haiti. It has the largest youth bulge in Latin America with more than 2 million school-aged children, according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, Unesco. Half of all children and adolescents live in poverty. The UN children’s agency, Unicef, estimates that 500,000 Nicaraguan children aged three to 17 are not in the educational system. Most live in rural areas, or are poor, indigenous or disabled. In a country with such high poverty levels, it is perhaps not surprising that children find themselves out of school and in the workplace. The last national child labour survey, published back in 2005, reported almost 240,000 child workers aged between five and 17. Nicaraguan officials recently told the Inter America Commission of Human Rights that eradication of child labour was a priority for the current government – led by former leftist guerrilla leader Daniel Ortega since 2006. Last year Nicaragua signed up to the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) “road map”, which aims to eradicate the worst forms of child labour by 2016, and all child labour by 2020 – the last country in the region to do so. Nicaragua has ratified multiple international treaties and has strong national policies, but government claims that it is reducing child labour are not supported by any published evidence. In fact, business leaders currently estimate that there are between 250,000 and 320,000 child workers, with one in three under 14.
The most recent US Department of Labor analysis said: “The [Nicaraguan] government’s enforcement of labour laws is inadequate, and plans to combat child labour and protect children have not been fully implemented.” A recently published study by the La Isla Foundation interviewed 26 children aged 12 to 17 who were working in sugar cane fields in 2013. Nicaraguan law allows children to start working at 14, among the youngest in the region, but not in hazardous environments like sugar cane, mines or quarries. Half the children interviewed were not in school, four could not read or write and virtually all had suffered injuries or illnesses linked to perilous work conditions. Luis Hernandez*, 17, left school almost three years ago, and was contracted to weed sugar cane crops during the most recent harvest. “I hated school, it was so boring, and I was glad to get this job as it means I can help my family and buy new clothes,” he said. “Of course I am scared about the health risks, all the boys in my team are scared, but there are no other jobs.” The sugar company, which said it has a zero tolerance policy to child labour, is investigating. Compulsory education is one of the most effective ways of combating child labour, according to the ILO. In Nicaragua, children are only obliged to attend school until 12.
Only 72% of children finished primary school in 2009, the latest year for which data is available. This low figure hides even bigger inequalities as only 65% of children from the poorest 20% of families completed primary school compared to 98% from the richest homes. On the poor Atlantic coastal regions where Bluefields is situated, just 58% completed six years of primary education. The Ortega government has prioritised spending on primary and tertiary education, so secondary school figures are unsurprisingly much worse: 46% finished the first tier (9th grade/year 10), and only 19% completed 11th grade (year 12). In the poorest families, only 6% of children finished secondary school. Manos Antoninis is a senior analyst at Education for All global monitoring report, which has analysed progress on education in 164 countries since 2002. He is in favour of increasing the age at which children can leave education. “While raising the compulsory age of schooling is unlikely to immediately impact on completion rates in Nicaragua, it would send a powerful message that the state believes in the importance of education, which in turn would impact the way families perceive their own responsibility in keeping children in school.” The EFA movement promotes a minimum nine years of free compulsory education. Philippe Barragne-Bigot, Unicef representative in Nicaragua, disagrees with Antoninis. He believes children drop out because of cultural norms driven by the cycle of poverty, poor-quality, lacklustre classes and the chronic lack of economic opportunities that makes school seem pointless. “Quality, flexible education and jobs will keep children in school, not a change in the law,” said Barragne-Bigot. In Incheon, South Korea, this week, leaders will assess progress towards the millennium development goals, which expire this year, and seek to agree a common position on the post-2015 sustainable development goals, which seem likely to include universal free primary and secondary education. Opinion is divided about whether it is wise to include secondary education in the proposed SDG target when one in six children in low and middle income countries does not finish primary school, according to EFA. “Countries that don’t educate their children to second school level don’t stand a chance. But the sudden expansion of secondary education could serve the elite, so policies must target the neediest,” said Antoninis. He added: “The inter-generational effect is chilling. A lack of education not only scuppers a child’s chances, but also the chances of their children. Failing to make an effort in this generation, also fails the next.” * Name has been changed to protect identity",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/19/poverty-nicaragua-children-school-education-child-labour,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/19/poverty-nicaragua-children-school-education-child-labour
2015-05-19T11:53:02Z,global-development,Global development,Burundi refugees say there is no turning back as fears grow of reprisals at home,"Evariste Hakizimana arrived at the Bugesera camp in eastern Rwanda last month, after members of the Imbonerakure, the feared youth wing of Burundi’s ruling CNDD-FDD party, turned up at his house in the middle of the night. “Don’t tell us that we never warned you,” he recounts that they told him. The next day he left with his family for Rwanda. Since early April, more than 112,000 refugees have fled Burundi to Rwanda, Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), amid rising violence and intimidation, mainly by the Imbonerakure, in the runup to June’s presidential elections. The refugee crisis peaked after President Pierre Nkurunziza announced on 25 April that he would stand for a third term, triggering street protests in the capital, Bujumbura. After violent clashes between protesters and police, General Godefroid Niyombare last week led a coup attempt but failed to take control of the country. Nkurunziza, who was abroad at the time of the coup attempt, has returned to Burundi and is purging his cabinet. Protesters have been warned that they will be treated as accomplices of the rebel generals while rights activists have accused Nkurunziza of repressing opposition and gagging the independent media.
The crisis has raised fears of further instability in a volatile region where armed groups often crisscross borders to prey on communities, and where several civil wars have left a deep legacy of fear and distrust. In Burundi, memories are still raw over the conflict between ethnic Hutus and Tutsis that left around 300,000 people dead a decade ago. During that conflict, Nkurunziza was among the mainly Hutu rebels fighting against the army, which was then dominated by the Tutsi minority. Despite the integration of both groups into the army – Niyombare is also a Hutu – fears that the crisis could spiral are still driving people across the country’s borders. Placede Mukerabirori remained in Burundi throughout the 12-year civil war, during which her parents were killed. This time, however, she decided to flee after she was threatened by Imbonerakure militias. “We cannot go back as long as [President] Nkurunziza is in the leadership,” she said. “If we went back and he was the leader, we would die, especially us – the refugees coming back. He would believe we were the enemies.”
Between 24 and 26 April, the number of refugees crossing the Rwandan frontier every day surged to between 15,000 and 23,000. The UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) scrambled to attend to this massive influx, and for several days, Bugesera camp, which was designed to hold 8,000 people, was home to more than 13,000. Bugesera’s 35 hastily built “hangers” of tarpaulin and tree trunks are the first stop for many of the 27,000 Burundian refugees in Rwanda. Now, the UNHCR, along with the Rwandan government, has begun the process of relocating hundreds of refugees a day from Bugesera to a larger, more permanent camp. Since the failed coup, up to 200 refugees a day have continued to stream across the border and UN officials are preparing for many more in the coming weeks. The agency estimates that as many as 100,000 could flee to Rwanda as the election nears.Saber Azam, UNHCR’s representative in Rwanda, says one of their biggest challenges has been attending to the large numbers of children. Many are without their parents, and around 30% are malnourished. “Our hope is that the situation in Burundi will improve and that they will feel secure and they will return to their country,” said Azam, noting, however, that the agency was preparing for this not to happen. Last week, east African heads of state condemned the coup attempt and called for Burundian elections to be held in “a free, fair and peaceful manner”. Rwanda has also called for a return to stability in Burundi, which relies on foreign aid to meet half its budget.
According to officials at Rwanda’s ministry of disaster management and refugee affairs, Rwanda will cap the number of Burundian refugees in the country at 60,000. After the cap has been reached, Rwanda will work with the UN and the international community to open a “humanitarian corridor” to allow refugees to pass through Rwanda to neighbouring countries. “We can’t close our borders to prevent refugees from coming,” said a ministry official who did not want to be named. The exact details of the passage and end destination have yet to be determined. So far, the ethnic tensions that characterised the civil war do not seem to be a problem among refugees in Bugesera. People appear united by their politics. “No one here at the camp supports Nkurunziza,” said Frazile Rwasa, a Tutsi refugee who arrived on 20 April. “All those who support him are back in Burundi.” But Hakizimana fears the crisis could take on ethnic dimensions. “Things are moving from politics to ethnicity,” he said. He fears that, if he returns, he will be targeted as an enemy of the president because he is a Tutsi. After hearing news of the coup attempt last Wednesday, thousands of residents at Bugesera sang, danced, and planned their return to Burundi. But with the failure of the coup now confirmed, they are settling in for a long stay in Rwanda.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/19/burundi-refugees-rwanda-no-turning-back-fears-grow-reprisals,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/19/burundi-refugees-rwanda-no-turning-back-fears-grow-reprisals
2015-05-19T09:51:10Z,global-development,Global development,Tunisia's women politicians prepare to seize their chance in local polls | Simon Speakman Cordall,"At a hotel in the desert city of Tozeur, 26-year-old pharmacist Mariem Bouattour is preparing to share the findings of a survey into women’s opinions on key challenges for the local government. Waiting to hear her is a small crowd of around 150 people, but the event is part of a much bigger drive to get Tunisian women into politics. Some 1,250 questionnaires were distributed throughout Tozeur, canvassing women’s opinions on 10 of the issues perceived as facing the municipal government. Subjects ranged from the provision of cultural services to transparency in government. Public hygiene, health services and local government infrastructure were considered the most pressing. The presentation is taking place at a “political academy”, organised by Aswat Nissa (Women’s Voice), an NGO dedicated to promoting women’s interests across Tunisia. The organisation is preparing women to stand in local elections and the academy provides a space for discussion of local issues before next year’s municipal polls, as part of the dentralisation promised in the 2011 constitution. For women, the academies offer not just an opportunity to lobby their political leaders to get the most pressing issues into their manifestos, but a platform for those who want to go into politics themselves to convince potential voters they are up to the job. “There are women in both industry and politics, but there aren’t really any in decision-making positions,” said Bouattour, who will stand as an independent candidate in the municipal elections. “If you’re in power you can address the issues affecting women. You understand them better. We live in a patriarchal society, so it’s important to have women with the will, the power and the energy to create change and push through the action we need to improve the situation for women in Tunisia,” she said.
Tunisia comprises 24 governorates, divided into 264 municipalities and 36 village councils. Devolution is aimed at tackling growing regional inequalities and to ensure more equal distribution of funds for local services. Both the degrees of devolution and the exact timing of the elections are still to be determined by the national constituent assembly. However, the decentralisation of power across the country’s diverse political, social and ecological landscape has meant that significant change looks inevitable. Women are hoping to seize the opportunity. Among them is Ourida Touhami, who is preparing to stand as a candidate for Ennahda, the centrist Islamic Party. “The municipality is the foundation of politics. It’s here where you directly interact with other women and the populace at large … This is a real opportunity to show society what women are, that they have agency; that women can genuinely affect change.” But this will not be easy. “The majority of women don’t have political experience,” said Ikram Ben Said, president of Aswat Nissa. “Even if they’ve been members of political parties since, say, 2011, they have very little responsibility within that party. Also, those political parties aren’t really investing in women. They have women when it’s time for election, because of the parity law, [the stipulation that parties provide a minimum number of female candidates], but they don’t have a long-term vision for them.” It’s a legacy that Aswat Nissa is striving to counter, working with women across the political spectrum nationwide to develop their skills as politicians.
“We’re seeking to develop women’s capacities in three main areas,” said Ben Said. “Firstly, there’s gender sensitive budgeting, because if you’re going to improve equality you’re going to need money … The second part is that, by participating in the political academies, women will go out and engage with potential voters, to convince them that they’re here and they’re ready to serve them. Thirdly, they’re there to present the priorities of women to their political parties and convince them to include them within their electoral programmes.” But Professor Kais Saied, one of the country’s leading constitutional experts, is sceptical about the devolution process and exactly how much power central government is willing to cede. “They’re worried they might lose some of their authority. The revolution came from within, from the inner states, then through the local authorities and to the centre,” he said. Prof Saied is also sceptical about the success of quotas in elections, although it has yet to be decided whether quotas for female candidates will form part of the municipal elections. “Unfortunately, women’s roles in Tunisia are quite limited. They’re perceived as cosmetic. In the last elections, despite the laws on fair representation for women, the quotas were only ever superficial. Women have to be more active if we’re ever going to represent society as a whole.” Organisations like Aswat Nissa are preparing to do just that.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/19/tunisia-female-politicians-woman-local-polls,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/19/tunisia-female-politicians-woman-local-polls
2015-05-19T06:00:00Z,global-development,Global development,"In Cameroon, a school helps to integrate disabled children into society | Marta Arias","At dizzying speed, Julien sticks a hole-punch tool into a piece of paper, over and over. When the 12-year-old is done, the teacher gives the paper to another student and asks him to read it. Julien nods approvingly as the other boy reads aloud. It is exactly as he had written it, punching out the text in braille. Julien, who is blind, and the other student, who is not, both share a classroom in the Promhandicam school in the Mimboman district of Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon. The school opened in 1975 as part of a private philanthropy project set up by Daniel de Rouffignac, a retired French colonel. It has 120 pupils and aims to help disabled children participate fully in society, and to educate children who are blind or have impaired vision. About half of the pupils have disabilities. Of these, many are blind, but there are others who have paralysis or learning disabilities, or have lost limbs. They study alongside children with no disabilities. Everyone learns to read braille.
For the school’s manager, Father Sergio Janeselli, this integration is key. “You see?” he says, pointing to the children playing together one breaktime. “One of the greatest things about this kind of education is that children just play with each other no matter if they are blind, disabled, or not.” About 2 million of Cameroon’s 23-million strong population are disabled, according to Marta Imamura, a medical officer specialising in disability and rehabilitation at the World Health Organisation in Switzerland. The UN’s children agency, Unicef, estimates that 23% of children aged between two and nine in Cameroon have at least one type of disability, and 65% of children acquired their disabilities through illnesses, such as polio, malaria, leprosy or measles. The most recent World Report on Disability, published by the WHO in 2011, noted that “children with disabilities are less likely to start school than their peers without disabilities, and have lower rates of staying and being promoted in schools”. About 80% of disabled people, including 150 million children, live in developing countries. The 2006 UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has been ratified by 36 African countries. However, in countries grappling with hunger and poverty, stigma and discrimination – even by parents – often renders disabled children effectively invisible. In poorer communities, this ostracisation can condemn children with mental or physical disabilities to a life in limbo, with no prospects for therapy and an increasing likelihood of being malnourished and otherwise neglected.
“Current attitudes of rejection and neglect reinforce the many barriers these children face in daily life, including discrimination, direct abuse and violence,” says Imamura. “There has actually not been very much research done in these areas,” says Lynn Cockburn, assistant professor in the department of occupational science and occupational therapy at the University of Toronto. “We are just beginning to really understand the extent and details of the situation. “There are very few schools that can adequately accommodate children with visual and hearing impairments, or with significant learning disabilities. There are almost no assistive devices and technologies used in schools to allow for such accommodations,” she said. In 2010, Cameroon’s ministry of social affairs introduced a law to protect and promote disabled children, but activists say implementation has been slow. In Promhandicam the letter of the law – integrating disabled people into society – is brought to life. The school’s ethos is spelled out on a big poster: “In the classroom, we are all equal in rights and obligations”. Class groups at the school are usually organised by age, as in any other institution, but there are some exceptions to meet specific requirements. Landry, 15, sits with a group of five-year-olds. He, like them, is learning to write. But while they struggle to hold pens between their little fingers, Landry is learning how to write with his mouth because his arms are paralysed. Monique Hendje, a teacher, is helping him. She scribbles letters on to a small blackboard and then Landry copies them on to paper, using a carpenter’s flat pencil. As well as catering for children with physical challenges, such as Julien and Landry, Promhandicam also educates children with learning disabilities. Older children, who may no longer be able to benefit from academic teaching, are taught other skills. “The 25 pupils in this class are not able to learn how to write or read any more, so we teach them how to become independent by doing some handicrafts that can be sold later,” says Rachel Bekono, a teacher.
One of Promhandicam’s strengths is its ability to produce tailored learning materials for its diverse range of students. Benjamin Mbelle, armed with patience and a noisy printing machine, copies every textbook into braille. This means every student can follow each class. The school opened a rehabilitation centre in 2005 and there is also a small workshop. There, Joseph Amougou, who himself is disabled, works at the school making prostheses or adapting furniture to the pupils’ specific needs. Next to his workbench there are broken tricycles and wheelchairs, and many kinds of artificial limbs, including Amougou’s own. Amougou embodies Promhandicam’s devotion to integrating disabled people as fully as possible into society. Cockburn says this is a human rights issue. “Attitudes can have an impact because children are not given opportunities to engage in everyday activities because parents and others don’t think they can … The charity model is still very prevalent, rather than a human rights model,” she says. Amougou is well aware of the importance of his job. “[This is] how we can prove that there are real options and that being disabled doesn’t mean being non-capable,” he says.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/19/cameroon-promhandicam-school-disabled-children-integration,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/19/cameroon-promhandicam-school-disabled-children-integration
2015-05-18T19:14:40Z,global-development,Global development,European parliament must seize its chance to stop trade in conflict minerals,"On 20 May, the European parliament will vote on a proposed regulation to tackle the trade in conflict minerals. The trade in tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold (3TG) is fuelling conflict which has had devastating consequences for people in countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Colombia. We are gravely concerned that the regulation proposed by the European Commission does not envision any real change. It makes it merely optional for importers to source these minerals responsibly. The proposed voluntary scheme would cover just 0.05% of companies using these minerals within the EU. No companies would be legally obliged to check whether they are complicit in financing conflict or human rights abuses.
The proposal in April 2015 by the European parliament’s committee on international trade on recommending binding “due diligence” requirements for approximately only 20 smelters and refiners based in Europe will not solve the problem. There must be legal requirements governing all companies that place these minerals on the European market – in any form, not just 3TG imported by a handful of smelters. Extending the binding requirement to tackle the entire trade effectively – not just one part of it – would put the EU at the forefront of global efforts to create more transparent, responsible and sustainable business practices. It would also better align Europe with OECD standards on responsible sourcing and complement existing binding rules adopted by the US and several African countries, including DRC. Members of the European parliament have an opportunity to help break the links between the minerals trade, conflict and human rights abuses – such as the large-scale sexual violence in eastern DRC, which Panzi hospital is dedicated to healing. We urge them to ensure that, in line with its fundamental principles, the European parliament demands additional binding rules that put respect for human rights above narrow economic interests.

2015-05-18T13:56:01Z,global-development,Global development,World Bank announces $5bn drive to improve quality of global education,"The World Bank is to allocate $5bn (£3.19bn) to improve the quality of global education over the next five years. The money will be disbursed after development partners have met pre-agreed targets, the bank said. The announcement comes a day before leaders from 160 countries gather in South Korea for the World Education Forum, where they will discuss education targets to be included in the sustainable development goals (SDGs) – the global development agenda that begins next year and will run through to 2030. The World Bank’s president, Jim Yong Kim, said: “What we hope is [results-based financing] will … help us to move from the millennium development goals [MDGs], focused on access and kids in seats, to one where we’re now really going to focus on outcomes and results.” The educational targets in the MDGs have been criticised for focusing on boosting enrolment without improving the quality of learning. In a recent report, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) said: “The focus on universal primary enrolment meant less attention to other crucial areas, such as education quality, early childhood care and education, and adult literacy.” The SDGs propose that, by 2030, “all girls and boys [should] complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education”. But achieving the target will be a huge challenge. About 121 million children are estimated to be out of school, while one in four children are illiterate, according to Unesco. Girls are particularly affected by poor enrolment: for every 100 boys not in primary school, there are 117 girls. Kim said he hopes to replicate the success the bank has had using the same results-based funding model to meet health targets. “What we found was that by focusing on results – like, for example, in malaria, are nets actually delivered, are treatments actually delivered – and then giving payment after that, it had an effect on the quality of services delivered that went far beyond our hopes and aspirations, and so we’ve been trying this in education,” he said. But NGOs have warned that a wide range of opinions must be sought when devising aid effectiveness targets. “I think we would respond cautiously [in] welcoming this funding if it is to be invested via governments in funding public education systems, but there is no detail of where the money is to be spent,” said a spokeswoman for the Bretton Woods Project, a UK-based NGO. “There are worrying signs that president Kim favours private providers – evidenced in his recent speech in which he endorsed the methods used by multinational Bridge International Academies, which caused over 100 organisations, including the Bretton Woods Project to sign a protest letter.” In a report, published in 2012, the European Network on Debt and Development warned: “Do not implement new results-based approaches unless they respond to the demands of recipient country governments in consultation with civil society and parliaments, and have been designed to meet aid effectiveness principles. Broader approaches should be prioritised over narrower ones.” The bank has spent about $40bn on educational projects since 2000 but, over the past five years, just $2.5bn of this has been results-based. Projects that have been tied to results include a plan with the Tanzanian government to improve student-teacher ratios and child literacy rates, and a programme in Pakistan to enrol more children from poor families in school and recruit more teachers. Improving the quality of learning and access to schools can play a prominent role in reducing poverty, the bank said. A key target in the SDGs is to eradicate extreme poverty – defined as those living on less than $1.25 a day – by 2030. Kim said: “The truth is that most education systems are not serving the poorest children well. An estimated 250 million children cannot read or write – even though many have attended school for years. This is a tragedy and has serious consequences for ending extreme poverty. “With nearly a billion people remaining trapped in extreme poverty today, sustained efforts to improve learning for children will unlock huge amounts of human potential for years to come. Better results in classrooms will help end extreme poverty.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/18/world-bank-education-quality-5bn,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/18/world-bank-education-quality-5bn
2015-05-18T08:00:01Z,global-development,Global development,Universal health coverage and private hospitals are not mutually exclusive | Dominic Montagu,"This week health ministers from around the world gather in Geneva for the annual meeting of the World Health Organisation (WHO). While they will no doubt take some time to enjoy the beautiful scenery, their working agenda will cover some of the world’s biggest health challenges, including planning for the next pandemic Ebola and influenza outbreaks. Decisions will also be made on topics that are less alarming but equally important for health. Chief among these is how to encourage developing countries to move towards universal health coverage (UHC), in which everyone in a country can access basic health services without facing financial hardship. The WHO director general, Margaret Chan, has described UHC as “the single most powerful concept that public health has to offer”. Given that 150 million people each year suffer financial catastrophe due to paying for healthcare, this is no exaggeration.
UHC now tops the domestic agenda in countries from India to Uganda, thanks partly to WHO-led advocacy. But progress is being complicated by a needless debate about the role of the private sector in healthcare provision in poor countries. Oxfam, which has the ear of many development officials, summed it up in a series of papers attacking private sector involvement in healthcare, describing it as “unregulated, unaccountable, and out of control”. According to this view, which is shared by many western aid agencies, UHC can only be achieved by a massive expansion of government-owned hospitals and clinics in developing countries. The idea that involving the private sector is antithetical to UHC is bizarre. The private sector (which includes non-profit providers) forms the backbone of healthcare in a range of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member countries including Japan, South Korea and Germany. In fact, more than two-thirds of all OECD countries rely mostly on private outpatient care and some of the best performing countries also deliver the majority of inpatient care through private hospitals. All of these countries have achieved both universal coverage and high levels of patient satisfaction. The private sector also provides up to 80% of healthcare in many developing countries. Proponents of public sector care are therefore effectively asking governments to massively expand government health provision in order to duplicate existing hospitals, doctors, labs, clinics, blood banks, maternity homes, and pharmacies. This is not only an unrealistic proposition, it is also pointless. There is no evidence that government control is the only way to achieve UHC. Quite the opposite: the evidence suggests there are many ways to get to UHC, and advising countries otherwise will drive them into needless, substantial spending to replicate resources that already exist. Harnessing the private sector to achieve UHC need not be traumatic. National or social health insurance schemes should be agnostic about whom they purchase services from: private or public, so long as quality, fairness and cost standards are met.
This approach works well in many developing countries. Certain districts in Thailand have achieved UHC by allowing all residents to use private hospitals, and then reimbursing those facilities. In the Philippines, growing numbers of pregnant women use private midwives, reimbursed by the national social health insurance fund, PhilHealth. Expanding health insurance coverage to poor people, allowing them to freely access private providers, is well underway in Ghana, Thailand, Taiwan, Korea, Malaysia and many other countries. A host of other countries are moving towards this approach, including Kenya, Indonesia, India and Uganda. The idea that such “tawdry” notions as profit and business have no room in healthcare is perhaps understandable among those who have made a career in public health, and whose motivations are altruistic rather than financial. Even a cursory examination of most health systems, however, reveals that very few countries can meet this high moral standard: pharmacies in the UK, France, and in most other countries are private, profit-driven, and most effective when they are well-run businesses. Dental services in most countries are private, as are outpatient clinics. Good care is still delivered. High-quality medicines can still be found at Boots, Watsons, or Walgreens. As a growing number of developing countries stand ready to redouble their financial and political commitments to making healthcare more accessible to their citizens, we do them no favours by giving them ideologically-driven advice. Cuba has the best health system in the world according to the WHO, and Brits are impressively vocal about their love of the NHS. But surveys tell us that the Dutch, Germans, and Japanese, though not as vocal, are no less satisfied with their private-delivery-based health systems. The WHO and the supportive aid ministries in the developed world should provide the best objective advice and evidence to developing countries on this topic. UHC is the goal; let’s not be sidetracked by pointless debates about getting “my way” or “your way”. However we arrive at our goal, a great many people will benefit. • Dominic Montagu is associate professor of epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/18/universal-health-coverage-private-sector-world-health-organisation,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/18/universal-health-coverage-private-sector-world-health-organisation
2015-05-18T04:00:11Z,global-development,Global development,Diluting India's child labour law will trap families in cycle of poverty,"The Indian government is making severe cuts to budgets that address discrimination and the welfare of the country’s most marginalised people. In a deeply flawed strategy, they are relaxing legislation on child labour as a means to alleviate poverty. An amendment to India’s Child Labour Prohibition Act seeks to permit children under 14 to work in “family enterprises”, a euphemism for industries such as carpet-weaving, beedi (cigarette) rolling and gem-polishing. Altering the act that was otherwise set to make all forms of child labour illegal will push millions of children into work rather than education, particularly Dalits (those at the bottom of India’s caste system), Adivasis and Muslims. India’s minister of labour and employment, Bandaru Dattatreya, has argued that the amendment, which has just been approved by the union cabinet, will help impoverished families earn a living and give children an “entrepreneurial spirit”. He also contends that children are only allowed to engage in work that will not interfere with their education. However, the widespread failure to enforce the rule of law across India means that permitting child labour of any kind will overturn progress in getting children out of work and into school. Officials are already underreporting child labour, and accountability will not be improved if particular forms of child labour are permitted. The government argument that allowing children to work in family enterprises will help families overcome poverty is strongly countered by many experts on child labour, including the Nobel peace prize winner Kailash Satyarthi, who criticised the amendment in an opinion piece in the Times of India.
There is no proof that allowing children to work will alleviate poverty. On the contrary, evidence suggests that children are used instead of adults, who are then unemployed because children are easier to exploit and control. It condemns children, especially Dalit children, to a life of exclusion, discrimination and low-paid jobs. Child labour in India predominantly affects the lowest castes, in particular Dalit, Adivasi and Muslim children. They are often forced to work because of their family’s marginalised status and lack of alternatives. These groups are particularly vulnerable to being trafficked into slavery, a road that becomes all the more open to children by allowing them to work “in their spare time”. Education is key to breaking out of poverty and marginalisation. In India, access to education for groups who suffer discrimination is already severely limited due to prejudice and poverty. According to the UN children’s agency, Unicef, Dalit girls have the highest rate of exclusion from primary school in India and the highest dropout rates, a tendency that will not be curbed by legitimising child labour in their free time. If the Indian government is serious about curbing poverty, it should prioritise budgets for education and enforce legislation that will protect marginalised children, creating inclusive school spaces that will act as an incentive for children to stay in school rather than drop out in order to work.
The government must also address the endemic structural discrimination that goes to the root of the problem and ensure an education for girls and other marginalised children. This includes directly and openly addressing caste-based discrimination, which affects the lives of 200 million Dalits in India. Despite espousing the cause of bridging caste, gender and communal divides, the government is failing to make this a priority and recently made severe cuts to education budgets, including slashing 57% off figures meant for the welfare and education of Dalits and Adivasis. Supporting the right to education among marginalised groups in India must be made a political, economic, and social priority if we are to take commitments to alleviate poverty seriously. The upholding of rights in India and the enforcement of the country’s legislation would in itself create significant progress in the fight against poverty and child labour. With the amendment proposed to the new child labour law coupled with the severe cuts on welfare and education, the government is instead set to send millions of marginalised children out of school and into work, trapping families in a cycle of poverty for yet another generation to come.

2015-05-15T13:13:41Z,global-development,Global development,UN deal secures release of child soldiers held by Central African Republic militias,"More than 350 children have been released by armed groups in Central African Republic (CAR) under a UN-brokered deal to free thousands of young people who have been forced to work as soldiers, sex slaves and servants during the country’s sectarian conflict. On Thursday, 357 children aged between eight and 18 – including more than a dozen girls – were released in three separate ceremonies near the town of Bambari, about 200km north of the capital, Bangui. Violence erupted in CAR in March 2013 when the mainly Muslim rebels of the Seleka alliance seized Bangui and installed the country’s first Muslim president, Michel Djotodia.
The Seleka went on to terrorise the majority Christian population, killing men, women and children until they were forced from power five months ago. Predominantly Christian forces known as the anti-balaka (anti-machete) militia retaliated by slaughtering thousands of Muslims and forcing hundreds of thousands more from their homes. Two of the ceremonies involved the release of children from the anti-balaka, while the third was for those who had been among the ranks of the Seleka. The move came a week after the UN children’s agency, Unicef, helped to agree a deal between the leaders of CAR’s 10 armed groups to secure the release of the 6,000 to 10,000 children thought to be connected with the different factions. “I want to thank the people who brought us here. We don’t want to stay in the army where life is hard,” a 16-year-old girl who had fought alongside the Seleka told Reuters. The girl, who asked not to be named, said she had joined the militia group voluntarily three years ago and had fought in Bangui street battles. Donaig Le Du, Unicef’s head of communication in CAR, said she hoped Thursday’s ceremonies would soon be followed by many more. “Seeing the kids dressed in the civilian clothes they’d been given hours before was quite emotional,” she said. “The kids have gone through a lot. They’ve seen things that no child should see and some of them have probably done things that no kid should ever have to do. Some of the little ones were smiling, but I think that was because there was a lot going on around them. For some of them, I would figure that they were thinking, ‘What is my future going to be now?’” After receiving medical screenings, the children were given the chance to talk to social workers. Those with relatives in the area will be reunited with their families if it is safe enough to do so, while others will be placed with foster-caregivers until their families can be found. Le Du stressed that the release was just the beginning of the children’s return to their homes and former lives. “[Even] when the family tracing is done, you don’t just drop the kid back in the community,” she said. “You need to prepare ahead of that because some of them will not be welcome and there will be community mediation to be done. It takes several months from the day the child is identified until the day the child can be returned back to normal life.” Unicef, which uses local NGOs to reintegrate children in CAR, has warned that the process of releasing and returning them to their communities will place additional demands on the already limited funding available to respond to the humanitarian emergency in the country. As of 30 April, the agency had received $17m (£10.9m) of the $73.9m it needs to carry out its operations this year.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/15/central-african-republic-child-soldiers-released-un-deal-armed-groups,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/15/central-african-republic-child-soldiers-released-un-deal-armed-groups
2015-05-15T08:00:00Z,global-development,Global development,"Without access to water, there can be no food security | Lyla Mehta","Ensuring universal access to water is vital in order to address food security and improve nutrition, yet recognition of the links between water and food are too often missed. A major report on water for food security and nutrition, launched on Friday by the high-level panel of experts on food security and nutrition (HLPE), is the first comprehensive effort to bring together access to water, food security and nutrition. This report goes far beyond the usual focus on water for agriculture. Safe drinking water and sanitation are fundamental to human development and wellbeing. Yet inadequate access to clean water undermines people’s nutrition and health through water-borne diseases and chronic intestinal infections. The landmark report, commissioned by the committee on world food security (CFS), not only focuses on the need for access, it also makes important links between land, water and productivity. It underlines the message that water is integral to human food security and nutrition, as well as the conservation of forests, wetlands and lakes upon which all humans depend. Policies and governance issues on land, water and food are usually developed in isolation. Against a backdrop of future uncertainties, including climate change, changing diets and water-demand patterns, there has to be a joined-up approach to addressing these challenges. There are competing demands over water from different sectors such as agriculture, energy and industry. With this in mind, policymakers have to prioritise the rights and interests of the most marginalised and vulnerable groups, with a particular focus on women, when it comes to water access.
There is vast inequality in access to water, which is determined by socio-economic, political, gender and power relations. Securing access can be particularly challenging for smallholders, vulnerable and marginalised populations and women. All around the world, water reform processes as well as large-scale land acquisitions often overlook and threaten the customary and informal rights of poor and marginalised women and men. Moreover, women’s entitlements are often recorded as belonging to the male “head of the household”. Removing this gender bias in farming and water and providing equal access to resources for both male and female farmers would have a big impact on food security and nutrition. Smallholder farmers produce more than 70% of the world’s food but often lack recognition of their land and water rights in formal legal systems. Women and girls frequently spend several hours a day collecting water but lack decision-making power when it comes to water management. Indigenous people are often displaced from their lands and rivers as a result of large infrastructure projects, and the interests of fisherfolk and pastoralists are rarely advanced in national policies. Mechanisms to allocate water need to give adequate priority to water for food production as well as for the basic needs of poorest populations and those pushed to the edges of society. There is increasing corporate interest in water, and states should ensure that investments respect basic rights to water and sanitation as well as food. Taking these complexities into account, the report proposes ways to enhance the capacity of poor farmers to manage water and land and to increase water and agricultural productivity in a range of food production systems, improve governance and invest in metrics and knowledge. The human right to safe drinking water and sanitation as well as the right to food are globally recognised. States should ensure the full implementation of these rights and explore how they can be meaningfully joined up. The right to water largely focuses on safe drinking water and sanitation and rarely considers the productive uses of water. In Kenya, Colombia and Senegal, 71–75% of households use domestic water supplies for productive activities such as food gardening. Water is integral for sustainable livelihoods. There is no doubt that land, food and water issues are linked. The barriers to joined-up national and global policies do not derive from a lack of technology or resources. Rather they are rooted in the absence of human rights, and the failure to recognise that water and food are intertwined. The HLPE report argues for coherence on these issues at all levels of policymaking and management, from local to global. We are calling for a human rights approach to water governance to enhance food security and nutrition. Only this will ensure healthy and productive lives for all.

2015-05-15T06:00:08Z,global-development,Global development,Indian grape farmers take a byte out of the online market | Zeeshan Shaikh,"Bhaskar Kamble believes he’s on to a winner selling grapes over the internet. “If Indians are buying lingerie online we were sure they would buy high-quality grapes off the internet too,” says the 42-year-old grape farmer. Based in Nashik, a district in the western state of Maharashtra in India, Kamble has floated an e-marketing initiative to deliver grapes cultivated in his farms directly to the doorsteps of buyers across India. Kamble’s website, bestgrapes.co.in, is part of the fledgling effort being made by Indian farmers to tap into the burgeoning e-commerce market in India. According to a recent report published by investment bank UBS – entitled Is India in an e-commerce bubble? A framework for assessing emerging markets – the country’s e-retail market is expected to reach $50bn (£31.6bn) by 2020. It currently stands at $16bn, as estimated by the Internet and Mobile Association of India. However, the exposure of agricultural produce on e-retail platforms is low. Farmers in India had been forced to rely on traditional modes for reaching customers, dealing with traders and middlemen. However, farmers like Kamble are beginning to use the power of the internet to reach customers directly.
The owner of nearly 30 acres of land, Kamble pooled the resources of about a dozen farmers from Jalalpur, a small village of 3,000 people in Nashik district, to start delivering grapes to buyers across Maharashtra at 100 rupees ($1.55) a kilo. Nashik is considered the grape capital of India, accounting for 60%-65% of the total amount of grapes grown in the country. The project was intended to serve the areas adjoining Nashik district, but Kamble has been attracting custom from further afield. “We received orders for these grapes from Dubai,” says Kamble. “We later realised that sending them would be economically unviable so we declined. We thought our initial market would be limited to Nashik, but we have received orders from other major cities as well.” Kamble has set up a back-end operations unit staffed by family members, who collate the orders. Most requests placed through the website are dispatched the next day, with delivery assured within 48 hours.
Kamble and his group have so far managed to sell nearly two tonnes of grapes through his website. He claims that the returns have been almost double that of selling his produce through a middleman. Even though grape cultivation is big business, the price local farmers get is tiny compared with what retailers receive when selling in the open market. A farmer gets a maximum of 50 rupees a kilo for export-quality grapes that are shipped out of the country. The same product is sold at three to four times that in the international market. High-quality grapes for the Indian market fetch a farmer 20-25 rupees, while a retailer could be selling them at more than 60 rupees. “We realised that we could make double the money if we could bypass middlemen and directly get access to the buyer,” says Dinkar Kamble, another farmer who is part of the initiative. Bhaskar Kamble says the idea was floated by an engineer friend who later helped him design the website. The initiative is facing teething problems due to the high cost of delivering orders. “Earlier we thought that the orders would be limited to Nashik district,” Dinkar Kamble says. “However, in the past week we have received orders for nearly 30kg of grapes on an average day, of which the majority are from Mumbai and Pune. The price of parcelling them to these cities is high and our margins are being stretched as we are selling at only 100 rupees a kilo.” Bhaskar Kamble is hopeful that the economies of scale will help the farmers absorb the cost in the long run. And while the initiative is limited to close friends and relatives at the moment, he says he wants more farmers to join him.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/15/indian-grape-farmers-online-market-internet-business,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/15/indian-grape-farmers-online-market-internet-business
2015-05-14T11:22:42Z,global-development,Global development,"South Sudan risks 'catastrophe' with new aid agency law, warn NGOs","A new law that would force aid agencies working in South Sudan to ensure that no more than a fifth of their staff are foreigners could cost lives and have “catastrophic effects” on those most at risk in the aid-dependent and conflict-riven nation, a group of NGOs has warned. On Wednesday, South Sudan’s parliament passed the non-governmental organisations (NGO) bill, which, according to the office of the president, Salva Kiir, is intended “to regulate the NGOs, international and local”. Although the bill is still awaiting Kiir’s signature, the South Sudan NGO Forum fears it could jeopardise humanitarian operations once enacted. South Sudan, the world’s youngest nation, has been convulsed by civil war since December 2013, when Kiir accused his former vice-president, Riek Machar, of plotting a coup. The resulting conflict – which has split the country along ethnic lines, pitting Kiir’s Dinka against Machar’s Nuer – has killed more than 10,000 people, forced about 1.5 million from their homes, and left 2.5 million facing severe food insecurity. The South Sudan NGO Forum, which represents 160 national and 140 international NGOs working in the country, said that while it welcomed the prospect of a strong regulatory framework to make it easier for its members to operate “within a coherent and consistent legal environment”, it was worried about the bill’s humanitarian impacts. “There are still significant concerns that certain provisions of the NGO bill will not regulate NGO operations, but rather hinder their ability to serve South Sudanese people at a time when needs are escalating due to the ongoing conflict,” the forum said in a statement. “It’s also important to note that NGOs are not currently operating unregulated. NGOs operate under national laws as well as rules and regulations of individual government bodies.” Given that South Sudan has a shortage of skilled workers, and a literacy rate of only 27%, there are fears that basic humanitarian operations could be severely undermined by the legislation. “If the bill is implemented in a way that creates a more regressive environment, then this will have potentially catastrophic effects for the large amounts of the South Sudanese population that rely on NGOs to provide basic services and life saving aid,” said the forum. “NGOs are already under mounting administrative pressure and often subject to arbitrary enforcement of rules and regulations. There are increasing incidents of harassment and violence against NGOs.” With the conflict intensifying, said the forum, food was becoming scarcer and NGOs were finding themselves trying to help people in increasingly difficult circumstances. The statement added: “If the bill makes getting assistance to people harder rather than easier, it could cost lives at a time of tremendous suffering for South Sudanese communities.” Last September, the government ordered all foreign workers, including aid agency staff, to be replaced by South Sudanese citizens, only to reverse the policy announcement a day later. In the latest flare-up of fighting, government forces are pushing towards Machar’s hometown of Leer, in Unity state, which is held by his supporters. The area, which the troops have surrounded, is home to some of the country’s once lucrative oil fields. It was the scene of heavy fighting in January last year, during which the town was virtually destroyed and a Médecins Sans Frontières hospital was attacked, looted and torched. Fears of an attack on Leer led the UN and all the NGOs working in the area to withdraw their staff last week. Toby Lanzer, the UN’s humanitarian coordinator in South Sudan, said on Wednesday that the evacuation of aid workers in southern parts of the state had left more than 500,000 people without life-saving aid. His warning came a day after the UN said at least 28 towns and villages in Unity had been attacked and burned since the end of April, adding there had been reports of killings, rape, abduction and looting of cattle and other property. Months of peace talks in neighbouring Ethiopia have so far failed to reach any lasting agreement, or even negotiate an enduring ceasefire. On Tuesday, the head of the African Union commission, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, said South Sudan was facing a “catastrophic humanitarian situation” with the “loss of countless human lives and untold suffering”.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/14/south-sudan-aid-agency-law-risks-catastrophe-warn-ngos,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/14/south-sudan-aid-agency-law-risks-catastrophe-warn-ngos
2015-05-14T09:00:11Z,global-development,Global development,African Development Bank presidential candidates outline their aims,"The African Development Bank (AfDB) will elect a new president at the end of the month as its current leader, Donald Kaberuka, steps down after a decade in charge. Eight candidates are in the running to take over from Kaberuka, who is credited with steering the bank through the tumultuous 2008 financial crisis and ramping up infrastructure lending.
The bank is one of the continent’s biggest lending institutions, rivalling the World Bank in financing infrastructure projects to improve electricity, transport and water services. In 2013, the bank approved almost $3.16bn (£2bn) in loans and grants to infrastructure projects on the continent, according to its annual report. Kaberuka, Rwanda’s former finance minister, was voted into office in 2005. Last month, he said the bank needs to do more to spread Africa’s economic growth and called on his successor to focus on reducing inequality across the continent. Founded in 1964, the bank has 80 member countries, including 26 non-African states. Its mission is “to promote sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty in Africa”. On 28 May, the board of governors will vote on the next president of the AfDB. The candidates to take over from Kaberuka are nearly all African government ministers, with the exception of one head of a regional development group and one former AfDB official. Each candidate has submitted a vision statement that details their priorities for the bank. Last month, seven of the eight contenders met at the Center for Global Development in Washington DC to outline these priorities. The candidates outline their views below.
Birama Boubacar Sidibe – Mali’s vice-president I really believe that we are going through a fantastic opportunity now. Africa is changing very fast and I really believe that we are in a situation where we need to be relevant to African problems – with changes ahead – and I believe my aspiration is really to continue to build on the past success and the past progress. My vision is of an AfDB that is of a new generation of regional development bank, seeking the effective development of the private sector as priority number one, and also as an institution that should be able to respond to the needs of its client, customer and/or shareholder. This vision – I see five priority areas: I believe we need first to build strong institutions, service delivery institutions and presentation institutions. My second priority would be [to] make it possible for the private sector to be the main investor in African problems in infrastructure and energy and so on. Also, [I would prioritise] the mobilisation of the resources to be able to finance mega projects, mega deal projects in Africa. That’s another area that I would really want to concentrate on if I were given that role. The AfDB needs to adapt its operating model to be able to be the institution that structures the deals to attract the private sector to come and face the challenges. We have a fantastic opportunity: Africa is changing, the bank needs to adapt its operating model to Africa, we need a modern bank to do that.
Akinwumi Adesina – Nigeria’s minister of agriculture and rural development I’m running for president of the AfDB because I have a vision for Africa, an Africa that actually has inclusive growth, an Africa where you have countries that are actually well linked to each other, so it’s regionally integrated. An Africa that is connected to the rest of the world so you have an Africa that is globally competitive. But also an Africa that young people want to stay in, not one that they want to move away from. An Africa that we can be proud to call ours. And that’s my vision for the bank, for what the bank can do. I have laid out my priorities for doing that. First, it’s critical to have smarter infrastructure to have increased productivity and competitiveness for Africa. The second is the private sector – it’s the engine of growth … for wealth creation. A big thing for us in Africa is an inclusive model. But also jobs for Africa’s youth, jobs for Africa’s women, reviving Africa’s rural areas for inclusive growth and, finally, to have regional integration for shared prosperity. Why am I ideal for this? I’ve lived in 15 countries, 10 of those were Francophone countries. I’m a development economist; I come with a whole set of skills that cover development finance in rural economic development, public policy, investment and finance. And I have worked and delivered programmes at scale, at impact. I actually come from a rural area; my father was a farmer, I came out of poverty. So I know poverty is not about statistics, it’s something we have to change. It’s not about someone like me being an exception, that should be the normal thing in Africa. And that’s why I’m running for president of the bank, because I think we can bring a lot of hope and prosperity to the continent.
Cristina Duarte – Cape Verde’s minister of finance and planning My vision for the AfDB starts with my vision for Africa. I have a quite deep conviction that change is possible – yes, we can do it despite [all the challenges]. The AfDB is supposed to help Africa to seize the opportunity, to help Africa to grab these moments in terms of Africa rising, and to ensure Africa’s transformation. This will require a change of mentality, of our mindset. So we can move away from business as usual to adopt a more leapfrog approach, we can move away from managing poverty, to adopt an approach [that seeks to] retain and create African wealth. In order to do that, the AfDB will have to undertake some reforms to become a more efficient, effective, productive and responsible organisation. And, in order to do that, the AfDB will have to adopt, for example, a more selective and focused approach, a results-based management approach based on and supported by a strong monitoring and evaluation system. I think it’s time for the AfDB to start measuring impacts – not processes, not lending volumes, not process approval – so that we can build on leadership, ownership and partnership.
Samura Kamara – Sierra Leone’s minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation As a former client of the bank, as well as a shareholder of the bank, and as an African, I’ve really seen the bank’s ability to make a lot of difference in people’s lives in Africa. And I do believe the bank can and must be pushed to advance the developmental monies as well as the financial monies. And I would be honoured to have the privilege to lead the bank to carry forward these two difficult challenges. The bank has done very well in [its] 50 years: it’s been dynamic, it’s been innovative, effective and accountable. I think we need to build on this. We need to consolidate what the bank has done. There are challenges, we have to learn the good lessons and bad lessons that are coming out of this. “But of course, we have a baseline on which we can build. We have the baseline which is the bank’s senior strategy to 2022. It lays down the imperatives of what are actually our core challenges in Africa. Secondly, we need to advance the bank’s AAA rating because it’s about also mobilising affordable resources, mobilising adequate resources and forming an optimally structured organisation. Against this background, we also need to put greater efforts into fighting inequality – we need to fight exclusion. We need to put a lot of emphasis on insecurity, that’s very important. As we move forward, we need to ensure that strong partnerships are built because this is central if African development is to continue in this mandate.
Thomas Sakala (Zimbabwe) – AfDB’s former vice-president of country and regional programmes Whether or not I was a candidate for this position, as an African I have a vision of an Africa that is determined to transform itself into a confident, integrated and prosperous continent, and it’s not original: it has been there for a long time. When we come to why I am a candidate, I can summarise it in three words: consolidation, innovation and results. And to understand how I’ve arrived at this position you need to start by recognising that the bank is currently in a good space: it is strong, it has been doing reasonably well. And probably I can also say that I’m proud to have been part of the staff and management team that has worked under the leadership of Dr Kaberuka to bring [the bank] to where it is. I know some colleagues here have also worked at the bank so it’s a shared source of pride.
If elected, I intend to quickly and strongly build on the strategy and recent initiatives and reforms; I’ll also introduce some. I have a number of areas where I would like to introduce some reforms; I would prioritise funding for the preparation of our infrastructure projects. Fundamentally, I believe the bank should continue with the same tenuous strategy objectives of inclusive growth and transition to green economies and it will have to remain focused on the five operational priority areas that have already been identified: infrastructure, regional integration, etc. Personally, I’m going to pay more attention to infrastructure, regional integration, private sector development in Africa and also pay a lot of attention to gender issues, fragility and food security. And I believe my long years in the bank, involved in various areas, will help me do that quickly.
Jaloul Ayed (Tunisia) – president of the MED Confederation My vision is to make the bank an engine to transform the unfathomed wealth of Africa for the benefit of all Africans while pursuing the path of sustainable, inclusive and green development. And in doing so, I will basically pursue the strategy that’s been set forth by the bank, particularly with respect to the areas of emphasis, mainly infrastructure, private sector, skills and technology. I will put much greater emphasis personally on the private sector because I believe that it’s really the engine for growth and development, particularly now that Africa is moving out and is relying more on its own resources. And so I believe the time now is for Africa to really capture the moment and push through the momentum that it has created over the last decade or so. I also happen to believe that there is another area on which I’ll put great focus which is financial systems and financial systems development and reform. I believe that an economy can only be strong if it has a strong financial system, and by financial system I mean not just the banking system but all the areas of financial systems: private equity, capital markets and what have you. I also believe the focus should be put on some areas that I believe are important, [such as] culture, and I attach great importance to gender, as well as to pushing through the strategy that has been deployed by the bank with respect to the fragile states.
Kordjé Bedoumra – Chad’s minister of finance and budget I think Africa is at a critical tipping point and that can and will accelerate the current growth, inclusive growth and sustainable growth. The AfDB can play a great role in focusing the resources on areas which can get results on the ground. And when I’m talking about results on the ground, I’m talking about things which can change the situation of our population. Four of them, quickly: the first one is that I hope that the bank can work with regional integration organisations so that we can soon come into a situation where the [free] movement of goods, services, people and capital is a reality on the continent. You have a market on the continent which can promote the economic transformation and also investment in the continent. The second thing we know we have to focus on [is] providing jobs for youth and the empowerment of women. These are areas that we have to focus on. Everything we are going to do in terms of promoting private sectors, small and medium-sized enterprises, micro-finance, we should measure [in terms of] how many jobs we create for young people, how we really promote the empowerment of women. We have to ensure we get results in these areas. That’s why I’m calling for an impact on the population. The third thing is the human being and the last one is security and peace, which is very, very important.
Sufian Ahmed – Ethiopia’s minister of finance and economic development Africa is in the midst of a golden age, and I want the AfDB to play the fullest possible role in taking advantage of the extraordinary opportunities all around us. As Ethiopia’s finance and economic development minister since 1995, I’ve helped Ethiopia to reap its share of this harvest. Our growth is among the fastest on the continent (more than 10% per annum over the last decade). Inflation is under control. And investors showed their confidence in our prospects when our $1bn Eurobond issue was oversubscribed by 260%. I would be honoured to use my experience to work for the whole of Africa as the next president of the AfDB and, if elected, I would focus on three core tasks. First, focus our financing on what we are best at and what will make the biggest difference for Africa – above all, infrastructure, agriculture, and supporting private sector growth and helping fragile states. Second, bringing world class advisory capacity to the table in support of the countries we work with – supporting fragile and conflict-affected states, building enabling environments, and generating real results from private sector growth. “Third, invest in high quality management and operations through an approach built on empowerment, delegation, and accountability, with the whole bank focused on effectiveness value for money and minimising costs. • Sufian Ahmed was not present at the Center for Global Development debate.

2015-05-14T06:00:07Z,global-development,Global development,'My mother did everything but she was left to bleed to death after giving birth' | Alon Mwesigwa,"Remmie Wamala, who worked at the Ugandan parliament, died in childbirth at a hospital in Kampala two years ago. “My mother did everything; [but] she was left to bleed to death after giving birth,” said her 10-year-old daughter, Shonel Lunkuse. Speaking at a citizens’ hearing, held last week to campaign for better healthcare in Uganda, Shonel said: “It was only one midwife in a room trying to help two women to deliver. Life has been a struggle ever since my mother died.” Shonel’s mother became part of an ugly statistic – in 2013, an estimated 5,900 women in Uganda died of pregnancy-related causes, according to figures from the World Health Organisation. That equates to 360 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births. One in 44 women in Uganda has a lifetime risk of maternal death. Globally, the maternal mortality ratio has dropped by 45% since 1990, but there are big disparities between rich and poor countries. The estimated maternal mortality ratio in developing countries in 2013 was estimated at 230 for every 100,000 live births compared with 16 in developed countries.
Meanwhile, the death of children under five worldwide declined from 12.7 million in 1990 to 6.3 million in 2013. Last week’s citizens’ hearing was one of several that have been organised around the globe in recent months to garner support for reproductive health and childcare. The hearings, organised by the White Ribbon Alliance for Safe Motherhood, the International Planned Parenthood Federation, Save the Children and World Vision, have been held in more than 25 countries, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda. They have involved thousands of people and at least 400 local organisations. From the hearings, people are calling on governments to account for their promises on delivery of millennium development goals (MDGs) four and five – to reduce maternal and child deaths – as well as pushing for strong targets in the new sustainable development goals (SDGs). On Thursday, the recommendations from the hearings will be presented to the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, by a Ugandan maternal health advocate, Faridah Mwanje Luyiga. Next week, activists will attend the World Health Assembly – the world’s highest health policy-setting body – to advocate for decent healthcare for women, children and adolescents. “We need a united voice calling for a fairer world for all children and ambitious goals that will deliver zero poverty and zero preventable deaths of children,” said World Vision in a statement. Recommendations from Uganda’s citizen hearings include ensuring universal access to family planning, a review of procurement processes to help speed them up, improved emergency obstetric and newborn care at health centres, and prioritising the recruitment and retention of healthcare workers. In Uganda, for every 1,000 live births, 69 children die before they reach their fifth birthday; 33% die in the first four weeks of life. There is a belief, though, that a lot can be achieved with the SDGs if people are engaged and empowered to hold their leaders accountable. “With less than 200 days remaining until the end of the MDGs, we want to highlight how much more can be achieved by the replacement sustainable development goals if citizen leaders are supported to lead the change and continue to work with and push governments to deliver,” said Betsy McCallon, the executive director of the White Ribbon Alliance. Challenges remain. Health workers in many countries have to contend with inadequate salaries, lack of electricity in health centres, and poor accommodation. “The care [in some hospitals] is heartbreaking,” said Philomena Okello, a nursing officer at Lira referral hospital in Uganda. She said the hospital has capacity for 22 women a day, but routinely receives more than 100. Last December, a report showed that new mothers and babies were being put at risk by health facilities that lack safe water, an adequate number of toilets and proper hygiene levels. Okello believes that if they are empowered, people can demand that clean water be put in place.
Luyiga said: “Evidence has shown that if citizens are told of their rights, obligations and entitlements, they will demand that their leaders act.” Maternal deaths and child mortality rates are higher among women living in rural areas and among poorer communities, where people also tend to be less aware of their rights and their leaders’ responsibilities. In Uganda, a 2013 survey of three districts – Lira, Mityana, and Kabale – found that the 43 government-funded health centres lacked the minimum requirements for treating complications in childbirth, including severe bleeding, high blood pressure, resuscitation of newborn babies, caesarean sections and blood transfusions. The leaders in each area appeared unconcerned until local people began asking hard questions. Things have now started to change. At the district level, according to White Ribbon Alliance Uganda, district health officers have responded to gaps in the provision of life-saving services, and budgeted for gaps that could not be addressed immediately. Save the Children’s recent state of the world’s mothers report said Kampala had made good progress in preventing child deaths, which were reported to be down from 94 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2006 to 65 in 2011. The good progress was because people from poor areas were being made more aware about child health, the report said. “Family health days in places of worship have helped promote awareness of preventable diseases and reduced their occurrences,” said the report. Such changes should ultimately reduce the heartbreak for people like Shonel. “The hospital agreed to compensate us, but that’s not fair. Money can’t replace someone’s life lost,” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/14/maternal-child-mortality-uganda-citizens-hearings-white-ribbon-alliance,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/14/maternal-child-mortality-uganda-citizens-hearings-white-ribbon-alliance
2015-05-13T15:27:12Z,global-development,Global development,Strong Girl tactics: One campaign song aims to strike a blow for women,"Nine female musicians from seven African countries have come together on a new song calling for women and girls to be central to the fight against poverty. In a shift from previous anti-poverty music campaigns that have been criticised for ignoring African musicians and misrepresenting the continent, the video from the One campaign features an all African-cast of some of the continent’s brightest stars. The song, called Strong Girl, features Victoria Kimani, from Kenya, Vanessa Mdee, from Tanzania, Arielle T, from Gabon, Gabriela, from Mozambique, Judith Sephuma, from South Africa, Waje, from Nigeria, Selmor Mtukudzi, from Zimbabwe, Yemi Alade, from Nigeria and 14-year-old South African rapper called Blessing.
The song is part of One’s poverty is sexist campaign, which calls for targeted investments to overcome the barriers that disproportionately affect women, not least in education and health. “In the townships of South Africa it’s hard for girls. There is poverty, abuse, and it’s difficult for girls to stand up for themselves,” said Blessing, from Johannesburg. “I know first-hand that poverty is sexist, and that our leaders have to do more to support girls and women. Because when they are allowed to reach their full potential, girls and women lift their families, communities and even whole countries out of poverty faster. “When a girl stands up for herself, she is standing up for every single girl and woman. That’s what being strong is. But you need to know other people are there to back you up – girls, women, boys and men.” The Nigerian Nollywood actor Omotola Jalade Ekeinde, who appears in the Strong Girl video, said: “I am fortunate to be a young woman living her dreams, a trailblazer of my generation, but I also recognise that many women and girls are not so fortunate; women and girls are disproportionately affected by the injustice of poverty and inequality. But when we invest in women and girls, we increase and accelerate the chances of overcoming extreme poverty.” The One Africa executive director Sipho Moyo said that as world leaders prepare to finalise the sustainable development goals in September, now was the time to call for a greater focus on women and girls. “Investments in health, education and economic empowerment can help remove the barriers that prevent so many girls and women from leading healthy and productive lives. Giving women the power and tools they need to improve their lives and take hold of equal opportunities means they can become catalysts to help end poverty.” The advocacy group is asking people on social media to get involved in their campaign by posting photos of themselves paying homage to Rosie the Riveter, the bicep-flexing woman depicted on a famous US war propaganda poster, using the hashtag #strengthie. Celebrities and campaigners have shown their support, including the education campaigner Malala Yousafzai.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/13/strong-girl-one-campaign-song-women-girls-sustainable-development,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/13/strong-girl-one-campaign-song-women-girls-sustainable-development
2015-05-13T12:37:39Z,global-development,Global development,Malawi study reveals devastating cost of child undernutrition,"Malawi’s development is being thwarted by child undernutrition, the effects of which continue to blight the lives of 60% of the impoverished country’s adults and costing its economy hundreds of millions a year, according to a new study. As well as dragging down Malawi’s productivity levels and putting a strain on health and education services, undernutrition has decimated the country’s potential workforce: an estimated 10.7% of those who would now be aged between 15 and 64 died as children because of undernourishment. Between 2008 and 2012, almost 82,000 child deaths in Malawi – 23% of all child mortalities – were estimated to be directly associated with undernutrition, the study says. The report, a joint study by the Malawian ministry of finance, the UN World Food Programme (WFP), the African Union Commission and others, says the consequences of stunting have been particularly devastating.
Stunting – or low height for age – occurs when children miss out on vital nutrients in the womb and in the first two years of their lives. Its effects are enduring, causing frequent illness, poor educational performance and low productivity at work. “Despite significant progress made in recent years, results … have shown that almost half of all children under five in Malawi (1.268 million out of 2.765 million children) were affected by stunting in 2012, and almost 350,715 children were underweight,” says the study. “This situation is especially critical for children between 12 and 23 months, out of whom 54.3% are affected by stunting.” The study, entitled The cost of hunger in Africa: the social and economic impact of child undernutrition in Malawi, found that 59.9% of working-age Malawians had suffered from growth retardation before reaching the age of five. With two-thirds of the country’s population working in manual activities, Malawi is estimated to have lost $66.7m in 2012 alone because of the reduced productivity of those who were stunted as children. In the same year, says the report, Malawi lost 800,566 working hours due to absent workforce as a result of incremental undernutrition-related child mortalities. Overall, the country is thought to have lost $597m (£381m) in 2012 – equivalent to 10.3% of its GDP – because of child undernutrition.
“The study findings have clearly shown that adequate nutrition is critical for one’s physical and intellectual development and work productivity, and is therefore an integral element for socioeconomic development,” said Goodall Gondwe, Malawi’s minister of finance, economic planning and development. “It is in this context that we are determined as a government to channel adequate resources towards nutrition interventions. [The] government will also strengthen institutional and human capacity for the effective delivery of nutrition services.” The report warns that without greater attention to the issue, Malawi’s economic development will be further undermined. It calls for nutritional efforts to be focused on vulnerable groups – including infants, young and school-age children, and people living with HIV – and stresses the importance of breastfeeding, diverse diets, water, sanitation and hygiene programmes, and strategies to prevent and reverse undernutrition, such as deworming and micronutrient treatments. Malawi is still struggling to recover from January’s floods, which affected more than a million people, left hundreds dead and devastated 64,000 hectares (158,080 acres) of land. The WFP estimates that more than 600,000 Malawians will need food assistance between now and July.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/13/malawi-child-undernutrition-lost-lives-poor-productivity,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/13/malawi-child-undernutrition-lost-lives-poor-productivity
2015-05-13T04:00:01Z,global-development,Global development,Cambodia forest communities confront illegal loggers as authorities look away,"Sok Plok and his fellow forestry activists are surprisingly fast for men in flip-flops as they navigate through the thick, thorny vegetation. They have been alerted by the distant humming of tractor engines; a sound that, in this part of Cambodia, normally means illegal loggers are afoot. They stumble out on to the dirt road just in time to intercept a shipment of timber on its way to a sawmill about 10 miles further down the road. A man known as Hee gets off the first tractor and calmly lights up a cigarette as Sok Plok explains that he and his companions are members of the anti-logging Prey Lang Community Network (PLCN). He then accuses Hee of transporting illegally felled timber. “I know,” says Hee with a shrug. “But I need to make a living. I get paid $50 for each load I transport.” Sok Plok demands to know the name of his boss but Hee refuses to tell him. Meanwhile, the other activists get to work, taking notes and photographing the convoy and timber.
Prey Lang, which means “our forest” in the local Kuy language, spans between 130,000 and 250,000 hectares and is the largest remaining lowland evergreen forest on the Indo-Chinese peninsula, and one of the largest in south-east Asia. It contains more than 20 species of endangered animals and seven distinct ecosystems. Around 200,000 people live in and around the forest. Grassroots organisations like the PLCN grew out of local action to protect the forest a decade or so ago. Sok Plok and his team are part of a patrol set up to challenge illegal logging, and all the information they collect – photographs and details of the number of tractors and quantity of logs – is recorded on a central database. In April, the PLCN published a report, Our Forest Remains Under Destruction, which accused political and business elites of being directly involved in and profiting from illegal logging. The report claimed that law enforcement and forest management officials consistently failed to act and had no concrete prevention measures in place. In April, Cambodia’s prime minister, Hun Sen, told provincial governors to take responsibility for curbing forestry crimes in their respective provinces, and criticised officials who blame each other when illegal logging is uncovered. Thy Neang, an environment ministry official who manages the Cambodian Elephant Conservation Group and works in partnership with Fauna & Flora International (FFI), said Prey Lang must be preserved. “If Prey Lang is deforested or heavily degraded, Cambodia will lose its largest lowland forest area with high biological value, putting at risk the existence of wildlife, including the Asian elephant, banteng and sambar,” he said. “The loss of such an ecosystem would, in turn, cause changes in climate, leading to droughts and water shortages in the dry season and more floods in the wet season. “Prey Lang is the source of the Stung Sen river, which is a major tributary of the Tonlé Sap lake,” he said. “Loss of the forest would in turn reduce water flow and reduce the value of ecosystem services ... The livelihoods of people living in the area, who are dependent on the collection of forest products including resin, wild mushrooms, wild vegetables, rattan and medicinal plants, would also be affected.” However, as with many disputes over natural resources, the people who are caught in the middle – such as Hee – may have little choice but to prioritise short-term gain. Back in the forest, after some negotiation, the Prey Lang activists decide to let Hee go on his way, but only after he has promised to get out of logging. Sok Plok says he trusts Hee to keep his vow – in any case, on this occasion the activists lack the manpower to seize the timber. But it seems a flimsy guarantee: it is hard to see what alternative livelihoods are available. “I guess I could try growing cassava, I don’t know. I just want to be able to support my family, and we are all living hand-to-mouth,” says Hee. He is transporting a tropical forest tree – Dipterocarpus alatus – that produces an oily resin used to varnish wood or waterproof boats.
In some villages in Prey Lang, up to 80% of households regularly extract this resin, and for many it is the main source of income, according to research by the University of Copenhagen. Families pass trees down through the generations. The other big threat to Prey Lang is ever-expanding rubber plantations. In a May 2013 report, Global Witness detailed how rubber companies “with close links to the region’s notoriously corrupt political elites, operate with complete impunity, devastating local livelihoods and the environment”.Ernst Jürgensen, who heads Denmark’s Danmission in Cambodia and helps to train PLCN activists, said the government gave large concessions to private companies to grow rubber trees in the forest. “The government claims this will create employment for the people of Prey Lang. In reality, that is seldom the case. Instead, we see how these companies overstep their concessions and clear more forest than they are allowed to, because there is no control or oversight,” he said. Almost 1.6 billion people – more than 25% of the world’s population – rely on forest resources for their livelihoods. The United Nations Forum on Forests, which is meeting in New York this month, wants to strengthen existing policies to address the effective management, conservation and development of all forests. It aims to forge an international policy for the next 15 years that will be aligned with the new sustainable development agenda, to be approved in September. As they set up camp for their second night on patrol, the PLCN activists, many of whom are farmers and foragers, share their concerns about the future. Hiem Vuthy, 25, says he is worried about the environmental consequences of deforestation. “I’m protecting the forest to prevent the flooding and droughts that we might get if all the trees are cut down,” he says. “I think Prey Lang is very important for my country. It’s full of valuable resources that many people use, so we should treasure that.” But in the distance, the shrieks of birds blend with the unmistakable drone of a chainsaw.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/13/cambodia-forest-communities-confront-illegal-loggers-as-authorities-look-away,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/13/cambodia-forest-communities-confront-illegal-loggers-as-authorities-look-away
2015-05-12T13:16:53Z,global-development,Global development,EU suspends €2m aid to Burundi amid violent crackdown on political protests,"The EU is withholding €2m ($2.3m) of aid to Burundi amid increasing concern over the government’s violent crackdown on protesters opposed to President Pierre Nkurunziza’s attempts to secure a third term in office. The president’s decision to try to extend his decade-long rule has prompted weeks of unrest that have killed at least 19 people and forced tens of thousands to flee to neighbouring countries. His opponents argue the move is a clear violation of the constitution, which limits a president to two terms in office. The EU envoy to Africa’s Great Lakes region, Koen Vervaeke, said that although the union had disbursed €6m ($6.7m) of the €8m designated for elections, it had decided to withhold the rest until Nkurunziza heeded calls for a transparent poll. “Today it is out of question to release the €2m unless conditions for a free, peaceful and credible election are secured,” he told a news conference in the capital, Bujumbura, on Monday.
Burundi’s former colonial power, Belgium, has also announced a suspension of electoral aid, opting to withhold half of the €4m it had set aside for the polls. Belgium said it would also pull out of a €5m police cooperation deal, funded jointly with the Netherlands. Police in Burundi have been accused of using live rounds on protesters, as well as tear-gas and water cannon – a charge they deny. A spokesman for the Dutch foreign ministry, Herman van Gelderen, said the Netherlands was awaiting the outcome of a meeting of the East African Community in Tanzania on Wednesday before making a decision, but echoed calls for an open vote. “There must be free and fair elections that are open to all parties,” he said. “It’s that simple.” The Burundian foreign minister, Laurent Kavakure, said the government was already taking steps to improve the situation, adding: “We are determined to create the conditions for free, transparent and peaceful elections.” Under the current election schedule, a parliamentary vote will be held on 26 May, with a presidential poll a month later. The opposition has called for a postponement. The crackdown on protests has drawn rebukes from many of the western nations that provide the aid on which Burundi relies for half its budget. European states are the biggest contributors, while the US provides support to the army. Dawn Liberi, the US ambassador to Burundi, told a meeting of the government and diplomats: “We call for an immediate end to the use of violent force by police against peaceful protests and the political intimidation, threats, and violence by all armed militia.” The US has said it is worried about reports that the Imbonerakure, the youth wing of Nkurunziza’s CNDD-FDD party, had been armed, an allegation the government denies. The violence has plunged Burundi into its worst crisis since the end of its 12-year civil war in 2006. The conflict, between ethnic Tutsis and Hutus, left around 300,000 people dead. Nkurunziza, a former rebel leader from the Hutu majority, has so far defied international pressure to withdraw from the election. A constitutional court has ruled the president can run because his first term – which saw him picked by parliament rather than elected by popular vote – does not count. Critics say the court is biased.
On Tuesday, Reuters reported that police fired guns and teargas towards protesters throwing stones in a suburb of Bujumbura. At least two police officers fired guns towards lines of demonstrators during clashes in Butarere district, a witness said. A police spokesman had no immediate comment. There were also reports of a grenade being thrown in a separate district, killing two people. The latest unrest has seen more than 50,000 people flee Burundi since early April, with at least half of them going to Rwanda, according to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. Almost 18,000 have fled to Tanzania and 8,000 to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Some of the refugees now arriving in Rwanda say they are running from the Imbonerakure. “The Imbonerakure came to our neighbourhood to say that those who were against the third term of President Nkurunziza were going to die. That’s why I left,” Eric Ahishakiye, a 23-year-old mechanic, told AFP. Adrian Edwards, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said those fleeing had recounted “harassment and intimidation by Imbonerakure youth militants, who paint red marks on homes of people to be targeted”. Rwanda, where a Tutsi-led government has been in power since the 1994 genocide, has signalled its concern at the arrival of so many refugees. “While we respect Burundi’s sovereignty in addressing internal matters, Rwanda considers the safety of innocent populations as a regional and international responsibility,” the foreign minister, Louise Mushikiwabo, said last week.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/12/eu-suspends-2m-aid-burundi-violent-crackdown-political-protests,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/12/eu-suspends-2m-aid-burundi-violent-crackdown-political-protests

2015-05-12T06:00:02Z,global-development,Global development,Brazil's tough laws on violence against women stymied by social norms,"As the negotiations continue towards agreeing a set of sustainable development goals (SDGs) to come into effect next year, tackling gender inequality remains high on the agenda. The current draft of the SDGs contains a standalone goal on the issue, which includes a specific target to “eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation”. It’s a welcome move – and certainly more hard-hitting than the gender equality requirements of the millennium development goals, which saw donor countries target aid at education and health in developing countries, while ignoring other areas crucial to women’s rights, such as countering gender-based violence. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), around 35% of women worldwide have experienced gender-based violence, with 38% of femicides globally committed by an intimate partner. As with the MDGs before them, however, any move to tackle gender inequality in the SDGs will come up against damaging social norms which in many societies keep women and girls disempowered. Indeed, in many societies violence against women occurs with such prevalence that it could be viewed as a social norm. In a country such as Brazil, where the situation for women has been slowly improving, a woman is still assaulted every 15 seconds, and one is murdered every two hours. Within the past three decades, at least 92,000 women there have been killed, many at the hands of their partners, according to the Map of Violence survey in 2012. In a bid to improve matters, in March Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff launched a zero tolerance policy towards violence against women and girls. The penal code was changed to include femicide – defined as any crime that involves domestic violence, discrimination or contempt for women, which results in their death.
And tougher sentences were introduced of between 12 to 30 years’ imprisonment for violence charges. Longer jail terms were brought in for crimes committed against pregnant women, girls under 14, women over 60 and women and girls with disabilities. It was a major great step forward for advocates for women’s rights in Brazil. But speaking to people working on the frontline of the battle against violence against women in Brazil last month, it is evident that despite the legislative push to tackle the problem, more needs to be done at a grassroots level to change embedded social norms. The Reverend Elineide Ferreira Oliveira runs Casa de Noeli, a safe house for female survivors of violence in the northern city of Ariquemes. She warns that reforms such as the new femicide law, and the Maria de Penha law of 2006, which increased penalties for domestic violence, will not be enough to change the patriarchal mentality that keeps women disempowered. “The new law could make things better, although it will take a while to implement,” said Oliveira. “Maybe with harsher punishments, they will have to treat violence against women more seriously. But even in the court system, there are some judges or lawyers who say when a husband and wife fight, we have no right to intervene, it’s a private matter. Many people think violence is normal – it’s not.”
As well as running the refuge, Rev Oliveira, along with other members of Christian Aid partner Anglican Service on Diakonia and Development (Sadd), which supports her work, has produced leaflets informing women suffering violence of their rights, and giving details of where they can get help. The leaflets, which are available in three languages, are distributed in schools, police stations and churches. The literature distribution is an important small step in tackling violence. The creation of the SDGs, however, presents a unique opportunity to instigate a host of small steps worldwide. That’s why it’s crucial that women’s rights are central to the final SDG framework. Their inclusion must be matched by countries demonstrating the political will needed to implement change – and funding must also be made available. Women’s rights organisations are frequently underfunded, with money also needed to implement legislation and long-term initiatives such as education on sex and relationships, and campaigns, in the media and elsewhere, that challenge stereotypes. The payback for such investment would be incalculable – nothing less than a world where gender-based violence is seen as an abhorrence that no society should tolerate.

2015-05-11T15:34:02Z,global-development,Global development,"Amnesty reports abduction, torture and rape of migrants in Libya","When the 17-year-old boy, who had been locked in a house for months near Sabha in Libya, said his family in Ivory Coast could not pay for his release, his captors showed no mercy. “They tortured us to force us to call our relatives to extort money from them. If you don’t pay, you don’t go out ... I told [the head of the ‘prison’] that I did not have any family members, that all of them had died. He answered: ‘You will join them in death if you don’t pay.’ I started crying, and so they started beating me with a belt and a broomstick,” he said. The teenager’s story was included in an Amnesty International report documenting abductions, torture and other abuses by smugglers and armed groups in Libya. The rights group said these horrors are driving many refugees and migrants to “risk their lives in treacherous sea crossings in a desperate attempt to reach safety in Europe”. The chilling testimonies were released as the EU struggles to tackle the growing number of people attempting to cross the Mediterranean from Libya. The European commission is due to unveil new proposals to impose migrant quotas on its members on Wednesday, while plans are also being drawn up for military attacks to target the trafficking networks.
Amnesty warned that efforts to destroy smugglers’ vessels before they are used could leave migrants and refugees trapped in a conflict zone, and it urged the EU to swiftly deploy promised rescue vessels where they are needed most, as well as to offer more resettlement places. “Introducing measures to tackle smugglers, without providing safe alternative routes out for the people desperate to flee conflict in Libya, will not resolve the plight of migrants and refugees,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s director for the Middle East and North Africa. “Neighbouring countries, including Tunisia and Egypt, must keep their borders open to ensure anyone fleeing violence and persecution in Libya is granted safe refuge,” he said. Amnesty carried out 70 interviews between August 2014 and March this year. As well as newly arrived migrants, Amnesty found that people from established migrant communities in Libya were seeking to flee the growing lawlessness. The young Ivorian arrived in Sicily last June; he said the smugglers, who had helped him get into Libya in March 2014, handed a group of migrants over to an armed group, who imprisoned them in a three-storey house for months. The teenager, who was not named, said the “prison” was run by Libyans but that Ghanaians were also working there. Mohamed, a Somali refugee interviewed in Sicily in April, said his group had entered Libya through the Sahara.
“In the desert, Libyan men were forcing, torturing us, beating us with swords, guns, stones, Kalashnikovs. They would beat us every day. They broke my finger, a friend had [a] broken arm. We couldn’t escape. My friend Mohamed tried to escape and was shot dead. Another man was hit on the head with a stone and died ... I stayed one month, then paid. My mother’s brother is in Holland; he paid,” he said. The report said migrants and refugees faced abuses at all stages of the smuggling routes from west and east Africa towards the Libyan coast. Many were abducted and tortured to force them and their families to pay ransoms. “Those unable to pay are often held effectively as slaves – forced to work without pay, physically assaulted and robbed. Smugglers also sometimes pass the migrants and refugees on to criminal groups once they cross the border in desert areas, or in major transit cities along the migration route, such as Sabha in the south-west or the coastal city of Ajdabiya in eastern Libya,” it said. A Nigerian woman told Amnesty she was gang-raped when she arrived in Sabha in December 2012, after a gang of five armed robbers had abducted her and her husband. “They took us to a far place outside the city in the desert. They tied my husband’s hands and legs to a pole and gang-raped me in front of his eyes,” she said. Amnesty found that abuses were not confined to desert areas but continued in major cities. Ibrahim, a 25-year-old from Mali, said he was abducted in Tripoli last September. He was kept in a small, dirty room with 46 others. “If you have 1,000 dinars ($740), they let you out. If you don’t, you stay. Often, the guards would come and slap you. I eventually had to pay to get out. It is effectively a business that they are running. They detain you so that you have to pay,” he said.
Amnesty’s researchers were also told of abuses in immigration detention centres where migrants and refugees, including children, can be held indefinitely. One woman said officials at one centre had beaten a pregnant woman to death. Those interviewed for the report also highlighted the particular risk faced by Christians at the hands of some armed groups, such as Islamic State, which recently killed at least 49 Christians, mostly from Egypt and Ethiopia. Charles, 30, from Nigeria, said he fled in March after being abducted and assaulted by a criminal gang in the coastal city of Zuwara. “Sometimes young men would come to our house to steal our money. They would come with guns ... I am a Christian and that’s why the men would always come to our house and attack us,” he said. “The international community has stood and watched as Libya has descended into chaos since the 2011 Nato military campaign ended, effectively allowing militias and armed groups to run amok,” Amnesty’s Luther said. “World leaders have a responsibility and must be prepared to face the consequences, which include greater levels of refugees and migrants fleeing conflict and rampant abuse in Libya.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/11/amnesty-report-abduction-torture-migrants-libya-mediterranean,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/11/amnesty-report-abduction-torture-migrants-libya-mediterranean
2015-05-11T09:00:03Z,global-development,Global development,Egypt's quiet classroom revolution brings fresh thinking to disadvantaged children | Jared Maslin,"Nineteen children are squirming in the dark. There has been a power cut for most of their 90-minute English lesson. At the front of the room their teacher, who is from the US, leads a demonstration with a student; a plastic emergency light casts their faces in silhouette. “How. Are. You?” the teacher draws out each word. “Alhamdulillah,” the child responds in Arabic. “Praise God.” The school in the poor Cairo neighbourhood of Saft al-Laban is founded by activists and provides after-school classes to help plug the gaps left by the city’s overcrowded, underfunded public schools, with smaller classes and better-trained teachers. The initiative, called Mish Madrasa (Not a School), is run by volunteers and relies on donations for funding and equipment. The school’s founder, Mostafa Wafa, is standing in the corner of the room, balancing the emergency light on his head with one hand. Wafa, a 24-year–old Cairo University graduate with a friendly smile and scruffy beard, says the impetus for the school came in part from his participation in Egypt’s 2011 revolution, which deposed President Hosni Mubarak after 30 years of authoritarian rule. While the larger political project of the revolution collapsed, he believed that a concrete, local initiative might succeed.
“We want to provide the neighbourhood with a good school. A school for humans,” says Wafa at his family’s house, where classes also take place. “In my opinion, education is the backbone of everything. If you want to change a society, you have to start with education.” He was also inspired to start the school by observing life in Saft al-Laban, a neighbourhood of towering concrete buildings bisected by a highway overpass. The area is one of Cairo’s vast unplanned zones of self-built housing known in Arabic as the ashwayyat – literally, haphazard. Walking through his neighbourhood one day, Wafa came across a group of young children carrying sticks and knives. They had just fought a rival group. He asked them why. “Because they beat up my little brother,” one of them replied. “Did you see Salah? The kid in the red T-shirt. He was the kid with the knife,” says Wafa, referring to a student who had wandered in early to the classroom, clutching a notebook for the English lesson. In Saft al-Laban, just three schools serve about 300,000 people, according to Wafa, who says classes can consist of up to 100 students. “The situation is so much worse now. I used to go to a public middle school, a public high school, and a public university. It wasn’t like that 10 years ago.” Mish Madrasa follows the government curriculum taught in public schools. Part of the project’s goal is to achieve where the public schools sometimes fail. More than a quarter of Egypt’s population is illiterate, including a significant percentage of school students. “We’re talking about a system that’s very poor, unimaginative, awful in many ways. Informal areas have access to that,” says Farida Makar, a researcher on education. “They’re not just structural problems, they’re philosophical problems in the way that education is understood. There is no real conversation around what education should be and why.” Alongside Egypt’s public schools is a parallel system of private centres, tutors, and some NGOs devoted to helping students – although Wafa believes that these focus more on raising funds than on ensuring that teaching is effective. He sees these alternatives as his competition. He says: “They are literally just teaching them how to read and write. And that’s an achievement. They are surprising their parents by having their children read and write. We want to provide them with a good education.” In Saft al-Laban, he says, the most prominent private tutoring option is a network of centres founded by an ultra-conservative Salafi former accountant. “He’s popular now in the schools. Every teacher in the school knows him. And he started from nothing,” he says. Wafa says his aim is to compete with NGOs, private tutors, and Islamists. “For sure, I want to expand like this guy. I don’t want to just receive funds and have the high-class circles know about me,” he says. “I’d rather the slum areas know about me.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/11/egypt-education-mish-madrasa-classroom-revolution-saft-al-laban,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/11/egypt-education-mish-madrasa-classroom-revolution-saft-al-laban
2015-05-11T06:00:10Z,global-development,Global development,'I just want to go to school': how Afghan law continues to fail child brides | Sune Engel Rasmussen,"Benefsheh sits on a couch, shy and dressed in school uniform, as she recounts her divorce. At the age of seven, her parents married her off to a 16-year-old boy in exchange for a wife for her brother. Benefsheh was abused by her husband and mother-in-law, who would beat her and force her to do hard manual labour in the mountains. When her brother eventually decided to rescue her from her in-laws, her husband claimed compensation: her younger sister, Shogofa. After fleeing their village close to the Iranian border, Benefsheh and Shogofa, now 13 and 11, settled in a women’s shelter in Herat city.
Young girls are routinely used as barter to settle disputes or arrange marriages between families in Afghanistan. Despite attempts from the international community to strengthen the country’s formal justice system, where the legal age of marriage for women is 16 (18 for men), Afghans still largely favour traditional forms of mediation over the country’s legal courts. Particularly outside cities, most Afghans continue to view the formal legal system as corrupt, unprofessional, inefficient and slow. Instead, village councils and tribal elders mete out justice based on religious tradition and mutual agreements. Suraya Pakzad, founder of the Voice of Women Organisation, which runs the shelter in Herat, said a formal court case can take several years and be costly in bribes and transportation to the city. In comparison, traditional mediation is faster and less corrupt. “At least in the informal system, you come up with some solution,” Pakzad said. “It’s easy, it’s cheap and it’s on your doorstep.” For women, however, the informal system does not necessarily provide justice. Economic dependence and cultural pressure prevent many women from seeking divorce or criminal retribution, effectively granting male perpetrators of domestic violence impunity. A recent UN report detailed how the Afghan court system fails to provide access for women, with the result that only 5% of domestic violence cases observed in the report ended in criminal prosecution. According to Human Rights Watch, 95% of girls and 50% of women in Afghanistan’s prisons are jailed for “moral crimes”, such as running away from home to escape a violent husband. That did not deter Fereshteh from fleeing her violent marriage in Nimruz province two years ago, at the age of 12. When her brother eloped with a cousin to marry for love, community elders decided that Fereshteh should be given as reimbursement to alleviate his family’s shame. She married her 27-year-old cousin, who already had a wife and children. She was treated as “a gift to the enemy”, she said, and beaten for two months until her brother, who had escaped to Herat, convinced the police to step in and remove her. Seven months after her divorce was finalised, her former husband continues to threaten her family. “I just want to go to school,” said Fereshteh. “My advice to parents is not to marry off their children. They should ask their children what they want.” International donors have pushed for legal reform in Afghanistan, and are supporting a bill to eliminate violence against women. The law, which would ban underage marriage and protects women’s shelters, has been challenged by some conservative politicians who view the bill as un-Islamic.
Afghanistan has also ratified the UN convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. In its 2014 national action plan on women, peace and security, the UK government pledged to help raise awareness of women’s rights in Afghanistan, “across provinces through workshops and media, and to support human rights defenders working on women’s issues”. Western countries have succeeded to some extent in creating awareness of women’s rights, said Pakzad, who in 2009 was named as one of the world’s 100 most influential people by Time magazine. However, she added, donors and Afghan organisations alike had missed a “golden opportunity” to strengthen women’s rights by neglecting isolated women in rural areas, who might suffer more, in favour of well-educated, urban women’s activists. “If you are healthy, if you are good, we have a workshop for you,” said Pakzad. “There is nothing for the sick people.” Equally problematic, she said, is that men have largely been ignored, although they ultimately are the ones who have to change behaviour and drive societal change. “If you don’t work with [men] and change their perspective, it is not going to go well.” Pakzad said: “We need training in how to deal with traumatised husbands, with traumatised fathers. If you were not traumatised, you would never cut your wife’s nose off or slice her face.” Benefsheh’s brother now recognises that it was wrong of his father to trade his sister so that he could marry. Now divorced, he is working as a labourer in the hope that he will able to support his two sisters outside the shelter. “The girl should be old enough to marry, and should be happy with it,” Benefsheh said.

2015-05-08T12:35:58Z,global-development,Global development,Central African Republic militias poised to sign disarmament agreement,"A senior UN official said he expected armed groups in Central African Republic (CAR) to sign a disarmament agreement during this week’s peace forum, boosting efforts to improve security across a nation torn apart by more than two years of sectarian violence and decades of coups and poor governance. Aurélien Agbénonci, the head of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) in CAR and the secretary general’s deputy special representative, said the UN peacekeeping mission, known as Minusca, was ready to support the implementation of any disarmament accord, and had made this clear to the myriad militia that still hold sway in large parts of the former French colony. “One of the achievements we are expecting from the forum is this agreement on disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR). If [the armed groups] agree to DDR, if they agree to get involved in [Minusca/UNDP-run] labour-intensive work programmes … we will boost the restoration of state authority,” he said.
In March 2013, mainly Muslim Séléka rebels ousted CAR’s president, seized the capital Bangui and installed the first Muslim president, Michel Djotodia. The Séléka terrorised the predominantly Christian population, killing men, women and children until they were forced from power in January 2014 and took refuge in the north. The Séléka killings sparked reprisals by “anti-balaka” Christian militia, who drove out tens of thousands of Muslims from the south. The peace forum, which opened in Bangui on Monday and runs until 11 May, has brought together government officials, Séléka rebels, anti-balaka militias, civil society leaders, international partners and religious leaders to analyse the root causes of the conflict and prepare for elections, due to be held before the end of the transitional government’s mandate in August. CAR’s interim president, Catherine Samba-Panza, who was appointed in January last year, said the forum should allow citizens to define “a new vision of our nation state, a new social contract of values and national cohesion and a global and definitive accord for peace and reconciliation”. Nearly 900,000 people have fled their homes since the crisis started. Fragile health systems have been decimated, preventable diseases like malaria are on the rise, and NGOs are still unable to access some areas because of attacks by roving armed groups who loot and torch homes, hemming terrified people into remote enclaves. Before the Bangui forum, a series of consultations were held across all the provinces to draw communities into the reconciliation process. Agbénonci said this allowed politicians to see at first hand how people outside the capital were excluded and marginalised, and to witness the extreme poverty of their everyday lives.
“At the root, it’s a crisis of poverty, it’s a crisis of mismanagement of resources, it’s a crisis of inequality, of injustice – and then they bring the religious element as an excuse,” Agbénonci said. Landlocked CAR has rich deposits of diamonds and gold, but little of that wealth has trickled down to its 4.6 million people. Agbénonci described the forum as an opportunity for “collective catharsis”, saying it would give a voice to those who lacked one and break a decades-old trend of all dialogue taking place between elites in the capital. In an early result, the UN children’s agency Unicef said on Tuesday that the main armed groups had agreed at the forum to release all children associated with their forces and end any new child recruitment. Between 6,000 and 10,000 children are associated with these militias, including fighters, children used for sex and those working as cooks, messengers and in other roles. The groups have yet to agree on a schedule for the releases, but Unicef said they had agreed to grant access to areas under their control to plan the releases. Agbénonci said the Minusca peacekeepers had played a critical role in re-establishing security. Minusca, working with the UNDP and other UN agencies, had enabled transitional leaders to visit parts of the country where residents had never before seen a president during the pre-forum consultations. However, the role of French troops – sent to restore stability after the 2013 coup as part of Operation Sangaris – has come under scrutiny after a whistleblower disclosed the alleged sexual abuse of children by French soldiers in Bangui. France started withdrawing some of its 2,000 troops this year. Agbénonci said the UN would do everything possible to have the elections held in August as planned. He said the UN integrated electoral assistance team had started electoral mapping this week. “Our objective is to try to make sure we stick to the deadline but we also know that when there is a need to be a bit flexible – common sense will guide people,” he said, adding that a lack of finances was also a problem. A referendum on a new constitution should be held before the elections, said Agbénonci, adding that this would serve as a rehearsal for the parliamentary and presidential ballots. To underline the enormous challenge of rebooting the national identity after a traumatic two years, he described a chance encounter with two presidential candidates in Bangui. He told them he had just been to Ndélé and Bria in the north and east. “Do you know what they told me?” he said. “‘You know, I’ve never been there.’ These are people who want to rule their country – and it’s their right – but they don’t know the real country and the constraints people are facing.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/08/central-african-republic-militias-disarmament-agreement-undp,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/08/central-african-republic-militias-disarmament-agreement-undp
2015-05-08T09:19:05Z,global-development,Global development,Sierra Leone gets back to business as people weary of protracted Ebola crisis | Huw Poraj-Wilczynski,"Behind one of the many tables selling soaps, lotions and cosmetics that line the central streets of Freetown, a woman holds up a compact mirror and uses a piece of cotton wool to dab makeup on her cheek. For a moment, she seems oblivious to the congested streets, the hustling traders and the Ebola warning posters on the wall behind her. She smiles, wipes off the makeup, replaces the compact on the table and disappears into the crowd. “We need to get back to normal life,” Suleiman Sesay says, as he arranges mobile phones on a table across the street. “People are tired of Ebola. It is affecting business badly. For most Sierra Leoneans, what we earn today, we eat tomorrow.” Sesay’s initial fear of catching Ebola has been replaced by the more immediate concerns of feeding his family and paying his three children’s school fees. “The crisis has been going on too long,” he says. “We had to come back to work. That is why we are all out here, even though Ebola is still in our country.” The first case of Ebola in Sierra Leone came to the attention of the World Health Organisation on 25 May 2014. Since then, more than 12,300 people have caught the disease and nearly 3,900 have died. To combat the spread of Ebola, the government implemented drastic measures such as limiting trading hours to 6am until 6pm, quarantining whole districts and enforcing nationwide lockdowns. The rate of infection has since drastically slowed, although there has yet to be a sustained period of zero cases, as in Liberia. However, the emergency measures have also had a significant impact on the economy, especially on farmers and small traders like Sesay. Sierra Leone is ranked 177th of the 187 countries in the UN human development index. Poverty is widespread and few people have savings. Most survive on a day-to-day basis. They run small businesses, buying products cheaper than they sell them for, or engage in small-scale farming. The profits are low but usually enough to get by on. Any disruption to a working day, whether illness or government restrictions, makes it difficult to keep going. “If I can’t work, I can’t earn money,” Sesay says. “Then I have to choose between feeding my family or buying stock. But business is difficult now anyway. No one has money.”
In rural areas, the situation is even worse. Nearly half the working population are involved in subsistence farming. Due to quarantine and lack of freedom of movement, many farmers were unable to plant crops, and those who did were unable to harvest, so produce spoiled. This left farmers and their families without food and without any crops to sell. “Farms have become wastelands,” says Kelfa Kargbo, Sierra Leone country director for Street Child. “The height of Ebola was when families should have been farming. Now there is nothing. It is the children who are suffering most. Particularly the Ebola orphans.” Street Child estimates there are 12,000 children who have lost either their parents or their primary caregiver. They are at risk from malnutrition, trauma and teenage pregnancy, particularly in rural areas. Schools have only recently opened after being shut for a year, but many people are now struggling to afford the fees. Ebola is not the sole cause of Sierra Leone’s economic woes, however. Many issues predate the outbreak. Sierra Leone was devastated by an 11-year civil war that ended in 2002, but by 2013 a commodities-led boom driven by deposits of iron ore, gold, diamonds and rutile had pushed growth to 20%. However, global iron ore prices have since dropped, partly due to a fall in Chinese demand. In January, the World Bank said Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea would lose more than $1.6bn (£1.05bn) in lost output in 2015 alone, more than 12% of their combined gross domestic product.
Last month, President Ernest Bai Koroma told Reuters the three countries wanted international donors to cancel their debts, and needed $5-$6bn over two years – a kind of Marshall Plan – to rebuild their economies. The crisis has also highlighted endemic corruption, with national auditors saying in February that authorities in Sierra Leone had failed to properly account for almost a third of the money allocated to fight the disease. The epidemic drained the health system of resources to deal with other medical issues, which can be devastating to people living on the economic edge. “We have a lot of sickness, not just Ebola,” Sesay says. “I get malaria a few times a year. Everyone does.” According to the World Health Organisation, there were more than 1.7m cases of malaria in Sierra Leone in 2013, resulting in 4,326 deaths. Despite millions of dollars in aid since the end of the war, healthcare facilities were parlous even before Ebola pushed the entire system to the limit. Cholera, typhoid, hepatitis and dysentery are common and infant mortality rates are high. Life expectancy is 46 years – 15 years less than in neighbouring Liberia. Médecins du Monde (Doctors of the World) said last month that during the outbreak more people are thought to have died of malaria than Ebola, and childbirth-related deaths appeared to have increased as well as cases of HIV and tuberculosis. With the healthcare system staggering, and the economy on its knees, life is ever harder for people like Abraham Fornih, a 28-year-old volunteer teacher whose father died from Ebola, leaving him in charge of 15 brothers and sisters.
“Now I have to find food for my brothers and sisters and money for their school fees. I am the eldest, the youngest is one year old. My father used to take care of everything,” said Fornih, who is from Rosint, in Bombali district in the north. Fornih’s family depend on their father’s farm for food and income. They were unable to harvest their crops because Rosint was quarantined for three months. In total, 37 people out of the village’s 327 residents died from Ebola. The birds ate the crops. Now, Street Child, which provides emergency food, seeds and educational grants to help Ebola orphans and their families, is helping Fornih. “Everything was destroyed,” says Fornih. “We need to plant more seeds so we have food at the next harvest. But all the seeds have gone. My brothers and sisters are hungry. They go out to collect wood which we sell at the market.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/08/sierra-leone-ebola-crisis-economy-business-farmers,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/08/sierra-leone-ebola-crisis-economy-business-farmers
2015-05-08T06:00:02Z,global-development,Global development,"In South Sudan, a local radio project is calming community tensions | Meena Bhandari","Julia Ding races down the dirt path: beads of sweat pour down her forehead and her face is contorted with fear. She collapses on to her knees outside Nile FM radio station. A tear rolls down her face. The bullets continue to rain down as staff scramble to lock up the radio station – a large khaki-green tent with a small mast protruding from the top. Humanitarian workers run towards bunkers, while others jump into dried-out ditches for protection.
This was the scene at the protection of civilians (Poc) site in Malakal in South Sudan’s Upper Nile State when fighting broke out on 21 April. The site, which is on the UN base just outside the town, is now a hissing pressure cooker. The Poc is a microcosm of South Sudan’s wider civil conflict. More than 25,000 people from the area’s major tribes are seeking refuge from the fighting; Dinka, Shilluk, and Nuer are all here for safety, shelter and basic services. Ensuring that the wider conflict is not played out inside the PoC has been a priority for agencies trying to deliver services. A quarrel at the water point or in a food distribution queue can quickly escalate.
Getting timely, effective, fair and accurate information to people is critical in keeping a lid on tensions. That is where Nile FM, a project run by Internews’ humanitarian information service, comes in. The service started in Malakal last year as a low-tech “mini-media” offering, providing a 20-minute audio programme “made by the community for the community”. It mirrored a project in the capital, Juba, where programmes are recorded on USB sticks and played on speakers at strategic locations, such as health clinics and water collection points. The speakers are carried on quad bikes, earning the service the name Boda Boda Talk Talk (BBTT), a reference to the local word for “motorbike”. In February, the Malakal service became a fully fledged radio station, sitting alongside other critical humanitarian actors in the Poc. Nile FM uses the same principles as the mini-media service. While traditional news media tells its audience what has happened, Nile FM asks people what they need to know in times of crisis, aiming to deliver “news you can use”. During the fighting in April, Nile FM immediately switched to emergency programming. All live phone calls were stopped and the music selection was cleaned up to avoid potentially divisive songs being aired.
Public service announcements were increased, including a two-minute drama urging children not to climb trees when shooting starts, an explanation of what unexploded objects look like, and a compilation of community voices called People for Peace. Most of the radio’s work focused on reducing tensions. On the second day of fighting, Nile FM staff gathered for a morning news meeting. Ding, who works as a journalist, was back with the team of 10 correspondents, all of whom fled to the Poc during fighting in Malakal last year. When they arrived, some of them had never even opened a laptop and had certainly never conducted interviews. Now the team buzzes with story ideas, drawn from people living in the Poc site. “Everyone is talking about how the youths are going into town to ‘salvage’ goods from the destroyed market. If they go, they should be worried about being forced to join the army,” said correspondent Anthony Thon De Diew, a former child soldier. “Students want to know what will happen to the examination they were due to sit today with the exam paper now inaccessible in town,” says former teacher Lorince Nyawela, another correspondent. With new people arriving daily, everyone is concerned about increased pressure on water services. And they want to know why traders have increased the price of sugar and basic commodities by 90% in just two days.
The humanitarian information service shows that the right information can dispel rumour, reduce tensions and calm communities, who often feel disempowered during conflict and subsequent aid responses. As well as working with communities, the service collaborates with humanitarian agencies, who tend to focus on top-down, one-way communications; the ubiquitous hand-washing posters with the child squatting and using a latrine, telling people what to do without enough evidence of impact. Through the service, aid agencies can listen to local people and tailor their responses accordingly.

2015-05-07T11:31:30Z,global-development,Global development,"Joyce Banda, Africa’s first female ex-president: 'I shall always be proud of what I’ve done'","It isn’t a title necessarily to be proud of: Africa’s first female ex-president. But for Joyce Banda, voted out of office a year ago it speaks volumes about her short, turbulent time in power in Malawi, and the lessons it holds for female leaders everywhere. “You just have to go and look at what’s happening to women presidents now and I don’t know whether that is going to attract women to enter politics because in Malawi my being in politics had a negative effect,” she told the Guardian in a rare interview. “Women decided ‘no, I would rather not join politics. If you end up being a leader and you’re treated like that, then I cannot do it.’” None of this was unique to Malawi or Africa, she continued. “I want to ask you to look across the world. Start with Australia and look at what Julia Gillard went through: she was called a witch, a bitch, a chicken. Go to Thailand and see what the prime minister has gone through: now she’s in court. Go to the Philippines and see what has happened to former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. She was arrested and charged with corruption; everyone who was arrested with her has been released on bail except her, and she’s sick. The matter has gone to the UN.
“From there move on into Zimbabwe, see what’s happening to Joice Mujuru [the former vice-president expelled from the ruling Zanu-PF party]. Go to Liberia and see what Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is going through – even Ebola is her fault. And go to Argentina and Brazil, end up in the US. So I don’t want to talk about myself but it is something a journalist should take a close at look at and form your own opinion. Misogyny not only for Joyce Banda but for women.” Banda’s ascent came abruptly in 2012 when the increasingly authoritarian rule of Bingu wa Mutharika was ended by a fatal heart attack. As vice-president she was constitutionally entitled to succeed him, but when Mutharika’s allies tried to block her she had to rely on the head of the army to confirm her as the first female president in southern Africa. She is one of three the continent has seen: the others – Liberia’s Sirleaf and Catherine Samba-Panza of the Central African Republic – are still in office. She refuses to blame sexism for her losing power two years later and notes that her biggest critics tended to be women. “It is very strange in Malawi,” she reflected. “I was pleasantly surprised, the reception that I got. I don’t remember a single day during the time I was minister of gender, foreign minister, vice-president and president when I saw anything on the part of the men that indicated they were undermining me. “In fact, it was the other way round: I received a lot of support from men in my country, maybe sometimes more than my fellow women. If there were any statements on radio scandalising me or accusing me, it was my fellow women, so I think I would be telling a lie if I said that I faced that in Malawi.” Banda was speaking after a meeting of the Champions for an Aids-free Generation, a group of former African presidents and other influential figures. They signed a declaration that included a focus on adolescent girls and women, “the face of HIV in Africa”. It is one of the international causes that Banda, going back to her activist roots, has been pursuing since last year’s acrimonious election defeat to Bingu’s brother Peter Mutharika.
She has not set foot in Malawi since September. No one is quite certain what will happen when she finally does return home. Her enemies have attempted to implicate her in a multimillion-pound “Cashgate” corruption scandal and, more recently, in allegedly ordering the assassination of Peter Mutharika when he was suspected of plotting a coup to prevent her from taking power. “I am being accused of murder, that I wanted to murder this president the time he was refusing to give up power to allow me take office,” she said. “It came from his mouth: that the former president sent doctors to come and inject him the day he was kept in the police [station]. That is the one [accusation] that is more current and serious now but I don’t care even about that because it’s not possible.” Banda insists that she has no regrets over her handling of the Cashgate affair in which civil servants, businessmen and politicians were put on trial accused of exploiting a loophole in the government’s payment system to divert millions into their own pockets. She says she asked the British government to fund a forensic audit, made publicly available online, that revealed 13bn kwacha (£19m) was stolen in three months during her administration. She also launched an investigation into Bingu’s last three years as president that uncovered the theft of a staggering K92bn (£135m). “The tragedy is the former president was alerted, just like I was, and didn’t take action,” she said. “That is the difference. Therefore, I shall always be proud of what I’ve done, regardless of what you journalists or anybody can say.”
The scandal prompted Britain and other donors to freeze direct aid, which made up 40% of the national budget. Banda added: “The donors have been very clear: ‘We will come back but conduct a forensic audit into the K92bn, we want to know who stole this money.’ At the end of the day it is not the donors that have to be blamed. It is us as Malawians: we are not listening to what the donors want us to do. It is my opinion that that should happen, that the forensic audit should be conducted into the K92bn so we know where that money went.” The former president says she was warned that a crusade against corruption would ruffle feathers and make enemies, but she was determined to stay the course. “You’re fighting strong people and they’ll fight you back, but I was fortunate in the sense that I decided that State House is not the last place I can be. There’s life beyond State House and therefore I will do it regardless because Malawians are the ones that must come first, and that’s what I did. “So they will criticise but all I want you to know as journalists is that you must help this continent: when you find one leader that sticks their neck out to fight corruption, they must be encouraged. At the end of the day it’s not about Joyce Banda, at the end of the day it’s about that ordinary person in the village who must get drugs but she won’t get drugs because money’s been looted.” “I will forever be proud that I did a good job,” she adds, pointing to sharp reductions in maternal deaths as an example. Yet despite all her claimed successes in agriculture, infrastructure, mining, energy and tourism, Banda suffered a clear-cut defeat at the polls. Critics suggested she was politically naive, picking fights with the likes of Madonna, and in a mutual love affair with the west. Banda refuses to comment on whether she thought the vote was rigged, but at the time she chose not to dispute the result to avoid a destabilising standoff. “I decided that I was going to leave State House, and I was going also to step up and step aside so that I give President Peter Mutharika an opportunity to run the country without my interference. “In any case, you can only have one leader at a time.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/07/joyce-banda-africa-first-female-ex-president-interview,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/may/07/joyce-banda-africa-first-female-ex-president-interview

2015-05-06T13:50:52Z,global-development,Global development,"Thailand human trafficking death toll far greater than feared, claims rights group","Human trafficking may have taken place in Thailand on a far greater scale than previously suspected, with dozens of mass graves containing the bodies of victims lying undiscovered throughout the country’s south, according to testimony gathered by a Bangkok-based human rights group. The claim comes after Thai authorities uncovered two graves apparently containing the remains of Rohingya “boat people” brought to remote parts of the country from Burma by transnational criminal syndicates. The discovery of 26 corpses at a mass burial site in Songkhla province on 1 May was followed days later by the finding of two skeletons in a second southern province, Phang Nga. More corpses have since been found close to the original site. But interviews with survivors, brokers and police officials, carried out by the NGO Fortify Rights for a report on Rohingya trafficking, suggest these grim finds may only scratch the surface of a much larger problem in which the Thai government is allegedly complicit. Survivors spoke of regular killings at camps, common graves and torture at the hands of gang members trying to extort money from their families. The Rohingya, a long-persecuted ethnic minority, have been leaving Burma in large numbers since an outbreak of violence in 2012 left neighbourhoods razed and claimed hundreds of lives. More than 100,000 people fled Rakhine state. Many of those who escaped fell into the hands of trafficking gangs that operate within the Bay of Bengal. Stripped of citizenship by Burma’s military government in 1982, the Rohingya have been subject to strict controls governing their freedom of movement, education and right to work. About 140,000 Rohingya now reside in squalid camps for internally displaced people, unable to leave and policed by local security forces that have been accused of a range of abuses. The interviews carried out by Fortify Rights highlight a life of similar misery beyond Burma. One survivorspoke of hundreds of deaths which she alleges occurred during a two-month spell in a large camp in an unidentified mountainous area near the Thai border with Malaysia. “We saw many people die,” she said. “When they died, they put them in a common grave … Sometimes five and sometimes six died at a time. “There were almost 2,000 people there.” In another statement, a 17-year-old Rohingya man who said he was held at a site on the Thai coast, close to the border with Malaysia, said he knew of seven people who died in the camp. “Two people died just beside me,” he said. “They had pain in their chests and then died. We washed the dead bodies, and after that we wrapped on the bodies a little bit of white cloth that we could find and then buried the bodies, two in the same grave. It was difficult to dig because there were rocks. So we just dug a little bit and covered the bodies.” He was unable to identify the location of this grave, as he had been blindfolded when brought to the camp. At another site, a Rohingya woman described a mountain location containing three camps, two of which had been abandoned. She described the brutal techniques deployed by traffickers against their human cargo, intended to induce panic and fear among the victim’s relatives so that they would pay large sums for their release. “We called our relatives and they would beat us and tell us to ask for money. They had pliers and pulled on our ears and breasts. They pulled on the men’s penises. If any babies cried, they would take the baby and the woman aside, hold the woman’s breasts and force the baby to eat,” she said. In another case, a 20-year-old Rohingya man, who was held for five months, described the conditions inside the camp, and the practice of dumping the dead or dying in isolated locations where no one would find them. “There were two camps like this, with 150 in each camp. We had to sleep on top of each other. Some people became sick in the camps after we were there a long time … Some were so sick but were still alive, but they were thrown into the mountain area. “When people died, the guards forced the people to throw the bodies in the mountain area. I saw others do this. It was a big mountain and very high, so the people brought the bodies up the mountain and left them there.” Matthew Smith, the executive director of Fortify Rights, said the accounts were indicative of “a widespread pattern of death, torture, and exploitation, in many cases involving the complicity of Thai authorities”. “The scale of this problem is enormous, and that wouldn’t be news to Thai officials,” said Smith. “The loss of life has been enormous. To say there are dozens of mass graves wouldn’t scratch the surface. We’re not in a position to assess specifically how many mass graves exist, but we have reason to believe it’s far greater than any current estimates. There needs to be a proper international investigation involving forensic teams.” The Thai government has been trying to improve its record on human trafficking, which after a recent parliamentary vote is now subject to the death penalty when victims die. Following the discovery of the grave sites, the Thai police have pledged to investigate the alleged involvement of local officials in trafficking activities, while Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has publicly ordered authorities across Thailand to “to scan every inch of their areas” for more camps. Human rights groups have expressed scepticism about these moves, however. Phil Robertson, deputy director for the Asia division of Human Rights Watch, said: “Denials that the government didn’t know what was going on are simply not credible. The Thai authorities have known about these camps for years, and in fact, senior government representatives admitted that to Human Rights Watch several years ago. It’s an understatement to say that in national government circles there has been a bit of a ‘Don’t ask, don’t tell’ policy about these camps and what goes on in them. “Local officials in the areas where these camps operate, and on transit routes taken to send Rohingya to the camps, have been directly involved and profited by serving as local look-outs and protectors for the camps.” Smith was similarly critical of officialdom. “Thai authorities have been fully aware of the existence of these camps, and they’ve known very well what goes on there,” he said. “We have testimony that places Thai officials in trafficking camps negotiating with traffickers while hundreds of people are held captive. Torture, killings, deprivations, and other abuses have all occurred with impunity. We’ve documented how Thai authorities have ‘rescued’ Rohingya asylum seekers and then sold or handed them to trafficking syndicates, who in turn tortured them.” Heightening deprivations in Burma are driving more people into the hands of the traffickers, said a Rohingya community leaderin Rakhine, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Every single thing is under the control of the authorities,” he said. “The boat drivers, the brokers … always have to negotiate with authorities. Without bribing the security forces [military or police], it is not easy to leave. But people are handed over again to the traffickers in Thailand or [near the] Malaysia border. From there, they will be released by paying around 30 lakhs kyats [about £2,000]. People who cant afford to pay are sold out or killed.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/06/thailand-human-trafficking-mass-grave-burma-rohingya-people,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/06/thailand-human-trafficking-mass-grave-burma-rohingya-people
2015-05-06T12:13:34Z,global-development,Global development,Number of internally displaced people highest 'in a generation',"The threat of violence from new and ongoing conflicts displaced 11 million people inside their own countries in 2014, bringing the total number of internally displaced people (IDPs) worldwide to 38 million, a report has said. Conflicts in Iraq, South Sudan and Syria forced more than 4.5 million people from their homes last year, fuelling an estimated 15% surge in the total number of IDPs, according to the annual report by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) and the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), published on Wednesday.
Last year’s figures show the worst internal displacement “in a generation” signalling that the international community has “completely failed” to protect civilians living in conflict zones, said the NRC’s secretary general, Jan Egeland. Roughly 30,000 people were forced from their homes every day in 2014, according to the study.
Instability in countries like Syria, where a civil war has been raging for more than four years, often forces IDPs to move around their country more than once to avoid violence. In Syria, at least 7.6 million people have been internally displaced, the highest number in the world, and representing 35% of Syria’s population, the report said. Ukraine’s conflict forced at least 646,500 people from their homes in 2014, marking the first time Europe has experienced mass displacement in more than a decade, according to the report. The annual report assesses 60 countries and territories that are involved in international or internal armed conflict, or are experiencing religious, ethnic and political violence, in an effort to identify where the highest numbers of people have been internally displaced.
In 90% of the countries monitored in the report, there were people who had been displaced for 10 years or longer. “The longer a conflict lasts, the more insecure [IDPs] feel and when hopelessness sets in, many will cross borders and become refugees,” said Volker Türk, assistant high commissioner for protection at the UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Until lasting peace is established in countries that are engulfed in conflict, mass migration will continue to take place, forcing migrants to take dangerous risks in the hope of finding a safe haven, said Türk. “As we have seen in the recent past, for example in the Mediterranean, despair drives people to take their chances and even risk dangerous boat journeys.” But serious limitations in data collection mean that the report serves as a barometer and not a comprehensive overview. “Rather than painting a complete picture of displacement in a country, [the estimates] give a general indication of the scale of a number of situations at a given point in time,” the report said. The NRC said that changes in their data collection methods led to “dramatic adjustments” in this year’s data on internal displacement. Data for the report is provided by governments, NGOs and the UN, it said. The NRC also cautioned that data collection can vary from country to country, which can affect their estimates. It said: “Due to differences in reporting by our sources, in some cases our new displacement figures reflect the total number of people displaced during the year, whereas in others they reflect only the number of people that remained in displacement at the year’s end.” It added: “With very few exceptions, comprehensive data does not exist. It may be available for some but not all areas of a country, or it may be collected for some but not all of the factors that determine an overall caseload. Such factors include the number of IDPs who have returned, integrated locally or settled elsewhere, and the number of those born or who have died in displacement.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/2015/may/06/number-of-internally-displaced-people-highest-in-generation-report,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/datablog/2015/may/06/number-of-internally-displaced-people-highest-in-generation-report
2015-05-06T06:00:06Z,global-development,Global development,Building a new Nepal: why the world must heed the lessons of Haiti | Prospery Raymond,"Watching footage of the devastation caused by the Nepal earthquake has brought back vivid memories of the moment, five years ago, when my office in Port-au-Prince collapsed around me during a catastrophic 7.0 magnitude quake. I will never the forget the dust, darkness and despair that threatened to overwhelm me as I was trapped for two hours in the ruins of Christian Aid’s Haiti headquarters. For those affected by the 7.8 magnitude earthquake in Nepal, I have nothing but compassion and empathy. I have seen first-hand the extent of the pain and suffering brought by a disaster of such scale. Perhaps it’s not surprising that people are already beginning to draw parallels between Nepal and Haiti: both are among the world’s poorest countries lacking the infrastructure, resources and capacity to deal with such a crisis. Some commentators have already urged the international community not to “make the same mistakes” it made Haiti after the January 2010 disaster. As both a seasoned aid worker and a Haitian, I know the well-documented challenges of the post-earthquake efforts: problems around distribution of supplies, the influx of foreign aid agencies, the subsequent cholera outbreak and the countless debates over what happened to the £6bn pledged by foreign donors. However, Nepal is not Haiti, and 2015 is not 2010. Nepal has its own context, its own culture. The impact of each disaster is different. The Haiti earthquake killed approximately 220,000 people, displaced 1.5 million and destroyed or damaged 300,000 buildings. The death toll from the Nepal disaster is considerably lower, but a greater number – eight million people – have been badly affected. Nevertheless, there are some lessons we learned in Haiti that could be put to use in Nepal. The media focus on search and rescue distracts us from the real needs: shelter, food, water, medication. In Haiti, our focus was similarly misplaced. In the immediate aftermath of the 2010 disaster, constant coverage of specialised rescue teams created the impression that large numbers of people were being saved by outside help. In fact, according to a Haiti evaluation report, no more than 130 people were rescued from the rubble by international search-and-rescue efforts, described as a “tragically low” figure in a disaster in which hundreds of thousands were trapped. (As it happens, Haitians saved more than 5,000 people, myself included). Since 2010, the Haitian diaspora has contributed more than $10bn (£6.6bn) to the post-earthquake recovery, for instance through remittances. The media reports did not reflect this reality. Likewise, in the coming weeks and months the media needs to tell the whole story in Nepal. Rather than depicting foreign aid agencies as the only “heroes”, they must highlight the solidarity and support given by the Nepalese.
Regrettably, one major obstacle to the initial relief effort in Haiti was the lack of synchronisation and collaboration between foreign agencies and Haitians. For instance, central coordination meetings hosted by the UN were conducted in English – in a French and Creole-speaking country. This prevented many Haitians from participating effectively in the recovery process. In Nepal, all efforts must be made to conduct operations, taskforces and UN clusters in the local language, with such groups co-led by local institutions. The international community and NGOs must support them in delivering aid – and as part of this they need to consider when will be the best time to exit. Much of the billions of dollars pledged by foreign donors bypassed the Haitian people and government. Haitians were largely excluded from key decisions over how this money was spent. A tiny percentage of donor funds for reconstruction work was given to Haitian firms and local NGOs: it’s estimated that less than 0.6% of relief funds were channelled through Haitian hands. This must not be allowed to happen in Nepal. International donors agencies need to reduce the level of requirements for releasing aid funds and ensure contracts are made with local businesses, not international companies, where possible – so that the learning stays within the country. Donors agencies in Nepal should work closely with local organisations, NGOs and authorities, whatever their perceived limitations. Sadly, the lack of Haitians’ inclusion in the global relief effort has been one of the main obstacles of the past half-decade. Some, like the Inter-American Development Bank, are now taking steps to reverse this trend. Many INGOs are already doing an excellent job – including those belonging to the Disasters Emergency Committee. But I would urge all NGOs to focus their efforts on quality not quantity, and to resist the urge to set up new organisations in order to support the country. Take it from me: it doesn’t work.
Recent days have seen criticism of the Nepalese government’s speed and approach to the response. However, it’s easy to underestimate the overwhelming impact that a disaster like this has on all local structures, governments included. That’s why NGOs must work with the government to ensure they have the right systems in place to coordinate efforts effectively, supporting them to prevent pitfalls such as corruption and to facilitate the delivery of the right support to those who need it most urgently. In the meantime, I’d encourage careful thought to be given to health issues too. Some may think that vaccination against epidemics is not a priority now, but extreme vigilance is needed. The cholera outbreak that killed more than 8,000 people in Haiti in 2010 could have been avoided. If the past five years have demonstrated anything, it’s the importance of linking immediate and interim relief and rehabilitation work to longer-term development goals – Nepalese citizens must be empowered to participate in decisions over their own sustainable development. After a disaster of such magnitude, the task of reconstruction is never easy. Even in Haiti, the rebuilding work continues: more than 85,000 people still live in temporary camps. Full recovery takes time, and the same will be true of Nepal in a few years, after the photographers, film crews and aid agencies have moved on. As one Haitian blogger wrote this week, in his own letter to Nepal: “You are not victims – you are survivors … Your brothers and sisters in Haiti are here to tell you that the ground will stop shaking, the dust will settle, and you will live on to build a new Nepal.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/06/earthquake-building-a-new-nepal-why-the-world-must-heed-the-lessons-of-haiti,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/06/earthquake-building-a-new-nepal-why-the-world-must-heed-the-lessons-of-haiti
2015-05-05T14:07:38Z,global-development,Global development,"South Sudan leaders putting country's future at 'grave risk', warns John Kerry","South Sudan’s promising future is “at grave risk of being squandered” because its leaders have failed to reach a lasting peace deal to end a bloody civil war more than a year after negotiations began, US secretary of state John Kerry has warned. Millions of lives are at risk of escalating violence and food shortages after fresh clashes between forces loyal to president Salva Kiir and those aligned to his former vice-president Riek Machar broke out last month in the country’s Upper Nile and Unity states. The International Crisis Group said the recent fighting, which has displaced more than 14,000 civilians, is the most serious violence the country has seen since August last year. South Sudan descended into civil war in December 2013, after Kiir accused Machar of plotting a coup. The war has caused the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians and displaced more than 1.5 million people within the country. About 520,000 people have fled to neighbouring countries. “With each day, the ranks of the hungry and the malnourished grow,” Kerry said on Monday during an official visit to Kenya. “And none of this had to happen, but it did happen because the country’s leaders failed to act on behalf of the best interests of their people and their nation.” Kerry said the US would give $5m (£3.3m) towards a justice mechanism to hold perpetrators of South Sudan’s violence to account, and urged other international donors to contribute. April’s bloodshed caused food security levels to slide in Upper Nile, Jonglei, Unity, Warrap, and Lakes states, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha). The conflict is wreaking havoc on South Sudanese livelihoods as people can’t move freely around the country and are prevented from trading, planting crops and taking care of their livestock.
Diplomats and aid agencies have urged warring factions to “urgently” form a binding peace deal to prevent further violence and avoid a looming food crisis. About 3.5 million people – nearly 40% of South Sudan’s population – will require emergency food assistance by June, according to the famine early warning systems network (Fews Net). Several ceasefires have failed to end the country’s conflict, provoking frustration from the US, which in February presented a UN draft resolution threatening a global travel ban and assets freeze. In a UN report leaked to Reuters, UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon said South Sudan’s leaders have “failed to see beyond their personal ambitions”, and threatened the imposition of sanctions on both sides. The Intergovernmental Authority on Development (Igad), which is leading peace talks in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, said that “90% of differences” between the warring factions have been solved, but serious disputes remain. In response to the deadlock, Igad has announced a “different and innovative approach” to solving the conflict that will bring in Britain, China and the US, as well as other African mediators.
Christos Stylianides, the EU’s commissioner for humanitarian aid and crisis management, said: “Having just returned from South Sudan, I am more concerned than ever about the deadlock of the peace talks and the intensification of fighting. These have terrible humanitarian consequences.” A “substantial reduction” in violence would immediately improve humanitarian access and allow aid agencies to distribute food supplies, Ocha said. But aid agencies remain sceptical that a peace deal will be formed in the coming weeks and warn of serious humanitarian consequences if fighting continues. “We are quite concerned that the security situation will deteriorate,” said Juan Prieto, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) head of mission in South Sudan. “The rainy season is coming and that’s a very worrisome factor for us, especially because of [the prospect of] cholera.” Heavy rains are expected to hit the country in June, making it difficult to traverse road networks and deliver food supplies. The number of South Sudanese people requiring humanitarian assistance has increased by about 500,000 over the past year, but aid agencies say they are finding it harder to reach communities in areas hit by violence. The UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) said it had suspended humanitarian services in Akoka and Fashoda counties in Upper Nile State following the disappearance of three WFP staff members and their vehicles while transporting food supplies from Malakal to Melut on 1 April. At least 10 aid workers have been killed or abducted in Upper Nile State since the conflict began. In the past, clinics and hospitals across the country have been looted and destroyed during the fighting. But combatants have not attacked MSF’s medical facilities over the past few months, Prieto said. Stylianides said: “Humanitarian aid saves lives but it cannot solve the crisis. A sustainable peace agreement is urgently needed.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/05/south-sudan-leaders-john-kerry-future-grave-risk,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/05/south-sudan-leaders-john-kerry-future-grave-risk
2015-05-05T13:12:03Z,global-development,Global development,Open thread – will foreign aid affect how you vote in the UK elections?,"As the UK general election looms and political leaders try to woo undecided voters, could party policies on foreign aid and development sway your vote? While domestic policies have dominated much of the public discussion leading up to the election, the main parties have also made clear their intentions on foreign aid. The Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party all promised continued support for spending 0.7% of annual gross national income on international aid in their party manifestos. The Green party went a step further, pledging to increase the aid budget to 1% of gross national income over the course of the next parliament. In the opposite direction, Ukip pledged to reduce aid by more than two-thirds and to abolish the Department for International Development (DfID), deeming it “wasteful”.
Youth ambassador for the advocacy group ONE and first-time voter Elena Wilson, 20, said foreign affairs was an important issue for young voters and deserved greater attention. “Relatively little has been said about Britain’s duty to the rest of the world,” Wilson said. “Unfortunately, it appears that international development is just an add-on, a compulsory box to be ticked when drafting manifestos.” But Wilson, who has been canvassing her local candidates for their thoughts on foreign aid, said the issue would sway her vote. “I’m just one example of people my age working to influence wannabe MPs – after all, we’ll be the ones voting for them. Amid the mayhem, we need to know that these politicians will commit to their promises to development, so whichever party is able to convince me of this will certainly be getting my vote.” We want to hear from you – will foreign aid and development be on your mind when you go to the polls this week?

2015-05-05T09:37:10Z,global-development,Global development,Nepal earthquake: how to donate,"A second earthquake has hit Nepal, of 7.3 magnitude, as the country attempts to recover from the 7.8 magnitude quake that hit just weeks ago. Aid agencies have been in the country delivering vital supplies and planning the rebuilding process, and are now on-hand to assist after the latest quake. The UK’s Disasters Emergency Committee launched an appeal to support survivors two weeks ago which has raised more than £50m. Here is a roundup of some of the agencies that have opened appeals for earthquake survivors. This list is not comprehensive, so feel free to highlight others in the comments section below. ActionAid The agency has reached more than 48,500 people so far with emergency aid including food, medicine, tarpaulins and hygiene kits. ActionAid aims to scale up its outreach over the coming months, including plans to build “safe spaces” for women and children who can be particularly vulnerable after natural disasters. How to donate British Red Cross As well as providing much-needed supplies including food and emergency shelter, Red Cross volunteers are searching for survivors through the rubble of collapsed buildings. The organisation also has a recently built blood bank in Kathmandu, providing blood to help injured survivors. How to donate
Cafod Catholic aid agency Cafod has committed £50,000 to respond to the emergency and has launched a £3m appeal. Cafod’s local partners are providing food, shelter kits and emergency supplies to people in need, including many who are taking shelter in churches. How to donate Care Care aims to assist 100,000 people with temporary shelter, ready-to-eat meals, water purification and toilet construction. “All of the particularly vulnerable – children, breastfeeding mothers, people with chronic diseases – they have been suffering a lot. It’s essential to get help to these people as quickly as we can,” says Santosh Sharma, Care’s emergency response coordinator in Kathmandu. How to donate: UK, International Catholic Relief Services Working with Caritas Nepal, CRS plans to assist 10,000 families with emergency shelter, blankets, water treatment kits, and hygiene kits. The agency has stocks of emergency aid in nearby Bihar, India, which is now on its way to Nepal for distribution. CRS has made an initial commitment of $825,000 to relief efforts. How to donate Christian Aid Christian Aid is working with its partners based in Nepal to reach survivors. Its sister agency Lutheran World Foundation Nepal is helping to coordinate emergency supplies for the government-run camp, while local organisation PGVS is distributing 100,000 water purification kits that Christian Aid has provided.
How to donate Handicap International Handicap International has supplied equipment to hospitals in Kathmandu and sent support teams to care for the injured. The agency is working to reduce the risk of permanent disabilities among survivors, while supporting the most vulnerable people caught up in the disaster. How to donate International Medical Corps International Medical Corps workers are providing emergency care to survivors, as well as delivering much-needed medical supplies. The organisation has opened a mobile medical unit in Ghorka, near the earthquake epicentre, with plans to expand to other affected areas. How to donate Islamic Relief The organisation has disaster response workers assessing the needs of survivors and will be providing food, shelter, water and other items such as hygiene kits and kitchen sets. How to donate Oxfam Oxfam is providing basic essentials to survivors and will build sanitation facilities in temporary camps in partnership with Unicef. “Our priority is to ensure that people affected have adequate humanitarian assistance and we are able to prevent secondary disasters, including outbreak of disease, by providing safe water and critical sanitation support,” says Zubin Zaman, deputy director of Oxfam India. How to donate: UK, International
Plan The charity says it is stepping up efforts to support 7,000 families with shelter kits including tarpaulins, mattresses, mosquito nets and blankets. Plan’s UK chief executive, Tanya Barron, says some rural communities outside the epicentre have had consecutive nights without shelter. “These remote communities are what are causing us most concern,” she says. “It’s clear when you move around that people are struggling to improvise shelters, and with more rain expected this is something we need to urgently address.” How to donate: UK, International Save the Children The charity aims to raise $50m to assist with aid efforts in Nepal. Workers have begun delivering tarpaulins to survivors in Kathmandu and baby packs in the Bhaktapur district, which include children’s clothes, blankets and soap. More assistance is on its way to the hardest-hit regions outside Kathmandu Valley, including Gorkha and Sindhupalchowk. How to donate: UK, International Tearfund Tearfund staff and partners remain in Nepal with a focus on shelter, food and sanitation. Teams have been trekking over landslides and mountains to reach remote communities impacted by the quake. How to donate Unicef The agency says it is focusing on water and sanitation, nutrition, education and child protection. Unicef has already delivered oral rehydration salts and zinc supplements to people gathered in informal settlements, and is providing tents for field medical facilities. Two cargo flights with a combined 120 tonnes of humanitarian supplies are also on their way. How to donate: UK, International Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) VSO is raising funds to support its existing programmes and to recruit skilled volunteers to help communities recover. This includes emergency education spaces for children, sending highly skilled healthcare professionals to hospitals and for trauma counselling, and damage assessment in remote areas. How to donate WaterAid WaterAid is working with its local partners to provide emergency water supplies, hygiene kits, water purification tablets and emergency trenches for sanitation. “Our immediate priority is to work with our partners to assess what is most needed in the communities where we work, and how we can help prevent outbreaks of waterborne diseases including typhoid and cholera,” said Girish Menon, WaterAid’s deputy chief executive. How to donate: UK, International We Help Nepal This is a network of international and Nepali development workers and activists with over a decade of direct disaster relief experience. Through connections with local organisations in Kathmandu and surrounding areas, these people know where support is most needed in the region – and how to get it there. The group is focused on supporting small- to mid-level grassroots organisations that have the capacity to support locally led disaster relief and recovery. Immediate funding will go towards emergency supplies (food, tents, water purification, assisting camps in Kathmandu neighbourhoods). In the longer term, they will turn to promoting self-reliance, supporting projects that are sustainable and will bring hope in the years to come. How to donate World Food Programme WFP is delivering food and emergency supplies to affected areas. It is also providing logistical support for other aid agencies via a relief hub at Kathmandu’s international airport, including electricity communications facilities, storage space and office buildings. How to donate World Vision World Vision is planning to respond in its initial phase to 50,000 people, meeting basic needs by providing first aid kits, sleeping mats, blankets and jerry cans, and temporary shelter. The agency will also set up three child-friendly spaces so children have a safe place to play and recover from trauma. How to donate: UK, International American Jewish World Service The agency is funding its Nepalese partners to provide medical assistance and emergency food and supplies to affected communities. AJWS says it is supporting vulnerable groups who could be disproportionately affected, including Tibetan refugees, the Dalit community, people in remote regions, people with disabilities and LGBT people.

2015-05-05T08:42:10Z,global-development,Global development,Water and sanitation in health centres in Mali – podcast transcript,"Participants: LL Lucy Lamble MDD Mamadou Diarafa Diallo MM Maggie Montgomery VB Vinima Baya F Fatouma BAM Boubacar Abida Maiga BD Baka Diarra EPA Elly Prosper Arama DB Daniel Bouàré AID Adama Issa Diarra LL Welcome to this edition of the Global Development podcast. This month we’re in Mali. MDD One of the biggest causes of child death through diarrhoea, through pneumonia and others is lack of access to water, water and sanitation and lack of hygiene. LL A recent WHO report looked at water, sanitation and hygiene, also known as Wash in health centres. Mali was one of the worst performers. MM This is a huge issue and, as as the report has detailed, we have upwards of almost 40% of facilities without any water access at all. And it became apparent that this was an issue that the health sector wasn’t necessarily addressing.
MDD The water is probably for two hours a day or three hours a day, so the rest of the time we ask, “So if you have to help a woman to deliver what will you do?” “We’ll still do it.” “So how?” LL This is Lucy Lamble. And this month on the Guardian’s Global Development podcast we look at how health centres in Mali are affected by this problem. I visit the rural village of Diatoula and a clinic in the town of Kalabancoro; and I also go to a school in Bamako where they’re implementing a water and sanitation programme. But first let’s hear more from Mamadou Diarafa Diallo, country representative for WaterAid in Mali. MDD In preparation of our water and healthcare facilities project I had visited a few healthcare centres. We went to this big CSRef [a referral health centre]; the CSRef is the second level healthcare facility where they do most of the surgeries. Basically they have water between 7am and 9am. After that no water. So they would just have some small bowls where they keep a little bit of water here and there. I just take care about water. We are not taking care about have you soap, or have you any other? Just simply having access to water. And when the head doctor took us to the latrines he said, “These latrines, I can’t go in. You can if you want to but I can’t go in.” They are smelly because they are pit latrines – they are filled, with no resources to empty the pits. So I think it reflects what has been happening, what is really happening; because that’s not even at community level it’s a second-stage level of a healthcare facility. LL So we’re just coming into the village now, Diatoula. It’s a rural community of about 1,000 inhabitants so quite a big community really. Male speaker So this is the chief. They’ve come to say hello to you and they’re going to visit the village and also the health centre. So you are welcome here. LL The health centre is staffed by just one pharmacist and one nurse who both live nearby. Vinima Baya is the centre’s nurse. VB So generally all those who come to us are pregnant women; women who are ready to give birth and also malaria patients come to us a lot. When we need water we have to go to the traditional well which is far from here. Patients and pregnant ladies who come to us need to ask someone in their family to go to collect some safe water somewhere. They have to go to the well five times. We need five buckets of water for the work. Once we receive the water we clean the mother, we wash all her garments and then we try to clean the room. We also give her some water for drinking. I don’t know the number of latrines in the village but here in the health centre we have two. We have one where we go to wash ourselves and the other is just for our needs. There is no ladies; everyone uses both.
LL Maggie Montgomery is from the World Health Organisation. MM That’s a really important time when infections can occur and there’s high risk to both the mother as well as the child in terms of delivering in an environment that doesn’t have clean tables, where those that are facilitating the birth aren’t using clean scalpels to cut the delivery cord. So there’s really high risk involved when these Wash services aren’t in place. And there’s of course all of the emotional and psychological issues of, as a woman, not having access to a toilet or not being able to wash yourself after this really important moment in your life. F My name is Fatouma. I am 16 years old. I grow vegetables and sell them in the village here. I used to have a baby but unfortunately he died. When my baby died he was 15 days old exactly. I came with my family members. We had water because we had gone to collect it from the traditional well in the village so there was water at my disposal and I didn’t have any special complications. MM So there was a new review that just came out last month, an individual bulletin that found upwards of 40% of newborn deaths are linked to sepsis and these are all, for the most part, preventable infections, many of which link to lack of water or safe hygiene practices. F I noticed he was not feeling good. He didn’t eat anything, he didn’t drink anything, he couldn’t do anything. I tried to give him some traditional medication. And I could see black spots on his body. One day later he died. So it took only one day. LL Boubacar Abida Maiga is the WHO Wash consultant in Mali. BAM There’s a very important link between mortality rate and Wash today because one of the main causes of infant and mother mortality is infections. And to avoid that we need good sanitation and good health. So for us it’s very important that we put at the disposal of health centres all the necessary tools and products that they need in order to promote and also be able to practise Wash in a very efficient way. So the World Health Organisation has been working a lot with the Ministry of Health of Mali to reduce infant mortality and encourage the community to observe Wash. Jointly we’ve put in place a plan to help the community. LL There are NGOs such as WaterAid, Unicef and Oxfam working here to get Wash facilities in place, but one major barrier is the cultural aspects associated with something as simple as hand washing, for example. BAM Of course, there are still many social barriers that are making the work very difficult. For example, in some communities some people still think that by washing their hands with soap they lose part of their traditional power. LL Baka Diarra is the president of the health centre here. BD So we are in a rural area. It’s not easy to actually do some promotion activities because there is no light, there is no TV. I mean the community members can see something on TV and then when you come to talk to them about it they already have a global idea. But here when you come to talk about those things people are going to find it weird, they don’t understand what you are referring to. So this makes it very, very, very difficult. LL Maggie Montgomery from the World Health Organisation. MM There’s some really interesting work that’s going on around creating habits and one of those habits is hand washing. Some of this has to do by looking at what are the determinants of psychological behaviours and how can we influence those factors that suggest someone is more or less likely to wash hands. So there’s the whole idea of norms, you know, if other people are doing it then someone is more likely to do it; the whole idea of self-advocacy – do I know how to do it? And also the idea that it just becomes a culture and something that is not only encouraged but almost seen as if you don’t do it you’re not a healthy respected person. I think also there was perhaps a disconnect in places where the burden of disease, especially communicable diseases is quite high, there sometimes is a perception that the risks are very low, and that there are so many risks that why should I engage in this one behaviour as I’m also drinking contaminated water and my food may be contaminated. LL Mamadou Diarafa Diallo from WaterAid again. MDD We are working on getting some evidence-based communication tools that will work on what the evidence is on the ground, what the culture says and how you can use that and turn it around. Use the opportunity of Ebola and other tragic suggestions and say you should probably there is a need to change for that. LL Mali’s been able to contain its isolated cases of Ebola, but what’s happened elsewhere in west Africa where countries have faced widespread outbreaks is that there’s been an obvious shift in the Wash culture among communities. MM They’ve transformed many of those communities into hand-washing communities, and now you see hand-washing stations almost everywhere. People are washing their hands quite frequently. So hopefully it doesn’t take something as awful as Ebola to change behaviour; but I think having the infrastructure as well as creating a culture of hand washing are two ways that such changes can come about.
LL Today we’ve come to visit the health centre in Kalabancoro Extension Sud, the south extension. It’s just outside Bamako in a neighbouring district called Koulikoro Cercle de Kati, about 10 kilometres from the centre of Bamako. Elly Prosper Arama is president of the centre and is also a consultant at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Development. EPA So the community is made of all the components of the Malian population. For example, I am Dogon so we have some Dogon families and some Bambara families, some Fulani families and so on. So all the different components of the population of Mali are represented here. LL The centre is brick-built and very well maintained. It’s something the community is extremely proud of. They started fundraising in 2007 and were able to open in 2013 with a doctor, a nurse, a midwife, a pharmacist and an excellent association that does its best to keep funds flowing. Doctor Daniel Daniel Bouàré is the doctor here at the health centre. And his own thesis was on the impact of the lack of adequate water and sanitation on mortality rates for children under five. He explains the situation with hand-washing facilities in the centre. DB Throughout the centre you’ll see in most of the rooms – the consultation room, the delivery room, the laboratory and all the other major rooms – you’ll see some hand-washing kits. And we also encourage people to wash their hands at the entrance before they get into the centre. We’ve put in place a team that takes care of cleaning the place in the morning to make sure it’s kept safe. And we keep encouraging people to wash their hands with soap even at home. LL In Bamako, the capital, there are Ebola awareness campaigns everywhere – on billboards, on radio and television, even as you enter businesses. But here, further away from the outbreak, it’s a little more difficult to enforce hand washing. DB I recognise, to be honest, that since the moment everyone said there were no more cases in Mali, I think everyone stopped doing it. But I promise I will take initiatives to relaunch the process of washing hands because we’re still hearing cases, say, in Guinea, and so maybe we should just keep on. And this will be a good incentive for the community to keep washing their hands at home. Also the government has given us some material in order to wash our patients’ hands. And this material is used here at the centre. LL The WHO advocates seven main basic standards for Wash and health centres. Here’s Maggie Montgomery. MM Certainly for water there must be supplies onsite so we’re not saying that people should be walking 500 metres to go and obtain water. The amount of water really depends on the type of services that the healthcare facility provides and our recommendation is anywhere from five to 400 litres per patient per day. So five would be something for just outpatient small facilities that are doing vaccinations and maybe general check-ups. For a cholera facility, for example, you would need 50 litres of water per person per day. I think for deliveries it’s about 100 litres per delivery and for Ebola it’s upwards of 300 litres per person per day. On water quality the standards follow the same standards we have in the guidelines for drinking water quality, but essentially it should be free of faecal contamination. And there should be some kind of residual or disinfectant such as chlorine in the water to ensure that there’s no recontamination happening. Sanitation there should be toilets for staff and for patients and there should be gender separation so women and girls can have their own private facilities. In terms of medical care waste, which often seems to be something that’s neglected, there needs to be some kind of system in place for safely separating, for example, sharps from some other types of waste and then destroying that waste, either through incineration or autoclaving. The hygiene standards on hand washing and obviously we advocate for either water and soap or hand rubs, which is something that our infection-prevention colleagues have worked diligently on at all points of care. AID So this school has 4,500 students. LL That’s a lot in one place. AID My name is Adama Issa Diarra. I am the director of this school, whose name is School F. So this school is part of the Wash in School programme set up by WaterAid. Before this water facility was put in place the situation was very, very, very catastrophic because first of all students used to pee everywhere. They used to go for open defecation. There wasn’t any sanitation as such and it was very, very difficult. And of course this used to bring some diseases. LL As we make our way to the rear of the school we can see rows of latrines and in this school they’ve got clearly designated areas for boys and girls. AID It wasn’t easy at the beginning so the change came step by step because people were used to, let’s say, some other practices; both at school and also at home and they didn’t understand how to start. So we had to really insist, keep on telling them and continue training students at school. And also even sometimes go to families and finally people started understanding and now it works. Not all the families have access to safe water and here we are, let’s say… When you try to dig a well, wells are very deep and it’s not easy and it costs a lot of money and not everyone has the means for that. So having access to safe water is a big problem, a big challenge here. So one key problem is students that come very dirty to school because first of all they don’t have even enough safe water for drinking, so we don’t even talk about washing themselves or washing their clothes. So this is why, as you can see around you, many kids are very dirty. And this is something that happens daily. LL The schools Wash project we visited in Mali seems to be working. But in the village they’re facing basic infrastructure problems which limits access to safe water. AID Ourselves we built, let’s say, a well but we’ve taken all the safety measures to help safe water. But we are not linked to the official adduction system. The government’s contribution is to set up the facilities. Once the facilities are in place there is the company called Somagep [Société Malienne de la Gestion de l’Eau Potable], which is a company for managing safe water in Mali. We still don’t have that official system of providing safe water. Most of the people are just connected to small water points which are not sufficient for the community. But we hope this project will be put in place soon. MM At a bigger infrastructure scale, of course, this requires securing safe water supplies, whether it be through bore holes or through the piped water supply or even rain water catchment which could offer at least a seasonal opportunity to obtain water. LL Mamadou Diarafa Diallo from WaterAid again. MDD So most of the health centres where we went most of them they do have probably a water point, but the water is probably for two hours a day, or three hours a day. So the rest of the time we ask, “So if you have to help a woman to deliver what will you do?” “We’ll still do it.” “So how? Do you have gloves? Do you have anything to sterilise? Is it ordinary?” “Yeah it’s ordinary.” MM So we’re advocating that there are some steps that healthcare facilities can immediately take. For example, making sure that within the delivery room even if there’s not piped water available that there’s clean covered buckets with soap and water available so equipment can be cleaned, tables can be cleaned. There’s at least water available for hand washing and safe water for drinking. LL But Maggie Montgomery is the first to agree that to implement even simple Wash measures there needs to be awareness at the health centres about the minimum standards and clarity about who’s in charge of ensuring they’re upheld. MM Most facilities have structures in place, they are just not maintained. And so a second thing is making sure that within the healthcare facility there is someone whose job is to make sure toilets are cleaned, that the doors are not locked so patients can access them, and that there is water for hand washing after using the latrines. LL The success of WaterAid’s Wash in Schools project has provided a tangible model. The NGO is now taking this to healthcare centres to help get them engaged. MDD Through this project to do a good advocacy which now has resulted in the fact that the government has decided to include Wash in the curriculum of the teacher training school, which they didn’t have before. So the primary school teachers and secondary school teachers will be now trained in Wash so that they will do Wash as a subject in the schools. LL We’ve had quite a tricky time as a team finding anyone at the department or ministerial level who’s prepared to do interviews. So what’s it like trying to work with a government and hold those responsible to account here? MDD Very, very challenging. For the past two years it has not been a very stable government so I don’t think they are really a government that has stayed more than 12 months. So you are always coming back to a new minister saying, “Can you remember your predecessor signed the commitment, he said he would put 5% of the budget on this?” “Really? I’m not aware of it.” “OK.” This is difficult because of the context, because there was a reconstruction agenda, so I think donor money was more directed in building up a strong army, buying more weapons, preparing more for any terrorist attack. LL Getting the government to come on board with the schemes is an important part of the advocacy work for organisations like WHO. AID The WHO has always worked with the government of Mali to focus on some very important aspects such as Wash. In practice, Wash is shared by many ministries. There are also many government organisations who have special responsibilities concerning promoting Wash in the field. Many partners are working in the field to promote Wash and also help communities understand it and accept it. LL Evidence is obviously key here and yet the WHO report found that data about health centres was almost non-existent. MM Even the data that does exist is largely from the African region and we find that there’s lots of inconsistencies about how Wash access is monitored and very little done in looking at aspects of quality and functionality in the reliability of supply. Mostly, not all countries have health management information systems, and ensuring that Wash is included in those is really important because in our review we actually didn’t find a single monitoring information system that included Wash. WHO and Unicef have committed to taking on this aspect of the monitoring work that they’re already doing in communities for the next round of the sustainable development goals. So I think having regular reporting and reflection of that data will also help to not only improve the quality of the data but also to improve our understanding and where we really need to focus effort. LL WaterAid Mali is also doing what it can to collect data through its Wash in Schools programme. MDD We just have to give more attention to that, and like I said as an NGO also get evidence, show a model that works. That could be very simple because some of the things are just technically the design has not been good enough to make it work. So if you have water between 7 and 9 and you know it, why don’t you get something where you can start the water, where you can get a better design, the technical designs work, the social intake – prioritisation is not there. MM This needs to be an issue that’s taken up at the health sector. If it’s always seen as a Wash problem and a Wash issue it won’t be sustainable. We’ve found just in the short amount of time since the report was released in March we’ve had a lot of positive feedback and we’ve had countries, for example, like Ethiopia, India, Zambia, Sierra Leone committing to be early adopters. So early adopters in terms of strengthening the standards and supporting implementation of those standards but also making sure that there’s the financial and human resources. LL So awareness of the issue is growing and with the Sustainable Development Goals imminent could this finally be the moment where both finance and political will make health centres, like those here in Mali, as safe as they should be?

2015-05-05T08:15:36Z,global-development,Global development,British mothers twice as likely to die in childbirth as Polish women,"Women in the UK are more than twice as likely to die in pregnancy and childbirth as those in Poland, Austria or Belarus, according to Save the Children. For the third year in a row the UK failed to make the top 10 of the charity’s annual State of the World’s Mothers report, coming 24th – up from 26th last year – in the list of the world’s best places to be a mother. A child born in the UK is also more than twice as likely to die before the age of five as in Iceland or Luxembourg. The UK has a child mortality rate of 4.6 per 1,000 births, while Iceland’s rate is 2.1 and Luxembourg’s 2.0 per 1,000 births. The UK, which has not made the top 10 since 2012, also came behind debt-stricken Greece as well as Spain, Slovenia and Israel. Norway topped the list while Finland and Iceland came in at second and third. The US is behind the UK in 33rd place. The report found that women in the US have a one in 1,800 lifetime risk of maternal death – the worst performance of any developed country in the world. In a ranking of child survival in 25 capital cities in the world’s wealthiest countries, Washington DC came last. The next worst were Vienna in Austria and Bern in Switzerland. Somalia remained in the bottom spot for the second year running. All but two of the 11 bottom-ranked countries in the world are in west and central Africa. The 2015 report found that women in the UK face a one in 6,900 lifetime risk of maternal death. In Poland the figure was much lower at one in 19,800, while in Austria it was one in 19,200 and one in 45,200 in Belarus. Obesity, IVF, social deprivation, multiple pregnancies as well as increased maternal age and poorer access to healthcare, especially in some ethnic minority communities and among asylum seekers, are linked with high-risk pregnancies in the UK. Save the Children International’s chief executive, Jasmine Whitbread, said: “We urgently need to close the gap in life chances for mothers and children so that no matter where they live, everyone has a fair chance to survive and fulfil their potential.” The Save the Children report – which, among other sources, uses data from UN agencies – ranks countries on five key factors: risk of maternal death, under-five mortality rate, educational status, economic achievement and political status. It also looks at the maternal and child health gap between rich and poor living in some of the major cities in the world. “For the first time in history, more than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas,” said Whitbread. “People are often drawn to cities by the prospect of a better life for their children, but many cities around the world are unable to keep up with breakneck growth, leaving hundreds of millions of mothers and children in cities without access to essential health services and the clean water they need to survive and stay healthy.” The report found that although some countries had been successful in saving more mothers and their children, the gap in survival rates between rich and poor was vast. The 10 countries showing the greatest survival divide between wealthy and poor urban children were Rwanda, Kenya and Malawi – where survival gaps have roughly doubled – as well as Cambodia, Vietnam, Peru, India, Madagascar, Ghana, Bangladesh and Nigeria. However, a number of cities are increasing survival rates for even the poorest mothers and children, including Kampala (Uganda), Addis Ababa (Ethiopia); Cairo (Egypt); Guatemala City (Guatemala); Manila (the Philippines); and Phnom Penh (Cambodia). “If the world’s going to complete the task of ending preventable child and maternal deaths, we have to find better ways of getting healthcare to urban populations, regardless of income,” said Whitbread. “For babies born in many of the world’s fast-growing cities, it’s survival of the richest.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/05/uk-behind-greece-spain-and-slovenia-in-list-of-worlds-best-places-to-be-a-mother,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/05/uk-behind-greece-spain-and-slovenia-in-list-of-worlds-best-places-to-be-a-mother
2015-05-05T06:00:07Z,global-development,Global development,"Afghanistan, domestic violence and divorce: one woman's harrowing story","Seventeen months after Setara’s husband cut her face and chest with a knife, disfiguring her for life and only narrowly failing to kill her, the laws of her native Afghanistan have still not allowed her to divorce him. The reason is not because anyone disputes what happened to her. Throughout their marriage, Setara’s husband, a drug addict, would demand that she bring him 5,000 Afghanis daily (£56) to sustain his habit. “Where is a woman supposed to get that kind of money from?” asked Setara, who goes by one name. The night in December 2013 when her husband lost control began as any other. “He was laughing, I prepared food for him, and we went to sleep together,” Setara recalled. But in the early hours, in a fit of rage possibly fuelled by drug withdrawal, Setara’s husband attacked her with a rock and hit her unconscious. Setara woke up when he was cutting off her nose with a knife. As she fought back, he stabbed her chest, slashed her lips and continued to beat her until she lost consciousness again. The next time she woke up, she was being dragged, bleeding and throbbing, outside. Alerted by the turmoil, her four children awoke and managed to chase the husband away. He went on the run and reportedly joined insurgents in Herat’s Shindand district. But though she hasn’t heard from him since, Setara has still not been able to get a legal separation.
Like many Afghan women in rural areas – and 80% of the country’s 700,000-plus internally displaced people – Setara doesn’t have an identification card, or tazkera, a requirement for having a divorce plea handled in a court of law. To obtain a tazkera, an Afghan woman needs consent from her husband or father, which can prove particularly problematic in cases of domestic abuse. Setara, though, had a stroke of luck. Her case came to the attention of a local attorney and also the Spanish army, which helped her to undergo surgery in Turkey and Spain. When she came back to Herat, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), an NGO, offered legal counselling and obtained her an identification card so she could start her divorce process. Even then, her father, also a drug addict, demanded 500 Afghanis (£5.60) for verifying her identity. Despite what happened to her, Setara said her father has no regrets about selling her off to her husband at the age of seven. “My father said, ‘It was your destiny.’ He even warns my mother that he will [do] something even worse to her,” she said. In Afghanistan, the vast majority of women who experience domestic violence don’t seek a legal divorce, partly due to economic dependence on their husbands and cultural pressure to keep families united. As a result, only 5% of cases involving violence against women surveyed by the UN in a recent report ended in prosecution in a formal court. Even for women who do file for divorce, the process is exhausting. “The right of divorce is with the man,” said Gulsum Sediqi, an activist with the Civil Society Institution Network in Herat. “He can divorce her any time, without reason. But women can’t divorce unless her husband doesn’t give her food or clothes. “If she is beaten, it has to be proven by two witnesses, and the process can take more than a year.” The lower part of Setara’s face is covered by deep lacerations running in a crude web from her nose to where her lips used to be. When we met, her black chador was pulled back to allow a side-sweep of dark hair to cover a scar on her forehead; the bottom of her face was covered with a piece of black cloth. She still has more surgery to go, and asks for her scars not to be photographed, but her face will forever remain a mark of a youth spent largely in misery. Unlike most others in her situation, however, Setara has a second chance. In about a month, her case will pass through the third and final legal stage, the supreme court in Kabul, finalising her divorce. Few will be able to follow her example. NGOs provide what little legal counselling there is, and their resources are limited. A long-delayed government plan to conduct a nationwide census and equip citizens with biometric identification cards remains elusive, despite the millions of aid dollars spent.
In rural areas, the lack of government offices and cultural barriers present further obstacles. “Customarily, men don’t want to take tazkera for their women. They say it’s not right to take women to a government office who will take their picture and put it on a piece of paper,” said Mohammad Abdoh, a legal advisor with NRC in Herat. “They say it’s a shameful act.” Setara lives alone with her youngest child, while her three oldest children are in an orphanage, out of reach if her husband appears to claim custody, which is his legal right for boys over seven and girls over nine. She lives off small donations and neighbours are afraid to talk to her, she said. But she is safe, and able to secure a better future for her children. “I filed for divorce for the sake of my daughters,” Setara said. “I have seen no happiness in my life but I want my daughters to, and I want them to achieve things in life”.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/05/afghanistan-domestic-violence-divorce-one-woman-harrowing-story-setara,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/05/afghanistan-domestic-violence-divorce-one-woman-harrowing-story-setara
2015-05-04T13:00:04Z,global-development,Global development,"EU development finance needs 'completely new approach', report says","The European Union needs to adopt a “completely new approach” to development finance and switch its focus from merely providing funding to devising and supporting policies that have a long-term, transformative impact, a new report argues. The European Report on Development 2015, published on Monday, suggests that official development assistance (ODA) should be viewed as a catalyst rather than an end in itself as the world prepares to agree the sustainable development goals (SDGs). “The vision of global development is at a critical juncture, and the need to move beyond ‘business as usual’ is stronger than ever,” it says. The report notes that the development finance landscape has changed significantly since the UN agreed such landmark initiatives as the millennium development goals (MDGs) and the 2002 Monterrey consensus, which pledged to triple aid to the poorest to help rich countries hit the target of spending 0.7% of their incomes on foreign assistance. It calls for a fundamental rethink of development policy in the run-up to three key meetings this year: the financing for development conference in Ethiopia in July, the UN general assembly in September – where the SDGs will be agreed – and the UN climate change conference in Paris in December.
“The main message is that finance alone will not be sufficient to promote and achieve the post-2015 development agenda,” says the report. “Policies also matter. Indeed, they are fundamental. Appropriate and coherent policies will ensure that finance is used effectively to achieve results and that it is not wasted or underused. Good policies will also help to ensure that more finance is mobilised as success breeds further success.” The study – entitled Combining Finance and Policies to Implement a transformative Post-2015 Agenda – concludes that the biggest hurdle for the agenda is not a shortage of funds but rather the lack of focus on how finance is mobilised and used. Huge progress could be made in reducing poverty, it argues, if domestic tax revenues in developing countries were raised in a way that supported sustainable development.
Equally important, says the study, is attracting private capital, which, although often abundant, is “highly selective” about where it flows and what it funds. “Achieving the SDGs will require the mobilisation of resources from private sources including foreign direct investment, bank loans, bond issuance, equity and other risk capital and private transfers as well as the use of risk-mitigation instruments,” says the report. It adds that mobilising and getting the most out of private resources will require “a supportive investment climate and complementary use of public policies and finance”.
The report suggests there should be four elements underpinning the new thinking on the relationship between finance and policies: consideration of all types of finance (public, private, domestic and international); recognition of the role of complementary policies, both national and international; a focus on long-term enablers, and a transformative post-2015 development vision. Since 2002, it says, finance options for developing countries have changed dramatically because of a 272% rise in domestic public revenues, a 114% rise in international public finance flows, a 415% rise in private domestic finance and a 297% rise in private international finance. Given the changing situation, it says, more emphasis should be placed on building national and local public capacities, improving transparency, information and accountability, and achieving “policy coherence” so that finances are not wasted because of competing policies in different sectors. It identifies six areas that are key to sustainable development, stressing the importance of local governance, infrastructure, human capital, biodiversity, green energy technology and trade. That focus, adds the report, “contrasts starkly with outdated views that ODA or finance alone can directly achieve sustainable development outcomes”. Speaking at the launch, Neven Mimica, the EU commissioner for international cooperation and development, said the post-2015 agenda was one of the union’s major priorities. “Eradicating poverty and achieving sustainable development are two of the most pressing challenges facing the world today,” he said. “They are also fundamentally interlinked: there can be no poverty eradication without sustainable development, and vice versa. Today’s report is a valuable research-based and independent contribution to our thinking and to the global debate on the post-2015 agenda.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/04/eu-development-finance-needs-completely-new-approach-report-says,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/04/eu-development-finance-needs-completely-new-approach-report-says
2015-05-04T08:00:09Z,global-development,Global development,"Indigenous Amazonians fear eviction from Lima, their home for three decades | Dan Collyns","Twenty years ago, Lima’s 2,000 Shipibo-Konibo people lived, as they had done for generations, in the verdant forest along the broad Ucayali river, deep in the Peruvian Amazon. Today, they live under the San Cristóbal hill that hunches over the capital, and on the rubbish-strewn banks of the Rímac river, which for most of the year is little more than a filthy stream. Originally displaced in the 1990s by the Shining Path’s Maoist insurgency, the indigenous Amazonians are now facing another upheaval. Lima’s leftist former mayor, Susana Villarán, had promised to move the 226 Shipibo-Konibo families from Cantagallo, a ramshackle collection of wooden shacks built on a former landfill site behind an outdoor iron-monger’s market, to a new riverside plot with pre-fabricated homes, electricity and running water. But Villarán’s ambitious $74m (£49m) “rio verde” (green river) programme – of which the Shipibo-Konibo relocation was a part – has been scrapped by her successor, Luis Castañeda. Villarán had envisaged the initiative as a way to bring a splash of green to the traffic-jammed, smoggy heart of Lima and refresh the capital’s neglected waterway. It was also intended to mitigate the impact of the building of the Vía Parque Rímac – a new trunk road connecting Lima to its nearby port, Callao. Castañeda has reversed several of the policies brought in by his predecessor and arch-rival, abandoning her transport reforms and ordering the street art created during her administration to be painted over. The Shipibo-Konibo fear their new homes will be the next casualty of Castañeda’s agenda. “Our worry is that this mayor doesn’t consult the people, the residents, the indigenous people living in Lima,” said Ricardo Franco Ahuanari, a Shipibo-Konibo leader. The community is also unsure if they will be allowed to stay on the land on which they currently live in Cantagallo. “We’re afraid that at any moment he could present us with an eviction letter and our people don’t have any where else to go,” said Ahuanari. The city’s deputy mayor, Patricia Juárez, who engaged in brief but inconclusive dialogue with the Shipibo-Konibo delegation, insists the “doors of the town hall are open until we find a solution which satisfies everyone”. But the community is far from satisfied with what it calls the municipality’s “delaying tactics” , and has accused the authorities of failing to provide them with the right information. They fear the city won’t buy the $4.7m plot of land earmarked for their new home in nearby San Juan de Lurigancho because Castañeda has said he will instead use the money to build a bypass on a busy avenue in central Lima. Villarán is equally incensed. “I feel very angry and very sad because this was not a promise by Susana Villarán as a person, or as a mayor, but a commitment from the municipality of Lima,” she said. “This unique indigenous community is affected by a major infrastructure project so they have the right to be compensated.” The Shipibo-Konibo – whoare one of Peru’s largest Amazonian tribes, numbering 20,000 – have been living in Lima for three decades and the Cantagallo community was officially recognised by the government in 2000. “My sisters came with six families in the 1990s faced by the threat of the Shining Path in the upper Ucayali,” said Franco Ahuanari. “In 1998 the whole community uprooted and we arrived in Lima in 2000. Many more brothers came from different villages.” A steady stream followed, settling in Cantagallo to produce and sell their distinctive textiles and paintings in the geometric style known as Kené, which represents their cosmovision seen through shamanic ayahuasca ceremonies. The community’s bilingual school was recognised by Peru’s education ministry in 2012 and the community features on the country’s ethnolinguistic map. The Shipibo-Konibo people are also registered on Peru’s database of indigenous groups.
In an open letter, the country’s human rights ombudsman , Eduardo Vega, said the municipality was obliged to deliver the trust fund set aside for the purchase of the new land and also urged it to “confront with real urgency the relocation of a vulnerable indigenous community rather than create mistrust amid the affected population”. Peru’s Legal Defence Institute (IDL) – a human rights NGO – has gone further, arguing that the breaking of the agreement is a violation of the indigenous group’s constitutional rights. Isabel Urrutia, one of IDL’s lawyers, said the institute was prepared to take legal action against the municipality on behalf of the Shipibo-Konibo. Although they no longer live in their native territory, some legal experts consider the community fulfils most of the requirements to be registered under the International Labour Organisation’s Convention 169, which was signed into law in Peru in 2011. The convention is designed to protect indigenous rights by granting them the right to be consulted about investment projects on their land. “The only condition is to belong to a people which was here before the Spanish, maintain part of their institutions; their culture, their language, their education, their art, their social organisation and finally the question of identity, and one can see that they fully identify themselves as indigenous,” said Urrutia. Shipibo-Konibo women – dressed in pastel colours and Kené-patterned skirts, and selling their jewellery and fabrics – are a common sight in downtown Lima, though many tourists do not realise the Amazonians live behind Lima’s grand Plaza de Armas, the main square that houses the government palace and the cathedral where the bones of the conquistador Francisco Pizarro lie. Although the Shipibo-Konibo have clung on to their language and traditions in the sprawling city of 10 million inhabitants, they insist they are now part of the living fabric of Lima. “We Amazon indigenous people enrich Lima’s living culture,” said Juan Agustín Fernández, one of the community’s activists. “We’ve been here for more than 30 years and we deserve to be treated decently; we’re not passing through.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/04/indigenous-amazonians-fear-eviction-from-lima-their-home-for-three-decades,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/04/indigenous-amazonians-fear-eviction-from-lima-their-home-for-three-decades
2015-05-03T08:00:01Z,global-development,Global development,Central African Republic facing chronic healthcare crisis as scars of conflict abide,"More than two years of sectarian violence have decimated already fragile health systems in Central African Republic (CAR), leading to a rise in preventable diseases like malaria among families still hiding from armed groups in the bush, according to the head of a medical charity. Laurence de Barros-Duchêne, head of mission in CAR for Médecins Sans Frontières, said disease was wreaking havoc as armed groups that torch homes, rob and loot hemmed people into remote areas. When those affected finally got to health centres, they were already severely ill, she said. “The insecurity really slows down the delivery of aid,” explained De Barros-Duchêne, “notably in the most sensitive areas like Batangafo in the north and in Kouango [near the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo] … Children have not been vaccinated for two years, the levels of malaria are unbelievable.” The UN has warned that the situation in one of the world’s poorest countries risks becoming “the largest forgotten humanitarian crisis of our time” as the plight of 2.7 million people needing aid fails to loosen donor purse-strings. Despite the ongoing insecurity, efforts are being made to heal the scars left by a conflict that effectively cut CAR, which has a population of 4.6 million people, in half. A national reconciliation forum is due to start in the capital Bangui on Monday to prepare the ground for elections later this year. De Barros-Duchêne said the conflict had exacerbated years of neglect in a country that ranks 185th out of 187 in the UN’s human development index despite rich natural resources, such as diamonds and gold. “This crisis has destroyed what little was left. Lots of healthcare facilities have been destroyed, lots of healthcare personnel have left the health centres. The level of healthcare was very, very bad before but now it is almost non-existent,” she said. “Malaria is the main cause of death here, but it could be treated very easily if it were caught on time. The problem is that when patients, especially children, arrive, they are already in a critical state and require hospitalisation.” Nearly 900,000 people have fled their homes since December 2013, with about half crossing into neighbouring countries and the rest seeking shelter within CAR. De Barros-Duchêne said militias were still engaged in “scorched earth” campaigns, burning villages so that terrified residents had nowhere to call home and no fields to cultivate for food. Despite the scale of the crisis, and its duration, CAR has rarely made headlines in the way other humanitarian crises have. That changed last week after French soldiers were accused of sexually abusing starving and homeless children in Bangui during their military intervention at the start of the crisis. A leaked UN report revealed the alleged sexual abuse of 10 boys aged eight to 15 at a camp for displaced people. The French president vowed to show no mercy if soldiers were found guilty of the charges. French soldiers were sent to CAR in 2013 after mainly Muslim Séléka rebels ousted the president, seized the capital and installed the country’s first Muslim president, Michel Djotodia. The Séléka terrorised the majority Christian population, killing men, women and children until they were forced from power in January 2014 and took refuge in the north. The Séléka killings sparked reprisals by “anti-balaka” Christian militia, who drove out tens of thousands of Muslims from the south. France started withdrawing some of its 2,000 troops this year, handing over to a UN peacekeeping force, known as Minusca. According to the UN’s Financial Tracking Service, the CAR appeal has received only 14% of the $613m (£402m) needed this year, leading UN officials to urge the world not to turn its back on the country. “We must prevent the Central African Republic from becoming a forgotten crisis,” Claire Bourgeois, the UN’s humanitarian coordinator, said in late April, adding that the money received so far would not cover “the minimum of what is needed to meet the huge humanitarian needs”. There are also more than 460,000 refugees from CAR in Chad, Cameroon, Congo-Brazzaville and the DRC. In April, MSF started an emergency intervention in Kouango after more than 20,000 people fled across the Ubangi river to the DRC because of fresh fighting. “We found a catastrophic situation that mirrored the rest of the country … It’s the same thing we have been seeing everywhere but because they did not have any access to healthcare, the situation was more acute,” said De Barros-Duchêne. Bourgeois said that families in CAR needed help to rebuild their livelihoods, while international partners must also provide support for the judicial system to ensure there was no impunity for atrocities. In April, CAR’s national transitional council adopted a law to set up a special criminal court to investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity carried out since 2003. The draft law must now be enacted by the head of state, Catherine Samba-Panza, who took over as interim president in January last year to shepherd the country towards elections, scheduled now for August. The peace forum is meant to bring together Séléka rebels, anti-balaka militias, trade unions, journalists, citizens who have fled their homes, political parties and religious leaders to examine the reasons for the violence and start the painful process of rebuilding trust in a country long plagued by coups, rebels and unscrupulous leaders.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/03/central-african-republic-chronic-healthcare-crisis-malaria-msf,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/03/central-african-republic-chronic-healthcare-crisis-malaria-msf
2015-05-01T17:01:40Z,global-development,Global development,Coverage of sect tragedy underlines how far Angola is from press freedom | Rafael Marques de Morais,"On 16 April, police and defence forces killed scores of pilgrims on Mount Sumi, in Angola’s central highlands, to avenge the deaths of eight police officers, allegedly at the hands of members of a Christian sect known as the Seventh Day in the Light of the World. The tragedy underscores the extent to which the government endeavours to control the flow of information on the case, undermining the free press. In a botched operation, the police officers were killed as they attempted to arrest the sect leader, José Kalupeteka, during worship. More than 3,000 followers, from many parts of the country, had camped at Mount Sumi, in Huambo province, for the sect’s summit. The sect is an offshoot of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church. Members have opted to live in seclusion while awaiting the end of the world. Angola’s foremost cartoonist, Sérgio Piçarra, has shown in his work how press freedom became a casualty as well. In Piçarra’s illustration, Mount Sumi is cordoned off with barbed wire, and there is a signpost that reads: “The access of strangers to this mountain is forbidden”. Next to it, an angry government official is accompanied by a police officer, whose finger is already on the trigger of his gun. The official is scolding three individuals on the other side of the fence – a parliamentarian from the main opposition party, Unita, a man carrying a briefcase representing an independent inquiry, and an ordinary citizen – who are not allowed on the mount. “Massacre? But haven’t I told you that we have killed only 13 guys?” screams the official at the three individuals. As in art, so in life: the area and surrounding villages remain sealed off by the military and police, with the free circulation of people in and out of the area effectively suspended. Using the state media, the government is imposing its own version of the story – the only version with nationwide outreach – while demanding that everyone else provide evidence to the contrary, even though it is not allowing independent journalists and civil society members near the site. The authorities have been adamant in claiming that the police killed only 13 “snipers” who shot at them. Articulated through the state media, the official version of events has insinuated that Unita and unspecified foreign forces are behind the sect. President José Eduardo dos Santos has labelled the sect “a threat to peace and to national unity”; as the commander-in-chief, he justified the actions of the defence and security bodies. State media has trumpeted Dos Santos’s vow that Angola’s security forces will “continue with the same vigour to completely dismantle this sect”. Despite the climate of terror in Huambo, I have been able to speak, via telephone, with a number of police and military officers who participated in the raid. They all told me how pilgrims were mown down indiscriminately, many of them praying to the end. They all gave accounts of how makeshift shelters were set alight with people inside. There were also stories of police officers sparing women and children who escaped down the mount but were unable to elude the manhunt that ensued. These officers also told me how they bore witness to the filling of mass graves, dug by an excavator, in the nearby village of Cuassamba. I heard too that the witch-hunt was broadened to several areas beyond the mount, where the sect seems to have a strong following. I reported the arrest of 18 hawkers in the city of Huambo for selling CDs of Kalupeteka, who is a popular gospel singer. Their whereabouts are unknown. I also reported on the killing of 52-year-old Eduardo António in the village of Catata, in the vicinity of Mount Sumi, on suspicion of being a member of the sect. The police took with them his herd of 27 cows. My sources were also swift in telling me about a further 30 people gunned down in the same village on 27 April. As I expressed disbelief, after 10 days of following leads, one officer who toured the area met me face-to-face. He told me he wanted to sound the alert on a “massacre still in progress”, and the need to stop it. He echoed what another military officer, unbeknown to him, had told me: “Our colleagues, even many from the police forces, are at pains with this action. Those killed were not enemies, but our people. The orders were to be obeyed.” I obtained first-hand information about how the intelligence services were searching the phones from the personnel involved in the operations to delete any videos of the event. As I am currently on trial for exposing precisely such abuses, I feel a sense of grief and powerlessness. Independent journalists like myself are few, and on the margins of the mainstream media. How to speak of a free press in a country where the overwhelming majority of journalists work for the state, and are used, at will, as weapons against the freedoms enshrined in the constitution? With the growing economic crisis threatening to erode popular support for the ruling People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola, the state media is being used as a flamethrower to legitimise brutal repression and political violence in Angola.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/01/angolan-sect-police-shootings-world-press-freedom-day,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/01/angolan-sect-police-shootings-world-press-freedom-day
2015-05-01T11:13:45Z,global-development,Global development,Coffee catastrophe beckons as climate change threatens arabica plant,"Cultivation of the arabica coffee plant, staple of daily caffeine fixes and economic lifeline for millions of small farmers, is under threat from climate change as rising temperatures and new rainfall patterns limit the areas where it can be grown, researchers have warned. Arabica, which has long been prized for its delicate and aromatic flavour, accounts for 70% of the global coffee market share. But it is particularly sensitive to temperature increases, which reduce its growth, flowering and fruiting and make it more susceptible to coffee pests. With global temperatures forecast to increase by 2C-2.5C over the next few decades, a report predicts that some of the major coffee producing countries will suffer serious losses, reducing supplies and driving up prices. The joint study, published by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) under the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), models the global suitability of arabica cultivation to see how production will be affected in 2050.
It predicts that Brazil, Vietnam, Indonesia and Colombia – which between them produce 65% of the global market share of arabica – will find themselves experiencing severe losses unless steps are taken to change the genetics of the crops as well as the manner and areas in which it is grown. Dr Peter Läderach, a CCAFS climate change specialist and co-author of the report, said that although some countries would be able to mitigate the “massive impact” of climate change by simply moving their coffee to higher, cooler areas, it was not an option for everyone. “If you look at the countries that will lose out most, they’re countries like El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras, which have steep hills and volcanoes,” he said. “As you move up, there’s less and less area. But if you look at some South American or east African countries, you have plateaus and a lot of areas at higher altitudes, so they will lose much less.” Without new strategies, says the study, Brazil alone can expect its current arabica production to drop by 25% by 2050. “In Brazil, they produce coffee on the plains and don’t have any mountains so they can’t move up,” said Läderach. “What they would have to do is look for adaptation strategies. This study shows that we urgently need to start breeding new varieties and adapting growing practices, like putting in shade to decrease temperatures. But the problem in Brazil is it’s very mechanised and if you put trees there, they won’t be able to bring the machines in.” However, he said, even those countries with higher altitudes were likely to find themselves struggling to make up for lost land because the needs of coffee cultivation would have to be weighed up against the preservation of forests, nature reserves and national parks. Although Indonesia, which is expected to see its arabica cultivation areas cut by up to 37%, could move production to higher areas, they tend to be home to indigenous communities and biodiverse environments. “If you don’t have good, rigorous laws in place, people are just going to start going up and chopping down the forest, which would then jeopardise all the downstream benefits that people receive, such as water and carbon sequestration,” said Läderach.
Coffee, the second-most traded commodity after oil, is grown by an estimated 25 million farmers in more than 60 tropical countries, making it a key source of revenue for many developing nations. Läderach said that failure to find new and better ways to grow arabica would have serious consequences for both humans and the environment. “If you look at Burundi or Uganda or Nicaragua, they depend very heavily on coffee, so they’d miss all that income for the development of their countries,” he said. “Environmentally, because it’s an agro-forestry system, it brings a lot of benefits like biodiversity and soil and water conservation, and erosion control.” Although developing hardier coffee strains, planting more shade and encouraging farmers to grow other crops would help compensate for the losses wrought by climate change, said Läderach, there were no quick or easy solutions. “Breeding new varieties takes years: coffee systems are not like arable crops, where this year you do beans and the next year you do cassava,” he said. “It takes three to five years before you can even harvest coffee for the first time. It’s a long lead time, which is why we’re pointing out that it’s very crucial to start developing strategies now.” Läderach said the challenges ahead were so great that they demanded the combined efforts of farmers, scientists, governments and businesses. “Climate change is going to have a massive impact, so we need to emphasise that the sector – and everyone – has to work together, or everybody will lose out,” he said. There is, however another possibility: with Brazil and Central America forecast to suffer most keenly, arabica production could be shifted not upwards but further eastwards, to Africa, Asia and the Pacific. But while such a move could revolutionise the coffee industry, it is far from risk-free. Dr Tim Schilling, executive director of World Coffee Research, which is funded by the global coffee industry, has his doubts. “There’s competition for land among other cash crops in Indonesia and the Pacific, and it is unknown whether Africa could build the necessary capacity in terms of politics, business climate, supporting institutions and infrastructure,” he said. Schilling believes technology may yet be the best bet for coffee growers, suppliers and drinkers. “For me, it all says brace yourselves for higher prices. The only glimmer on the horizon is the ability to change the coffee plant so that it produces decent coffee and yields under a climate-constrained environment.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/01/coffee-catastrophe-beckons-as-climate-change-threatens-arabica-plant,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/may/01/coffee-catastrophe-beckons-as-climate-change-threatens-arabica-plant
2015-05-01T06:00:05Z,global-development,Global development,The best books on Ethiopia: start your reading here,"Cutting for Stone by Abraham Verghese In 1954, a young Indian nun working at a mission hospital in Addis Ababa dies while giving birth to identical twins. Their father, a well-respected British surgeon, disappears, abandoning the boys. Fortunately for the twins, the two doctors who deliver them become their loving, adoptive parents. This big, bittersweet, beautifully written novel, set mostly around the hospital, follows the family’s fortunes over five decades. As the boys come of age, Ethiopia’s turbulent politics – executions, rebellions, coups – play out sometimes on the periphery of their personal story and sometimes at its very centre. The “elder” twin, Marion, narrates the tale, at the heart of which is an act of betrayal that breaks the strong bond between him and his brother Shiva. When political events take a dangerous turn, forcing Marion to flee to New York, he finds himself becoming entangled with his past and forced to come to terms with it. Verghese, an acute observer, vividly evokes life at the hospital and in the bustling capital. He delivers a page-turning, emotionally absorbing tale – despite a surfeit of medical detail (the book’s title is a phrase from the Hippocratic oath). The Ethiopian-born author is a doctor who lives, writes and teaches medicine in the US. This, his first novel, has sold more than a million copies. Beneath the Lion’s Gaze by Maaza Mengiste Mengiste’s novel of the early years of Ethiopia’s revolution begins in 1974 as student demonstrations and famine lead to the overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie by the military. She creates an intimate portrait of an extended family, and it is through their eyes that we see the revolution unfolding – and descending into chaos and brutality. Hailu, a respected surgeon in Addis Ababa, and his elder son Yonas, a university professor, prefer to keep their distance from Ethiopia’s violent and dangerous politics. But the younger son, Dawit, is determined to be politically active. Initially, he is a student protestor against the emperor and supports the Marxist junta. Later, when the military begins to crush dissent and sow terror, he becomes a brave and dogged opponent of the regime. Dawit recalls his mother telling him that “hope can never come from doing nothing”. When the military forces Hailu to treat a young woman who has been horrifically tortured, a decision he makes causes him and his family to be swept up in the political storm. This compassionate, tightly woven tale immediately draws the reader into its unfurling domestic and political drama. It’s an impressive literary debut. Mengiste’s family left Ethiopia when she was a child; she now lives in the US. Notes From the Hyena’s Belly by Nega Mezlekia Mezlekia’s powerful and poignant memoir recounts his coming of age in the turbulent decades straddling the ousting of Haile Selassie. Born in Jijiga, a city where Amhara Christians and ethnic Somali Muslims live in “a multicultural mixing bowl”, he has fond recollections of family life and early schooldays. However, the best of times in childhood is followed by the worst of times in adolescence as Ethiopia endures famine, civil war, repression and war with neighbouring Somalia. As his political awareness grows, Mezlekia joins student protests calling for land reform. But the struggle is to be “long and treacherous”. His first spell in prison, where torture is routine, is at 14 – followed by many more. In 1977-78, the Marxist military rulers unleash their “Red Terror”, leaving 100,000 young people dead in the carnage. With “the revolution eating Ethiopia’s children at an alarming rate”, Mezlekia, at 18, joins an armed rebel group. Ethnic tensions within the group eventually force him to leave, and he slips back into civilian life. Despite the harsh realities, Mezlekia tells his story – and the story of his country – with wry humour, interspersing facts with folktales. It’s a gripping insider’s insight into contemporary Ethiopia. Both his father and his beloved Mam meet violent deaths. Miraculously Mezlekia survives, leaving Ethiopia for Europe and then Canada, where he lives today.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/booksblog/2015/may/01/best-books-ethiopia-start-your-reading-here,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/booksblog/2015/may/01/best-books-ethiopia-start-your-reading-here
2015-04-30T15:47:16Z,global-development,Global development,"Yemen conflict must end without delay, demand female peace activists","A letter demanding an immediate end to hostilities in Yemen was delivered to 10 embassies in The Hague on Wednesday. Delegates from the Women’s Power to Stop War conference, held in the city this week, delivered letters to the embassies of Britain, the US, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Yemen, Russia, China, Germany, Egypt and France, and to representatives of the European commission in the Netherlands, outlining seven demands. The letter called for an immediate end to fighting, and to the transfer of arms to Yemen. It called for safe access for humanitarian aid agencies to deliver vital goods and services, and safe passage for the thousands of people who have been displaced by the fighting. The letter also demanded that those who have violated international law be held accountable, and called for governments to negotiate a lasting peace, based on the outcomes of the 10-month consultation – the national dialogue – that sought to avert conflict in the country in 2013. There was also a call for international governments, and the newly appointed UN envoy to Yemen, to engage with Yemeni women and civil society activists. The move followed an impassioned plea for action from the Yemeni activist Amal Basha during the three-day conference, which was organised to mark the 100th anniversary of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF).
“We are showing solidarity. We have got together a statement to deliver to 11 countries that were party to the national dialogue in Yemen, before the whole thing got out of control,” said Sameena Nazir, the president of WILPF Pakistan and vice-president of WILPF’s executive committee. Twenty-one women were selected to deliver letters to each of the embassies, a nod to events after the congress of women held in The Hague in 1915, which led to the creation of WILPF. Delegates from that meeting visited the embassies of countries engaged in the first world war to demand an end to the fighting. “In honour of our 100th anniversary, the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom convened in The Hague to continue to discuss and debate the causes of war and how to reach peace. We heard from our sisters in Yemen and the conference has requested that the following statement be brought to your attention for urgent action,” read the letter. “The world is failing in Yemen. The world cannot be complicit. Yemen has been betrayed by the international community. The peaceful transfer of power has been undermined by external interests. Violence and war has been unleashed and fuelled from the outside. The human cost is incalculable.”
Following recent air strikes by Arab states, the humanitarian situation in Yemen has been described by the International Committee of the Red Cross as catastrophic. The UN said more than 1,000 people had been killed since the bombing campaign began at the end of March. The Arab coalition, led by Saudi Arabia, wants to flush out Iranian-backed Houthi fighters and restore the presidency of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who has fled the country. Saudi Arabia has announced an end to its bombing campaign, but Reuters news agency reported that aid flights had been blocked by continued bombing. The final day of the WILPF conference, which brought together more than 900 peace advocates from around the world, including four Nobel peace laureates, ended with a recommitment to challenge multinational systems that encourage war, and to campaign for complete disarmament. Radhika Coomaraswamy, who is leading a UN global study on women, peace and security to mark the 15th anniversary of resolution 1325, which calls for women’s full participation in peace processes, told delegates the UN had “gone away from its core vision, that it should be a place for turning swords into ploughshares”. “The main focus on the UN should be to find non-violent ways to protect,” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/30/yemen-conflict-end-female-peace-activists-the-hague,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/30/yemen-conflict-end-female-peace-activists-the-hague
2015-04-30T12:26:34Z,global-development,Global development,Students Speak: Volunteer holidays can be a powerful tool for development | Carla Kweifio-Okai,"Volunteering abroad on short-term aid projects has become a rite of passage for many young people, but does it do any good? We asked students to share their views on the often criticised “voluntourism” trend, and the reaction was overwhelmingly favourable. Here are some of the responses. Through the right channels, volunteering can work for all involved There are swathes of voluntourism traps out to deceive people and I was lucky that, after passing on various volunteering “packages”, I remembered a chance recommendation about a government programme, ICS. Based on my assessment, they assigned me to a disabilities centre in Ghana for three months. There, I was thrown into challenges I’d never faced before: presenting to schoolchildren and teachers; producing our own foreign language documentary; teaching ICT, through language and communication barriers, to the deaf. My three British colleagues and their local counterparts were even more remarkable. They built a school from scratch – not a brick shell, but a curriculum, lesson plans, examinations, certification. These operations are sustainable, too we trained our local counterpart volunteers and handed over to the next cohort of British volunteers. Were there problems? Of course. The programme operates on subsidies; volunteers get out as much as they put in, and some don’t put in; and not all projects allow so much freedom. But with a healthy dose of cynicism, I feel we had an impact. It’s important to realise it is not selfish to think about what these programmes have done for us, the “volunteers”. Through my work, I picked up the satisfaction of teaching, which I still carry on at home. Through my involvement with the community I realised there’s such a vast, unexplored world outside my doorstep. Through my brilliant colleagues and our adventures, I came out of my shell and am ready to take on that world. James Wong, Barts and the London medical and dentistry school, UK Don’t tar all projects with the same brush
Volunteering can be an exceptionally effective form of foreign aid. Having skilled and passionate people working alongside foreign counterparts not only delivers immediate, tangible results in the project delivery, but also builds the most powerful tool for development: human capacity. Over a decade of involvement with volunteer programmes in south-east Asia and the Pacific, I’ve seen numerous examples of positive change stemming from such projects. My particular focus has been with Australian Business Volunteers (ABV), an organisation that places skilled professionals on short-term assignments (from one to four months). We work with local counterparts to deliver a targeted, measurable project that directly addresses an identified need. While the projects are beneficial in themselves, it is the capacity building of the local counterparts that delivers the greatest long term benefit. By “teaching them to fish” we empower them to be a force for positive change long after we go home. In the countries where we operate there are precious few other avenues for this level of professional development. ABV, like some other Australian volunteer organisations, operates in a professional environment with professional people and delivers overwhelmingly positive outcomes. If there are specific projects or organisations operating that are delivering negative outcomes, they need to be addressed. But they don’t in any way detract from the value of other projects or the volunteer programme as a whole. Noven Purnell-Webb, Deakin University, Australia
Volunteers have much to offer Volunteering overseas provides an opportunity for passionate individuals to utilise their skill sets in order to contribute to sustainable development around the world. Yes, there are instances when volunteer positions are abused by fun-seeking individuals who are more intrigued with the idea of experiencing exotic locations and foreign cultures. However, these foolish examples should not detract from the advantages of providing firsthand assistance to vulnerable populations in whatever capacity possible. Volunteers have the potential to offer much-needed services with an array of expertise that may be lacking in the developing world. Therefore, more rigorous screening and acceptance of volunteer applicants could potentially lead to more qualified individuals, as the volunteers dutifully provide essential services, instead of using the position as an excuse to vacation or possibly take work away from unemployed locals. Furthermore, capacity building between the volunteers and targeted community may lead to increased cooperation involving governmental and NGO entities. Patrick Rulong, University of Waterloo, Canada Volunteering is a form of grassroots development Volunteering can be a force for good but it depends on the approach. It’s important that volunteers adapt and are more of a “helping hand” rather than trying to reshape cultural values and norms. The community I volunteered in, Nuevo Gualcho in El Salvador, now has a tourist route that is run by the community which British and national volunteers worked together to create. Volunteering should acknowledge the skills that communities have and give them the knowledge and the opportunity to utilise those skills. The cultural exchange gives volunteers the opportunity to learn and work with people they otherwise would not have met. However, volunteering abroad has become commercialised and has reached a staged where many people do it to tick off their bucket list or add to their CV. The humanitarian spirit can be easily lost in the mix of self-centered characters. However, the greatest impact that volunteers make is the relationships they build with locals. The impressions they leave are unforgettable and, speaking from personal experience, we truly do make friends for life. When a volunteer’s heart is in their work, the impact they can make is priceless. There are different ways to bring about change and volunteering is not always the solution. Volunteers need to be careful and research what their role will be while volunteering, as many companies are out for their money and sustainable development can be used as a tool to attract them. Victoria Poku-Amanfo, University of Exeter, UK Volunteers beware I’ve travelled a lot and have never volunteered. I don’t think I’ll ever volunteer. For me it has never seemed worthwhile, when weighing up my options. I don’t think you need to volunteer to have a good time or feel like you’re doing your bit to stop human misery. Does volunteering really help the people you’re supposed to be helping? I don’t know. But what I do know is that volunteering is big business, and those who choose to volunteer shouldn’t be condemned for the sins of the industry. I’ve met volunteers who were not allowed to leave the area they were helping out in. I’ve met a volunteer who caught the programme coordinator pilfering funds from an orphanage in Kenya. I’ve met plenty of volunteers who seem worn out, dissatisfied and ready to go home. Volunteering is shamefully expensive and can be exploitative. $2,000 for two weeks in India doesn’t add up. $2,000 in India is big, big money. Then again it’s probably better than $2000 for two weeks in Europe on Contiki [tour holidays]. Declan Quali, University of Wollongong, Australia ‘What harm have we caused?’ I have read many articles and heard many people claim that travelling abroad to volunteer in industries such as health care, education or building services does not bring about any benefits to those we are trying to help. I wish people who believe this would justify themselves. I cannot think of any harm being brought to a community by individuals from the western world building wells for a community so that they are provided with clean drinking water to prevent the spread of cholera, or helping to improve a child’s English, which will benefit their future education and job prospects. It isn’t until you volunteer to do this work yourself that you realise what a massive impact you are making on people’s lives. I discovered this last summer when I travelled to the poorest region of India for five weeks to build 10 new homes for orphaned families. The families, the builders and the community in general could not have been more welcoming, friendly and grateful for the work we were doing for them. As a result, each family had a new, cement-built home with running water and electricity instead of a wooden hut held together with sticks and rope. Now I ask you, what harm have we caused?

2015-04-30T11:37:54Z,global-development,Global development,Burundi: thousands flee to Rwanda as protests grip capital before June poll,"Thousands of people have crossed from Burundi into neighbouring Rwanda over the past week, fleeing intimidation by youth militia who are reportedly targeting rural areas as protests grip the capital, Bujumbura, over the president’s decision to stand for a third term in June’s presidential elections. According to reports, the authorities have cut mobile access to social media services such as WhatsApp and Facebook. Private radio stations have been shut down and youth militia are marking the homes of those opposed to the president. With protests in the capital ongoing, many fear more violence in a country that endured vicious ethnic violence during its 12-year civil war. The protests have also raised fears that future violence could cause ripples in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where armed groups still prey on vulnerable communities in the resource-rich east bordering Burundi. On Saturday, President Pierre Nkurunziza was nominated to stand again by his ruling CNDD-FDD party. Furious at what they perceived as a breach of the constitution and of the peace accord that ended the civil war, protesters took to the streets of Bujumbura and clashed with police. The protests have continued this week. Demonstrators burned tyres, built roadblocks and threw rocks at security forces, who responded with tear gas, water cannon and live bullets, according to Human Rights Watch. Burundi’s Red Cross said at least six people had been killed in Bujumbura. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, sent his special envoy for the Great Lakes region, Said Djinnit, to Burundi, while the US assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labour, Tom Malinowski, travelled to the country on Wednesday to “urge all actors to reject violence to safeguard the gains Burundi and its people have achieved since 2005”. Britain has urged its citizens to avoid all but the most essential travel to the country, with some areas designated no-go zones, including Cibitoke and Bubanza provinces, north of Bujumbura. Britain’s Foreign Office called for Burundi’s government to allow private radio stations to resume broadcasts, and to let citizens protest peacefully.
Nkurunziza’s supporters argue that his first term, which started in 2005, does not count because he was appointed by parliament rather than elected. His opponents say another term would be in breach of the constitution and the peace deal to end the 1993-2005 civil war, in which 300,000 people were killed. Nkurunziza is not alone among African leaders in seeking to extend his term of office by changing or ignoring constitutional limits. When Blaise Compaoré, the former president of Burkina Faso, tried to end term limits and extend his 27-year rule in 2014, he was forced to resign after massive street protests. In Burundi, violence – and intimidation by the pro-government youth militia, the feared Imbonerakure youth wing of the CNDD-FDD party – has driven thousands of people from their homes. Up to 5,000 people crossed into Rwanda over the weekend, although the number crossing daily has dropped slightly since then. On Tuesday, 1,281 people crossed. More than 22,000 people, mainly women and children, have fled into Rwanda since the beginning of April, according to the UNHCR, the UN refugee agency. Nearly 4,000 people have crossed from Burundi into the DRC. Martina Pomeroy, a spokeswoman for the UNHCR in Rwanda, said most of those fleeing came from the northern province of Kirundo, adding that there had been obstacles to people crossing in recent days, with reports that some were having to pay bribes on the Burundi side. “Mostly what we hear is that people were feeling threatened. We haven’t encountered people who were victims of violence themselves, but they were threatened by youth militia, who support the current regime … people said they used different intimidation tactics, like they would mark your house and say, ‘We are coming for you tonight’,” Pomeroy said.
“People would go and sleep in the bush and then come to Rwanda on foot. There are also some reports of people saying that people they knew had disappeared,” she said, adding that those fleeing said they were targeted because of their perceived opposition to the government and president. The UNHCR’s two main reception centres near the border have been completely overwhelmed, Pomeroy said, prompting the agency to move up to 1,500 Burundians a day to a new refugee camp in Mahama, in south-east Rwanda. Stephan Klingebiel, head of department at the German Development Institute, said the political crisis was exacerbating frustrations caused by extreme poverty and a perception that a small elite was benefiting from an expected “peace dividend” in a country where democracy is but a “fragile facade”. Klingebiel, who is carrying out research in Rwanda, said he had heard the youth militia were very active in rural areas. “Burundi was never a very peaceful and stable place but over the last couple of months it really has accumulated, and everyone was expecting that if Nkurunziza ran for a third term, things would get worse. There is a high risk that we are at the brink of a severe and difficult situation.” He noted that there was also an ethnic dimension to the tensions, with ethnicity still seen as a factor in economic and political success. During the civil war, Nkurunziza was among the mainly Hutu rebels fighting the army, which was then dominated by the Tutsi minority. Burundi is one of the world’s poorest countries and most of its population of nearly 10 million people are subsistence farmers. It is heavily dependent on aid, with just under half its planned budget for 2015 due to be funded by international donors, according to a plan approved by parliament.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/30/burundi-election-violence-thousands-flee-rwanda-president-nkurunziza,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/30/burundi-election-violence-thousands-flee-rwanda-president-nkurunziza
2015-04-30T06:00:01Z,global-development,Global development,Pakistan’s burqa-clad cartoon superhero makes foray into India,"Burka Avenger, the mysterious burqa-clad superhero operating out of the fictional Pakistani town of Halwapur, is jumping borders into the Indian heartland to tackle women’s empowerment. The cartoon series created by Pakistani singer Haroon Rashid – known simply as Haroon – is being shown on ZeeQ, a channel owned by the Indian entertainment company Zee Network. The show, produced by Unicorn Black, launched in India this month and is being aired in Hindi and English as well as two regional languages. “For the release in India the show has been adapted somewhat. It has been dubbed in Hindi and other regional languages,” said Haroon. Burka Avenger is the story of Jiya, a twentysomething schoolteacher who dons a full body covering, similar to those worn by some Muslim women. The burqa, which is seen by some as a symbol of subjugation, is used by Jiya as a magical cape to hide her identity and fight the wrongs around her, including the subjugation of women and the denial of the right to education for girls. Haroon claims the idea of Burka Avenger was in reaction to girls’ schools being shut down by extremists in Pakistan. The character is a keen proponent of education for girls. Burka Avenger slugs it out with a number of villains with her weapons of choice – books and pens. The character also tackles health issues, including fighting the opposition to vaccination drives. “I did not want her to use guns and bombs to fight back. So she uses books and pens, which has a message that the pen is mightier than the sword and education is the answer – not more violence,” Haroon said. Burka Avenger was launched in Pakistan in July 2013 and has won several prizes including an Emmy Kids award. It was also named one of the most influential fictional characters by Time magazine in 2013. Haroon is hoping the show will help boost awareness about women’s empowerment and the importance of education for girls. “We address serious issues, but the edge is taken off through stories that are full of adventure and comedy,” Haroon said. “The core social messages come across, yet the stories are not preachy.” Even though there are contrasting social dynamics in India and Pakistan, the status of women in both countries has a familiar ring. India has a skewed sex ratio, with 940 females to every 1,000 males. And it’s getting worse, with the ratio for girls to boys 914:1,000.
India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, recently asked political leaders in the northern Indian state of Haryana to ensure female foeticide is brought to an end there. Haryana has the most skewed ratio in the country, with only 877 females for every 1,000 males. India has made great strides in ensuring gender parity in schools. However, there is a high rate of crime against women and girls. The government has launched a number of campaigns, including Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (save daughters, educate daughters) to stop foeticide and improve education for girls. “Using cartoons to shape their mind and make them aware about the social issues of our society is a positive step in creating gender sensitivity and social awareness in our country,” said Haroon. The creators and presenters of the series are hoping the themes resonate in India as well. “We are always on the lookout for shows with themes that are relevant to Indian children and we are very fortunate that we have this show,” said the deputy business head of ZeeQ, Aparna Bhosle. Women’s groups in India have welcomed the move to air Burka Avenger. “A lot of problems that women in India face stem from the cultural upbringing which conditions the mind of children,” said Noorjehan Safia Niaz, founder of the Ashana Trust, which supports women’s initiatives for justice and development. Despite the tension over Kashmir and terrorism, there have been increasing cultural exchanges between India and Pakistan. Early last year, Zee Network launched an entertainment channel showcasing programmes from Pakistan.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/30/pakistan-burka-avenger-cartoon-superhero-india-women,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/30/pakistan-burka-avenger-cartoon-superhero-india-women
2015-04-29T16:57:02Z,global-development,Global development,"Sudan repression continues after Omar al-Bashir election win, says rights group","The Sudanese government is continuing the crackdown on political opposition and student protests that began in the buildup to the presidential election won by Omar al-Bashir this month, according to a human rights group. Dozens of opposition party members, political activists and students have been beaten and detained, mainly by Sudan’s security services, in a wave of repression that began the day before voting started, advocacy group Human Rights Watch (HRW) said. The ballot, in which Bashir extended his 26-year rule over the country, has been widely condemned by rights groups and western governments. On Monday, Bashir was declared the winner of Sudan’s election, which was held from 13 to 15 April. He gained 94.5% of the vote. But an African Union electoral observer mission, led by the former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo, said voter turnout was “generally low” throughout the polling period, mostly because opposition leaders had called for the ballot to be boycotted.
The government has levied criminal charges against opposition figures who urged Sudanese voters to stay away from the poll under the Sudanese Criminal Act of 1991, which carries the death penalty, according to the African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies (ACJPS). Sudanese security services arrested and detained opposition figures with the aim of “restricting the ability of independent groups and activists to voice dissenting political views from those of the ruling party”, the ACJPS said. Mastor Ahmed Mohammed, a member of the Sudanese Congress Party, one of the groups that called for the election to be boycotted, was arrested on Tuesday, HRW said. Sudanese opposition activist Sandra Faroug Kadouda was dragged from her car by security services on 12 April as she made her way to a meeting with other opposition members. “Her car was found 30 minutes later abandoned … with the keys still in the ignition,” ACJPS said. Kadouda was released from prison on 15 April, but the government censored a newspaper article about her detention in the al-Sudani newspaper. On 14 April, police raided Al Fashir University, using tear gas to disperse students who had gathered to rally against the election. About 29 people were arrested, according to the ACJPS. On 19 April, government security services beat and detained a student leader at Khartoum University, according to HRW. “They beat him with batons for several hours and interrogated him about his links to opposition political parties,” HRW said. Bashir, who has been in power since 1989, faces criminal charges at the international criminal court for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and alleged genocide. The international community denounced violence carried out by the Sudanese government during the election period, saying it marred the credibility of the poll. “The outcome of these elections cannot be considered a credible expression of the will of the Sudanese people,” said a joint statement by Norway, the US and the UK. Days before the polls took place, the EU’s foreign minister, Federica Mogherini, said: “The upcoming elections cannot produce a credible result with legitimacy throughout the country.” “By saying the elections weren’t free and fair, [western governments] are actually saying the government is no longer legitimate by implication, which is very strong stuff in their terms,” said Gillian Lusk, associate editor of Africa Confidential. The most credible estimate available is thatsuggests that about 35% of eligible voters cast ballots, but people in Sudan believe the real number could be half that. Most of the people who voted in the poll are thought to be government employees. Daniel Bekele, HRW’s Africa director, said: “Instead of allowing people to express their views peacefully, the government is snatching up political activists and beating, torturing, and jailing them, without the slightest pretence of respect for basic rights.” He added: “The best way for the ruling party to celebrate the elections is to end the crackdown on political dissent.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/29/sudan-repression-omar-al-bashir-presidential-election-human-rights-watch,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/29/sudan-repression-omar-al-bashir-presidential-election-human-rights-watch
2015-04-29T12:27:48Z,global-development,Global development,Peace activists at The Hague decry $1.8tn global military spend in 2014 | Liz Ford,"There is no mistaking Anne Scott’s opinion of nuclear weapons. Standing outside a conference hall in The Hague on a chilly Tuesday lunchtime, the secretary of the Scottish branch of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) sported a bright blue T-shirt with the words “NHS Not Trident” defiantly emblazoned on the front. Scott, from Edinburgh, had taken a handful of red poker chips from a table and placed them on a tarpaulin, marked “health”, as a symbolic gesture of where she would like government spending on the military to be diverted. “Nuclear weapons [in Scotland] are taking out money from health, education, welfare and human rights,” she said, defending the Scottish National Party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, for her stance on diverting current UK spending on nuclear weapons towards public services. Khedijah Mohammed-Nur, from the Network of Eritrean Women, placed some of her chips on the health pile and some on a sheet marked “education”. “It matters to me that we have a healthy society and we have education. If we have educated societies, spending on human rights will be less of a problem. Human rights abuses won’t happen if society is educated,” said Mohammed-Nur, who left her native Eritrea for London in 1993. The symbolic act came halfway through WILPF’s three-day Women’s Power to Stop War conference, held to mark the organisation’s 100th anniversary this week. More than 900 delegates from 80 countries are being encouraged to share ideas and strategise about how to work locally for peace.
Military spending – how much money a state spends on everything to do with the armed forces, including weapons, salaries and administration – has been one of the hot topics of the conference. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, total global military expenditure in 2014 stood at $1.8tn (£1.17tn), about 2.3% of global GDP. Although the figure represents a 0.4% fall in real terms spending since 2013, the third year-on-year decrease, the figure still outstrips the total spent during the cold war. US military spending fell by 6.5% between 2013 and 2014 – contributing to an overall drop of 20% in the US since 2010 – but current spending remains 45% higher than before the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. Globally, North America still spends more on the military than any other country, with 35% of the global spend. Speaking to the Guardian, Nobel laureate Jody Williams said the amount governments spend on their militaries violated article 26 of the UN charter, which says the security council must act to divert money and resource away from weapons. She also pointed to the 1961 speech in which the outgoing US president Dwight Eisenhower warned Americans to beware the influence of the “military-industrial complex” – the cosy link fostered between defence departments and arms producers. “This was not [said] by tree-hugging, peacenik, granola-eating people, but by our victorious general who said, ‘We don’t need a standing army that we needed for world war two, we don’t need to continue the relationship with industry and military. We need it to go to the needs of people,’” she said. Williams, who won the Nobel peace prize in 1997 for her work to ban landmines, is now working to outlaw killer robots – fully autonomous weapons that are piloted remotely. In 2013 she helped launched the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, with the aim of getting them banned before they turn up on the battlefield. “Are we so morally depraved that we are willing to cede the power of life and death to a machine? What do human beings think? That it’s OK to let machines pick targets and kill targets?” said Williams. She added that drones, while not much better, at least offered the advantage of “a human being picking the target and pushing the button to pulverise that person”. Colin Archer, secretary general of the International Peace Bureau, told delegates that military spending figures painted “an appalling picture, an appalling imbalance in the use of humanities resources”.
“It’s not just about the money, it’s about the misuse of brain power. The amount of scientists and technical [experts] involved in the military – we are talking about millions of people whose lives are devoted to weapons of war. We need these brains for human development,” said Archer. “We’re all conscious of the enormous human and environmental needs in society. The business of moving money [away from military spending] is a simple idea outside, but we all know that it’s political extremely complex and requires pressure.” María Muñoz Maraver, human rights programme director at WILPF, said governments are too concerned with national security, instead of human security. National security relies on the military, while human security focuses on protecting people and promoting peaceful solutions. “Every time there’s a threat, we have a military response,” she said. Among the ideas delegates have put forward to achieve global disarmament are the creation of government peace ministries to work alongside defence departments, the abolition of the UN security council – or failing that, its complete overhaul – and, more extreme, for those involved in the sale and purchase of arms to be hauled before the international criminal court. But given the complexities of the issue – persuading governments to stop funding their militaries and companies to stop making weapons – is change an impossible ask? “Nothing is impossible. If I believed [it was impossible] I wouldn’t still be an activist,” said Williams, whose campaign to ban killer robots began at her kitchen table. “We have done things, we have banned landmines, we’ve banned cluster munitions … Anything can happen if we get up off our collective butt and work together. With an overarching goal then, however individuals contribute to that goal, we can change the world.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/29/peace-activists-the-hague-18tn-global-military-spend-in-2014,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/29/peace-activists-the-hague-18tn-global-military-spend-in-2014
2015-04-29T10:59:38Z,global-development,Global development,"Nepal earthquake: learn lessons or more will die in future disasters, warns expert","Thousands more Nepalese people will die in future earthquakes and the country will slide further back into poverty if the government and the international community do not learn the lessons of Saturday’s disaster, a risk-management expert has warned. More than 5,000 people are now known to have died in the magnitude 7.8 quake, although the Nepalese government warned on Tuesday that the death toll could reach 10,000. Katie Peters, a research fellow at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), said that although significant progress had been made in retrofitting schools and hospitals and training people how to respond to earthquakes, more needs to be done to mitigate the effects of future natural disasters. Peters, who works with Nepalese government on disaster risk, said that failure to invest in “building back better”, improving infrastructure and making sure everyone was as prepared as possible for quakes would prove costly. “There will continue to be a rise in both loss of life and economic loss from disasters,” she said. “That’s the reality – and it will cost more for the international community.”
While she commended the swift humanitarian response to the crisis, Peters said the rush to rebuild should not come at the expense of proper planning. “There’s always a tension between wanting to rebuild as soon as possible – which is human nature – and taking the time to make sure that there’s consideration of the whole range of disasters that Nepal faces and making sure that we don’t carry risk into our reconstruction efforts,” she said. “If we’re rebuilding schools and hospitals, we need to make sure it’s done in a way that can withstand an earthquake of the same magnitude again. [A quake] can massively increase the rates of poverty – and Nepal is among the 11 countries globally that are most at risk of disaster-induced poverty.” Peters said focusing on risk reduction would be in everyone’s interests: not only would it help safeguard the futures of hundreds of thousands of Nepalese, it would also save the donor community tens of millions of pounds. “The statistics show that five times more funding goes on response than it does on preparing for a disaster and trying to reduce the impact of a disaster, and that’s something that the international community can do,” she said. “Every dollar spent on preparedness saves eight dollars in response – the evidence is so clear. There’s so much more attention that goes on to responding to a disaster, but at the same time, as donors, we need to make sure that we are continuing to support both communities and governments before the next disaster strikes so there’s not just an influx when there is a disaster; we need to help people beforehand.”
Although the earthquake had long been predicted, Peters said she hoped it would serve as a wake-up call on the importance of investing in preparation. “That’s the lesson that countries learn time and time again: there will often be piecemeal efforts to try to invest in how you manage the effects of a disaster, but it’s not until one happens that people actually start pushing it up the priority list,” she said. Peters said local communities had to be central to disaster risk management as they were the ones who had found themselves digging people out of the rubble 24 hours before the humanitarian agencies arrived. She also said that the international community had learned much from the 2010 earthquake that devastated Haiti. Following the quake, which killed between 90,000 and 316,000 people and displaced more than 1.5 million, donors were criticised for channelling aid funding through big agencies and NGOs rather than local Haitian organisations. “The international community has learned from that already, and you can see from the response in Nepal that people are actively trying to make sure that they are working in support of local and national response efforts – and that’s what’s going to make it sustainable,” she said. “If you help to build local and national capacity to respond, the big dream is that in the long run, there won’t be a need for international support.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/29/nepal-earthquake-disaster-response-risk-management,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/29/nepal-earthquake-disaster-response-risk-management

While it is no doubt true that working conditions in the factories are often unacceptable and need to be reformed, there is certainly nothing idyllic about life in poor, rural communities in Bangladesh and it is doubtful that the women would be better off if they stayed back in the village. Economic growth and industrialisation is not the problem; it is actually a major part of the solution (the other ‘part’ being to ensure that a policy and regulatory framework exists that ensures that the economic growth is equitable).

2015-04-28T11:50:35Z,global-development,Global development,Shirin Ebadi: 'If books had been thrown at the Taliban instead of bombs … we would not have Isis',"If books instead of bombs had been thrown at the Taliban, and if schools had been built in response to the terrorist attacks on New York in 2001, we would not now be contending with Isis, Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi told a conference on Monday. Ebadi, who was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2003 for her work in promoting human rights in Iran, criticised the west for how it dealt with terrorist groups in the Middle East, and called on governments to cut their arms budgets. Speaking in The Hague at the 100th anniversary of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), Ebadi said: “If books had been thrown at the Taliban instead of bombs, and had schools been built in Afghanistan – 4,000 could have been built in memory of the 4,000 people who died in 9/11 – at this time we would not have Isis. “Let’s not forget the roots of Isis rest in the Taliban. Let’s not repeat the experience. We have to remember that Isis is not simply a terrorist group, but an ideology, and ideologies cannot be fought with bombs. This ideology can only be fought with the correct interpretation of religion.”
Ebadi, the first Muslim woman to be awarded the Nobel peace prize, called on UN member states to reduce their military budgets by 10% and spend the money saved on education and social welfare. To cheers, applause and standing ovations, the three-day conference, entitled Women’s Power to Stop War, opened with a tribute to the women who travelled to The Hague in 1915 seeking an end to the first world war, and whose actions led to the creation of WILPF.
Four Nobel laureates addressed the audience of more than 900 delegates from 80 countries. A fifth Nobel laureate, Tawakkol Karman, the Yemeni rights activist who received the prize in 2011, was unable to travel. “We don’t need another cold war, or to demonise other countries or dehumanise leaders,” said Mairead Maguire, who was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1976 for her work addressing sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. “We have no right to dehumanise other people and then take them out. How far have we sunk when we can sit down and plan how to take out another human being because we don’t agree with their politics?” Madeleine Rees, secretary general of WILFP since 2010, told the audience the global system was not equipped to bring peace. “We have a UN system, we have a charter, a declaration of human rights and we have treaties and conventions. We’ve had four world conferences on women, we have the women, peace and security agenda and world courts to adjudicate on all the above. So we should be pleased. But it’s not working. We’re still not able to bring the peace we have been demanding.”
Rees, who previously worked for the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Bosnia, said a multilateral system is needed but the current one is failing: “Our default position is intervention, when we know the cost and consequences of that intervention.” She said the trillions of dollars spent annually on arms could have paid for the millennium development goals several times over, and warned that the increasing concentration of wealth and power in the hands of the few will continue the cycle of violence. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, total global military expenditure stood at $1.8tn in 2014. One year of the world’s military spending would finance more than 650 years of the UN’s regular budget and more than 6,300 years of the budget allocated to UN Women. “We have to reclaim peace,” said Rees. “It’s easier to not pay attention, and get on with our lives and be distracted. But we can band together. Each in our own way, we can all do something, and if we pay attention to what others are doing, then we have a movement. There are more of us wanting to end war than those who want it to continue.” At a later session, delegates heard that engaging men and boys in debates around violence was crucial to end conflict.
Anthony Keedi, programme manager at Abaad: Resource Center for Gender Equality, which works in the Middle East and north Africa, said men were conditioned to think that conflict is natural, but violence is a choice. “Men are taught not to empathise, not to cry or show vulnerability as these are weaknesses. They are taught to be stoic,” he said. “Being taught not to empathise makes it easier to point and kill, to act violently.” Part of Abaad’s work is to offer free psychosocial support to men and boys to reduce violence.
On Tuesday, WILPF will publish its manifesto, which will recommit the organisation to campaign for total worldwide disarmament and demilitarisation, to support an international system that guarantees international law and “to work towards a new international order free from neo-colonialism, political tyranny, economic exploitation and financial speculation, in which income, resources and opportunities are justly distributed between and within countries”. “Violence is not inevitable. It is a choice,” says the manifesto. “We choose non-violence, as means and as end. We will liberate the strength of women and, in partnership with like-minded men, bring to birth a just and harmonious world.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/28/shirin-ebadi-books-not-bombs-women-peace-conference-hague,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/28/shirin-ebadi-books-not-bombs-women-peace-conference-hague
2015-04-28T06:00:06Z,global-development,Global development,Child trafficking in India: 'It was only after a few years I realised I had been sold' | Sutirtha Sahariah,"Anti-slavery activists say thousands of children are going missing from some of India’s remote tribal areas as human traffickers respond to a surge in demand for domestic child labour in booming urban districts. Between 2011 and 2013, more than 10,500 children were registered as missing from the central state of Chhattisgarh, one of India’s poorest states. The majority are believed to have been trafficked out of the state and into domestic work or other forms of child labour in cities. “Trafficking for sex and other purposes has always existed in India, but trafficking children for domestic slavery is a relatively new development,” says HS Phoolka, a senior advocate at India’s supreme court and a human rights lawyer and activist. “This is due to rising demand for domestic maids due to rising income in urban areas and widescale poverty … in rural areas. This trafficking shows the rise of massive inequality in India.” The missing children in Chhattisgarh represent a small percentage of the estimated 135,000 children believed to be trafficked in India every year. Yet the rate at which they are going missing from remote villages in the south of the state is causing alarm.
Last year, the supreme court expressed serious concern over the number of missing children in Chhattisgarh. The state responded with legislation, India’s first attempt to regulate the growing number of employment placement agencies, which are often conduits for children being trafficked into domestic servitude and other forms of exploitation. Activists say more needs to be done to tackle the problem. “The state has become a big source area for children because of a lack of law enforcement, civil unrest, large-scale poverty, illiteracy and the remoteness of the villages,” says Bhuwan Ribhu, an activist working with the Bachpan Bachao Andolan (Save the childhood movement). “These are places where the protection of the state does not reach. Trafficking in this region has become deeply engrained.” In the village of Kunuri, Deepti Minch, 19, describes her experience of being trafficked into domestic servitude in northern India’s Punjab state. A village agent had visited her family and promised her mother 5,000 rupees ($79) a month if she sent Deepti to work in Delhi. Once she reached the capital she was sold off to a family. “It was only after a few years I realised I had been sold,” she recalls. “I was extremely hurt and was in tears. My life was tough. I worked from six in the morning until midnight. I had to cook meals, clean the house, take care of the children and massage the legs of my employers before going to bed. If I didn’t do my job well, they used to scold me.” Deepti eventually managed to run away and make her way back to her family – yet thousands of other children remain unaccounted for. One of them is Salmaet, who went missing from Sihardhar village in Chhattisgarh’s Jashpur district six years ago, when she was 11. “I thought she had gone to a neighbouring village, but when she didn’t return I got worried and started asking around,” says her father, Thibu Ram. “I still have no idea where she is. I hope she’s safe.” Salmaet’s disappearance is part of a disturbing trend of children going missing in the area. Fear and distrust of the police and officials mean children are rarely reported missing for months, or even years, after they disappear. Although Salmaet went missing in 2008, her family didn’t go to the police until this year. They say the police have done nothing to look for her. Rishi Kant, one of India’s leading anti-trafficking activists, says trafficking is still considered a peripheral issue among law enforcement agencies, especially in rural areas such as Chhattisgarh. “The response of states across India to this problem is very poor,” he says. “In states such as Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, law enforcement is too busy fighting the armed Maoist insurgency or civil unrest. Human trafficking is not a priority.”
In neighbouring Jharkhand state, Aradhana Singh, head of the anti-human trafficking unit in Khundi district, says the police lack both the funds and the will to tackle the problem. “We simply don’t have resources,” she says. “Our phones don’t work; power cuts are so frequent that we cannot use a computer or a fax machine. There is not even office space to offer counselling services. Most [police] don’t see trafficking as a crime. They just see it as poor children migrating for a better livelihood and don’t take these issues seriously. They think I’m dealing with a petty issue.” The impunity enjoyed by those running trafficking rings in these tribal areas is increasing the power and influence of local criminal gangs. “The situation has become so grave that in these areas it is the traffickers who wield the power,” says Prasanta Dash, head of Unicef in Chhattisgarh. “Even if cases are filed against them, they are able to pressure the families to change their statements or threaten them. Because they earn a lot of money, they are well off and act as muscle men. Trafficking in this region is very deep.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/28/child-trafficking-india-domestic-labour-chhattisgarh,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/28/child-trafficking-india-domestic-labour-chhattisgarh
2015-04-27T12:04:04Z,global-development,Global development,"Less pay, more work, no pension: the 21st-century woman's lot laid bare","Women earn on average 24% less than men, work more hours and have less chance of receiving a pension in later life, according to UN Women’s flagship report, which calls for an overhaul of global economic policies to improve women’s lives. The 2015 progress report, Transforming economies, realising rights, published on Monday, said current economic policies and discriminatory laws and attitudes are failing women in rich and poor countries. Despite significant progress in overcoming the barriers to equal opportunities, which includes new legislation to support women’s right to work, change has not penetrated deep enough in some countries. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the executive director of UN Women, said it was “staggering that where we are doing the right thing is more the exception than the rule”. The report, published as the UN debates the next set of sustainable development goals, found that only half of women over the age of 15 are in the labour force, compared with three-quarters of men considered to be of working age. In poorer countries, 75% of women are employed in informal sector jobs, such as domestic workers, positions not covered by international employment laws and which leave them open to abuse and exploitation. Some 77 countries still restrict the type of work women can undertake, with bans on night-time work – as was the case until recently in Bolivia – or construction jobs.
At least 80 countries, including France, Germany, Switzerland, Mexico and South Africa, do not have legislation requiring equal pay for equal work. Over their lifetimes, women in France and Sweden can expect to earn 31% less than men, in Germany 49% less and in Turkey 75% less.
On top of the wage gap in paid work, women on average do almost two-and-a-half times more unpaid care and household work as men. Combining paid and unpaid work, researchers calculated that women in almost all countries work longer hours each day than men. The report, which drew on existing international data, national figures and policies, as well as on-the-ground interviews, said that while the economic crisis in 2008 had affected the lives of women and men, the resulting cuts in public spending had disproportionately affected women. Austerity measures had “shifted the burden of coping and caring into the household and on to the shoulders of women and girls”. Although the gender pay gap had narrowed slightly since the crash, this had not translated into a more equal employment landscape. In some countries, the reduced wage gap was due to men’s wages falling more than women’s, which “can hardly be considered progress. Instead of catching up with men, there is a levelling down for all,” it said. The report, the first UN Women progress report since 2011, also found that sexual harassment in the workplace is still a reality for thousands of women. At least 34 countries do not have legislation banning sexual harassment at work and those that do aren’t doing enough to fully implement them. In the EU, 75% of women who hold managerial or more senior professional positions say they have experienced some form of sexual harassment in the workplace, the report found. Almost all countries now offer paid maternity leave, although only 63 complied with the International Labour Organisation’s recommendations of a minimum of 14 weeks of leave paid at a rate of at least two-thirds of earnings by governments and employers.
Later in life, women are more likely to live in poverty as they are less likely to contribute to a pension than men. Given the nature of women’s work, they don’t always have spare money to contribute towards a pension scheme if one is available. The report called on governments to tighten laws to protect women in the workplace. Well-designed and funded social services – such as affordable health and childcare, and improved access to water and sanitation – are needed to improve poverty levels and free up women’s time. A shift in attitude is required to challenge the traditional role of women as the chief carers of children, argued the report. Social protection measures, such as cash-transfer schemes that have proved successful in parts of Asia and Latin America in alleviating poverty, are also needed. Mlambo-Ngcuka said that it was not just about finding new money, but also about using existing funds to better support women through paying a minimum wage or investing in affordable, decent childcare. More women in decision-making roles are also required, she said. “Our public resources are not flowing in the directions where they are most needed, for example, to provide safe water and sanitation, quality healthcare and decent child and elderly care services. Where there are no public services, the deficit is borne by women and girls.” Barbara Lotti, a programme officer at the women’s fund Mama Cash, said: “The report stresses consistently that social norms are responsible for women’s socio-economic disadvantage in the labour market. Even in countries where formal equality in the form of laws exists, the type of work women perform is undervalued as compared to the jobs that men do, resulting in a gender pay gap. “It is a big gain to understand the stereotyping of women and the stigma they experience as a crucial factor in women’s access to decent employment. Now more than ever is the time to equip women workers in formal and informal sectors with resources to do their norm-transforming work and thus get at the root causes of the inequality they face.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/27/un-women-report-less-pay-more-work-no-pension-the-21st-century-womans-lot-laid-bare,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/27/un-women-report-less-pay-more-work-no-pension-the-21st-century-womans-lot-laid-bare
2015-04-27T06:00:03Z,global-development,Global development,Centenary stand: female activists head for The Hague to set a new peace agenda | Liz Ford,"One hundred years ago this month, more than 1,100 women from 12 countries travelled across Europe to the Netherlands to protest against the war that was raging across their borders. Presided over by Jane Addams, a member of the US suffrage alliance, the Congress of Women opened in the Hague on 28 April 1915 to debate ways to end the first world war and prevent further conflict. The congress sowed the seeds for the creation of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), which this week marks its centenary with a return to the city. The three-day conference will celebrate the work of female peacemakers globally and has the bold aim of formulating a new peace agenda for the next 100 years.
Activists from across the world are expected to attend, as well as five Nobel laureates. These include Leymah Gbowee, who was involved in the mass mobilisation of women in Liberia to demand an end to civil war, and Jody Williams, who launched an international campaign to ban landmines. “It was significant that women from so many countries came together [in 1915] with a highly political aim,” said Edith Ballantyne, who was secretary general of the organisation for 23 years and its international president for six. “While women had been organising in the International Suffrage Alliance, the peace women recognised that the vote alone was not enough, that women had to take a stand.” Ballantyne, who as a teenager fled the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, said she had mixed feelings about the anniversary. “After such a long association, I am pleased to have made it to this 100th anniversary meeting. [But] 100 years later, we have not stopped war, and in fact we face many wars,” she says. “So it’s both a great and sad day.” But the organisation, which has branches in more than 30 countries, has enjoyed some big successes over the years. Two WILPF presidents have received the Nobel peace prize. Addams, who became the organisation’s first president, was awarded the prize in 1931, followed in 1946 by Emily Balch, who attended the 1915 congress and led the organisation from 1935.
WILPF was heavily involved in the push for an international arms trade treaty, ensuring it referenced the link between the proliferation of weapons and gender-based violence. WILPF was also central in drafting the UN security council resolution 1325, unanimously adopted in 2000, which was a milestone in recognising women’s experience of war. The resolution calls for the full participation of women in conflict resolution, peace negotiations and post-conflict reconstruction, and their inclusion in peacekeeping missions. However, the resolution has yet to bring the change campaigners want. Women still have to fight for a seat at the peace negotiating table. “When it comes to the crucial moment, the door is closed,” says Madeleine Rees, WILPF’s current secretary general. Rees says the Hague conference will feed into a current UN review of women’s role in peace and security to tie in with the 15th anniversary of the resolution later this year. Radhika Coomaraswamy, the lead author of the review, will be speaking at the conference, and the design of the plenary sessions should provide some solid insight, says Rees. The three plenaries will explore the power dynamics in society and how they can be challenged, the increase in global militarisation and the structural root causes of war, and what activists can do to bring change at local, national and international level.
For Rees, engaging activists is one of the main aims of the conference. “We’ve got to stop disengaging, stop engaging in football or consumerism or anything that makes us avoid paying attention to what is happening,” says Rees. “It starts with an individual decision – ‘I will participate in making a difference’ – to commit to think global and act local; we need that. We’re not going to make demands of governments or the UN [at the conference] so much, instead we’re [looking at] the work we need to do ourselves. The thing for us is going back to local engagement.” Local engagement could involve challenging local politicians on their stance on nuclear weapons, or campaigning against the arms trade, violence against women or trafficking, says Rees. The use of killer robots – fully autonomous weapons rather than drones, which are piloted remotely – offers another focus for questioning. WILPF is now campaigning against this frightening recent development. Cynthia Enloe, a professor of political science at Clark University and specialist in demilitarisation, adds that local people need to watch for signs that trouble is brewing. “Men are often encouraged to be the nation’s protectors … and maintain their role as household protectors, and that role of protector really can be manipulated by people wanting to encourage the annexation of neighbouring territories or to build up the military,” she says. “One thing to look out for is governments or warmongers, who try to encourage men to merge these two roles.” Enloe, a WILPF member for more than 20 years, believes resolution 1325 has provided a useful tool for peace activists to hold governments to account. “When we have got something that is holding people accountable, that is definitely progress,” she says, adding: “Fifteen years in the history of gender politics is not very long.” Ballantyne hopes the anniversary conference will result in “a powerful call” to work together to achieve an end to militarisation, ultimately realising the vision of Addams and the women who travelled to the Hague in 1915. “Peace work is ongoing. There are invisible successes because you can’t measure what you have prevented. I’m certain that many situations would have been worse had the peace movement and WILPF not been working.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/27/female-activists-hague-new-peace-agenda-1915-congress-of-women,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/27/female-activists-hague-new-peace-agenda-1915-congress-of-women
2015-04-25T09:00:09Z,global-development,Global development,"'When people come with severe malaria, it is like a race against time'","In her 12-square-metre outpost in Ethiopia’s Oromia region, Nure Kieltaji represents the frontline in the fight against malaria. She works as a community health worker, one of two people offering basic primary healthcare to more than 1,000 people in her village Dembel Dildila. Nure spends a lot of her time on malaria prevention, travelling between homes to educate people on the use of insecticide-treated nets and point out potential breeding sites for mosquitoes – mostly pots of stagnant water and discarded plastic bags. “Malaria cases go down here each year,” she says proudly, pointing to a series of charts on the wall behind her. “If they have fever, even for one hour, they should visit me.” Nure’s biggest concern is severe malaria, which kills more than 1,500 people in Ethiopia each year. Uncomplicated cases of malaria are a burden but not fatal, while patients with severe malaria can present to clinics unconscious, with signs of damage to the brain, lungs or kidneys. Children are most vulnerable because their bodies are yet to build an immune response to the malaria parasite. “When people come with severe malaria it is like a race against time,” Nure explains. The nearest clinic capable of treating severe malaria is relatively close to the village – about a 30-minute walk – but with an unconscious patient and no vehicles, the distance seems far greater. “I’ve heard of patients coming but it’s too late for them to get to the clinic, especially when they are young children and the parents might not know how serious it is,” Nure says.
For more than a century the standard treatment for severe malaria has been quinine, a drug given to patients by drip. But quinine can be difficult to administer – it relies on precise calculations of the patient’s body weight and a slow delivery over four hours, with repetitions every eight. For this reason fatal overdoses can occur, particularly in rural areas where there may be a lack of training or health professionals are overstretched. In 2010 the World Health Organisation issued guidelines for an alternative to quinine, an injectable drug experts say is more efficient and safer to use. A Médecins Sans Frontières trial found treatment with the new drug, injectable artesunate, reduced the risk of death by 39% in adults and 24% in children. MSF also found artesunate had fewer side effects than quinine and was easier for health workers to administer. The drug also helps hospitals clear beds faster; a child treated with artesunate could be back home after two or three days, compared with a week or more when treated with quinine. Despite its advantages, the roll-out of artesunate in many malaria-endemic countries has been frustratingly slow. In Ethiopia, the government introduced the drug in its national guidelines in 2013. But a lack of training on using artesunate, combined with higher prices and supply shortages, has meant many clinics continue to stock quinine. Damtew Yadeta, malaria and tropical disease expert at Oromia Regional Health Bureau, said health workers in the region had begun using artesunate but a scale-up was required. “One of the biggest challenges is the information gap at different facilities – we have about 1,300 health centres in the region and almost all are expected to give case management services for malaria, but due to budget shortages we cannot provide training for everyone. So due to lack of information, health professionals are not requesting artesunate, even though it is the preferred drug.” For malaria patients already receiving the new drug, the difference in treatment options is clear.
At Tulu Bulu hospital, a public clinic on leafy grounds 60km south of Addis Ababa, 26-year-old Chala Duba is back for a check-up after contracting malaria. He says he came to the hospital after suffering from “severe weakness and back pain”. “They gave me the injectable drug and I got relief from the severe pain. After 24 hours I was able to take food again,” Chala says. At Nure’s village health post, the new drug is also making life easier. While injectable artesunate can only be administered in health clinics and hospitals, health workers like Nure can deliver a different form of the drug rectally. This treatment serves as an interim measure for children who are further away from medical clinics, buying them about 24 hours to get injectable treatment. “Now, if someone comes in with severe malaria, like vomiting and fever and convulsing, I can test them here, give them rectal artesunate and refer them on,” Nure says. “It gives them time, and time is very important.” Lelio Marmora, executive director of Unitaid, which is working to increase the uptake of artesunate in Ethiopia, Nigeria, Cameroon, Kenya, Malawi and Uganda, says a key focus is to address drug supply problems. He says Unitaid has identified two new manufacturers and is investing to help bring their products on to the market, increasing the drug’s availability and driving prices down. “There have been challenges around adequate and predictable supply at the health facilities which have been impeding use. Injectable artesunate is supplied mostly at centralised health facilities such as regional hospitals. However, most malaria cases are seen in rural peripheral health facilities,” Marmora says. “Ultimately, we’d like to see all of the global annual 8m severe malaria cases treated with the best possible medicine we have available. Today, this is injectable artesunate for treatment at facilities and rectal artesunate to buy time before patients reach facilities.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/25/ethiopia-severe-malaria-race-against-time,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/25/ethiopia-severe-malaria-race-against-time
2015-04-24T16:30:16Z,global-development,Global development,Child casualties highlight brutal cost of Yemen conflict as civilian deaths mount,"More than 550 civilians, including at least 115 children, have been killed in the street fighting and air strikes that have claimed more than 1,000 lives in Yemen since 26 March, according to the UN. The UN children’s agency, Unicef, said at least 64 children had been killed by air strikes, 26 by unexploded ordnance and mines, 19 by gunshots, three by shelling and three by “unverified causes related to the conflict”. The violence has maimed a further 172 children, and injured a total of 1,185 civilians. “There are hundreds of thousands of children in Yemen who continue to live in the most dangerous circumstances, many waking up scared in the middle of the night to the sounds of bombing and gunfire,” said Julien Harneis, Unicef representative to Yemen. “The number of child casualties shows clearly how devastating this conflict continues to be for the country’s children. Without a speedy end to the violence, children will be unable to lead normal lives.” In a statement released on Friday, the UN high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) said that while the fighting between Houthi rebels and other armed groups had often been indiscriminate, Saudi-led coalition air strikes against Houthi rebels were still killing dozens of civilians despite the official end of the bombing campaign. OHCHR said air strikes on military and civilian positions in Sana’a, Ibb, Hajjah, and Taiz, which occurred on 22 April – a day after Saudi Arabia said it was halting the strikes – killed 58 civilians, including seven children. Forty civilians were killed and 70 wounded that morning after warplanes twice hit a bridge in Ibb governorate. Civilians rushing to help the injured were reportedly hit by a second wave of strikes. A day earlier, said OHCHR, at least 20 civilians were killed and 120 injured in an air strike on a building in the Faj Attan area of Sana’a City. The raid also damaged a number of UN offices in the Yemeni capital, including those of OHCHR. Last Sunday, Oxfam claimed an airstrike had hit one of its warehouses in northern Yemen, describing the incident as “an absolute outrage”. Another NGO, International Medical Corps, said a coalition airstrike on Monday injured six staff members working in their office in Sana’a and damaged humanitarian supply warehouses containing medical and other relief supplies. Saudi Arabia and its allies launched the air war at the end of March in an attempt to restore the authority of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who was forced to flee abroad last month as Iranian-backed Houthi fighters swept across the country. Fighting between Houthis and local armed groups in Yemen’s southern governorates claimed at least 14 civilian lives on 21 April, with the same number injured. OHCHR said it had also received separate reports of snipers killing a child in the southern city of Dhale and four civilians emerging from a mosque in the port city of Aden. The agency said weeks of bombings and street battles have also left hospitals damaged and without water, morgues inundated with bodies, and ambulances unable to reach casualties because of a lack of fuel. The UN estimates at least 64 public buildings have been partially or completely destroyed as a result of the conflict. “We urge all sides to the conflict to ensure that international human rights law and international humanitarian law are respected, and to ensure that all measures are taken to ensure civilians are protected,” said a spokesman. “All sides must ensure that the humanitarian aid – which is desperately needed – can reach the people of Yemen.” Mohamed Elmontassir Hussein, the International Rescue Committee’s country director for Yemen, said the humanitarian situation was becoming catastrophic. “Hospitals are not working properly because there is no water and no electricity and not enough medical supplies,” he said. “The bombing is continuing and the fighting on the streets is still ongoing and there is no differentiation between civilians and armed people on the streets.” Hussein said proper humanitarian access had to be provided as soon as possible and called for a complete end to the air strikes. “We are not reaching everyone,” he said. “It’s insecure and although our national staff on the ground are trying their best to support hospitals, it’s time-consuming to arrange, as is delivering drugs to some of the hospitals. The airport has to reopen and there has to be some kind of return to regular life.” Cédric Schweizer, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) Yemen delegation, echoed Hussein’s calls. “There are three priorities,” he said. “First, medical aid and other assistance must be allowed in. Second, people must be able to leave their homes to have access to shops and basic services (such as they are). Third, the ICRC and other humanitarian organisations must be allowed to carry out their work.” On Friday, the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) warned that 12 million people in the country did not know where their next meal was coming from – a 13% rise since the conflict escalated at the end of last month. The agency said it was trying to deliver food to more than 100,000 people sheltered around Aden. “But we are struggling to reach people because of deteriorating security,” a WFP statement said, adding that dire fuel shortages were also hampering the response. The food agency said it hoped to provide emergency food aid to 2.5 million people from May to July.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/24/yemen-child-deaths-civilian-casualties-mount-civil-war,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/24/yemen-child-deaths-civilian-casualties-mount-civil-war
2015-04-24T12:37:33Z,global-development,Global development,NYU set to compensate thousands of migrant workers on Abu Dhabi complex,"New York University (NYU) has pledged to compensate thousands of migrant workers who built its new campus in Abu Dhabi after an investigation found that roughly a third were excluded from safeguards intended to stop them from being abused and exploited. About 10,000 people were not covered by the university’s labour guidelines, which were meant to protect them from exploitative conditions including forced labour, poor wages, illegal recruitment fees and associated debts, squalid living conditions, and abuse and harassment, according to a report by the international investigations firm Nardello & Co. The report found that the system monitoring compliance with the guidelines was flawed, with local contractors – including Mubadala, a real estate company owned by the Abu Dhabi government – exploiting a loophole to exempt some subcontractors from the labour guidelines, which increased their profits. It concluded that “this practice … created a significant gap in coverage that disenfranchised thousands of workers from the protections contemplated by the labo[u]r guidelines”.
The investigation was commissioned by NYU and its partner Tamkeen, following reports by the media and human rights groups suggesting that many migrant workers building the new campus on Saadiyat Island lived in squalid conditions, were charged supposedly outlawed recruitment fees, received wages far lower than they were promised, and had their passports confiscated by their employers. These findings were cited in a complaint by the International Trade Union Confederation to the International Labour Organisation, which is conducting an investigation into allegations of forced labour in the United Arab Emirates. The Nardello investigators determined that NYU and Tamkeen were genuinely committed to fair working conditions and that their guidelines and monitoring arrangements had improved the lives of many workers. However, their report also “corroborated many of the allegations levelled by the media and NGOs and found that the implementation of the [employment] standards was flawed”. In a joint statement, NYU and Tamkeen welcomed the finding that 65%-70% of the 30,000 migrant workers involved in constructing and operating the campus on Saadiyat Island, which opened last year, had been protected by the guidelines. But they also accepted that the system was flawed, adding that they would provide compensation to the excluded workers in “line with what they should have received under our labor standards”. “That error, for which we take full responsibility, was inconsistent with the project’s publicly stated commitment to ensure that all of those working on the construction of the NYUAD Saadiyat campus would be covered by our standards and compliance-monitoring program,” the statement said. It added that a third party would be appointed to reimburse the affected workers, who also include some not paid their full wages despite being covered by the guidelines. An NYU spokesman did not elaborate on the amount of compensation that would be provided. Originally only a narrow group of workers were exempted from compliance with the labour standards, such as outside vendors delivering goods to the main campus project. But the contractors widened this group to exclude subcontractors whose work was valued at less than $1m (£665,000), those who worked onsite for less than 31 days, and those with gaps of 30 days between visits to the site.
As contracts included additional payments for “compliance-related costs”, this provided a financial incentive for contractors to subcontract work into smaller amounts, exempting them from the guidelines and eliminating the associated extra costs, the investigators found. “It is evident that decreasing the number of covered workers would have had the net effect of lowering compliance-related costs and increasing profits for the company,” said the report. The investigators found that the project’s main contractors, Mubadala and Al Futtaim Carillion, a UAE affiliate of the British construction firm Carillion plc, which was responsible for implementing the guidelines, exploited the flaws in the system, thereby increasing their profits. The report noted that correspondence among Mubadala, AF Carillion and EC Harris, the cost consultant on the project, referred to NYU and the Executive Affairs Authority of Abu Dhabi having been “fully aware” of the exemption strategy. However, it also said NYU, and NYU’s monitor of the labour guidelines, Mott McDonald, appeared not to have been aware of the practice of granting exemptions, adding that “accounts vary” as to what each party knew. Some NYU staff interviewed by Nardello said they were aware of a “time threshold” but not a financial one. Nicholas McGeehan, Gulf researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: “Not only was there a policy to exclude workers from the labour guidelines, but firms were able to increase their own profits on account of that policy using money designated to help them comply with those guidelines. Nardello have said in interviews that it was beyond the scope of their mandate to investigate this issue in full, which is a great shame.” In a statement, John Sexton, president of NYU, said that neither the university nor Tamkeen were aware of the exemption policy “or how widely it was being applied”. But he added: “The bottom line is that we both nonetheless must take responsibility for the lapses that occurred and must try to address them”.
The report found that only 20 of the 25,000 who qualified for reimbursement of the recruitment fees they paid to secure work in the UAE, typically $1,000 to $3,000, received any financial compensation. It also noted that 30% of workers reported they were forced to hand over their passports to their employers to gain employment on the campus, in breach of the labour guidelines. The Coalition for Fair Labor at NYU, a campaign group of staff and students, welcomed the report. It said the findings showed that Mott MacDonald had “failed to do an adequate job, and that the process, as a whole, was poorly designed”. A footnote in the report said: “UAE law is completely inconsistent with labor practices in the US and elsewhere in the west”, adding that it was “difficult to reconcile” NYU’s labour guidelines with UAE law, specifically its ban on unionisation and criminalisation of strike action. Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, said: “The acceptance of these laws by NYU simply means that workers will face serious exploitation with no effective means of redress. They continue to employ support, cleaning, catering and maintenance staff who are forced to pay illegal fees to get jobs, pay them poverty wages and deny freedom of association.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/24/nyu-compensate-thousands-migrant-workers-abu-dhabi-complex-nardello-report,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/24/nyu-compensate-thousands-migrant-workers-abu-dhabi-complex-nardello-report
2015-04-24T12:19:12Z,global-development,Global development,DfID accused of heightening inequality through support for private sector,"The UK government is driving inequality in the world’s poorest countries by “dogmatically” funding private sector health and education projects instead of using aid money to boost public systems, a report has said. Rather than addressing the needs of the world’s poorest people, the Department for International Development’s (DfID) close relationship with the private sector is filling the pockets of big corporations, according to Profiting from poverty, again, a study published on Friday by the campaigning group Global Justice Now (GJN). Nick Dearden, director of GJN, said: “Aid should be used to support human needs by building up public services in countries that don’t have the same levels of economic privilege as the UK. So it’s shocking that DfID is dogmatically promoting private health and education when it’s been shown that this approach actually entrenches inequality and endangers access.” The report also questioned DfID’s appointment of Sir Michael Barber, a senior executive at Pearson, the world’s largest maker of textbooks and academic materials, as its chief advisor for education in Pakistan, saying it presented a conflict of interest. DfID oversees an ambitious £350m health and education programme in Pakistan and has partnered with Pearson on a project in Tanzania and Zimbabwe. “It seems highly inappropriate that executives from a company like Pearson can be acting in an official capacity at DfID, while their company provides commercial services that would directly benefit from the type of decisions being taken by DfID,” Dearden said. A DfID spokesman said: “We have firm policies in place to prevent any conflict of interest in our work.” Pearson, which operates in more than 70 countries, launched its affordable learning programme in 2012. The initiative is a for-profit venture fund that uses capital investment “to help millions of children in the world access a quality education in a cost effective, profitable and scalable manner”, according to the company. A spokeswoman for Pearson said: “As the Global Justice Now report makes clear, there is ‘an explicit agreement with DfID to ensure that Michael Barber’s role does not advantage Pearson’. Pearson’s affordable learning fund has no investments in Pakistan.” In a letter to the UK cabinet secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, Dearden said: “It remains the case that Pearson does benefit from DfID contracts in the more general area on which Sir Michael works, namely promoting an increasing role for private education providers across the world.” On Friday, a group of US, British and South African NGOs and teachers’ groups issued an open letter to John Fallon, Pearson’s CEO. The letter read: “By supporting the expansion of low-fee private schooling and other competitive practices, Pearson is essentially ensuring that a large number of the world’s most vulnerable children have no hope of receiving a free, quality education.” The open letter was released on Friday to coincide with the company’s annual general meeting. It was signed by the American Federation of Teachers, the UK’s National Union of Teachers, the South African Democratic Teachers’ Union, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, Action Aid UK and the National Education Association. The UK has invested more heavily in private sector projects than other rich countries, drawing criticism from the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (Icai). “DfID often seems to behave more like a hedge fund [than an aid agency], investing capital alongside banking partners like JP Morgan,” GJN said. DfID is working with companies including Coca-Cola, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and Adam Smith International and is promoting the role of private sector partners in its biggest health and education projects, according to GJN. The GJN report said DfID’s efforts to promote low-cost private schools in poor countries are “misplaced and dangerous”. The Girls’ Education Challenge, a £355m DfID programme designed to get more girls in school, is managed by PwC and includes a partnership with Coca-Cola in Nigeria. In Kenya, DfID has partnered with Adam Smith International in a £25m project that seeks to get 5,000 Kenyans enrolled in low-cost private schools. DfID has also channelled millions of pounds into the harnessing non-state actors for better health for the poor (Hanshep) scheme, which promotes private sector investment in the health sectors of poor countries. Kishore Singh, the UN’s special rapporteur on the right to education, is among those who have expressed reservations about private education. “I see [the growth of private education] not as progress, but as an indictment of governments that have failed to meet their obligation to provide universal, free and high-quality education for all,” said Singh. A DfID spokesman said: “The UK strives to get the best possible outcomes for poor people and takes a pragmatic stance on how services should be delivered. In some circumstances (parts of India, Kenya, Nigeria and Pakistan, for example), this includes developing partnerships with low-fee private schools. “DfID works with the private sector in situations where the public sector is not sufficiently present (the slums of Nairobi for example) or where state provision is so weak that the private sector has stepped in to fill the gap. Recognising that fees are still a major barrier to access for the poor, DfID’s support includes voucher schemes that subsidise access to low-fee private schools for the poorest.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/24/dfid-private-sector-support-inequality-global-justice-now-report,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/24/dfid-private-sector-support-inequality-global-justice-now-report
2015-04-24T11:42:36Z,global-development,Global development,'I thought the boat was my only chance',"About a year ago, I planned to pay a smuggler to get on a boat to Europe. A lot of people in Europe think that we refugees don’t know that we can die at sea, that we have not seen the horrific pictures of refugees’ dead bodies, that we don’t know that tens of thousands of people have been buried on Europe’s shores.
But I do watch the news every day, and I had seen how more than 500 people had died a few kilometres from the Italian island Lampedusa in October 2013. I knew the statistics, I knew the risks. I had even lost friends of mine, who are some of the “refugees without a face and without a name”, as the media refers to them. But, in the same way as many Syrian refugees who, together with Eritreans, made up about half of the refugees crossing over to Europe by boat in 2014, I thought this was my only chance. I am a Syrian refugee from the Palestinian al-Yarmouk camp in Damascus. When I was small, my grandmother used to tell us how she felt when she was forced to flee to Syria from her home in Palestine in 1948, and how she hoped that her children and grandchildren would never have to experience what it feels like to be a refugee. But we did. I was born a Palestinian refugee, and almost three years ago I became a refugee once more, when my family and I had to flee the Syrian war to Lebanon. Our home, the Palestinian camp, had been under the hardest siege one can possibly imagine. I am still in touch with family and friends who could not leave Yarmouk camp. In a cruel absurdity, they sometimes have internet, but they don’t have food. Many of them have starved to death or died because they do not have access to medication or treatment.
My friends and family have always known me as a very optimistic person. I love life, I love people. I had worked in Cyprus, and even when I could not return home to my beloved Syria because the war had already started, giving up was the last thing I had in mind. In Lebanon, I started supporting my fellow Syrians and Palestinian-Syrians. They needed me, and their smiles and appreciation kept me going. I woke up every morning to volunteer with DPNA (Development for People and Nature Association), a partner organisation of CARE. But about a year ago, I could not bear the situation any more. I felt the refugees’ suffering – that of the Syrians, the Palestinians, the Syrian-Palestinians. I felt their misery, their destroyed hopes and dreams. And I also thought about my own life, my future. I had lost hope. Before the war in Syria started, I had my whole life ahead of me. But then, at 27, my life as it was suddenly took a break. I could not work legally in my profession as an engineer any more. I had studied, I had money, a good job. Suddenly, I stood there with nothing at all. Being a refugee also means losing your future, your dreams.
I did not get on the boat to go to Europe. After long discussions with my family and friends, I am still in Lebanon, and I am still supporting my fellow refugees. I am leading a project to train other volunteers now. Refugees are in need of humanitarian support. The refugees I work with have been engineers like me; they were doctors, teachers, farmers and workers. We had normal lives, and, as much as we refugees appreciate Europe for what it is, it’s not “heaven on earth” for us.
Like me, most refugees dream about going back home, going back to Syria. But if peace is not restored and neighbouring countries continue to struggle with the burden of hosting 4 million Syrian refugees, Europe for some seems to be the only option to live a life in dignity. We humans are all quite similar: we love our friends, our families, our home. We do not give this up easily. But bombs and bullets keep us away from the place we love most. I follow the news, I follow the discussions. I hear politicians talk about the necessity for the EU to resume its rescue missions; about issuing asylum to Syrians and other refugees before they have to travel on unsafe waters. I am truly touched that so many people around the world cry out about our suffering, that people around the world care. They understand that I have not chosen to be born as a Palestinian Syrian, as you have not chosen to be born as a European. I do not wish my situation on anyone. But I would hope that we could make this time in history a time of change. Europeans have gone through similar pain, just a few generations ago. Europeans too have been refugees ; they were the reason why grand international law projects like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 1951 refugee convention were drafted in the first place. I really hope that people in Europe can remind themselves of the bond of humanity that connects us all and that remains the strongest medicine against desperation and powerlessness. But more than anything I hope that European and other leaders around the world resume their efforts to push for peace talks. In the end, most refugees hope that they can cease to be called refugees, that their countries will restore peace and that they can return to the places they love most: their homes.

2015-04-24T11:15:10Z,global-development,Global development,UN human rights chief denounces Sun over Katie Hopkins 'cockroach' column,"The UN’s human rights chief has attacked the Sun newspaper for publishing an article by columnist Katie Hopkins, branding her use of the word “cockroaches” to describe migrants as reminiscent of anti-Semitic Nazi propaganda. In a scathing and extraordinary intervention, the UN high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, points out that the word “cockroaches” was used by both the Nazis and those behind the genocide in Rwanda, and urges the UK government, media and regulators to respect national and international laws on curbing incitement to hatred. “The Nazi media described people their masters wanted to eliminate as rats and cockroaches,” said Zeid.
“This type of language is clearly inflammatory and unacceptable, especially in a national newspaper. The Sun’s editors took an editorial decision to publish this article, and – if it is found in breach of the law – should be held responsible along with the author.” But such language, he added, was typical of “decades of sustained and unrestrained anti-foreigner abuse, misinformation and distortion” when it came to the reporting of migrant and refugee issues in the British media. On 17 April, Hopkins – a columnist for the Sun, Britain’s biggest-selling newspaper – wrote that she was resolutely unmoved by the plight of those risking their lives by crossing the Mediterranean. Hopkins, a former contestant on the BBC1 show The Apprentice, and perennial courter of controversy, wrote: “No, I don’t care. Show me pictures of coffins, show me bodies floating in water, play violins and show me skinny people looking sad. I still don’t care.” Hopkins added: “Make no mistake, these migrants are like cockroaches. They might look a bit ‘Bob Geldof’s Ethiopia circa 1984’, but they are built to survive a nuclear bomb. They are survivors.” The column appeared hours before a fishing vessel packed with migrants capsized off the coast of Libya, with the loss of 800 lives. A spokesperson for the UK industry regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, said: “We can confirm that there have been more than 300 complaints about the article. IPSO is investigating whether the piece breaches the Editors’ Code and will publish its findings in due course. While this process continues, it would not be right to provide a detailed response on the investigation or the broader issues it raises.”
Zeid said Hopkins’ column was far from an isolated incident, accusing the British tabloid press of consistently attacking and vilifying migrants. “This vicious verbal assault on migrants and asylum seekers in the UK tabloid press has continued unchallenged under the law for far too long,” he said. “I am an unswerving advocate of freedom of expression, which is guaranteed under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), but it is not absolute. Article 20 of the same covenant says: ‘Any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law.’” The commissioner also accused the Daily Express of seeking to whip up anti-foreigner prejudice. “To give just one glimpse of the scale of the problem, back in 2003 the Daily Express ran 22 negative front pages stories about asylum seekers and refugees in a single 31-day period,” he said.
“Asylum seekers and migrants have, day after day, for years on end, been linked to rape, murder, diseases such as HIV and TB, theft, and almost every conceivable crime and misdemeanour imaginable in front-page articles and two-page spreads, in cartoons, editorials, even on the sports pages of almost all the UK’s national tabloid newspapers.” But many of the stories, said Zeid, had been “grossly distorted” or subsequently revealed to be “outright fabrications”. Although he conceded that “a similar process of demonisation” was taking place elsewhere in Europe, he said it was “usually led by extremist political parties or demagogues rather than extremist media”. Zeid said that all European countries needed to crack down on racism and xenophobia, which, “under the guise of freedom of expression, are being allowed to feed a vicious cycle of vilification, intolerance and politicisation of migrants, as well as of marginalised European minorities such as the Roma”. He also highlighted the fact that both the ICCPR and elements of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination – both of which have been ratified by the UK and other European countries – had sprung from a desire to avoid a repetition of the Holocaust. “History has shown us time and again the dangers of demonising foreigners and minorities, and it is extraordinary and deeply shameful to see these types of tactics being used in a variety of countries, simply because racism and xenophobia are so easy to arouse in order to win votes or sell newspapers,” he said.
While there was a valid public debate to be had on migration and refugee issues, he said, the discussions had to be based on facts rather than “fiction or blatant xenophobia”. Zeid added that twisted and prejudiced reporting was sapping compassion for those fleeing conflict, human rights abuses and economic deprivation, as well as those now drowning in the Mediterranean. He said the “nasty underbelly of racism” now characterising the migration debate in more and more European countries was even skewing the EU response to the crisis. Thursday’s emergency meeting of European leaders, he added, had focused “on deterrence and on preventing movement at all costs, [which] risks making the crisis even worse, and could sadly result in further massive loss of life”. Zeid is the second senior UN official to criticise Hopkins. On Wednesday, François Crépeau, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, said people such as the columnist were helping to win votes by “migrant-bashing”. Crépeau said politicians needed to show proper leadership: “We need people who are able to say to that Sun journalist, ‘You’re wrong and you should know that.’” Hopkins used her column in the newspaper on Friday to address her previous remarks, describing the outcry the piece provoked as a “cautionary tale”. She wrote: “I am reminded of the power of the pen. One should be brave enough to speak out - but aware of the dangers which lurk in the depths of our vocabulary. “No one wants to see images of children drowned at sea, no matter what their journey or their destination. The next time you are thinking of clicking on a petition, don’t be angry about words. “Accept our opinions differ. Channel your outrage at the regimes causing people to flee. And be part of the solution.” A Sun spokesman said neither Hopkins nor the paper would be commenting further.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/24/katie-hopkins-cockroach-migrants-denounced-united-nations-human-rights-commissioner,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/24/katie-hopkins-cockroach-migrants-denounced-united-nations-human-rights-commissioner
2015-04-24T06:00:07Z,global-development,Global development,Kandahar city power project in jeopardy,"One of the US government’s flagship programmes for development in the strategic south of Afghanistan risks running aground. According to current plans, when the Department of Defense withdraws funding for diesel in Kandahar city later this year, it will also pull the plug on thousands of factories and homes, potentially aiding the Taliban, which until 2001 had its stronghold in Kandahar. The US’s Kandahar Bridging Solution is set to end in September. A key part of the project is the Shorandam Industrial Park, a new $7.8m (£5.2m) venture built on the side of the highway between the airport and the city. The park includes a power plant and an electrical distribution system. It also has business facilities to stimulate growth and create jobs for local entrepreneurs, although many remain empty. The US has no convincing plan to secure remaining electricity when it cuts funding, a US congressional watchdog warns in a new report. “We are unconvinced that there are plans in place to ensure there is a reliable and sustainable power source for this strategically important city,” says the Special Inspector for Afghanistan Reconstruction (Sigar). USAid built the Shorandam Industrial Park in 2004. After assuming control of the park in 2010, the Afghan government allowed the US military to build a power plant on the site to temporarily supply Kandahar with some of its electricity. Sigar says that during a recent visit to Afghanistan, the US government did not provide the necessary insight into planning and quality assurance of the industrial park. “USAid officials were unable to provide the requested contract documents and could not explain their inability to locate the documents,” Sigar says. “As a result, we could not test whether the park’s internal electrical distribution and water systems were operable and safe, or whether those crucial systems, as well as roads, flood channels and other construction, met contract requirements.” Kandahar, which used to be an underdeveloped bastion of the Taliban, is now a busy city of half a million people, with daily domestic and international commercial flights. The city is largely secure by Afghan standards, with blast walls and an extensive police force fortifying the streets. Yet, security in the province is tenuous. Rasoul Baghi, director of the southern provinces for the state power firm Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (Dabs), said the Taliban controls more than a third of the output at the Kajaki plant, a facility in neighbouring Helmand province that helps power Kandahar. An estimated 30% of Afghans have access to electricity, but the insurgents are able to secure a steady power supply to areas under their control, taxing residents in the process. For the past few weeks, electricity from the Kajaki plant has been cut off from the grid because of fighting spilling over from Sangin district in Helmand, damaging the transmission line. A recent two-month military operation named Zulfiqar failed in its objective to clear Sangin of insurgents, but made it possible for Dabs to reconnect the Kajaki plant to the power grid three days ago, said Baghi. Before then, the provincial capital Lashkar Gah had been without power for 60 days, according to the deputy governor of Helmand, Jan Mohammad Rasolyan. The Taliban has maintained a steady level of fighting over the winter; in spring, they normally scale up attacks further. On Wednesday, the insurgents named this year’s fighting season “Azm”, meaning “resolution” or “determination”. The spring offensive will begin on 24 April, the insurgents said, foreshadowing what many fear will be the Afghan war’s deadliest year on record. There has been a particular increase in violence in the country’s south, where the national security forces are strained in the absence of international troops. Another purpose of investment in Shorandam Industrial Park was to create employment. Stimulating the economy would ideally encourage farmers away from growing opium and give birth to a business class with commercial ties and loyalty to the national government. Original plans for the plant included accommodation for 48 businesses. During their visit last year, however, Sigar’s inspectors only found one active Afghan business on site: an ice cream packing facility. When the inspectors returned this year, after the majority of US troops had left, there were still only four active businesses.
Shorandam and Kajaki aside, Kanadahar is powered by a third main plant, Bagh-e Pul, which the US also helps power with diesel subsidies. In early 2014, the Americans supplied 1.8 million litres of diesel to Shorandam and Bagh-e Pul plants, said Baghi, which was enough for the generators to run on almost full capacity. For the past year, the Defense Department has gradually decreased its supplies of fuel for the power plant, leaving it almost defunct. Fuel has shrunk to 300,000 litres, divided between the two plants. In a written statement, Ben Edwards, a USAid spokesman, described Shorandam Industrial Park as “fully operational”. “Existing and future business tenants have access to electricity, water, roads and clear title to land in both parks. Equipment and infrastructure provided by USAid is already being utilised by business tenants. The Afghan government is taking active steps to ensure that the parks contribute to the economic development of the country,” Edwards said. Baghi said the current situation leaves the electricity vulnerable when there is fighting, as was the case in the recent clashes in Sangin. He adds that the only way for the cash-strapped Afghan government to supply the required diesel is to move resources from other big city plants in the country. “We don’t have any alternative to supply fuel for the plants,” Baghi said. “The key to solve this is with the US government.” This article has been corrected to clarity that it is the US Department of Defense who is withdrawing funding for diesel in Kandahar city in September, rather than USAid.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/24/kandahar-city-usaid-afghanistan-power-project-jeopardy-sigar,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/24/kandahar-city-usaid-afghanistan-power-project-jeopardy-sigar
2015-04-23T12:59:50Z,global-development,Global development,The global education challenge: making the grade in Mali | Lucy Lamble,"Sabalibougou district school is set back from the main road, a block away from the right bank of the river Niger in Bamako. Next door is the daily sheep market. The broad open area between the school and the road, which appears at first the perfect area for a boisterous game of football, is in fact land recently cleared of informal housing. The local authority has plans to develop here. The immaculate schoolyard hosts 4,500 pupils from years one to nine, all on one site. The set-up is typical for state schools in urban areas. In Mali, as in France, public school students wear what they like or have; the students who pass by in uniform are heading to private schools.
It costs 1,500 central African francs ($2.50; £1.67) a year to study at Sabalibougou, but there are still parents who cannot muster the fee. Private schools in the city can charge anything from $1,200 to $8,000 a year. Students stay in their block from grades one to six, the first “cycle”, before moving up a section for grades seven to nine. Beyond that, some leave the school system while others head for the upper school, or “lycée”.
The milieu is distinctive, but the challenges facing the school, its students and its staff – lack of funding, overstretched facilities, large classes, a dearth of teacher training, children failing to progress to secondary education in sufficient numbers – reflect a pattern discernible across many developing regions. The school monitors absences carefully. There are many reasons that prevent students coming to school here, but money is part of the story. Adama Issa Diarra is the director of school “F”, one of the eight sections within the compound. “Sometimes we notice that some students don’t come to school, mainly due to the fact that many families are still poor. Sometimes some students don’t even eat before coming here and parents feel ill at ease. When it comes to paying school fees – because we have to collect the fees – we tell parents, ‘If you don’t pay, we’ll be obliged to ask your kids to remain at home’. Some parents, because they don’t have money, just decide that their kids won’t come until they get some money.”
The school gives parents the option to pay step by step. Even then, some are not able to meet the deadline. But money is not the only factor that prevents all local children from enrolling, says Diarra. “Unfortunately, there are still some families who don’t accept sending the kids to these kind[s] of public schools. Some want to send their kids to Islamic schools, which are very different from our system. Some just don’t want to send their kids to school because they help them in the farms, or they use their kids for other things to get money..” In a packed ninth-grade classroom, some of the school’s oldest students squeeze on to benches. Exercise books are open, and the teacher has written the aim of the lesson on the blackboard: today it is “récitation”. The first two students, both girls, rather shyly deliver their accounts to the class of nearly 100. But then the form’s star steps forward to make his case with gusto.
About 70-80% of the children who start school in Sabalibougou complete the basic level. From there, only half go on to secondary school. Diarra says this is down to the challenge of passing the last class. “Many kids have to take the classes many times and finally, at a given time – when they’ve taken it two or three times – you’re obliged to send them out. So unfortunately it’s [only] about 50% who succeed.”
Looking around the school, there is little sign of a gender gap for those successfully completing basic education. Secondary level graduation is a different matter, however. “Unfortunately, many girls don’t succeed in finishing their secondary school,” says Diarra. “We have two main issues. The first is that they get married early, or too early. The second one is unwanted pregnancies; when these occur, most of the girls have to stop school.” It’s break time now. As students pour out into the courtyard, two children share their plans for the future. Fanta Bamba, 14, says she likes school very much and particularly enjoys learning English. “I would like to continue my studies. I’m very lucky because my family allows me, as a girl, to continue. So I will make the most of this opportunity to finish my studies.” Fanta has yet to decide what she wants to do when she leaves school. “It’s not very clear in my mind, but I would like to get a very good job where I can have enough money and have a good life and also help my parents.” Her friend, Bourama Fomba, 13, would like to go on to lycée after finishing. He has given careful consideration to what comes next. “When I finish my studies, I would like to find a good job in an office, or even to become a minister – why not?” But such aspirations are a challenge to nurture when there are 80 pupils in Bourama’s class, and 82 in Fanta’s.
Diarra ponders the biggest difficulties facing the country’s teachers. “We have a few key challenges: we have a large number of students per class, [and] sometimes when teachers have too many students in their class the quality of the teaching will decrease.” He would like to see more opportunities for teacher training, especially continuing professional development. Teachers also lack resources to deliver some lessons, says Diarra: “Sometimes teachers don’t have enough – or appropriate – materials … it’s very, very difficult.” As director, Diarra supports other staff. “We try to assist the teachers in the class, sometimes we even give them model, simple classes as we teach and make them observe and learn from that observation.” But with large classes and relatively limited resources, motivation is a key issue, says Diarra. “This is the problem, the system is not really improving because sometimes there is a lack of training for teachers and sometimes the training is not very adapted to the situation and there is a lack of teaching materials, so it’s very difficult for teachers even to apply what they’ve been learning.”
Unsurprisingly, only a minority of school F pupils will make it to university. Those who do will study alongside students who have come up through the private school system. “It’s very sad to say,” says Diarra, “but poor families tend to send their kids to public schools and, of course, rich families prefer to send their children to private schools, where maybe it’s better organised and with more possibilities, more materials and so on.” Bourama, though, remains upbeat. “If I have a chance to talk to people in the world, I would like them to understand that here in Mali it’s not very easy but students are serious [hard-working]. We are really doing our best to move forward, because we are aware what an opportunity – for both boys and girls – going to school represents.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/23/mali-education-sabalibougou-school-global-challenge-bamako,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/23/mali-education-sabalibougou-school-global-challenge-bamako
2015-04-23T07:30:02Z,global-development,Global development,Education is a fundamental human right – which is why private schools must be resisted | Kishore Singh,"At the beginning of the new millennium, the international community made a commitment to achieve universal primary education for all boys and girls. Today, 15 years later, we find huge gaps between these commitments and reality.
Across the world, 58 million children still don’t have access to schools, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. Millions more fail to graduate, or fail to learn what they need toparticipate in society meaningfully. Capitalising on the inability of governments to cope with rising demands on public learning, private education providers are mushrooming. I see this not as progress, but as an indictment of governments that have failed to meet their obligation to provide universal, free and high-quality education for all. Education is not a privilege of the rich and well-to-do; it is the inalienable right of every child. The state must discharge its responsibility as guarantor and regulator of education as a fundamental human entitlement and as a public cause. The provision of basic education, free of cost, is not only a core obligation of states but also a moral imperative. Privatisation cripples the notion of education as a universal human right and – by aggravating marginalisation and exclusion – runs counter to the fundamental principles of human rights law. It creates social inequity.
The admission policy in private schools is based on the ability to pay, and on the socio-economic background of parents. As a result, private schools lack the diversified system of learning and cultural plurality that is so necessary today. They promote market economy values rather than the humanist mission of education. Disturbingly, some in the international community are pushing for greater privatisation in education. The World Bank, a longstanding supporter of the approach, has recently been joined by other international bodies. At the end of 2014, the African Development Bank, the UN Economic Commission for Africa, the African Union commission, and the UN Development Programme released a report promoting increased private sector involvement in education. The study concluded that “Africa must build a vibrant private sector that supports the development of a dynamic primary education system”. This call has been echoed by some government officials in Africa and elsewhere. In the 1980s and 90s, when developing countries first made significant cuts to their public health and education spending under structural adjustment, international financial institutions, along with the largest donors, promoted user fees and increased private sector service delivery. The World Bank’s current policy of encouraging and supporting profit-seeking multinationals that provide education is a matter of serious concern, given the devastating impact this strategy has on the right to education. As a recent Oxfam briefing paper has suggested, governments should not allow low-fee private schools, and should restore education as an essential public service. As private education becomes big business, learning must be protected from the forces of privatisation. According to a study on private education by the UK’s Department for International Development (DfID), a potentially very large number of low-fee private schools, which target poorer families in developing countries, are unregistered. These schools save costs by hiring ill-trained teachers and running large classes in substandard school buildings. Such “edu-businesses”, as they have come to be known, are an unsatisfactory replacement for the good public education governments should be providing. Huge commercial publicity often tempts parents to opt for private schools in the expectation that their children will receive a better education. They believe that private schools are more efficient, and that competition improves outcomes. However, such beliefs are rarely supported by evidence. The DfID study, for instance, suggests private schools do no better than state ones.
The cost of privatising education lies not just with school fees but also with the damage done to the public good. Fees, however small, hit the poorest and most vulnerable hardest. Sometimes, this means the oldest son receives an education while daughters stay at home. Inequalities in society grow when the poorest are excluded. In the worst cases, corruption undermines the system. Headteachers may require special payments to accept students, and teachers may charge for private tutelage. We must constantly remind states of their obligation under human rights law to establish conditions and standards for private education providers, and of the need to maintain a transparent and effective system to monitor these standards, with sanctions for abusive practices. Parents, community, teachersand students must be encouraged to speak out against the commercialisation of education, acting as vigilant observers and reporters of abusive practices. Governments must empower human rights institutions, watchdogs and other mechanisms to investigate alleged violations of the right to education. I’m not saying traditional public schools are the only solution. Community schools, locally organised and run with state support, can meaningfully complement government efforts to provide education and are an alternative to privatisation.
Governments must face the education challenge head on. Investment in education must be prioritised, using at least 4% of GDP, and reform priorities should be established with assistance from civil society and international donors, development banks and the UN. Leaving these challenges to the private sector may seem easier. But when we ask what kind of world we want, we do not say one for those who have, and another for those who don’t. Let’s not create education systems that promote inequality – there is enough of that already. The international development agenda must aim to eliminate private schools, not champion them.

2015-04-23T07:00:02Z,global-development,Global development,Millennium development goal 2: 15 achievements on education,"1. Enrolment in primary education in developing regions reached 90% in 2012, up from 83% in 2000, and 80% in 1990.
2. The greatest regional improvement was in sub-Saharan Africa, where the primary school enrolment rate increased by 18% between 2000 and 2012. 3. Tanzania has achieved near-universal primary education by abolishing school fees, and tackling the issues that had kept children out of school. The country’s holistic approach has included implementing a gender sensitive curriculum, introducing a specific education plan for the country’s nomadic population and providing water facilities to communities where girls previously had to stay at home and spend hours collecting water. Schools for disabled children have also been introduced, along with initiatives to help reduce early pregnancies, which often take girls out of school.
4. Northern Africa*, which had enrolment rates of 80% in 1990, had almost achieved universal primary education by 2012, with enrolment rates at 99%. Eastern Asia, south-east Asia, the Caucasus and central Asia*, and Latin America and the Caribbean have also all achieved close to universal primary education. 5. Sierra Leone has reversed some of the damage done by the country’s long civil war, in which more than 10,000 children were conscripted into the army. Since the end of the conflict in 2002, the number of children who have never been to school has halved. The country has also uncovered many “ghost-teachers”, teachers who have died or left the school but continue to exist on paper, allowing schools to embezzle salaries worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. It now faces the challenge of re-establishing schools closed due to the Ebola outbreak. 6. By 2012, all developing regions had achieved, or were close to achieving, gender parity in primary education enrolment. 7. In Afghanistan, 3.75 million girls were enrolled in school in 2014, compared with just 191,000 in 2002. Overall, school enrolment in Afghanistan has increased from 1 million to 8.2 million, and more than 165,000 new teachers have been trained. 8. The adult literacy rate increased globally from 76% in 1990 to 84% in 2010. The global youth literacy rate grew from 83% to 89% over the same period.
9. By 2012, the number of out-of-school children worldwide had fallen to 58 million, from 100 million in 2000. 10. In Bangladesh, “second chance” schools provided primary education to more than 790,000 out-of-school children between 2004 and 2012. More than half the students, who came from the 90 country’s poorest sub-districts , were girls. 11. In India, the percentage of primary school-age children out of education had fallen to just 1% by 2011, from 14% in 2000, and 22% in 1990. 12. According to the World Bank, the global primary school completion rate increased from 81% in 2000, to 92% in 2012.
13. In the Caucasus and central Asia, eastern Asia and northern Africa, nine out of 10 pupils who started primary school completed the last grade. 14. The decrease in dropout rates has been reflected in more children continuing to lower-secondary education: the lower secondary enrolment rate had increased from 71% in 1999 to 85% in 2012. In Afghanistan, China, Ecuador, Mali and Morocco, lower secondary enrolment has increased by at least 25 percentage points. 15. Quality of education has also improved in many countries. By 2015, the number of teachers per pupil had increased in about 83% of countries with data, though significant challenges remain. What would you add to this list? Are there any MDG2 success stories where you live? Post your thoughts in the comment thread below.

2015-04-23T06:30:01Z,global-development,Global development,What is the millennium development goal on education all about?,"What is millennium development goal two? The second of the eight development goals launched at the turn of the century called for every child in the world, boys and girls alike, to receive a full course of primary school education by 2015. Progress towards this lone target has been measured by looking at how many children enrol in primary education, how many complete the process, and how many 15- to 24-year-olds are able to read and write.
Will the goal be met? The headline figures might suggest a success story in the making, but the short answer is no. In 2012, the most recent year for which worldwide data is available, 58 million children aged between six and 11 were out of school. The problem was nowhere more acute than in sub-Saharan Africa, where roughly 30 million children were affected. So while more children are registering for primary school than ever before – in 2012 the global figure stood at 90%, up from 83% at the turn of the century – the ideal of universal enrolment remains elusive. Progress since the turn of the century was made mostly before 2007, with only an additional 2 million children making it to the classroom since then. Moreover, about a quarter of children worldwide – half of them living in conflict-affected areas – drop out of primary school before their studies are complete, a statistic that has remained unchanged since the millennium development goals were introduced. And while there has been a slight increase in literacy among 15- to 24-year-olds, which went from 87% in 2000 to 89% in 2012, again there is a sting in the tail, with 126 million young people worldwide still unable to read and write. It does not help that donor funding for education has been in decline since 2010.
How have girls fared? Again, it’s a mixed story. The education goal called for “girls and boys alike” to receive a primary school education, but it failed to acknowledge that the challenges they face are far from alike. In some poor countries, sons are still seen as the breadwinners of the future, and their education prioritised over daughters. This means they are more vulnerable to early or forced marriage and early pregnancy, and are often left to shoulder a disproportionate share of the domestic workload. On the plus side, perhaps partly because of the emphasis on education in the gender equality goal, boys and girls are now enrolling for primary school in equal numbers. That, though, means very little if they subsequently fall by the wayside, and the reality is that for every 100 boys out of primary school there are 117 girls.
What still needs to be addressed? Increasing primary school enrolment without making provision for improved access to secondary and higher education was a fundamentally flawed strategy. Governments and donors supported the education goal by building and equipping new primary schools, in the process creating a burgeoning generation of young learners. But not enough provision was made for what would happen further down the line. The consequences of this approach are perhaps nowhere more apparent than in sub-Saharan Africa, where more than half of children old enough to be in secondary school are no longer in education, even though the region has recorded the most significant increase in primary school enrolment since the turn of the century. In some cases, buildings and books were emphasised over the more basic aim of improving literacy. Moreover, inadequate resources made it difficult to reduce class sizes, increase the number of qualified teachers, promote better teacher training or enhance academic curricula. Building more schools while neglecting to populate them with enough skilled teachers who were paid on time was not a recipe for success. How did MDG2 fit with existing global education initiatives? In April 2000, at the World Education Forum in Dakar, 164 countries pledged to meet a set of six targets by 2015. The agenda called for expanded and improved early childhood care and education, and stipulated that school attendance for children should be compulsory, free of charge and of good quality. It also promoted lifelong learning, adult literacy, the provision of learning opportunities for old and young, gender equality and an all-round improvement in education quality. But the Education for All initiative was overshadowed by the millennium development goals and their emphasis on universal primary education. As the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation said in a recent report: “The focus on universal primary enrolment meant less attention to other crucial areas, such as education quality, early childhood care and education, and adult literacy.”
What steps will the sustainable development goals take to address the original education target’s shortcomings? The new education goal promises to be far more comprehensive than its predecessor. Goal four proposes that, by 2030, “all girls and boys [should] complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education”, a formula that – in succinctly covering many existing problem areas – suggests lessons have been learned. There is a clear anxiety to touch all the relevant bases, with targets devoted to preparing children adequately for primary school, university and professional life. Schools must be sensitive to the needs of both sexes, with provision made for disabled children and a greater emphasis on safety and quality. Percentage targets for literacy, numeracy, life skills and – crucially – teacher training will be set when the sustainable development agenda is formally adopted in September.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/23/millennium-development-goal-education-explainer,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/23/millennium-development-goal-education-explainer
2015-04-23T06:00:01Z,global-development,Global development,Uganda’s success in universal primary education falling apart | Alon Mwesigwa,"A gentle drizzle beats an insistent rhythm on the rusty, corrugated iron classroom roof at Katwe primary school in a suburb of Kampala, Uganda’s capital. It is a chilly morning and children in the primary one class are learning the alphabet. “A, B, C,” they repeat after their teacher. But many of these children will not finish their seven years of primary education.
Irene Namusuubo Guloba, the headteacher, says: “Around 250 of our pupils did not come back this year. We cannot tell exactly where they went.” This exodus of pupils is not unusual here – some transfer to other schools, but others drop out completely, Guloba says. Katwe primary is one of the government schools implementing the Universal Primary Education (UPE) scheme. When the initiative started in 1997, as part of a national policy to provide free primary education for underprivileged children, it was a dream come true for most poor parents in the east African state. Wealthier parents take their children to private schools. In record time, numbers in UPE schools soared. Enrolment increased from 3.1 million pupils in 1996 to 8.4 million in 2013. The numbers are evenly spread between boys and girls. And the country has been commended for achieving more than 90% of MDG2, which aimed to ensure that all children – boys and girls alike – complete primary school. But this success seems to be falling apart amid a very high number of dropouts and poor-quality schooling for some of those who complete primary school. The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) has estimated that 68% of children in Uganda who enrol in primary school are likely to drop out before finishing the prescribed seven years. Chad has the highest dropout rate in sub-Saharan Africa, at 72%. In east Africa, Kenya has the highest completion rateof 84%. At a cabinet ministers’ retreat last month, Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni expressed his rage over the rate at which pupils were leaving school, even when the country spent 900bn Ugandan shillings ($302m; $201m) annually on the scheme. He said: “We should get an answer, and if you think it [UPE] needs to be restructured, we do that.” The scheme faces a myriad of issues: gender challenges, child labour, early marriages, less motivated teachers, and lack of awareness among parents. However, the biggest challenge is poverty. Dr Nicholas Itaaga, a UPE expert and a lecturerat Makerere University’s School of Education, says poorer parents still struggle to meet requirements for school. “UPE was a good development for any government to implement. Our problem in Uganda [is that] it was not adequately planned. We are losing out.”The major setback for UPE is that it is not entirely free, contrary to the general perception that parents are not supposed to pay for anything.
In practice they still have to buy scholastic materials including pens, exercise books, clothing and even bricks for classroom construction. They also have to provide or buy lunch for their children. For poorer parents, especially in rural Uganda, who live on about $1 a day, the cost is beyond reach. Charles Mugerwa is the father of an 11-year-old boy in Kasenyi village, Kalangala district, in central Uganda. On a school day, his son is at home. Asked why, Mugerwa said: “He has no uniform.” The poorer regions – northern and eastern Uganda – experience higher dropout rates. Western and central regions are regarded as better off. Government figures indicate poverty levels have declined in Uganda, from 24.5% in 2009-10 to 19.7% in 20012-13. “Do not expect a pupil who comes to school and there is no hope for a lunch[time] meal to stay in school,” Guloba says. Some schools now ask parents to pay between $2 and $5 a pupil for every three-month term so that they can prepare lunch for them. But some parents still cannot afford to pay, and their children end up dropping out.
“I have been to the deep rural areas and a simple thing such as an exercise book or sanitary pads for the girls is a very big issue,” Itaaga says. An estimated 30% of girls leave school when they start their periods, often because of a lack of sanitary pads. At Katwe, the school steps in for parents and buys pads for the pupils. “I actually have big girls here. The school provides some money to buy sanitary pads. The senior woman talks to them and they are comfortable,” Guloba says. “We are able to keep them in class”. But not all girls have that chance so they end up dropping out, deterred by inadequate facilities, particularly the lack of privacy when boys and girls share latrines. Fagil Mandy, former chairman of Uganda’s National Examinations Board, feels that the critical role schools can play is insufficiently acknowledged and evaluated. “The school as an institution has not been focused on by any major authority. It is a life-nurturing place, and should be overseen and monitored all the time,” Mandy says. Government statistics show that for every 71 pupils there is one latrine. NGOs and bodies including the World Bank have funded the construction of classrooms and toilets for some schools, but much more help is needed to provide adequate facilities for the huge numbers of pupils involved.
The education minister, Jessica Alupo, says the high dropout rate is a great concern for the government: “We want to know why all parents send a child to school when they are in primary one and the numbers decrease as they ascend to upper classes. We want to engage them [parents] much more than before.” Margaret Rwabushaija, chair of Uganda’s National Teachers’ Union, says the government must increase funding to schools. Since 1997, she says, it has not revised the amount of money it pays to educate a child annually, which stands at 7,560 shillings. “How do you expect headteachers to run schools without money?” she asks. Another major issue has been quality of teaching. A 2012 study found that three out of 10 pupils in primary three could read and comprehend a primary two-level story. At primary seven, the final class in the primary cycle, two out of 10 pupils could not read a primary two-level story. This has created a huge knowledge gap between children of the “haves”, studying in private schools, and the “have-nots”, in government schools. Betty Bitainensha, deputy head teacher at government-aided Kitante primary school in Kampala, says public schools often have the best-trained teachers, but they are less motivated to work. Teachers are among the lowest paid public servants in Uganda. The government has pledged to increase teachers’ salaries in the 2015-16 financial year. Alupo says she is optimistic about the future, but only if they can focus on the key obstacles: “Are teachers at school at all times? Are they are motivated to teach? Is the environment conducive for the learners? And finally is there a special programme to talk to parents about their role and obligation?”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/23/uganda-success-universal-primary-education-falling-apart-upe,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/23/uganda-success-universal-primary-education-falling-apart-upe
2015-04-22T23:01:03Z,global-development,Global development,"Rana Plaza: Two years after the tragedy, why has so little changed? | Sam Maher","The scale of the disaster at the Rana Plaza garment factory two years ago in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka created an expectation that there would be industry-wide change, but this has not materialised. In reality, little has changed since the tragedy occurred in April 2013. Brands and factory owners are making huge profits, the Bangladesh government is ensuring employment, albeit of poor quality, is provided to its most marginalised people, and consumers can buy extremely cheap clothes. It also means that in Europe the brands can keep prices low at a time of wage deflation and austerity.
The only group that suffers is the workforce, made up largely of young women whose voices are barely heard. They are patronised and stereotyped as hapless and weak, and are expected to be thankful for work that is characterised by some NGOs as empowering, rather than exploitative. So the real question is, why do so many expect change? Why are we asked to emphasise “the good” when “the bad” is the overwhelming experience of the workers we meet? There is an unquestioned belief in Europe that the process of industrialisation is inherently good and that, over time, change will happen organically. This is based on a false reading of history that excludes the context in which change really took place in the industrialised west. Industrialised societies didn’t simply evolve into social democracies where citizens had the right to expect things from their government and their employers. Safe working conditions, the elimination of child labour, the five-day week, the provision of education, healthcare and social security did not simply evolve as a result of industrialisation. They were fought for bravely over generations by workers. The assumptions underlying the belief that Bangladesh is just at an earlier stage of development (leaving aside the strongly colonial and racist undertones of the suggestion that Bangladesh is not as civilised as Europe) are wrong. Bangladesh is not a reminder of our past but a vision of our future. When our governments promote neoliberal, free market capitalism as the only game in town, they are aiming for a reorganisation of society exactly like that being delivered in Bangladesh. This envisages an almost non-existent state whose role is largely limited to providing the security forces required to subdue a dissatisfied population. It also anticipates a total lack of any “barriers” to the rapid accumulation of profit – no taxes, no trade unions, no “red tape” of regulation. For the rich in Bangladesh – and the garment industry has created a host of rich families – it is possible to buy top quality services, including education and healthcare, and if you can’t find it at home you can join the rest of the global elite and simply shop abroad. Workers are faced with the myth of free choice: if you don’t like your job you can always starve. Or try your luck as an informal worker, migrate as a domestic worker (often working in slave-like conditions), or beg on the streets. If you are no longer healthy enough to cope with the long hours, malnutrition and stress resulting from your working conditions, or if you get injured, pregnant or want to have a family life, you are on your own.
Any safety net that does exist is provided by a “big society” of NGOs whose reach and influence is huge. But they are only accountable to their funders, never to the people they serve. And they provide a strong ideological framework where the poor have to prove they are genuinely worthy. So, when asked to see what has changed since Rana Plaza, we need to demand more than minor adjustments to a global system that is driving us all towards greater precarity and an increasingly reduced voice in society. We need to recognise that change isn’t just about one sector in one country. If we want to see real change, we need to start demanding it – not just in Bangladesh but at home, by organising and fighting for a different vision of society where all the citizens of every country have the right to live in dignity.

2015-04-22T13:29:45Z,global-development,Global development,'We see more and more unaccompanied children on migrant boats' | Chiara Montaldo,"I’m in Pozzallo, a small tourist town on the south coast of Sicily. In the past week, more than 700 migrants have arrived here – 373 on Tuesday, 300 on Friday and 100 on Sunday. Our team is tired out after working day and night. The reception centre in Pozzallo was designed for just 180 people. Some of those arriving crossed the sea in rubber dinghies, others in wooden boats, but not one of the vessels was safe to travel in. The boat that arrived on Sunday night had set off from Turkey, and was carrying young men from Syria, Palestine and Egypt. This was one of the better boats, and so the people were in a better medical condition – Syrians generally travel in better boats, because they are able to pay more. But the boat that arrived two days earlier had come from Libya, and was carrying mostly people from African countries – Nigeria, Gambia, Mali, Eritrea and Somalia – many of them families with young children.
The migrants from Africa often arrive with ulcers and chemical burns from the petrol that floods the boats’ holds.They may also have skin diseases, like scabies and lice, from being held in detention centres in Libya, often for six or eight months at a time. Others have wounds from being tortured or being victims of violence. A couple of people have arrived with gunshot wounds – they told us that in Libya it is anarchy, and you risk being shot every time you go out in the street. The medical conditions we see reflect the migrants’ trip across the sea, but also what happened to them before: the detention centres, the journeys across the Sahara, the countries they’ve fled. Sometimes the migrants are on a “mixed boat” with two decks – Syrians on the upper deck, Africans in the hold. They tell us that if the rescue boats see migrants who are white, it is more likely that they will be rescued. When the migrants get on to a boat, they know that some will die, some will survive. They are prepared to take those risks because what they are leaving is so bad. The journey from Libya takes three or four days. They are very hungry when they arrive – often they have water to drink on the boat, but rarely food. But still, many arrive dehydrated, as well as completely exhausted. With hundreds of people crammed together in the overcrowded boats, many suffer from body pains.
The survivors of shipwrecks are always in a far worse condition, psychologically as well as physically. They’ve usually swallowed lots of salt water and are suffering from respiratory diseases as well as mental trauma from having been in the sea and having seen their companions die. Before last year, most of those making the journey across the Mediterranean were young men. But now they are people of all ages. Whole families arrive, with grandparents and young children. Last week there were two babies, one eight days old, the other four days old, both born in Libya just before the boat departed. The elderly people bring with them different medical problems, such as diabetes and hypertension. We are also seeing more and more unaccompanied children – usually teenagers from 13 upwards, making the journey without their parents.
The Syrians bring some possessions with them – a bag of clothes perhaps – but the migrants from Africa have often been travelling so long to get here that they arrive without anything, not even shoes. When they disembark at the dock, the MSF team is there to greet them, alongside police and officials. Many migrants have experienced torture and violence at the hands of military men, so to be greeted by more men in uniform can be scary for people who already have so many reasons to be scared. That is why it is so important that we are there too. MSF is a friendly and often familiar presence for many of them. One guy who arrived from Palestine recognised our logo from being treated at our clinic in Gaza. A woman who arrived from Egypt had worked for us in Cairo as a translator. Landing is a dramatic moment, but it can be a positive one. They are tired and hungry, but at least they are alive. Many say how happy they are to be here. After landing, the migrants come to the triage tent, where we screen them for tuberculosis and chronic diseases and find out about their medical condition. We are usually the first people they’ve talked to in Sicily. Often they ask, “Where are we?” and “What will happen now?”
In return we ask where they are from and how the journey went. The replies can be shocking. A 19-year-old Nigerian woman with chemical burns over her body told me how the hold of the boat in which she was travelling was awash with petrol mixed with salt water. Two people swallowed some by mistake and died; she didn’t know what had happened to their bodies. I worried about how young she was, and what would happen to her next. We know that Nigerian women are frequently the victims of trafficking and are forced into prostitution. There are so many women travelling alone – we would like to do more to protect them. But we see them in the reception centre for a few days, and then they are transferred on and we lose them. After a few months, the stress of the trip and their worries for the future can lead to depression. For anything between three months and a year, while the migrants wait for their asylum claim to be decided, they can’t work, they have nothing to do, and they can feel very isolated. Our psychologists are here to provide them with counselling and mental healthcare.
The lucky ones who get asylum can go on to work or study, but finding a job isn’t easy, especially if you don’t know the language well. And there are all the others who don’t receive any form of protection, and remain illegally. Many among this group drift into the criminal underworld or prostitution. The world’s attention is focused on the sea, but rescue operations alone can’t solve the situation. Europe needs to allow desperate people to find protection legally, without having to risk their lives in the process.

2015-04-22T10:59:20Z,global-development,Global development,Migrant crisis: smuggling or trafficking? Politicians don't seem to know |,"It is a basic idea: if you want to solve a problem, it is best if you understand what the problem is in the first place. This principle seems to be evading many of Europe’s leaders in the face of the appalling carnage that is ongoing off our southern shores. Over the course of the past week, politicians – Theresa May, Ed Miliband, the EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, Yvette Cooper and William Hague among them – have been using the terms “people trafficker” and “smuggler” interchangeably in relation to those transporting refugees across the Mediterranean. Indeed, the Guardian reported on Tuesday that the captain of the boat that sank with the loss of more than 800 lives was being charged with trafficking. It is not mere pedantry to take issue with this. Trafficking and smuggling have particular meanings in law and often require very different approaches. Those who are throwing around the terms with such abandon should know this. There are three key distinctions between smuggling and trafficking.
Exploitation Smugglers are paid by people to bring them across borders. After the border has been crossed, the transaction between smuggler and migrant ends. Trafficking is a very different crime. Trafficking means bringing people into an ongoing situation of exploitation and then profiting from their abuse in the form of forced labour or forced prostitution. Consent Migrants usually consent to being smuggled. A trafficked person usually does not consent or their consent is meaningless because they have been coerced. Borders Smuggling always happens across international borders. Trafficking does not. People can be trafficked from Coventry to Manchester. While smuggled migrants sometimes become victims of trafficking, there simply is not the evidence to conclude that what is happening in the Mediterranean is human trafficking. Rather, we are seeing people smuggling on a massive scale. Why the confusion among politicians over the terms? Surely, following the past year’s parliament debates on the Modern Slavery Act, British political leaders should be clear on the differences? I suspect there is something else at play. In the past year, those in power here and across Europe have done nothing in preparation for the spring migration of vulnerable people from north Africa apart from reducing naval resources. Now, as we all reel in horror over the many lives lost at sea in under a week, politicians are having to cast around for excuses. The conflation of smuggling and trafficking conveniently obfuscates the issue and buys political breathing space. It is a classic public relations move by those faced with evidence of their complicity in human rights abuses – or in this case, arguably, a preventable atrocity. When faced with such horror, it is easier to make grand statements blaming migrant deaths on evil traffickers than to seek the causes and identify proper responses.
What we are seeing across north Africa and the Middle East is not the machinations of organised trafficking rings, though doubtless some will take advantage of the chaos to enslave people. We are seeing a refugee convulsion, similar, but smaller in scale, to that which affected central and eastern Europe at the end of the second world war. Back then, the crisis was dealt with in some measure by a concerted international response to provide relief and safe migration. Seventy years on, Europe’s piecemeal approach to this catastrophe has to date been pathetic, creating the market for people smugglers to thrive. The events of this week make it plain that a greatly enlarged maritime search and rescue operation is urgently needed. But like any humanitarian response this is not a solution to the crisis. It is a means to reduce the numbers who are dying until a solution can be found. This must include a rethinking of the idea of “fortress Europe” and the establishment, perhaps through the deployment of UN peacekeepers, of safe migration routes for the refugees who have ended up on the coast of north Africa. Until Europe’s leaders show an audacity of ambition sufficient in scale to meet the problem, their efforts will be forlorn. To begin with, they must ensure they are dealing with the problem that is actually facing them, which is not that of trafficking, an issue which they appear only to half understand.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/22/migrant-crisis-smuggling-trafficking-politicians-dont-seem-to-know,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/22/migrant-crisis-smuggling-trafficking-politicians-dont-seem-to-know
2015-04-22T06:00:09Z,global-development,Global development,Europe's former imperial powers target their aid to ex-colonies,"Until the 20th century, they were Europe’s biggest imperial powers. Today, France, the UK, Belgium, Spain, Germany and Portugal are spending the bulk of their official development assistance (ODA) budgets on their former colonies. For France, the world’s fourth biggest donor, ODA is aimed at its former colonies in Africa. According to the latest data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the top seven countries receiving French aid are Morocco, China, Vietnam, Ivory Coast, Colombia, Senegal and Kenya. Of those, only China, Colombia and Kenya were not part of France’s former empire. It is unclear why China is a relatively large recipient of French aid. The Asian giant is also an important provider of aid to poorer countries, especially in Africa. Francophonie an official criterion for aid “France always had a colonial and linguistic focus on ODA,” explained Christian Reboul, of Oxfam France. “But it’s legitimate, because the former French colonies in Africa are de facto the poorest countries in the world. There is a consistency in that decision.” Since 2014, Francophonie has been the official goal of French development policy. First, after the last cabinet reshuffle in April 2014, the portfolios of development and Francophonie were merged into one, led by the new secretary of state, Annick Girardin. That same year, France adopted its first legislation on development aid. It focused ODA on priority regions – sub-Saharan Africa and the southern Mediterranean get 85% of French aid. Francophonie, as a goal of development policy, is part of the law. “It’s politically easier to target Francophonie than a former colonial empire, but at the end it’s exactly the same,” said Reboul. Within this region, the French government has identified 16 poor countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Djibouti, Comoros, Ghana, Guinea, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Chad, Togo and Senegal. These 16 countries, identified as priorities because of their poverty, will receive at least 50% of available aid grants. Among these 16 priority countries, only Ghana and Mauritania do not have French as an official language. But all of them are part of the International Organisation of the Francophonie. More important, only three of them were not French territories. Congo and Burundi were colonised by Belgium, and Ghana was ruled by the UK. “Actually, Ghana is maybe the only example in that list [that] doesn’t have anything to do with Francophonie, and has a level of development far above the rest,” says Reboul. Middle-income countries in Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean are also supported by French development policy, but through loans, or economic partnership more than grants. But the figures can be confusing. In 2012, within the top 10 recipients of French ODA, none were targeted as priorities, and most of them were fast-developing, such as Ivory Coast, Brazil, China, Morocco and Vietnam. “This gap can be explained by France having very strong volumes of loans and very weak volumes of grants in its ODA,” explained Reboul. The share of grants in the overall French ODA is modest. In 2013, out of the €9.8bn ($10.49bn) for public development aid, only €312m was in the form of grants for bilateral projects, or 3.2% of the French budget. UK is Europe’s leading donor
The UK is Europe’s leading aid donor. Last year, Britain gave £13bn ($19.4bn), making it the second largest aid donor in the world, after the US. The UK is also one of only five member states to have met the UN target of 0.7% for ODA. However, a 49-page report on the UK’s ODA makes no mention of guidelines under which decision-makers favour certain recipient countries and not others. According to latest OECD data, the top seven countries where UK aid goes are Pakistan, Ethiopia, India, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Afghanistan and Tanzania. Of UK aid recipients, only Afghanistan and Ethiopia have not been British colonies. Speaking to EurActiv, the Department for International Aid (DfID) recognised that of the 20 countries that received most UK aid in 2013, seven are former British colonies and one is a British Overseas Territory. A spokesperson said it was up to the next government to define priorities for ODA in the same way as the outgoing cabinet did in 2011. At that time, it was mentioned that “as a result of the review [the UK government has] decided to focus aid more tightly on the countries where the UK is well placed to have a significant long-term impact on poverty”. Belgium’s target Belgium, a relatively small country of 11 million people, is the 14th biggest aid donor in the world, according to OECD data. The top seven countries to which Belgian aid are DRC, Burundi, Rwanda, the Palestinian territories, Mali, Mozambique and Vietnam. The first three, which receive the vast majority of Belgian aid, are former colonies. Belgian authorities stress that the country’s ODA has increased by 3.3% compared with 2013, and has stayed at 0.45%, which is slightly above the EU average of 0.42%. According to the minister of development cooperation, Alexander De Croo, the Belgian aid effort should concentrate more on the least developed countries, as well as on sub-Saharan Africa. However, Belgium’s relationship with its former colonies is far from an easy one. With the DRC, a 2008 visit by Karel De Gucht, Belgium’s former foreign minister, exposed the lack of transparency in the exploitation of the country’s mineral resources, calling it “a country where the state is absent”. De Gucht was subsequently declared persona non grata, and it took a long time before fences were mended. With Rwanda, relations are even worse. In January 2015, De Croo announced his intention to place stricter conditions on assistance to developing countries, following his government’s decision to suspend part of its aid to Rwanda. Belgium decided to withhold €40m in aid, after deciding that the Rwandan government had failed to meet commitments to increasing transparency, good governance and freedom of the press. But the real issue appears to be that Rwanda’s president, Paul Kagame, accused Belgium, along with France, of “direct involvement” in the 1994 genocide. Some 800,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed in a four-month killing spree triggered by the assassination of Rwanda’s then-president, the Hutu Juvénal Habyarimana. Spain: strategic interest The first seven beneficiaries of Spanish aid are Peru, Morocco, Colombia, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Ecuador and Bolivia. Only Morocco wasn’t a Spanish colony. However, Spain has interests in the Western Sahara, a disputed territory bordering Morocco, which it ruled between 1884 and 1975. Asked if Spain was giving priority to former Spanish colonies in Latin America, an official declined to answer, and referred instead to documents from the country’s Agency for International Cooperation (AECID), a government department subordinate to the ministry of foreign affairs. Among the criteria for disbursing Spanish aid is the need to contribute where international effort is deemed insufficient, and where the Spanish impact could be greater. Due to the economic crisis, Spain has dramatically reduced its ODA. Consequently, the concept of “geographical concentration” has been introduced, in order to focus on specific regions and on a smaller number of countries. Instead of the 50 countries in the so-called third master plan of Spanish development aid for 2009-12, there were only 23 countries in the fourth master plan (2013-16). “This is why we shall concentrate in geographic areas where Spain has more strategic interest: Latin America, northern Africa, western and sub-Saharan Africa,” wrote José Manuel García Margallo in the introduction to the fourth master plan. Portugal: almost all aid goes to former colonies But the most striking example is Portugal, where almost all the country’s aid goes to former colonies. The first seven are Cabo Verde, Mozambique, Angola, East Timor, São Tome and Principe and Guinea Bissau, all of them former Portuguese colonies. On the other extreme, Germany, a country which has had fewer colonies than any of the other colonial empires, does not prioritise its former territories. Germany transferred €10.6bn development assistance to countries aside from its former colonies in 2013. The top recipient is Afghanistan with €459.7m, followed by India (€450.4m), China (€315m), and Syria (€257.1m). Far lower amounts go to former German colonies. Tanzania receives €139.2m, Cameroon €89.4m, and Namibia €27.5m. The amount paid to Togo makes up €23.2m, to Samoa €3.8m. NGOs criticise the German government for paying development assistance to the wrong countries. Instead, it should focus on the fight against extreme poverty in its budget allocation, the campaigning organisation One said. Half the funds should be given to least developed countries (LDCs), referring to the 48 poorest countries in the world. “To this day, many top receivers of German development aid continue to be G20 countries and newly industrialised countries,” Andreas Hübers, a political adviser at One told EurActiv Germany.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/22/europes-former-imperial-powers-target-aid-ex-colonies,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/22/europes-former-imperial-powers-target-aid-ex-colonies
2015-04-21T13:44:46Z,global-development,Global development,"Escaping Eritrea: 'If I die at sea, it's not a problem – at least I won't be tortured'","Like many of her fellow Eritrean refugees, Sofia, who managed to escape northwards to Cairo, has a very simple reason for fleeing her homeland. “In Eritrea you’re even afraid to talk to your family,” she says. “The person next to me [in a cafe] could be a spy, and they are looking at what you are doing. People disappear every day.” One day, a friend made the innocent mistake of striking up a conversation with a man in a cafe who later turned out to be from the Libyan embassy. “They were just chatting. And they said she was a spy passing information to him. We don’t know what happened to her. She is in jail till now. One day they told us she was in hospital with high blood pressure but we were so afraid that we didn’t go because we feared they might arrest us too.” This, says Sofia, is the daily reality of life in Eritrea, whose citizens are second only to Syrians when it comes to risking dangerous crossings of the Mediterranean in search of a better life in Europe. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), nearly 37,000 Eritreans applied for asylum in 38 European countries over the first 10 months of last year, compared with about 13,000 in the same period in 2013. It puts the total Eritrean refugee population at more than 321,000. The reasons for the exodus are not hard to fathom: last month, a UN inquiry accused the government of President Isaias Afewerki – who has ruled the east African country since its independence from Ethiopia in 1993 – of operating a system of “ruthless repression” and “pervasive state control”. The chair of the inquiry, Mike Smith, noted a culture of “extra-judicial executions, enforced disappearances and incommunicado detentions”, all aimed at silencing critics of the regime.
Given the climate of repression, violence and paranoia – and the indefinite national service that never pays more than $2 a day – asked Smith, “Is it surprising that faced with such challenges, Eritreans leave their country in their hundreds every day?” The Eritrean government responded to the inquiry by criticising its reporting methods. Tesfamicael Gerahtu, an Eritrean diplomat, said his delegation was dismayed at “the protracted reliance on unreliable, unproven and sensational information and interactions”, adding that “preconceived ideas and conclusions” about Eritrea had become rampant. Others bitterly disagree. Elsa Chyrum, director of the UK-based group Human Rights Concern – Eritrea, sums up her homeland in two words: open prison. “There’s no freedom of speech, no freedom of expression, no religious freedom,” she says. “We have more than 300 prisons across the country and people there have no food to eat. Even begging is criminalised in Eritrea.” But equally pernicious, says Chyrum, is the national service that sees 17-year-old students taken from their families and pressed into unending conscription. Some work up to 12 hours a day, six days a week; the less fortunate are sent to work in mines without basic protective equipment. “Many children are brought up without their fathers because their fathers are tied up in conscription for life,” she says. “The whole family unit is completely broken. You see all the unaccompanied children leaving because they don’t want to have a miserable life like their fathers and brothers, so what do they do? They run away. Everybody is running away.”
Meron Estefanos, another Eritrean human rights activist, says those Eritreans with enough money are paying senior government officials up to $5,000 each to leave. Once over the border into Sudan, people smugglers take them by pick-up truck to Libya, where they look for boats to Europe. Most hope to reach Sweden or Norway. Israel – where about 42,000 Eritrean and Sudanese nationals are believed to reside – recently announced that it would begin deporting asylum seekers from the two countries to other African nations. “It’s absurd that Israel doesn’t recognise Eritreans as refugees,” says Estafanos. “They are deporting refugees to Rwanda, where they have no rights. They are being given letters that say they will be granted asylum and work permits in Rwanda and that it’s a great place to live. But as soon as they arrive in Rwanda their documents are being taken away and they have only one or two days before the same people who picked them up from the airport are smuggling the Eritreans out of Rwanda and into Uganda and then God knows what happens.” But even those who, like Sofia, have made it as far as Cairo do not feel safe. Deportations have been recorded from Sudan and Egypt, meaning that in Cairo – where Eritreans are barred from the state education system and face few job prospects – refugees feel vulnerable. Despite the risks of deportation, Sofia does not want to risk travelling to Europe by sea. She does, however, understand what drives her compatriots to climb aboard the crowded and dangerous vessels that ply their trade between Libya and the coast of Europe. “If you want to register [for resettlement] with UNHCR, they give you an appointment for 2017,” she says. “And who can afford to wait that long? It’s better to go [by boat]. I have two choices – one is to die, the other is to live. If I die at sea, it won’t be a problem – at least I won’t be tortured. “Here you don’t have a destiny – you don’t have education, no work, you can’t help your family. Every day you’re just asking for help. But if you go to Europe at least at some point in the future, you will have a nationality and you will be a human.” That desperation is echoed by Eritreans who are being held in a Tripoli detention centre after being intercepted at sea by Libyan coastguards.
“It is not our choice to penetrate the sea,” says Bayin Keflemekal, a 30-year-old nurse. “If we got some help from the Libyan government; from UNHCR, we would try something else. But if the government won’t help us, if UNHCR won’t help us, if no one can help us, then the only option is to go to the smugglers. We are suspended in the air.” Chyrum hopes the deaths of at least 800 people who perished when their boat capsized off the coast of Libya last Sunday will compel European leaders to rethink their approach to Eritrea when they hold an emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday. She is fiercely critical of the EU’s recent decision to try to halt the exodus of Eritreans by sending development aid to the country, arguing that the money will stay in the hands of the political elite. Chyrum says the European funds would be better spent on helping the thousands of Eritreans already in southern Europe or expanding the EU’s Frontex border control agency. If Europe is serious about reducing the flow of people from Eritrea, she says, it needs to use its political, diplomatic and financial influence to bring about change in Asmara. “Unless the root cause is dealt with, people will keep taking risks,” she says. “A lot of pressure needs to be put on the government of Eritrea to stop the indefinite national service, to make life bearable for people and to allow them to live a free life. They have to release all the prisoners of conscience from prison and allow people to choose what they want to do in life.” Unless “tough action” is taken against the Isaias regime, she says, the government will continue acting with impunity, and Eritreans will continue making the long trek north, and fishermen and coastguards will continue fishing bodies from European waters. “It’s a one-person rule, but one person has destroyed the whole country,” says Chyrum. “The future of Eritrea is fleeing and drowning in the Mediterranean.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/21/escaping-eritrea-migrant-if-i-die-at-sea-at-least-i-wont-be-tortured,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/21/escaping-eritrea-migrant-if-i-die-at-sea-at-least-i-wont-be-tortured
2015-04-21T11:47:38Z,global-development,Global development,"Number of people in extreme poverty could be greatly underestimated, report says","Hundreds of millions more people could be living in extreme poverty than official estimates suggest, according to a study about how global development is being hindered by a lack of data about the world’s poorest people. The Data Revolution: Finding the Missing Millions, a report published by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), warns that poorer countries have no way to adequately measure their progress in areas such as poverty, health and education. The ODI claims that the World Bank’s information on the number of people living in poverty could be drastically underestimated because of inadequate data collection. It says that there could be a quarter more people living on $1.25 a day – the World Bank definition of extreme poverty – than the official estimate of 1.01 billion. Across the world, 350 million people might not be included in household surveys, limiting what we know about them. Data gaps are often due to traditional collection methods, such as door-to-door surveys, national censuses and government registrations, which are expensive or too infrequent to measure demographics in highly spread out, dense or shifting populations in, for example, urban slums or desert regions. Between 2006 and 2013, 28 out of 49 countries in sub-Saharan Africa conducted household surveys, said the report. “This means that a quarter of the 414 million people who are estimated to live under $1.25 a day in the region according to the most recent official poverty estimate are derived by extrapolating from surveys dating from 2005 or earlier,” said the report. Researchers claim this data lag means that in 2013, for example (the latest year for which there are figures), the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births could be anywhere between 160 and 290, rather then the estimated 210. The report also says that, globally, we do not accurately know how many people live in cities, the volume of global assets that are held offshore and undeclared to tax authorities, how many girls are married before the age of 18, the percentage of the world’s poor who are women or the size of sub-Saharan Africa’s economy.
“The international community [will not] be able to support the most vulnerable and marginalised people without an overhaul of the current ways of gathering statistics,” said the report. Elizabeth Stuart, research fellow at the ODI and author of the report, said that data is often not available because “the right questions are not being asked, data is not being asked on the right people, or governments choose to not ask certain questions because of political difficulties”. Countries survey their populations at different times and in different ways, meaning that it is often hard to find comparable datasets internationally, the report found. It is also harder to get data about the poorest and most vulnerable people in society, such as people with disabilities and those with mental health problems. The report’s authors said governments can’t hope to tackle poverty and meet other development goals without information about the true scale of the problem. Data collection is expensive and time-consuming, meaning that detailed and accurate surveys are hard to achieve, said the authors. To conduct a household survey in countries such as Tanzania or Malawi, for example, it could cost the governments as much as $36.30 per person.
However, the researchers believed there are several “quick wins” in gaining access to potential data sources. These included opening up the World Bank’s hidden database on income distribution, developing new technologies to allow data to be more readily available, and investing more in government data collection and statistical systems. Stuart said that such methods are required “to help the world’s poorest. You need to know where they live, what they look like and what they need. Data aren’t just about measuring stuff. They’re also vitally important to tell governments what they need to know to be able to lift them out of poverty.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2015/apr/21/number-people-extreme-poverty-overseas-development-institute-report-could-be-greatly-underestimated,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/datablog/2015/apr/21/number-people-extreme-poverty-overseas-development-institute-report-could-be-greatly-underestimated
2015-04-21T06:00:06Z,global-development,Global development,"Chibok: 'For over one year, our children haven't been to school'","Since Boko Haram militants kidnapped 276 girls from her school in Chibok, in April 2014, Ruhab has spent her days at home, cleaning, looking after her siblings and preparing food for her older brother, a civil servant, who often works long hours in the office. “I make sure there’s always some rice and stew when my brother comes home from work,” she says, removing a pot of steaming hot rice from the stove. She is desperate to go back to school. “I believe education is very important, but one year is also a really long time,” she says. “I’ve forgotten so much. My English is not as good as it used to be and if someone asked me to write a paper, or even pick up a pen, I would have tell them there’s no way, I don’t know how to any more.” Before Boko Haram took the girls into the forest, they looted the school and set the buildings ablaze. Today charred classrooms offer testimony of the attack on the girls’ secondary school. Opposite the school, on the dirt road that leads into town, is a military checkpoint. Locals pass here daily on their way to the nearby fields or to fetch water from the school’s well, the only thing that’s still functioning at the former grammar school. No one knows when the school will open again, or if teaching will ever resume. It is understood a British NGO has offered to fund the restoration of the school grounds. The government has accepted, but the governor of Borno State, which belongs to the opposition party, is refusing to accept any help from the federal government. Some parents are demanding the return of their daughters before teaching resumes. There is now no secondary school in Chibok and the surrounding villages, which has a population of about 60,000. Some parents have sent their daughters to schools in Abuja, Lagos or Maiduguri. But many can’t afford the higher school fees and significantly higher living costs involved. Fifteen-year-old Christina’s younger sister is at school in Maiduguri, the state capital, but Christina herself hasn’t been to school since January last year, when rumours of a potential Boko Haram attack began to circulate. “My parents can’t afford to send both my sister and I to school,” says Christina, who believes girls are affected more than boys. “Boys can leave home and go find work in Lagos or Abuja, but we girls, we have no choice but to stay behind. Our parents would never let us go and live in someone’s house and work for them, there’s no way.” Some of her friends have got married and moved in with their husband’s family, says Christina. “Some are even pregnant, and they’re my age.”
Fighting between Boko Haram, the country’s armed forces and civilian self-defence groups has affected hundreds of thousands of children all across Borno State. Over the past year, 800,000 children in the country’s north-east have been forced to leave their homes, according to the UN children’s agency, Unicef. The number of children displaced and living in neighbouring countries as refugees has doubled over the past 12 months, according to the agency. In north-east Nigeria, students and teachers have been deliberately targeted. More than 300 schools have been damaged or destroyed and at least 196 teachers and 314 schoolchildren killed. Two-thirds of schools in Borno remain closed following Boko Haram attacks. Hawa Usman, a teacher in Chibok, says the closing of the school has already affected a whole generation. “For over one year, our children haven’t been to school. For Chibok to not have a school is devastating. It will affect children for years to come,” she says. Rukatu, 19, escaped the rebels by dropping from the truck that was carrying her into the Sambisa forest, the militants’ former stronghold. Sitting in her parents’ home in Chibok she says she wants to continue her studies, but her father, a military man, wants his daughter to get married. On Rukatu’s lap sits her two-month old daughter. “The girl’s father is in Lagos,” she explains. He has yet to meet his daughter. Rukatu is one of the 57 girls who managed to escape. Some have continued their studies in other towns or abroad. Education after Escape, a non-profit organisation set up after the kidnapping, has taken 11 of the girls to the US. Five are studying at the Canyonville Academy in Oregon. A further 21 students are completing their secondary schooling at the American University in Yola. “I’m hoping my parents will allow me to do the same,” says Rukatu. She doesn’t hold much hope that the school in Chibok will reopen anytime soon. Even if it is restored and classes do resume many parents are reluctant to send their daughters to school, fearing that the insurgents, who oppose western education, will attack a second time. Yana Galang’s daughter, also called Rukatu, was abducted by the rebels and is still missing. She doesn’t trust the government to guarantee the safety of the girls. “We have suffered enough. I [wouldn’t] let my daughter go back to that place,” she says. Lawan Zanna, whose daughter Aisha was abducted, remembers his last conversation with her and the promise he made. “I said to her that if she did well [in] her exams, if she came home with good grades, I would pay for her to go to university. I intend to keep my promise, if I ever see my daughter again.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/21/chibok-nigeria-boko-haram-kidnap-girls-school-borno,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/21/chibok-nigeria-boko-haram-kidnap-girls-school-borno
2015-04-20T15:38:22Z,global-development,Global development,Crushing repression of Eritrea's citizens is driving them into migrant boats,"Abinet spent six years completing her national service in one of Eritrea’s ministries, but when she joined a banned Pentecostal church, she was arrested, interrogated, threatened, released and then shadowed in a clumsy attempt to identify other congregants. She arranged to be smuggled out of the country in 2013 and is now in a graduate programme in human rights in Oslo. Like Abinet, hundreds of Eritrean asylum seekers are landing on the shores of Italy. Eritreans are second only to Syrians in the number of boat arrivals, though the country is a fraction of Syria’s size and there’s no live civil war there. Many Eritreans are feared to have drowned in Sunday’s shipwreck in the Mediterranean, from which the death toll could reach 950, with more migrant vessels reported in distress on Monday – the weekend’s incident has caused EU ministers to hold emergency talks on the growing migration crisis. The reason most Eritreans cite for leaving is conscription for national service of indefinite duration, with pay so low their parents have to subsidise them. There were other reasons I heard during the hundreds of interviews I conducted over the past year with Eritrean refugees in North America, Europe, Israel, Africa and Central America. Refugees cited unrelenting abuse and humiliation, constant threat of imprisonment or torture for offending someone in authority, often without even realising how they had done this, or for abetting someone else’s escape or practising a banned religious faith. The EU and a number of its member states are responding to this crisis by offering aid to Eritrea with the aim of reinvigorating its stagnant economy based on unofficial assurances that national service will be scaled back in the future. But they are missing an essential point: the crushing repression of Eritrea’s citizens, especially its youth, is as much a driver of the outflow of people as the lack of economic prospects. Nor are they separate, as the economy is almost completely dominated by the state and ruling party. Money alone will not change this. However, despite the country’s belligerent behaviour in the region and its egregious human rights record, which have long left it isolated, there is an opportunity for engagement given that prominent regime officials have indicated a willingness to reform.
But if the EU and individual states jump too rashly and simply throw money at Eritrea, they risk entrenching the very practices that lie behind much of the exodus, while doing precious little to stem it. Eritrea is dominated by its self-appointed president, Isaias Afwerki. He has surrounded himself with weak institutions, and there is no viable successor. Although the three branches of government – cabinet, national assembly and high court – provide a facade of institutional governance, real power is exercised through informal networks that shift and change at the president’s discretion. Theassembly has not met in a decade, and there is no published national budget. Every important decision is made in secret. Under these circumstances, taking private pledges of reform at face value is a risky proposition. As a minimum, a date for an end to the practice of indefinite national service should be announced, along with a plan for a rolling demobilisation of those who have already served longer than the 18 months designated when the programme was set up in the 1990s. Making this public would make it difficult – not impossible, but harder – for the government to renege on a promise it is quietly making to visiting delegations but not telling its own conscripts. Given President Afwerki’s unbending resistance to such moves in the past, there is reason to be sceptical. Such an announcement would be likely to slow the migration rate of those in military service, and preparing to be called up for it, but more is needed to stem the flow. When I’ve asked refugees, especially recent arrivals, what it would take to get them to go back, there are two things they mention right away: the release of political prisoners, including those jailed for their religious convictions, and the implementation of the constitution, which was ratified in 1997 but has sat on a shelf in the president’s office ever since. It is deeply flawed and needs revision, but it would be a start.
Many also talk about the need for basic freedoms – of press, of speech, of movement, of religion – but the rule of law tops the list, as everyone wants to know what the rules are and that those in power have to play by them, too. Without this, few are likely to take promises of reform seriously. Those policymakers in other countries inclined to re-engage with this regime and offer aid need to use this opportunity to demand hard evidence that change is coming and that it’s more than cosmetic. There are more steps needed to ensure that Eritrea is really on a path from dictatorship to some form of nascent democracy with increased transparency in state affairs, reform of the deeply flawed judicial and penal system, and the nurturing of a political culture in which stable political institutions can take root. Eritrea also needs a structured process of truth and reconciliation to give people back their history and start a process of healing on which this once promising new nation can build a future. And there has to be movement toward normalising relations with its neighbours, including Ethiopia. But one step at a time. One thing is certain: if the wrong steps are taken at the outset – or false hope is raised and no steps taken – what little hope still flickers within the younger generation inside Eritrea will be further dimmed, more will flee, and it will be much, much harder to convince any of them to go back soon. • Dan Connell is a visiting researcher at the Boston University African Studies Centre, who has been writing about Eritrea for nearly 40 years",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/20/crushing-repression-eritreas-citizens-italy-migrant-boats,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/20/crushing-repression-eritreas-citizens-italy-migrant-boats
2015-04-20T13:22:24Z,global-development,Global development,EU must pull its weight to help create a better global financial system,"No one said the fight for a better global financial system would be easy. Last week’s negotiations in the UN’s financing for development (FfD) process, which will lead to a high-level conference in Addis Ababa in July, showed exactly how tough the battle is going to be.
Although the discussion is ultimately about money, FfD is not a fundraising event. It focuses on systemic issues such as illicit financial flows, sovereign debt crisis, private financial flows, trade, investment and global governance. Improving these would greatly contribute to the eradication of poverty and to financing sustainable development. The world needs urgent change. The report of the high level panel on illicit financial flows from Africa concluded that they “range from at least $30 billion to $60 billion a year”, making Africa “a net creditor to the world rather than a net debtor, as is often assumed”. In the EU, the estimated loss through tax dodging is €1tn per year. Rather than working together, governments are currently fighting about who gets to decide what should be done. Developed countries insist that the OECD – also known as the “rich countries club” – should be the centre of global tax negotiations. This would exclude more than 100 developing countries from negotiations, while countries such as Luxembourg and Switzerland – a key part of the problem – get to be in the room. Developing countries are calling for an intergovernmental tax body under the UN, where they do have a seat at the table. The EU – strong supporters of the UN as the forum to adopt sustainable development goals and climate treaties – last week rejected this. It argued that such a body would be unnecessary “institutional proliferation”. In response, the negotiator from India commented: “We find it a bit odd that we speak about a common agenda for everybody, and then we defend the right of an exclusive club to make policy on an issue which not only affects everybody, but also is central to the financing discourse.”
The EU is, on the other hand, promoting public-private partnerships and the use of overseas aid to support companies investing in development – often referred to as “blending”. The opportunities that “blending” hold for western companies are clear, since donor countries often choose their own companies as partners in these projects. The G77 – a group of more than 130 developing countries – is sceptical, stating: “The advantages for developing countries regarding the concept of blended finance are unclear and should further be explained.” Civil Society has pointed out that private investors are more attracted to middle-income countries, which can provide better opportunities for profit. This risks driving aid away from the least developed countries. The shift towards profits also risks promoting tools such as user fees for infrastructure, or health and education services, which the poorest people are unable to pay. The G77 representative highlighted that: “The issue of public-private partnerships is important, but we want to caution that there are some risks and that those risks need to be mitigated. There is the experience that sometimes it is the government that is left with all the costs and the private sector with all the profits.” One can sometimes get the impression that the EU’s strong focus on private finance is an attempt to divert attention away from the fact it has never fulfilled its commitment to deliver 0.7% of gross national income as aid. The negotiator from the group of Least Developed Countries stressed that governments “should not go to Addis just to reconfirm commitments made 40 years ago”. They called for a scaling up of aid commitments, for concrete timetables for reaching the commitments, and for improving the quality of aid, including full untying of aid (lifting requirements by some donors that aid be spent on goods and services provided by companies based in their own countries, or a limited number of countries). Debt is also a sensitive issue. After Argentina’s struggles with vulture funds, as well as increasing debt levels and crisis risks around the world, an intergovernmental process has been launched under the UN general assembly, with the aim of developing an international debt workout mechanism.
Despite its own crisis, the EU chose to boycott the first session of this process during negotiations and now refuses to include references to the UN discussion in the Addis Ababa outcome document. Meanwhile, countries such as China and Russia are working constructively with the G77 on a better debt management regime. The pressure on the EU is growing. Developing countries complain about EU countries using aid to pressure poorer African nations to stop supporting G77 positions on systemic reforms. If true, this would not be the first time such tactics have been used in UN negotiations. Ultimately, if the goals are not ambitious enough, there is a risk that the negotiations will collapse. This would seriously undermine the chances of reaching an agreement on the sustainable development goals – planned for adoption in September in New York – and would jeopardise the Climate Summit in Paris from 30 November to 11 December 2015. Collapse would also mean the continued failure of intergovernmental cooperation. This would be devastating for the poorest countries and those in crisis due to natural disasters, poverty, disease, debt, food or financial collapse. It could also lead to more countries becoming tax havens, thereby increasing tax dodging and escalating inequality. Negotiations continue in May.

2015-04-18T08:00:01Z,global-development,Global development,Sustainable development must prioritise women's sexual health | Sarah Shaw,"At this moment we stand on the brink – we have the chance to ensure that for the first time, women and girls will have the rights and services that they are entitled to. By ensuring that women and girls have the ability to decide their family size, their futures and their lives, we are able to change the face of the world. At this moment global leaders are finalising the post-2015 framework. The new goals – and the targets within those goals – that will be agreed by world leaders over the next few months will replace the millennium development goals, which were agreed in 2000 to last until this year. It is our opportunity to make the change that we need to see a reality. Over the past two months, the UN has hosted two annual commissions that have looked at the post-2015 development agenda, and specifically how it relates to gender equality, population and sexual and reproductive health and rights.
In March, at the Commission on the Status of Women, governments at the UN recognised the importance of gender equality for achieving sustainable development. And this month the Commission on Population and Development – which tracks progress of the programme of action laid out in the ground-breaking International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) – gives one of the last opportunities to focus on the link between sexual and reproductive health and rights and development. Governments have accepted this argument and see how central these issues are in achieving poverty eradication and a more equitable world. The open working group proposal on the sustainable development goals is calling for all countries by 2030 to ensure that all individuals have access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services. This includes family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes. It also sees sexual and reproductive health and rights as a gender equality issue, and further says that countries must also ensure “universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights as agreed in accordance with the programme of action of the ICPD and the Beijing platform for action and the outcome documents of their review conferences”.
While they may seem similar, these two targets are significantly different and it is only when people have access to the health services as well as being empowered to realise their rights that we will see women who are able to escape domestic violence, girls who are not forced into marriage, and young people who are able to stay in school and become positive members of their communities. Health services alone are not enough; there must be action to enable individuals to understand and exercise their rights. We have not reached the end of this road. Despite the positive references in the open working group proposal and the outcomes of the two commissions, it is still all to play for. Between now and September, governments will continue to discuss the proposals for the post-2015 development framework, and there is no guarantee that one, if not both, references to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights will remain in the document. While there is a lot of support from governments from every region, there is still opposition. There are some countries that would like to block attempts to promote gender equality and initiatives that would give women control over their lives. If this happens, we will be failing the 800 mothers who die each day from preventable causes, the 225 million women who want contraception yet can’t get access it, and the young people who are not given the sexual education to protect themselves from HIV. It is for these women that we need to keep pushing for sexual and reproductive health, and sexual and reproductive rights, to stay in the post-2015 development framework. Women and girls deserve equality and health services, but above all, they deserve to live and prosper. We are on the brink of a global change. We can make that happen.

2015-04-17T12:56:37Z,global-development,Global development,"Dadaab refugee camp closure would endanger 350,000 Somali lives, warns Amnesty","Amnesty International has joined the UN and others in urging Kenya to halt its plans to close the world’s largest refugee complex, arguing that forcing the 350,000 Somalis in Dadaab to return home would put their lives at risk and breach international law. Kenya ordered the closure of the camp last week after members of the Somali Islamist group al-Shabaab attacked Garissa University College on 2 April, killing 148 people. Although the Kenyan government has long viewed Dadaab as a breeding ground for al-Shabaab and often called for it to be shut, its language has become increasingly blunt in the aftermath of Garissa and the 2013 attack on the Westgate shopping centre. Last Saturday, the country’s deputy president, William Ruto, said Kenya would now change “the way America changed after 9/11”, adding: “We have asked the UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) to relocate the refugees in three months”. Ruto said that if the UN failed, “we shall relocate them ourselves”. The UNHCR has described the plan as abrupt and warned that it would have “extreme humanitarian and practical consequences”. On Thursday, Amnesty also called on Kenya to reconsider the decision and honour its responsibility to protect those within its borders.
“The attack in Garissa underlined the need for the Kenyan government to better guarantee the security of its population,” said Muthoni Wanyeki, the group’s regional director for east Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes. “But this must not be done by putting at risk people Kenya is duty-bound to protect.” Amnesty says that Somalia’s government simply does not have enough control over many parts of the country. “General violence and insecurity persists and residents have frequently been subject to both indiscriminate and targeted attacks,” it said in a statement. “If refugees are sent back to these areas, they risk human rights abuses, such as rape and killings, as well as extortion.” The move has also been opposed by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and Human Rights Watch. “Such a drastic measure in an impossibly short timeframe would deprive generations of refugees of any choices for their future,” said Charles Gaudry, MSF’s head of mission in Kenya. “This is a move that would punish hundreds of thousands of people, forcing them to return to a country where safety and medical care is far from guaranteed, and in some places is non-existent.”
Leslie Lefkow, deputy Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said “unlawfully forcing almost half a million Somali refugees back home to face a real risk to their lives and freedom” would not serve the interests of justice. She added: “Instead of scapegoating refugees, Kenya is legally obliged to protect them until it is safe for them to return, and should identify and prosecute those responsible for the killings in Garissa.” On Wednesday, the UN called on the Kenyan government to reconsider its demands. “The main issue is the voluntariness of returns,” said UNHCR spokeswoman Karin de Gruijl. “If these people were forced to return, it could be in breach of international law and UNHCR would not facilitate such a move.” The 1951 UN Refugee Convention, to which Kenya is a party, prohibits forcing refugees back to areas where their life or freedom is threatened, a practice known as refoulement. The UNHCR also says large-scale returns of refugees are still not possible in many parts of Somalia, where public services such as schools and healthcare are lacking after 20 years of conflict.
However, the agency said it was ready to work with Kenyan authorities to strengthen law enforcement at Dadaab to help protect refugees and Kenyans against possible intrusion by armed groups or “terrorist incursions” from across the border. At its peak, Dadaab held 500,000 Somali refugees, many of whom had fled famine in 2001, said de Grujil.
“The majority of the people who are still in the camp are those who have been there for a very long time – including some of them for generations.” Njonjo Mue, of the human rights coalition Kenyans for Peace, Truth and Justice, said the logistics of emptying Dadaab “boggles the mind” and could play into al-Shabaab’s hands. “Basically, we would be handing over to al-Shabaab a ready-made army of, say, 200,000 young men who will be desperate and who will have nothing to do,” he told Reuters. Last week, several NGOS criticised the Kenyan government’s decision to close 13 remittance companies specialising in money transfers to Somalia as part of its response to the Garissa atrocity. The authorities, which have been condemned for their slow response to the massacre, faced further embarrassment on Tuesday after it emerged that a plane meant to transport commandos to the scene of the attack was instead being used to fly the family of a police chief back from a family holiday on the coast.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/17/dadaab-refugee-camp-closure-risk-350000-somali-lives-amnesty,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/17/dadaab-refugee-camp-closure-risk-350000-somali-lives-amnesty
2015-04-17T12:30:16Z,global-development,Global development,"'Women need the same rights as men, because development needs equality'","This week, ministers and women’s rights activists convened in New York for the annual Commission on Population and Development, which assesses progress against agreements made at a conference in Cairo in 1994. We asked members of Resurj, a global alliance of young feminists, what their governments are doing to support young women and the changes they would like to see. Samah Krichah, Le Labo’ Démocratique, Tunisia
As a young Arab woman living in a very unstable region of the world, my interest in women’s rights, as well as sexual and reproductive health and rights, have an added dimension: the impact on those rights of conflicts and [extremely] conservative societies. For a long time, women in my region were held back at almost all levels and were [and still are] seen only as victims. This is to some extent a true reflection of the situation, since women are constantly victims of different types of violence and sexual abuse in my region, from discriminatory national policies to harassment, [and] from rape to – now, more recently – being sold as slaves by Isis. However, development needs equality: women being regarded the same way as men and enjoying the same rights. The goal of this year’s Commission on Population and Development is to integrate population issues into sustainable development. From my point of view, nothing can be done without women enjoying their rights and liberty, possessing their bodies and being fully acknowledged as actors of development and part of decision-making process at all levels, especially in the context of peacebuilding and peacemaking. Nzira Deus, Movfemme, Mozambique
Often, sexual and reproductive programmes in Mozambique ignore the social and cultural factors that prevent young women and girls from making healthy decisions, thus making them vulnerable to undesired pregnancy, sexual violence and debilitating health conditions such as obstetric fistulas. In rural areas, cultural practices such as initiation rites and early marriage have a negative impact on the sexual and reproductive health of girls and young women. Initiation rites teach girls to behave as adult women, making them abandon school and get married early. Unfortunately, in rural areas girls do not have access to information about their rights and bodies, safe spaces to talk freely, or friendly services. Rural hospitals lack trained people to provide information, and some of them are not responsive to the needs and rights of girls. There is also a lack of contraceptives other than male condoms, but in my country it is difficult for a young woman to negotiate the use of a condom with a male. As a result, girls and young women are more likely to become pregnant and risk their lives obtaining an unsafe abortion. The government needs to focus more attention on programmes that inform young women and girls about their sexual and reproductive rights. Policies must not just stay on paper, but must be implemented, being mindful that rural areas have different needs from urban centres. The government needs to adopt creative mechanisms to educate and spread information in rural areas, taking into account the context as well as the diversity of languages and cultures. It is important to develop the leadership of young women from rural areas, and bring them to the policy-making table so their voices can be heard and they can propose solutions for their problems. We need to eliminate the stigma of youth sexuality and challenge negative practices and culture, because no culture should ever trump human rights. Natasha Sajjad, Rutgers WPF Pakistan, Pakistan
In Pakistan, adolescents are the least considered sector of the population. They’re often forgotten from development discourses and excluded from policy dialogue. Puberty is never discussed, and the most that is said is, “You’re growing up.” With the onset of menstruation, all a girl is told is: “Be extremely careful or your clothes will get stained and that will be shameful … And oh! Keep it a secret!” So the confusion and turmoil that they are going though, the physical and emotional changes they are experiencing, are completely ignored. In fact, when asked, adults often say, “No one told us. They too will figure it out.” And adolescents do figure it out, through friends, browsing the internet or by going to back-alley quacks. They also figure it out by being sexually abused, becoming child brides, having unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions and sexually transmitted infections. In Pakistan, sexual and reproductive rights are not a reality. For adolescents, especially for adolescent girls, this is a distant dream. Providing adolescents with contextualised information and education on sexuality doesn’t happen. Services related to their sexual and reproductive health are not readily available either. Though adolescents are the flag-bearers of sustainable development, no one realises that holistic development isn’t possible without the basic human right of sexual and reproductive health.
We have a long path to travel. It is important that existing policies are implemented appropriately and, even more importantly, implemented with a human face. There is a need for a push from the international community in getting sexual and reproductive rights acknowledged and acted upon. When the international community came together in Cairo in 1994 and placed the individual at the centre of population issues, talking about the reproductive rights of individuals, this enabled Pakistan to introduce programmes on reproductive health. The post-2015 development framework needs to have a strong focus on sexual and reproductive health and rights for adolescents, especially girls, to give Pakistan the much-needed push to address their needs. Mariana Mancilla, Balance, Mexico
The decisions that women make about our sexual and reproductive health can impact the entire span of our lives and determine whether we feel safe, free and happy. Yet the majority of young women in Latin America are not able to make these decisions freely. In Mexico City, for example, abortion has been legalised up to 12 weeks, but this helps only those women who live in the city, or have the financial means to travel there. Reproductive justice remains elusive for millions of other women. Many of the governments in my region continue to side with fundamentalist forces, trading away women’s rights, especially our sexual and reproductive rights. We need a clear – and complete – separation between the church and state. We need our governments to create international agreements and public policies based on human rights, in particular the right of younger women to control their bodies and their reproductive life. As our governments negotiate the sustainable development goals, it’s important to remind them that young people should not only be valued for their role in reducing poverty. All of our human rights must be recognised. Young people, especially young women, have a right to a quality education and access to youth-friendly sexual and reproductive health services that comply with our needs to control all aspects of our sexual lives. Only then will we achieve truly sustainable development. Diakhoumba Gassama, Senegalese Council of Women, Senegal
Although Senegal has signed numerous African and international agreements guaranteeing universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights, Senegalese young people, especially young women, are still not able to exercise their fundamental rights to have control over and decide freely on matters related to their bodily integrity, sexuality, reproduction, sexual orientation and gender identity. This is the result not only of the lack of implementation of progressive laws, but also the pervasive culture of silence among families, communities and even service providers on matters regarding sexuality. To address this, youth centres have been created to provide sex education, but they are restricted to certain age groups (mostly 15-19) and heavily influenced by patriarchal and religious views, limiting evidence-based information on HIV and Aids prevention, family planning, and sexual and gender-based violence prevention. The lack of investment in rights-based comprehensive sex education means very few young women use sexual and reproductive health services before the age of 18, less than a third of those aged 15 to 24 have profound knowledge on HIV, and many single women have unsatisfied contraceptive needs. Senegal’s very restrictive law on abortion (which is still illegal even in cases of rape and incest) is currently being debated, thanks to various feminist and human rights collectives asking for urgent reform. Hopefully, decriminalisation will reduce the number of unsafe abortions, which account for 13% of maternal deaths. In a country that prides itself as a leader for democracy and gender equality, Senegal must take the necessary steps to ensure that young women have access to sexuality education. Only by providing them with the information they need to protect and enjoy their reproductive health and rights will Senegalese young women be equipped to fully contribute and participate in the development of Senegal as a resilient nation. Sarah Gold, International Women’s Health Coalition, US
The current Commission on Population and Development feels like the crossroads of two age-old wars – the war on women and the war on people living in poverty. As I hear governments debating my right to make decisions about my own body, I feel a little sick. As I hear my government and those of other developed countries burying their heads in the sand, pretending not to see the enormous economic inequalities between developed and developing countries, my heart sinks. I think about what these debates taking place in fancy negotiating rooms at the UN really mean for women in my own community. Two-thirds of women who get abortions in the US cite not being able to afford a child as one of the main reasons for their decision. The perverse irony is that, under most circumstances, the US government continues to deny federal funding for abortion to American women, including those enrolled in Medicaid, our country’s health insurance programme for low-income communities. The same women struggling to secure housing, health insurance, and a living wage are being denied a say in the shape of their own lives and families. These wars can only be won if we fight for economic and reproductive justice together. As governments define development priorities for 2015 and beyond, we need them to stand up for our sexual and reproductive rights as well as our economic and social rights. Strategies to address poverty in the US and in all countries cannot neglect access to abortion, among other critical sexual and reproductive healthcare services. And strategies to advance sexual and reproductive rights are incomplete without tackling the deeply rooted inequalities within and between countries. We can only thrive when all of our human rights are respected, protected and fulfilled.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/17/commission-population-development-new-york-young-feminists,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/17/commission-population-development-new-york-young-feminists
2015-04-17T10:57:44Z,global-development,Global development,Paraguay activists ensure government's oil ambitions will be no walk in the park | Laurence Blair,"Paraguay’s Chaco region, the northern part of an arid 650,000 sq km plain stretching from Argentina to Brazil and Bolivia, is no stranger to fighting over land and the wealth it contains. The latest threat of conflict is in a corner of the Chaco, where President Horacio Cartes is considering oil exploration in the Defensores del Chaco national park. It is estimated that 4bn barrels of oil lie beneath the 7,000 sq km park, in which thorny scrub is home to big cats, monkeys and tapir. The site also contains the emblematic Cerro León: a unique ring of forested hills 40km in diameter. Critics fear that potential drilling could wipe out one of the region’s few remaining bastions of biodiversity, and that contamination of the area’s vital river systems will hurt not only local residents – including the Ayoreo, a semi-nomadic people who have lived in the region for millennia – but the entire country. Others allege that the government is trying to push through a deal with foreign investors to benefit the wealthy few. A small but vocal crowd aired their complaints at an evening protest in the capital, Asunción, on Tuesday. A group of about 100 gathered on the steps of the National Pantheon of Heroes, holding placards and chanting, “Cerro León, no se toca!” (Don’t touch Cerro León) and “Cartes fuera!” (Cartes out). “I came here to defend my country. I’m defending what my father did as a soldier in the war of the Chaco,” said Margarita López, outside the historic building dedicated to the memory of Paraguay’s military heroes. “In the name of him and of all my family, I come to defend this little piece of the patria that’s now being sold down the river, by the same governors who should be defending it,” she added as her teenage daughter nodded in agreement. The group blamed the destruction of the countryside on Cartes’s commitment to the “agro-export model,” far-reaching marijuana trafficking networks, and foreign-owned soybean estates. Paraguayans have reason to be wary of the government’s aims, explained Diego Mereles, one of the young founders of the Defenders of the Chaco group. The state is already carving out rocks from Cerro León, reportedly for roadworks, despite ministry of public works (MOPC) documents previously claiming to be extracting minerals “nearby”. “We don’t buy this story that they’re taking out rocks to build roads,” said Mereles. “In reality, we think that at the bottom of the Cerro León issue is something else … companies are coming from other countries to destroy our land.
“It’s not the first time; they’re always looking to find petroleum, but we think they’re looking to sell off the whole Paraguayan Chaco. We don’t believe anything that Cartes says.”When the group reached the MOPC’s glass facade, activists aimed fiery rhetoric at two police officers. The officers were backed by a group of armed colleagues a few metres away, at the end of the street – a necessary precaution in a country facing a low-level insurgency from armed peasant groups near the eastern border with Brazil. Late on Friday, the MOPC announced an environmental review of whether to grant exploration rights at Cerro León to the interested Peruvian firm. A meeting was scheduled on Tuesday. But the review process is plagued with duplicity, protesters claimed. The Cartes administration denies having any plans to authorise exploration in the national park itself, and says that a provisional licence from the MOPC to operate nearby is dependent on approval from the environment ministry. Yet the economic rationale behind moves to embrace oil is clear. Paraguay’s 6.8 million residents used 27,000 barrels of crude a day in 2013, all of which had to be imported from Argentina and Bolivia. It’s an expensive but necessary operation, after Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez cancelled a cheap oil deal in 2012 following the impeachment of Fernando Lugo, Paraguay’s radical former president, a decision that saddled the state oil firm Petropar with a $260m debt. An estimated 4bn barrels are thought to lie under the Chaco, and previous government claims that it holds 14bn cubic litres – “the largest reserves of oil and natural gas that humanity has ever known” according to one former minister – would rank Paraguay above Venezuela and Saudi Arabia in the fossil fuel stakes. The government, meanwhile, claims that the profits from hydrocarbon exports could help to eliminate the poverty that’s dogged Paraguay since it declared independence in 1811. But Sarah Bracho, an activist, cited the example of Paraguay’s showpiece hydroelectric projects – including the colossal Itaipu dam shared with Brazil – as evidence that such trickle-down economics rarely works. “Right now we ourselves are an exporter of electrical energy, and we’re yet to benefit from that, so what’s to make us think that these petrol reserves will benefit us in any way?” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/17/paraguay-oil-exploration-defensores-del-chaco-national-park,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/17/paraguay-oil-exploration-defensores-del-chaco-national-park
2015-04-16T23:01:09Z,global-development,Global development,World Water Forum needs to be more than just a trade show for privatisation | Satoko Kishimoto,"The world may have met the target for access to safe drinking water set out by the millennium development goals, but work remains for world leaders assembling this week at the 2015 World Water Forum in South Korea. They must be held accountable for the 748 million people who still lack access to an improved source of water, as well as the estimated 1.8 billion who consume contaminated water. Despite grand pledges to realise the human right to water, huge inequalities remain across regions, between urban and rural areas, and between rich and poor neighbourhoods. The global gathering has traditionally been like a trade show promoting water privatisation – and that will again be the message, albeit wrapped in the newer “public-private partnership (PPP) as innovative investment” discourse. It’s high time we stopped chasing this mirage. The private water agenda is based on a false premise. PPPs are not an innovative financing mechanism. They are a cherry picking exercise, one that grants water multinationals the most attractive contracts (and all profits), while governments assume the risks and citizens struggle to pay soaring bills for often poor quality water services. Governments and local authorities would do well to listen to the resounding cry from Jakarta. The central Jakarta district court’s 24 March decision to annul privatised water contracts in order to protect residents’ human right to water in the megacity shows how private operators put profit before people. The court ruling comes after a lengthy class action lawsuit against private operators PAM Lyonnaise Jaya (Palyja) and Aetra Air Jakarta (Aetra) over their poor water service coverage (59%), failure to meet investment obligations, astounding leakage levels (44%) and fourfold water tariff increase over just a dozen years. Far from fulfilling the promise of infrastructure investment and new technology, the private operators in Jakarta simply sat on their guaranteed 22% profit and neglected users. Not surprisingly, research by the Public Services International Research Unit, which monitors water privatisation, shows that – despite the big expansion of PPPs in recent years – financing for water infrastructure comes predominantly from public sources. The figure may be as high as 90%. The recent book Our public water future: The global experience with remunicipalisation demonstrates that Jakarta is not an isolated case. It reveals that, over the past 15 years, 235 cities and communities have reclaimed their water system in 37 countries, impacting more than 100 million people. Moreover, the pace of what has been termed the “remunicipalisation” trend has accelerated dramatically, doubling in the 2010-15 period compared with 2000-10.
Policymakers are opting for remunicipalisation for pragmatic reasons rather than ideological ones, as evidence shows that the public sector can provide better services. Interestingly, the great majority of remunicipalisations have taken place in two countries: France (94), home of two of the world’s private water companies, Suez and Veolia, and the US (58). In the first year following the flagship remunicipalisation of water in Paris, the new municipal operator Eau de Paris realised efficiency savings of €35m (£25m). What is more, the public utility prioritised environmental conservation measures and set up a unique body through which the public can have a say in how the company is run. If people in countries that have championed privatisation are saying no, isn’t it time to stop imposing it on the rest of the world? Undistracted from trying to compete for markets, public water operators are now joining forces within and across countries through public-public partnerships (PuPs) to share learning and best practices, and to facilitate the remunicipalisation process. If the World Water Forum is serious about its goal to implement solutions to the global water crisis, it must change direction. The disastrous privatisation experiment must be put to bed and investment made in accountable public solutions that can deliver the human right to water for all.

2015-04-16T15:04:32Z,global-development,Global development,Tensions build over scheduling of Guinea's elections | Vincent Foucher,"Guinea’s history of electoral violence may not be over. Tension is building around the presidential poll scheduled for this October and the local elections planned for early next year. The opposition – principally Cellou Dalein Diallo’s Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea and Sidya Touré’s Union of Republican Forces – is concerned about possible fraud. Threatened protests should be taken seriously: in 2013, about 100 people died during electoral unrest. To set the stage for a comprehensive dialogue about the voting system, the local elections should be rescheduled for this year, so that they take place before the presidential ballot. International actors, in particular the UN Office for West Africa and the EU, would then need to support that dialogue and ensure its results are implemented. Unlike other African countries with contentious electoral processes, Guinea’s problem is not one of an incumbent president delaying a vote or trying for an unconstitutional new term. The opposition’s quarrel is with the order of the two elections. They are convinced that the local authorities, whose mandate formally expired in 2010, are completely under the president’s control. These local officials, some of whom have been replaced by administrative appointees in constituencies where the opposition has weight, are said to have been responsible for a variety of disenfranchisement schemes in pro-opposition areas during the 2013 legislative elections. They have also been accused of massaging the vote in pro-government areas. The opposition fears a repeat in the presidential contest unless earlier local polls give them a better chance to get fair play. Before agreeing to the 2013 legislative elections, the opposition had insisted that the next round of local elections be held well before the presidential ballot, in early 2014. This was written into an annex of an agreement resulting from the 2013 political dialogue, but the government did not sign the document and now disputes the commitment. Pro-government politicians do not support the schedule change (and possible delay of the presidential vote), fearing the opposition would claim there was a constitutional vacuum, as some opposition figures have threatened. But contemporary Guinea has experienced many exceptional situations – three- and five-year delays for the legislative and local elections respectively, for example. This would not cause it to crumble. In informal discussions, some opposition leaders said they would agree to a reasonable delay in the presidential election were it necessary in order to hold the local vote first.
The controversy, however, goes well beyond the calendar. The opposition has also repeatedly challenged the electoral registry, the map of constituencies, the composition and functioning of the electoral commission and the constitutional court. Not to mention the conditions for diaspora voting, the neutrality of prefects and governors, and much more. Even the recent population census is disputed: the opposition says the authorities inflated results in pro-government areas, in order to prepare to justify a forthcoming increase in pro-government voters there. Reliable observation missions (particularly the EU’s) noted a long list of problems in the 2010 and 2013 elections. In 2013, for instance, the number of 18-year-old voters registered was unusually high in some pro-government areas, as was the level of participation and the number of voting stations. The number of polling stations and votes invalidated on procedural grounds was correspondingly low. In the closely disputed swing state of Guinée Forestière, the results from more than 180 polling stations were cancelled without explanation. Some or all of the opposition claims may be false or exaggerated, but why take the chance over a few months’ change in the electoral calendar? As Crisis Group wrote in December 2014, a consensus on arrangements would offer the best chance to avoid an escalation from local incidents fuelled by political affiliations that function largely along ethnic lines. Such a consensus would be all the more valuable because worrying rumours and suspicions are being fed by other matters, including the Ebola epidemic and a handful of assassinations and attempted assassinations of politicians and administrators. The opposition’s spokesperson, Aboubacar Sylla, claims he was shot at on 4 April, for example. While President Alpha Condé has done a good job of reining in the military and other security forces, sustained troubles could put these important achievements at risk and further poison relations between the country’s communities. The government called for dialogue on 26 March. The opposition responded that there had been two such dialogues in 2013-14; the authorities simply needed to implement the conclusions reached then. It is up to the government to take the first step by asking the electoral commission to schedule the local elections before the presidential (with a reasonable three- to six-month interval between them). This would build confidence and could pave the way for a dialogue covering the other pending electoral issues. In turn, the opposition should commit to that dialogue and produce a detailed, realistic and time-sensitive assessment of what it considers essential. In all this, international engagement is essential. In 2013, European observers stayed several nights at a key tallying centre in Conakry to guarantee results would not be tampered with. That is how tense the situation has been, and why an international presence is so essential. President Condé initially excluded such missions for this year, but he has changed his position: the authorities have approached the EU for observers, and the UN is due to dispatch a mission this month to review electoral preparations. The new secretary general of the International Organisation of la Francophonie has visited Conakry. These are welcome moves. International partners will need to develop a solid coordinating mechanism, however, to prevent Guinean actors playing them off against each other. • Vincent Foucher is senior analyst for west Africa at the International Crisis Group",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/16/tensions-guinea-elections-presidential-ballot-opposition,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/16/tensions-guinea-elections-presidential-ballot-opposition
2015-04-16T10:59:19Z,global-development,Global development,We need a new Jubilee campaign to achieve equality and sustainability | Alex Evans,"The millennium development goals (MDGs) were agreed 15 years ago against a backdrop of unprecedented popular campaigning. The Jubilee debt campaign was at the heart of it. When the G8 met in Birmingham in 1998, for instance, tens of thousands of Jubilee protesters formed a human chain around the city centre. It was an unparalleled mobilisation, with unprecedented results: low-income countries’ debt fell from 69% of their national income in 2000 to 29% today. Now we face a year in which similarly groundbreaking mobilisation is needed. The world is struggling to muster the political will for a 2C climate deal at the COP21 conference in Paris. And there is little sign of an action plan for delivering the new sustainable development goals that matches the ambitious nature of the targets themselves. The goals will be agreed in New York in September.
The Jubilee debt campaign succeeded in large part because it was based around a powerful framing. The biblical idea of Jubilee – a festival that the Israelites were supposed to observe every 49 or 50 years, when all debts were to be forgiven – resonated with people far beyond the church groups that formed the campaign’s backbone. But the campaign was always about more than debt relief. For one thing, Jubilee campaigns were about sufficiency, recognition of sustainable limits and the need for nature to rest. Each Jubilee year was also a Sabbath year – a time of “solemn rest for the land”, as the Bible puts it. No crops were sown; people lived off what the land produced naturally. These years were about rest for poor people, too. Liberty was proclaimed throughout the land; everyone, slaves included, was free to go home. No one was to lend money to poor people at interest, or sell them food for profit. They were also about the fair allocation of wealth. Jubilees called for a managed reset of land ownership, which – in the agrarian context of the time – was effectively a reboot of wealth distribution, designed to reduce inequality. These three themes – living within environmental limits, ensuring everyone can meet their basic needs, and keeping inequality from getting out of hand – are at the heart of the sustainable development agenda. And they are also, we argue in a Tearfund report published on Thursday, the three defining features of a restorative economy – a new growth model that would embed these Jubilee principles right at its heart. The genesis of our report was the recognition of a paradox: that while the past 15 years have in many ways been a golden age for poverty reduction, they have also made it clear that the more our current economic model succeeds at development, the more it fails on sustainability. The Earth’s life support systems have become stretched to breaking point as more people achieve greater affluence. Tearfund is already seeing the consequences of this for people living in poverty with whom it works. To resolve the problem, a transformation of our economy is needed. And given the formidable barriers to this happening – inertia, vested interests, institutions built for another age, public apathy – a new theory of influence is needed too.
As the report sets out, this is going to mean less time spent on insider lobbying and more on building a movement that lives the values of a restorative economy and mobilises to demand political change – exactly what we saw in the US civil rights struggle, the campaign to abolish slavery, and other movements that have overcome apparently impossible odds. We think the movement will be shaped by a few key shifts in perspective. We need to move our thinking from “people like us” to just “people – like us”. We need to look longer-term – beyond the next news cycle, the next financial quarter, the next election. We should also be moving towards a different good life – one that understands that security, wellbeing and consumption do not mean the same thing. These themes are vividly present in the notion of Jubilee – an idea intimately bound up with the restoration of right relationships between God, people and creation. In the 1990s, development campaigners began a momentous undertaking that changed how millions of people see the world and the life chances of hundreds of millions living in poverty. Now, it is time to complete our unfinished millennium Jubilee through changes in our lifestyles – from living within our fair share of the world’s resources to using our power as voters, citizens and consumers – and in how we campaign for transformative political change. • Richard Gower is co-author of the Tearfund report, and director of Foresight Economics consultancy",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/16/millennium-jubilee-campaign-equality-sustainable-development-goals,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/16/millennium-jubilee-campaign-equality-sustainable-development-goals

2015-04-16T04:01:07Z,global-development,Global development,Why the Mundra power plant has given Tata a mega headache,"Tata Mundra was supposed to herald a new era of cheap energy for India. Instead, to date, it has served as an example of the tension between development and traditional ways of life. The first of 16 “ultra mega power projects” (UMPP) planned by the Indian government, Mundra – an enormous 4,150MW coal-fired power station named after the coastal area that is its planned site – would use modern technology to provide affordable electricity to five Indian states. Part-funded by a $450m (£300m) loan from the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank arm that lends to private companies, it has consistently been described by Tata Power, which won the government contract to build the power station, as “arguably the most energy-efficient, coal-based thermal power plant in the country”. But in 2011 a tiny fishing village complained to a World Bank ombudsman that, for them, the reality was ash falling from the sky, destruction of a marine environment essential to their way of life, and failure by the World Bank even to acknowledge them as an affected people. The Wagher, a Muslim minority described by the Indian government as “a socially and educationally backward caste”, say that fishing communities have lived on the Mundra coast for centuries. They practise a traditional form of fishing using nets in the shallows at low tide to catch shoals of fish washed in when the tide rises. The fish are thendried on the sand before being taken to market. The Association for the Struggle for Fishworkers’ Rights (Mass), a community group representing the Wagher, says that the Mundra plant has damaged the villagers’ livelihoods, in effect displacing them economically. They say the Mundra plant’s waste outlet expels a plume of hot water, destroying mangroves that act as a breeding ground for fish and a natural barrier against cyclones. They also say that ash from the coal plant settles on fish left out to dry, rendering them inedible. The Wagher claim that pollution from the power station causes them chest and other body pains. The World Bank claims that the projects it finances are subject to stringent oversight procedures, including assessments of potential environmental or social damage. The Mundra plant was no different, it says, and was designated a category-A project – signifying “potential significant adverse social and/or environmental impacts that are diverse, irreversible or unprecedented”. However, Mass says the Waghers’ way of life was affected because the project’s assessments failed to consider them at all. In 2013 the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO), which assesses complaints against the IFC and its projects, published a scathing report into the Mundra project. It found that the various assessments had failed to adequately consider the Wagher people or the plant’s potential impact. The IFC disputes much of the CAO report. In particular, it says that the fishing villages were temporary and that even though the construction had displaced a sandbar, villagers were still able to set up their seasonal settlements. It accepts that there has been some impact on the fishing community but says this has been addressed by Tata Power. It claims that further studies had corroborated the project’s environmental assessments, that the decline in the fish and lobster catch had predated the Mundra plant, and that Tata Power was undertaking to plant additional mangroves to compensate damage from the power station. Mundra’s advocates insist its costs would be a small price to pay for a new era of cheap energy to drive India’s growing economy. But the finances underpinning that argument have since been thrown into doubt. In 2011, Indonesia, the intended source of the cheap coal needed to power Mundra, implemented new regulations with a minimum price for exported coal. This markedly increased the cost to Tata of powering the plant. Tata is now asking for permission to pass on the increased cost to the Indian states buying Mundra’s electricity. Tata Power said: “Tata Power is committed to the local community and continues to work with them on various platforms and multiple community development initiatives.” Regarding the Waghers’ complaint to the ombudsman, Tata Power said: “We also wish to reinforce that the core issues raised by Mass are not specific to Mundra UMPP and relate to certain generic issues concerning the coastline of Gujarat. CGPL [the Tata subsidiary that owns the Mundra plant] shares a very healthy relationship with the local communities and continues to work with them on various platforms and multiple community development initiatives.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/16/why-the-mundra-power-plant-has-given-tata-a-mega-headache,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/16/why-the-mundra-power-plant-has-given-tata-a-mega-headache
2015-04-16T04:01:07Z,global-development,Global development,World Bank breaks its own rules as millions lose land and livelihoods,"The World Bank has repeatedly violated its own policies on protecting the rights of indigenous people while funding projects that resulted in nearly 3.4 million slum-dwellers, farmers and villagers losing their land or having their livelihoods damaged over the past decade, according to documents seen by the Guardian. The projects, into which the bank channelled more than $60bn (£40bn), aimed to boost electricity and water supplies and expand transport networks in some of the world’s poorest countries. But they have resulted in more than 1.2 million people in Vietnam being economically or physically displaced over the past decade, as they made way for dams and power plants funded by the organisation. In addition, more than 1 million people in China were displaced by about $12bn of bank investment.
The bank has said its goals are to end extreme poverty and reduce income inequality worldwide. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and other outlets, including the Guardian, reviewed more than 6,000 World Bank documents as well as interviewing current and former bank employees and government officials involved in bank-funded projects. In many cases, the organisation did not follow internal policies and safeguards requiring it to monitor evictions caused by its projects and provide resettled people with new housing options and job prospects, the investigation showed. In addition, many of the projects are fossil fuel-based, such as the coal-fired Tata Mundra power station. Since his appointment as president of the bank in 2012, Jim Yong Kim has committed the bank to addressing the challenges of climate change and reducing reliance on fossil-fuels. This week, he called for fossil-fuel subsidies to be scrapped and for a carbon tax to be introduced. “There was often no intent on the part of the governments to comply, and there was often no intent on the part of the bank’s management to enforce,” said Navin Rai, a former World Bank official who oversaw the institution’s protection for indigenous people from 2000 to 2012. “That was how the game was played.” In one project, the bank’s ombudsman, known as the inspection panel, closed an internal inquiry into a project that had resulted in mass displacement, internal documents and emails show. After the bank funded a project to improve water supplies, roads and power in Lagos, Nigeria’s bustling commercial hub, nearly 2,000 slum-dwellers in Badia East were evicted to make way for the scheme. They complained to the inspection panel, but the chairwoman, Eimi Watanabe, refused to open an investigation into the forced resettlement. She instead urged the plaintiffs to hold direct negotiations with the Lagos state government, which offered a small sum of money as compensation. The bank said the panel had closed down the case because of “the progress made and speedy provision of compensation to displaced people”. Watanabe did not respond to ICIJ questions about the Lagos case. The investigation comes at a time when the bank is increasingly funding projects that require forced resettlement. In 1993, just 8% of World Bank projects were linked to resettlement. By 2009, however, the figure had risen to 29%, according to the bank’s internal review last year. On Friday, the bank will begin its annual spring meetings, where new resettlement policies and safeguards will be debated. The organisation has pledged to respond to its critics with “the strongest, most state-of-the-art environmental and social safeguards”. However, current and former World Bank officials are sceptical of the latest draft of the institution’s new policy, published in July after being shelved for months. They say the policies in the draft give governments more room to sidestep the bank’s standards and make decisions about whether local populations need protecting. “I am saddened to see now that pioneering policy achievements of the bank are being dismantled and downgraded,” said Michael Cernea, a former bank official who oversaw the bank’s resettlement protections for nearly two decades. “The poorest and most powerless will pay the price.” The Ethiopian government, which has repeatedly been accused of using World Bank funds to carry out forced resettlement, threatened local communities with violence if they criticised resettlement programmes when being interviewed by the bank’s inspection panel, according to a former World Bank employee. “All the people had been instructed in advance of us coming,” said Eisei Kurimoto, a Japanese academic who served as an adviser on the bank’s review. “And they had been intimidated in advance to tell us good things.” Last month, the World Bank approved a new $350m loan to Ethiopia, which included support for the local government in Gambella. An Ethiopian government spokeswoman said: “Tens of thousands of Ethiopians, including Gambella residents, have benefited from successful resettlement, which is done on a voluntary basis.” Last month, the bank admitted there had been “serious shortcomings” in implementing resettlement projects. At the time, Kim said: “We took a hard look at ourselves on resettlement and what we found caused me deep concern. We found several major problems. One is that we haven’t done a good enough job in overseeing projects involving resettlement; two, we haven’t implemented those plans well enough; and three, we haven’t put in place strong tracking systems to make sure that our policies were being followed. We must and will do better.” An open letter, issued on Wednesday by 85 NGOs, said the bank’s anti-poverty goals would not be achieved unless it addressed an “institutional failure” to ensure its projects did not adversely affect the world’s poorest people. “The World Bank’s twin goals cannot be achieved when its own resettlement practices are impoverishing communities,” said Kate Geary, Oxfam’s land rights policy researcher. “Now that the bank has finally revealed its own assessment of its resettlement failures, it needs to do all it can to repair the damage done.” The headline and first paragraph of this article was amended on 16 April 2015 to make clear that the 3.4 million slum-dwellers, farmers and villagers faced losing their land or having their livelihoods damaged. In addition the article was amended on 30 April 2015 to make clear that not all of those 3.4 million people were indigenous and that the 1.2 million in Vietnam were either economically or physically displaced. A reference to the bank’s ombudsman, known as the inspection panel, which suggested that it “tried to quash internal inquiries into projects”, was amended to make clear that only one internal inquiry was closed.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/16/world-bank-breaks-own-rules-indigenous-people-forced-off-land,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/16/world-bank-breaks-own-rules-indigenous-people-forced-off-land
2015-04-15T15:36:28Z,global-development,Global development,Ukip pledges to cut foreign aid and put DfID to the sword,"The UK Independence Party (Ukip) has pledged to slash Britain’s overseas aid spending by more than two-thirds and abolish the “wasteful” Department for International Development (DfID) if it wins next month’s general election. In its manifesto, which was published on Wednesday, Ukip argues that “charity begins at home” and attacks the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Labour party for supporting recent legislation that commits the UK to spending 0.7% of its annual gross national income on international aid. The party objects to the ringfencing of the aid budget at a time when “the politics of austerity” have left hundreds of thousands of Britons reliant on food banks, pensioners “freezing to death” because of rising fuel bills, and the NHS under severe strain. “The old parties pushed ahead with this expenditure regardless, ignoring considerable evidence that the money spent on overseas aid is not well directed or controlled and that much is wasted, lost to corruption or handed to countries already wealthy enough to have their own space programmes, nuclear weapons and even overseas aid programmes of their own,” says the manifesto. Taxpayers’ money, it adds, should not be spent on “already economically thriving countries; countries with poor human rights’ records; and … on politically correct vanity projects that do nothing to lift developing nations out of poverty”.
Ukip intends to repeal the 0.7% commitment and bring the UK’s aid contributions in line with those of the US, which currently spends 0.2% of its national income on overseas aid. The proposed changes would take place over three years to allow projects in progress to be completed and any contractual obligations to be met. Despite the huge reduction, however, Ukip says Britain’s overseas aid will not fall below £4bn a year – “more than given by Spain and Italy combined”. Some of the manifesto’s harshest language – and plans – are reserved for DfID, which spent £11.46bn on overseas aid in 2013. Ukip wants to close the department, merging its “essential functions” with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, but keep a single minister for overseas development. “DfID has already shown itself to be wasteful and lacking in focus on aid outcomes, yet its budget has been protected from recent government cuts,” says the manifesto. “Ukip takes a very different view: when DfID’s budget is reduced, we see no reason to keep DIFD [sic] running as an independent government department.” The party is also promising to refocus aid spending on emergency relief, healthcare, inoculation against preventable diseases and water and sanitation projects.
In reference to another of Ukip’s manifesto promises – to take the UK out of the EU – the party intends to offer British providers the first chance to run such programmes “following removal from the EU procurement directive”. Once free of “the EU’s protectionism” – which Ukip claims has adversely affected international development – the UK will be better placed to help the world’s poorest people “by giving them free access to the British market”. Ukip’s proposals were immediately criticised by the campaigning group Global Justice Now. “It’s true that too much aid money is spent on consultants and free market privatisation schemes, but Ukip’s solution – simply to cut it massively – is a recipe for a more unequal world,” said the group’s director, Nick Dearden.
“If you’re concerned with making the world fairer, you support real redistribution of income from the richest to the poorest, you use this money to help build decent public services around the world.” In their manifestos, the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems have all promised to continue their support for the 0.7% commitment. The Conservatives argue that aid is essential to both the UK’s interests and those of the developing world. “Aid helps prevent failed states from becoming havens for terrorists,” says the Tory manifesto. “It builds long-term markets for our businesses, by promoting global prosperity, and reduces migration pressures. So we will maintain our commitment to tackling conflict, poverty and disease around the world.” Labour is promising to rebalance the budget to target funding on the poorest countries in the world. The party would focus on working “in fragile and conflict-affected states to improve the lives of those affected by violence, prioritising the protection and education of women and children”, tackling corruption and improving tax systems and workers’ conditions. The Liberal Democrats will work to fight climate change, prevent conflict, offer humanitarian aid, and promote trade, development and prosperity. The Green party, meanwhile, goes much further than the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats or Labour – and in the opposite direction to Ukip. In its manifesto, the party pledges to increase the overseas aid budget from 0.7% of gross national income to 1% over the course of the next parliament, to fight for the cancellation of international debts to the poorest countries and to help less developed nations “fund climate change adaptation and build resilient communities through the UN Adaptation Fund”. Plaid Cymru, which also supports the 0.7% legislation, says that “failure to assist the developing world will only fuel resentment, violence and division”. It intends to ensure international cooperation to prevent modern slavery and female genital mutilation, and to campaign to see more consideration given to the effects of climate change on poverty.

2015-04-15T09:49:04Z,global-development,Global development,Is education making the grade in your part of the world? | Carla Kweifio-Okai,"At the turn of the century, world leaders pledged that all primary school-aged children would be in school by 2015. The ambitious vision failed to come to fruition, but significant progress has been made. By 2010, enrolment in primary education in low-income countries reached 90%, up from 82% in 1999. But the UN estimates there are still 58 million primary school-aged children missing from the world’s classrooms. While the previous education goals focused on getting more children in school, the proposed targets for the next 15 years focus on the quality of education children receive once they are at school. The sustainable development goals, which leaders are expected to adopt in September, call for governments to ensure all girls and boys complete “free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education” by 2030.

2015-04-15T08:00:02Z,global-development,Global development,Young people played a game-changing role in the battle against Ebola in Liberia | Ashoka Mukpo,"Archie Gbessay, 28, stands at an intersection in Monrovia’s West Point neighbourhood next to a stall where mobile-phone recharge scratch cards are sold. Across the street is a school that, in August 2014, became the focus of Liberia’s Ebola crisis. It was being used as a holding centre for Ebola victims when enraged residents broke through its iron gate and released patients. Now empty, it is being renovated to be used again as a school. The military quarantine imposed on West Point after the residents’ raid seems far away, as does the atmosphere of fear that enveloped Liberia. The country has made remarkable progress in the fight against Ebola. It is nearly a month since the last new case – thought to be a result of sexual intercourse with a survivor rather than transmission from an active case – and there are no Ebola patients in Liberia’s treatment units.
For many experts the efforts of community volunteers like Gbessay have played a critical role in halting Ebola’s spread. As deaths mounted in August and September, residents in some of Liberia’s hardest-hit neighbourhoods organised groups that searched for Ebola cases, battling denial of the virus and sharing information with Liberian health officials. Although many Liberians initially refused to acknowledge the existence of Ebola, these groups convinced their neighbours to adopt preventive measures and seek treatment if ill. Gbessay and a few friends established their informal group in August when the epidemic began to overwhelm the Liberian government’s response. “We felt that if we did nothing, we would be judged for our actions,” he says. Initially, they sought to combat Ebola denial through face-to-face discussions. Then the holding centre was attacked and West Point was cordoned off, provoking a violent confrontation between residents and soldiers, who shot and killed a 15-year-old boy. The government turned to Mosoka Fallah, a Harvard-trained infectious diseases specialist who had spent part of his early life in West Point, to mediate. Tasked by the Liberian ministry of health with tracking down Ebola cases, Fallah recognised that engagement with communities was key to stopping the outbreak. Many people were angry at the long delays in removing infected bodies from neighbouring homes, or refused to believe Ebola was real. It was often difficult to obtain information about people who were sick or had been in contact with Ebola victims.
Fallah heard reports of secret burials in West Point and feared there were unreported cases inside the neighbourhood’s maze of tin-roofed shacks and alleys. He became aware of Gbessay’s group and realised its potential as a bridge into the community. Fallah offered to help train the volunteers, but says: “At the time there was no pay. It was just about saving your community.” Under Fallah’s guidance, the group grew to more than 100 volunteers. He provided them with notepads and pens, asking them to record the names and condition of anyone exhibiting Ebola symptoms. “The first day they found a lot of cases,” Fallah says, adding that the group showed Liberia’s leaders that West Point’s residents were cooperating with the fight against Ebola. “It was so successful it convinced the president to de-quarantine West Point,” Fallah says. By early September, the situation in Monrovia had become dire, with sick people lying in front of overcrowded treatment facilities. Health officials continued to have trouble getting communities to cooperate with government efforts. Dr Bernice Dahn, Liberia’s assistant minister of health, asked Fallah to expand the West Point model to other neighbourhoods.
Fallah organised community meetings across Monrovia. “We apologised to them first,” he says. “We told them that we’ve been doing a top-down approach and it’s wrong. We want to let you be the decision-makers and we’ll be the supporters.” Volunteers were dubbed active-case finders, and were soon knocking on doors and keeping an eye on those who’d had contact with the sick. In late September, the World Health Organisation (WHO) opened a 120-bed Ebola treatment unit (ETU), creating space for those found by Fallah’s volunteers. By the beginning of October, he says, “Everywhere we went we were seeing progress. There were challenges but those kids were working their butts off.” In New Kru Town, the site of a community hospital where the deaths of nine clinicians had marked the worsening of Liberia’s Ebola crisis in June, Eric Patten, 30, had taken over as the lead active-case finder. “We were working 24 hours a day,” he says. Sometimes his teams would spend hours at a single house convincing a suspected case to report to a treatment centre. “Many of them would have just stayed home and died or gone to the drug store for antibiotics,” Patten says. By mid-October, WHO data showed case rates falling rapidly across Monrovia. Officials from the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) reacted with disbelief, sending teams to check funeral homes and graveyards to see if deaths were being hidden. When a cluster of cases was recorded in New Kru Town in late October, Fallah was dispatched to investigate. He found Patten waiting for him with the names and locations of the dead along with a list of all their contacts. “He was so meticulous and detailed – it gave me a lot of hope,” Fallah says. At the same time there was a drastic reduction in the forested north-western district of Foya where Ebola first appeared in Liberia. Piet deVries, country director of Global Communities, says it was largely a result of independent measures taken by villages. In one example, known as “community fencing”, all new arrivals to the district’s towns were quarantined for three weeks. Many communities refused to allow visitors. “Ultimately, the only way you stop the infection is when people practise safe behaviour,” says DeVries. “If you have continued transmission, it doesn’t matter how many ETUs you have, people will still get sick.”
Millions of dollars have been spent on building ETUs since September but the majority of their beds have never been filled by an Ebola patient. By early January 2015, cases in Liberia had dropped to less than 10 a week, reaching zero at the end of February. Frank Mahoney, a CDC epidemiologist, says: “The engine of the outbreak was Monrovia. Getting that on a downward slope contributed to the slowdown.” For Fallah, the slowdown has much to do with the efforts of volunteers like Gbessay . A study Fallah co-authored with researchers from Yale University found that better community engagement was the key factor. He hopes the model of community participation in health outreach developed during the Ebola outbreak will continue after it is over. “People in West Point think it’s normal for five or six people to die every day of diseases other than Ebola,” he says. “Why should we accept people dying in the prime of life? We have a model now that shows the power of the community to transform those health issues.” • Ashoka Mukpo, a freelance writer, researcher and videographer, is an Ebola survivor",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/15/young-people-ebola-liberia-game-changers-monrovia-diseases,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/15/young-people-ebola-liberia-game-changers-monrovia-diseases
2015-04-15T06:00:10Z,global-development,Global development,Yemen: ‘Now I've learned first-hand what it's like to be a displaced person’,"I never thought I would know what it’s like to be an internally displaced person, but I do now. Working at Care, I am usually the one helping displaced people but almost two weeks ago, after air strikes began in Yemen, my family and I felt the fear and pain of suddenly having to gather your things, leave your home and run for your life. It was 5am when my husband and I were woken by the call that the air strikes were coming near our home in Haradh and we had to evacuate immediately. I woke my nine-year-old son and tried not to let him see the fear in my eyes. We heard the planes in the distance and, as we quickly packed up our car, I could not stop thinking about all the people whose only mode of transport was on foot. How would they escape? Would they escape?
As we were leaving Haradh, my husband and I tried to keep each other and our son calm. We prayed all through the drive that we would make it to our destination safely. Although I now know first-hand what it’s like to be displaced, we are much better off than so many others; we are with my husband’s family in Hajjah, where we have everything we need: safety from violence, food, water and, most important, each other. Many are not so lucky. The day before we left, a displaced people’s camp was attacked in Haradh, killing 40 people and injuring hundreds – including several children. Care doesn’t work at this camp, but I know it well. When I received news of this attack and the images of dead children, I sobbed in disbelief that so many innocent people could be killed for no reason. I cannot get the images of those dead children out of my head, and am afraid of what is to come for my country. Yemen is already the poorest country in the Middle East and now, with this conflict, people are facing fuel shortages, electricity outages and soaring food prices. There are people in desperate need of assistance. They need food, water and healthcare, but they cannot be reached because access is blocked, especially in the south around Aden.
We are thankful to be safe in Hajjah for the moment, but every day we hear the planes overhead, and wonder if our safe haven is also about to turn violent. At the loud roar of the planes, my son runs to hide. We live in fear that a bomb could drop at any moment. To help ease my son’s fears, we are trying to restore some normality to our lives, which, for the time being, is still possible in Hajjah. Although resources are few, we are still able to access them. But we are stockpiling food because we have no idea what the future might hold. I’m still able to do my job at Care since parts of the north are safe from the conflict, and I’ve enrolled my son in school, where he can continue his education and play with other children. But, while I sit in the safety of my family’s home in Hajjah, I worry about the people I left behind in Haradh and those in Aden where the fighting is concentrated. I hear news daily of the death toll ticking up, now into thousands, and I wonder: when will this stop? People’s needs are escalating so quickly, and we have no idea of what will happen next. It is as if we are living in a nightmare, so we wait in hope that this nightmare will be over soon. • Bushra Aldukhainah is humanitarian coordinator for Care Yemen.

2015-04-14T16:54:07Z,global-development,Global development,Sierra Leone: it's back to school after Ebola crisis,"For a school whose classrooms and hallways have been silent since the main gates were locked last July, Rokel Secondary was quick to reacquire some of its familiar routines. Students who turned up early on Tuesday wearing the wrong shoes or with their laces undone were gently reminded of the rules – as were those who committed the sins of talking or, worse, eating in class. Despite the tellings-off and the thrill of seeing long-missed friends again, though, little at the school in central Freetown, Sierra Leone’s capital, is as it was nine months ago. The 220 pupils who trickled through the gates in twos and threes as the sun rose over the hills were met by a teacher who aimed an electronic thermometer at their foreheads before telling them to wash their hands with chlorinated water. Before the Ebola crisis, Rokel would have seen almost four times as many students course through its gates, some brought by local poda-poda buses, others by taxis.
But school staff were happy to take things slowly as Sierra Leone finally reopened its schools. The shutdown, which kept the country’s 1.8 million children out of education for the best part of a year, has brought challenges that transcend the medical. “The turnout is small but we hope more will come by the end of the week,” said Sylvester Meheux, Rokel’s headteacher. “Some children have dropped out but the bulk will return. They have been trading and are now used to having a little bit of money.” It didn’t help either, said Meheux, that thieves had broken into the school and stolen furniture and other items during the long, enforced vacation. “But there is enthusiasm now. We will provide a safe environment for children. Teachers have been trained for Ebola and will pass that information to the children.” The push to inform and educate has permeated every fibre of the school fabric, from the assembly, where children were organised into lines and told not to get too close to one another, to the French class where the two students role-playing a conversation were reminded not to shake hands as they practised their greetings. Beatrice Temple, 14, said it felt great to be back at school after so many months of radio lessons. “I was a little bit nervous yesterday,” she said. “I wasn’t sure if my friends would be here.”
Some were; others were still under quarantine. One group that will not be allowed back, however, are the female students who have got pregnant during the Ebola crisis because the government has refused to lift the ban on pregnant girls attending school. NGOs have appealed to the government to end the exclusion, arguing it is unfair and counterproductive. In a statement released on Tuesday, the charity Plan said: “Access to education is a fundamental human right and is also a powerful weapon to address teenage pregnancy and other forms of child abuses.” Beatrice said teenage girls had had a particularly difficult time during the Ebola crisis. “Pregnancy has risen,” she said. “I feel bad and I hope they will come back to school some time.” Her fellow student Henry John, 13, was also glad to be back. “I want to pass my exams and become a doctor,” he said. “I’ve been studying, but not everyone has.” Many Sierra Leonean students, he added, had lost family to Ebola and found themselves unable to resume their studies. “There aren’t many students here; people are afraid,” said Henry. “But don’t be afraid: Ebola will go.” Their teachers, too, were delighted to be back – despite the slightly muted atmosphere and the empty classrooms. “I’ve been doing nothing for quite some time,” said Wusman V Conteh, a senior teacher. “I’m glad the kids are turning up. Some are scared and some parents are holding children at home. But more will come when they see it’s safe.”
Only then will the full scale of the educational and emotional task facing both teachers and students become apparent. “Some children could not [remember] the work done last year,” said Conteh. “They’ve not been reading so we need to recap and then catch up. Some have lost parents and family members; it’s difficult for them, but it is good for them to be back at school with friends and learning. I can’t over-emphasise the importance of education: education shapes their future.” His words were echoed by Roeland Monasch, Unicef’s Sierra Leone representative, who described the reopening of the country’s 8,000 schools as “a major step in the normalisation of life”. The disease, which has claimed more than 10,500 lives in west Africa, has killed more than 3,800 people in Sierra Leone. It does, however, appear to be on the wane at last: Sierra Leone reported a fifth consecutive weekly decrease from 25 confirmed cases in the week to 29 March to nine in the week to 5 April. But a full return to pre-Ebola life remains a distant prospect. More than 8,600 Sierra Leonean children lost one or both parents to the disease, with many forced to find work to support themselves and their families. “It will be hard for struggling families to sacrifice even that small income and send their children back, especially girls,” said Alison Schafer, World Vision’s mental health and psychosocial support specialist in Freetown. “Reopening schools is not just a one-off event. It’s going to be a months-long journey.” Amid the relief and excitement of returning to school, said Schafer, there would also be fear and anxiety – which was why World Vision had helped train more than 1,000 teachers in psychosocial support skills. “Although children may be concerned about the possibility of catching Ebola in the classroom, they are more worried that they’ve forgotten everything they’ve learned,” she said. “They’re anxious about whether they can ever catch up.” The disease’s more subtle legacies were not lost on Beatrice as she surveyed her school for the first time in 36 weeks. “It’s not a normal time,” she said. “We’re not allowed to play, there’s no body contact. I miss the old times when we used to play and do cool stuff. The girls threw the ball to each other and played hide-and-seek, and the boys played football.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/14/sierra-leone-back-to-school-after-ebola-crisis,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/14/sierra-leone-back-to-school-after-ebola-crisis

2015-04-14T12:01:08Z,global-development,Global development,Nigerian election: readers tell us what should be on President Buhari's agenda,"As the dust settles after Nigeria’s history-making election, the focus has shifted to the road ahead for president-elect Muhammadu Buhari. He is set to be inaugurated on 29 May, and Nigerians are busy discussing what the new government will achieve in its first 100 days and beyond. When the election was decided, we asked readers to share their hopes for Nigeria’s future. Below are some of the main issues that were raised. Stop Boko Haram
The Islamist militant group Boko Haram has become one of the biggest threats to Nigeria’s security. Okonta Emeka in Delta state told us that defeating insurgents must be the top priority for Buhari and his cabinet. “Enough hasn’t been done to stop Boko Haram. It will be a bigger problem if the government doesn’t find the root cause and their sponsors,” Emeka said. As the country marks one year since Boko Haram kidnapped 276 girls from their school in Chibok, there is pressure on the new government to act on freeing the remaining girls. Nigerian university student Redeem told us via email that she wanted to see the government work with campaigners to tackle the problem. “The problem we’ve had is that we felt the government has not listened properly when we told them to help #bringbackourgirls; if they can’t listen what hope do we have?” Fix the power supply
One of the most common issues raised by readers was the country’s inconsistent supply of electricity. For the 40% of Nigerians connected to the power grid, there are constant concerns of price hikes and frequent blackouts. Roland Digieneni in Bayelsa state told us the electricity supply was among the most important issues Buhari should tackle. “My community in the Niger delta want the new president to deal with corruption, pollution, youth unemployment and electricity. Electricity is actually the biggest issue on people’s lips – in a region famous for its oil, electricity is intermittent at best,” he said. Emma Ojibah, in Rivers state, agreed. “Electricity is one issue our government at all levels must keep politics aside and do something quickly about. This ugly power supply reality is biting hard at our people and economy,” she said. Sade Olusanya said she wanted to see consistency in the delivery of government projects. “Steady electricity, water supply and good road network will help the socio-economic development of Nigeria. I want the new government to focus on one major project at a time to execute, complete and implement for greater accountability and transparency rather than trying to execute multiple projects which are often mismanaged, incomplete and abandoned,” she said. “Let this system of getting things done filter down to the local governments at the grass roots, so that corruption and project mismanagement can be monitored and controlled.” End corruption Guardian Witness user Patrick Braih summed up his reason for voting for Buhari:
Braih wasn’t alone, with the need to combat corruption high on the agenda for voters. Best Uso in Rivers state said Nigerians would have to wait to see if the anti-corruption measures touted by Buhari would have an effect. “I wanted a change of government and the doom of the current administration. However, I do not have total faith in the assertion that this change in administration will guarantee a corrupt[ion]-free Nigeria, but I think we should try something new.” One of our Twitter followers, @oluwaseuntuase, shared his similar hope for the future:
‘Nigerians want change’ Finally, Guardian Witness user Babals summarised the hopes of Nigerians following a momentous election win for Buhari:

2015-04-14T06:00:08Z,global-development,Global development,Is Chad succeeding in beating the 'oil curse'? | Celeste Hicks,"In 2008, Chad’s capital, N’Djamena, was an eerie place to arrive in late at night. As the plane descended, there was virtually nothing in the dusty Saharan blackness to indicate that a capital city lay just metres below. There was only one tarmac road that ran like a belt around the little city; the stretch towards the new Kempinski Hotel lay in darkness except for the odd ray of orange light from the headlights on clapped-out taxis. Today, it is a different city. A new two-lane highway leads from the airport to the city centre, where a huge Place de la Nation (Nation Square) has been built opposite the presidential palace with a triumphal arch, fountains, statues and television screens. Although it’s important not to overstate the improvements in street lighting in the outlying neighbourhoods, the centre at least is now easier to navigate at night, with new tarmac replacing uneven mud routes.
Much of this transformation is down to oil. The country has earned at least $10bn since Exxon Mobil opened the Kome oil field near the southern town of Doba in 2003. In 2006, a deal was signed with the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) to open a second field to feed a new domestic oil refinery. Much of the building work in N’Djamena has been carried out by Chinese contractors in deals that exchanged production rights for promises to improve the country’s infrastructure, such as roads, railways and power networks. However, civil society in Chad complains that the change is a mirage, arguing that this $10bn windfall has been wasted. While the capital has seen superficial improvements and GDP has risen significantly, social development indicators have barely budged. Chad was still fourth from the bottom on the UN’s Human Development Index in 2014 and has met none of the millennium development goals. Meanwhile, an estimated $4bn has been spent on military and weapons purchases. What can be done to prevent the negative impact of oil production on poor economies – the so-called “resource curse” that has affected countries such as Nigeria and Angola? The story of the early days of production in Chad is fascinating and one of the central themes of my book. In 2000, the World Bank signed a groundbreaking deal with Chad and Esso (Exxon Mobil’s arm in Chad) to try to beat the resource curse. The agreement ensured that royalties from oil sales would pass through a transparent bank account in London, and that a large proportion of it would be spent on development. It also sought to guarantee social and environmental standards for production.
But the pioneering project was a failure. In 2006, in the face of a rebel threat that had twice come within hours of unseating President Idriss Deby, Chad ripped up the original agreements and amended “development” projects to include national security. This decision led to the World Bank having to close the project and leave Chad. The consequences of this military spending can still be felt today, as Chad’s strengthened army spearheads the campaign against the Islamist group Boko Haram in north-east Nigeria, having previously taken on al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb in Mali. Despite its failures, the World Bank project has proven to be a vital learning tool for a new generation of African countries in the early stages of setting up production. For example, in an echo of Chad, a law was passed in Ghana that ensured oil revenues were deposited in a separate, transparent bank account from general government revenue, and contracts with the oil production company Tullow Oil have been published online. Chad’s Future Generations savings fund was designed to tackle the familiar problems of non-renewable natural resources and volatility in the world oil price, so clearly seen in recent months, with crude falling below $50 a barrel. Although this fund was emptied and closed as the country scrambled to fight the rebels, the idea is still proving popular: Ghana, for example, has created a savings fund and Niger has also made a constitutional commitment to establish one. In the area of environmental protection, Chad’s oil project has also had encouraging results. Provisions in the original World Bank deal for safeguarding ecosystems and livelihoods, and for clearing up oil spills and monitoring local pollution around the Doba oil fields, have resulted in remarkably few accidents for an African oil project. The project has been studied by campaign groups in Kenya and Uganda keen to protect their own ecosystems – such as Lake Turkana and Lake Albert, respectively – as they move towards production.
Although there are still concerns that China’s involvement in African oil production will undo many of the gains made by western transparency campaign groups and that Africa will lose out, my research has shown that the picture is more nuanced. Chad recently engaged in a serious round of brinkmanship with the CNPC in a dispute over environmental pollution that resulted in a $1.2bn fine and an order to clean up. While there was suspicion that the row was more about forcing the CNPC to pay more for its oil concessions, it has shown that effective environmental laws can help to prevent the kind of destruction seen in the Niger delta. It has also shown that China’s neocolonial activities in Africa are not going unchallenged.

2015-04-14T00:11:11Z,global-development,Global development,"800,000 children in Nigeria 'running for their lives' from conflict, says Unicef | Sam Jones","Fighting between Boko Haram, military forces and civilian self-defence groups in north-eastern Nigeria has forced around 800,000 children from their homes over the past year, according to the UN children’s agency, Unicef. In a report marking the first anniversary of the Islamist group’s abduction of 276 schoolgirls from the Nigerian town of Chibok, Unicef says the number of children running for their lives in the country or crossing into neighbouring Chad, Niger and Cameroon has doubled in just under 12 months.
Despite steadily escalating its attacks in recent years, Boko Haram – whose name means “western education is forbidden” – achieved worldwide notoriety last April when it abducted the girls from their school in Borno state. The girls, aged between 12 and 17, were snatched from their dormitories and loaded on to trucks. Although some managed to escape, others were paraded in a propaganda video, in which it was claimed they would be freed in return for the release of Boko Haram militants held by the Nigerian authorities. President Goodluck Jonathan’s delay in reacting to the mass abduction – and his government’s failure to rescue them – is thought to have contributed to his defeat at the hands of Muhammadu Buhari in Nigeria’s recent election. In a statement released on Tuesday Buhari said: “When my new administration takes office at the end of May we will do everything we can to defeat Boko Haram. We will act differently from the government we replace: we hear the anguish of our citizens and intend to respond accordingly. “What I can pledge, with absolute certainty, is that starting on the first day of my Administration Boko Haram will know the strength of our collective will and commitment to rid this nation of terror, and bring back peace and normalcy to all the affected areas.”
Manuel Fontaine, Unicef’s regional director for west and central Africa, says the Chibok kidnapping was one of a series of “endless tragedies being replicated on an epic scale” across the region. “Scores of girls and boys have gone missing in Nigeria – abducted, recruited by armed groups, attacked, used as weapons or forced to flee violence,” he says. The report, Missing Childhoods, says at least 15,000 people have been killed since 2009, when Boko Haram stepped up its violent campaign. Last year, 7,300 were killed, while more than 1,000 civilians have died since the beginning of 2015. Unicef says children have become frequent and deliberate targets for murder, sexual abuse, kidnappings or forced marriage. “Countless numbers of children, women and men have been abducted, abused and forcibly recruited, and women and girls have been targeted for particularly horrific abuse, including sexual enslavement,” the report says. “Schools have been attacked. The conflict is exacting a heavy toll on children, affecting not just their wellbeing and their safety but also their access to basic health, education and social services.” Not only are children as young as four being used by Boko Haram as cooks, porters and lookouts, the report says, but young people are reportedly being recruited by the vigilante groups fighting the Islamist insurgents in north-east Nigeria. Amnesty International estimates that at least 2,000 women and girls have been abducted by Boko Haram since the beginning of last year, many of them forced into sexual slavery and trained to fight. Its secretary general, Salil Shetty, said the “scale and depravity” of the group’s methods had been laid bare in a new Amnesty report based on nearly 200 witness accounts. “Men and women, boys and girls, Christians and Muslims, have been killed, abducted and brutalised by Boko Haram during a reign of terror which has affected millions,” she said. “Recent military successes might spell the beginning of the end for Boko Haram, but there is a huge amount to be done to protect civilians, resolve the humanitarian crisis and begin the healing process.”
Unicef has warned that the hundreds of thousands of displaced people are putting additional strain on already stretched health, education and social services systems in host communities, and has called for international donors to increase their support. It says it has so far received only 15% of the $26.5m needed for its humanitarian operations in Nigeria this year; 17% of its $40.2m appeal for Cameroon; 2% of its $42.5m appeal for Niger and 1% of its $63.1m appeal for Chad. “Insecurity and lack of funding are constraining Unicef’s ability to reach affected children,” the report concludes. “Unicef appeals to parties to the conflict to allow humanitarian access. Unicef also urges the international community to increase its support to aid agencies working to alleviate the suffering of civilian populations.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/13/children-nigeria-conflict-unicef-boko-haram,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/13/children-nigeria-conflict-unicef-boko-haram
2015-04-13T16:51:40Z,global-development,Global development,"$73bn more needed every year for social development goals, says ODI | Mark Anderson","Aid donors and governments must fill an annual $73bn funding gap to meet health, education and social security targets that are outlined in the next set of global development goals, a new report says. Targets to roll out universal healthcare, free primary and secondary education, and basic social security over the next 15 years are achievable, according to Financing for the Future, a report published on Monday by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI). But more aid spending, better tax collection and a greater focus on low-income countries will be needed, it says. The report comes as donors meet in New York to revise a global framework for financing sustainable development ahead of the UN’s International Conference on Financing for Development in July, which will discuss how the sustainable development goals (SDGs) will be paid for. “The world is currently coming out with all these new development ambitions, but if they’re not backed with new development financing [the goals will not be met],” says Paddy Carter, an ODI researcher and one of the report’s authors.
The big reduction in the number of impoverished people over the past 20 years will be difficult to replicate in the coming decades because “the poor are increasingly concentrated in conflict-prone states, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa”, the report warns. If development strategies remain the same, the gap between rich and poor countries will widen, leaving an estimated 550 million people living on less than $1.25 a day, according to the ODI. Some of the poorest countries in the world – mainly in sub-Saharan Africa – are still 20 years away from achieving universal primary education. The total cost of meeting the social sector ambitions of the SDGs will be $148bn, the report says. After adding current aid flows and estimating tax revenues, the authors say the world will fall $73bn short of the amount needed to reach the goals. Meeting the target for basic universal healthcare will cost $74bn a year – about 1.7% of the annual healthcare spending of the world’s richest countries – while providing social protection will require an additional $42bn every year, the report says. Donors and governments will need to find $32bn to meet the target for free primary and secondary education in every country, the report adds.
The report used data on education spending from the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation’s (Unesco) 2015 Education for All report (pdf) and Chatham House estimates for heath spending. Researchers selected 89 countries, taking into account only those with a population greater than 1 million and a poverty headcount above 1%. They estimated the amount of revenue each country could generate through income tax and used existing aid flows to determine the funds available for implementing social sector programmes. Governments in low-income countries, defined by the World Bank as those with a gross national income (GNI) per capita of $1,045 or less, must ramp up social sector spending and improve tax collection, the report says.
The ODI urges donors convening in Addis Ababa for the UN meeting in July to “set out concrete commitments to close this gap” and meet the UN’s longstanding target to spend 0.7% of their gross national income on official development assistance. “Aid isn’t the answer to eradicating poverty but it is an incredibly important part of the solution,” Carter says. “Without more aid delivered in the right way, in the right places, the goal of eradicating poverty will be out of reach.” But just five donors – Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and the UK – met this target last year and aid to the poorest countries fell by 16% from the previous year, according to figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Romilly Greenhill, an ODI researcher and co-author of the report, says: “Aid is uniquely well placed to support poor countries in their efforts to reach the poorest, including by providing free healthcare and education, and cash for those living below the poverty line. But to do this effectively, the aid industry will need to change.” Because of an error in the ODI’s original report, our article said that meeting the target for basic universal healthcare would cost 0.15% of the annual healthcare spending of the world’s richest countries. The correct figure is 1.7%",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/13/73bn-social-development-goals-overseas-development-institute,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/13/73bn-social-development-goals-overseas-development-institute
2015-04-13T14:33:04Z,global-development,Global development,Paralympian finds heartbreak and hope among Rwanda's disabled children | Clár Ní Chonghaile,"When Sophie Christiansen met Enock, a 12-year-old boy with cerebral palsy, in a convent school in northern Rwanda last month, the no-nonsense Paralympic gold medallist was shocked by his situation. “He was a ball of spasticity, curled up on a bed. He was so tight,” she recalls. “If he was here [in the UK], he would have had therapy and he would be walking by now. The nuns were teaching him to sit up, but they didn’t have the knowledge to stretch him. My parents stretched my legs every day. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to walk … It was heartbreaking. I knew this boy could walk but he was just sitting, with nothing.”
Christiansen, an equestrian who was born with cerebral palsy and has won five Paralympic gold medals for Britain, travelled to Rwanda with Chance for Childhood, a UK-based charity that works to get vulnerable children, including those who are deaf or have communications difficulties, into schools. For Christiansen, who has battled stereotypes and misconceptions about cerebral palsy and knows just how much can be achieved with treatment, the plight of children who had not received adequate help was particularly poignant. “They are more disabled by the lack of treatment and early diagnosis. If cerebral palsy is caught early, then they could become as independent as possible and live normal lives. They are abandoned so, of course, they are not going to fulfil their potential,” said the 27-year-old. “These kids were not helped to develop the skills they need, and that’s an additional disability.” Anna-mai Estrella, executive director of Chance for Childhood, says stigma also contributes to a lack of information about how many children are disabled, frustrating efforts to include them in the education system. “We found stigma to be the biggest barrier to education, which shows why the data isn’t representative of how many disabled children there are – because they are hidden away, locked in rooms by their families,” she says. Another problem is a lack of specialist knowledge to diagnose different disabilities accurately. Christiansen was struck by how stigma combined with this lack of technical and medical knowhow has condemned disabled children – including those with cerebral palsy – to lives of limited potential in Rwanda. But she recognised how challenging these cases were for parents as well. “Can I blame them that there is a bit of stigma about it, when they’ve never come close to disability and then their child is born disabled? What would you think? It would be natural to be ashamed due to lack of understanding. It was the same thing in Britain 75 years ago,” she says. As heartbreaking as Enock’s situation was, other children with cerebral palsy do not receive any care at all. Perusse Baransaritse, 65, is sole carer for her 10-year-old grandson Samuel Byiringiro, who has severe cerebral palsy. They live in Musanze, in northern Rwanda.
“Our life is not easy,” she said, explaining how she found it hard to combine her farming duties with caring for her grandson. She tried to leave him to his own devices, but found it unbearable. “The biggest problem is that he cannot walk or hold anything in his hand, which makes it hard for him to eat,” she said. “I am always very worried about Samuel’s future. Sometimes I think maybe by God’s help he will be able to walk and help himself at least to eat but mostly I’m afraid that when I die, then he won’t survive.” Baransaritse told her story to Chance for Childhood, which has been trying to fill the information gap by mapping where disabled children live. The charity works with local partners to send specialists from village to village in three districts in northern Rwanda to locate deaf and communications-impaired children.
Chance for Childhood aims to set up communication camps in the months ahead, using speech therapists and physiotherapists to teach people how to communicate with disabled children. It has also set up a learning support assistance programme, providing specialists to work with children in schools. “All of our teachers are trained in inclusive education and how to deal with different learning support needs,” Estrella says. The teachers also work with parents and communities, explaining just how important it is for children to be in school. As world leaders debate development targets for the next 15 years, campaigners say the rights of the estimated 1 billion people living with disabilities must be explicitly included in the sustainable development goals (SDGs). About 80% of disabled people, including 150 million children, live in developing countries. Disability is mentioned in the SDGs, specifically in the goals relating to education, growth and employment, inequality, accessibility of human settlements, and data collection. However, campaigners are concerned that without a standalone target on disability, rhetoric on inclusion will remain just that. The 2006 UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has been ratified by 36 African countries. However, in countries grappling with hunger and poverty, where even the most rudimentary services are often lacking, disabled people frequently find themselves on the extreme margins. Christiansen admits to feeling a little overwhelmed by the scale and seemingly insoluble nature of the problem, but believes education is key. “More training needs to happen in occupational health, speech therapy and occupational therapy, which actually is relatively easy to implement,” she says. Providing role models also helps to combat stigma. Christiansen brought one of her 2012 gold medals to Rwanda. It broke the ice with the children, transmitting a wordless but powerful message of hope. “While [a Paralympic gold medal] is so far removed from their lives, they could recognise what it represents and that broke down the barrier of language,” she says. “It really meant something.” Additional reporting by Sarah Hughes",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/13/sophie-christiansen-british-paralympian-rwanda-disabled-children,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/13/sophie-christiansen-british-paralympian-rwanda-disabled-children
2015-04-13T13:45:16Z,global-development,Global development,"#JusticeForLiz: With this conviction, the Kenya we want is within reach","Justice has finally been served for a 16-year-old girl who was gang-raped and left for dead in Kenya’s Busia county in June 2013. The girl, known as Liz because her full name cannot be disclosed for legal reasons, has been supported by nearly 2 million people, and her case spawned the #JusticeForLiz social media campaign. On Monday morning, three men were convicted and sentenced to 15 years for rape, and seven years for causing grievous bodily harm. The case has exposed the cracks in Kenya’s legal system, where prosecutions are few and far between for sexual violence and cases have complex challenges to overcome. Monday’s verdict is sure to have a ripple effect across the nation, and hopefully the region at large. Around the world, girls experience difficulties accessing justice – particularly during adolescence. Like many countries, Kenya is experiencing a sexual violence epidemic and authorities are only beginning to grasp the magnitude of the task at hand.
The fact that Liz’s case took so long to reach this point – and still faced serious obstacles despite strong national and global support – illustrates the injustices experienced by survivors in a criminal justice system in transition. While Kenya boasts one of the most progressive legal and policy frameworks for addressing sexual violence, Liz’s case and countless others have revealed significant failures of local authorities to adequately address sexual violence. Negative cultural attitudes towards women, as well as the fear and stigma associated with such crimes, make reporting of cases a daunting and often impossible task. Recent national statistics are not easy to come by. A report published by Crime Scene Investigation Nairobi in 2008 estimated that 19 out of 20 rapes in Kenya are not reported and are therefore unpunished. In 2013, the Gender Violence Recovery Centre said more than 2,500 cases of sexual violence were reported in 2011-2012. Meanwhile, nationally the number of rape cases involving children has increased, while new figures from Kenya’s National Crime Research Centre show that violence against women and girls continues to be at incredibly high levels. Wife/husband battery is at 97.7% prevalence in Mombasa county and not much lower throughout the nation. In Liz’s case, three of the six alleged perpetrators are still at large, although it has been a year since arrest warrants were issued. Sensitive treatment of survivors of sexual violence is also almost universally lacking. If a survivor overcomes the huge initial hurdle to report what happened, apathy or a lack of knowledge of laws, policies and procedures by officials, and the continued lack of resources, mean that cases are often handled poorly from the outset. Liz’s case, and the failure of local authorities to adequately address sexual violence, drew national and international attention to Busia county. However, it is only the tip of the iceberg.
Related investigations revealed compelling evidence from Busia that thousands of other survivors of sexual violence continue to suffer injustice due to obstacles within the justice system. Deep-rooted concerns are particularly widespread in Kenya, relating to the abuse of power and corruption by the police service and key government officials, as well as a tendency for the victim to be blamed for what happened. However, progress is being made too, on the back of concerted action by national and international human rights groups. Last year, Equality Now wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions, detailing 70 additional rape cases compiled by our partners, which had yet to be properly investigated. Less than a month later, the DPP responded to say that he had contacted the Criminal Investigations Director calling for “speedy and thorough investigations” into these cases and that he had appointed a special unit to provide guidance throughout the process. Liz has finally received justice and her case will hopefully continue to be a wake-up call for all. We at Equality Now hope that it can also be used to highlight the gaps in policies and procedures. Authorities must be held accountable and we must continue to push for safe environments for girls, where sexual violence is not tolerated and is punished to the fullest extent of the law. There is potential to use knowledge gained from this case to help clarify the role of special prosecutors and intermediaries, and to better protect survivors of sexual violence during the entire legal process. There is also an opportunity now to learn from best practice and to push for further implementation of the law and the bolstering of systems which protect the rights of Kenyan girls and women. The Kenya we want – one where girls and women have the freedom to access and enjoy their rights – is within reach. Liz has bravely helped to pave the way forward to ensure justice for Kenyan girls. We must maintain this momentum to ensure that nobody is left behind. • Kimberly Brown is a legal consultant with Equality Now’s Nairobi office",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/13/justice-for-liz-rape-kenya-conviction-sentence-womens-rights,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/13/justice-for-liz-rape-kenya-conviction-sentence-womens-rights
2015-04-13T11:48:19Z,global-development,Global development,Sudan: 'The election will not change anything',"The slogans are powerful and the issues deadly serious – but if election fever ever hit Sudan, the temperature has long since returned to normal. Almost all the major opposition parties are boycotting the elections, which began on Monday, ensuring that the president, Omar al-Bashir, who took power in a coup in 1989, will win another term. His National Congress party (NCP) feels sufficiently confident that it is not contesting 30% of the parliamentary seats, as an inducement to the splinter parties and smaller movements it has convinced to run in these elections. The opposition’s “Irhal” or “leave” campaign is asking Sudanese people to not vote. Opposition parties are protesting against the restrictions imposed on them and the press, and about the ongoing conflicts in Darfur, South Kordofan and the Blue Nile region. A national dialogue, launched by Bashir in January 2014, was meant to address these issues over the past year. However, several opposition leaders were detained and a crackdown on the press was intensified; the talks never really got going. The opposition has said that it is impossible to hold free and fair polls in these conditions. Yet, on both Saturday and Sunday, the opposition appeared unable to organise the sizable anti-election rally it had promised. On Sunday evening, two hours after the scheduled start time, only one major politician, Farouk Abu Issa, recently freed from several months in jail and looking frail, had showed up. He sat in the front row with a few dozen supporters at most. It was almost as if the opposition was boycotting its own boycott event. Protest groups such as Girifna and Sudan Change Now have, on a small scale, been more active – holding impromptu seminars in public areas, writing rude slogans on Bashir’s campaign posters or covering photos of his face with red paint, a reference to their claim that these are “blood elections”. Bashir is being investigated by the International Criminal Court for war crimes in Darfur (although the investigation was suspended in December 2014). “The election will not change anything,” said Amjad Farid, the spokesman for Sudan Change Now. “Before the elections Omar al-Bashir had no legitimacy, and afterwards he will have no legitimacy.”
Sudan Change Now also travelled to some of the camps that are now home to the millions displaced by Sudan’s civil wars. One local traditional leader made his frustration clear: no president had come to his area in southern Blue Nile since Ibrahim Abboud the 1960s, he said. He didn’t know many of Abboud’s successors, the man explained, but he knew Bashir because he sent his planes to bomb them. Bashir’s camp has dismissed opposition claims that the elections are meaningless. Rabie Abdelati, an NCP official, said holding the elections is a “constitutional requirement” and political parties “do not have the right” to postpone the election, as the opposition had wanted. The president has been travelling around the country campaigning and giving his usual fiery speeches. At his last rally, in Khartoum stadium, thousands packed the stands. They screamed when Bashir appeared, and, with a broad smile, he waved back with his swagger stick. “I like President Bashir as a president because he works very hard,” said one fan, Mohamed Abbas. “He makes us more secure. He has served everyone in Sudan.” Despite all the fervour at the rally, many in the stands left before the end of the president’s speech. With the result not in doubt and the opposition’s call for a boycott, the number of people who vote in the three-day ballot matters. But in Khartoum, at least, it is difficult to discern much electoral excitement. At the last election, in 2010, there was a sense that a genuine democratic contest – and perhaps even change – might have been possible. However, the irregularities in those elections were downplayed by the international community because of a fear of putting at risk the upcoming vote on independence for southern Sudan. This time, the atmosphere has been muted. The NCP “has all the power”, said one man from western Sudan, clenching his fist to emphasise his point, “and all the money. What can we do?”
The lack of excitement in the runup to the vote “is not to do with the campaign from the opposition”, said Hafiz Mohamed, the director of human rights group Justice Africa Sudan. “It’s just people are passively not engaging because they don’t actually see that the process is addressing their problems or serving their interests. There’s no contest, it’s a one-sided election.” Several western countries have been critical of the process. The EU’s envoy to Sudan was summoned after a strong EU statement. The UK, US and Norway, known as the Troika, have stated that “an environment conducive to participatory and credible elections does not exist”. Despite frequent anti-western rhetoric, the Sudanese government is keen to improve ties, in part to get American sanctions removed and the debt burden of more than $45bn (£31bn) forgiven. Bashir has been strengthened by an improvement in relations with Gulf countries following his decision to take part in the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen. The Arab League and the African Union are observing the polls, and are more likely to accept the results than western nations.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/13/sudan-election-omar-al-bashir-opposition-boycott,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/13/sudan-election-omar-al-bashir-opposition-boycott
2015-04-13T06:00:01Z,global-development,Global development,Sustainable development won't happen without the means to implement it,"Predictably, the world has spent four years getting excited about ambitious targets and has given itself little more than four months to work out how to pay for them. We are a quarter of the way through 2015 and the September summit that will set the development agenda for the next 15 years is within sight. The conference that will discuss where the money is to come from takes place even sooner, in Addis Ababa in July. But ask anyone what can be expected and you will see worried faces. This is typical. In a household, it would be economic folly to lay out grand plans without having the money to pay for them.
But in UN negotiations, the rational way of doing things gets inverted. First a big vision is agreed, and only then does anyone pause to see if there is money in the bank to pay for it. Of course, one school of thought says that setting out a grand vision in a mood of can-do optimism is the best way to gather the funds required to make that vision a reality. This approach – pretty much the one adopted when the millennium development goals (MDGs) were established in 2000 – hinges on new and exciting targets, announced amid much fanfare, themselves becoming the main drivers of new funds. This time round, the prospects of such a strategy working are marginally better. Back in 2000, there was no serious discussion about the MDGs outside of a few back rooms in the UN, and the meeting to discuss financing them took place (in Monterrey) two years after they had been agreed. At least this time the financing conference will take place before the SDGs are announced. Indeed, this was insisted on by the G77, the group of “developing” countries that, increasingly, is running the show as traditionally powerful counterparts (namely the OECD group of donors) timidly agree. It is terribly 1990s for rich governments to call the shots. But in this new era of the Brics and Mics, Civets and Mints, the major governments of the south are enjoying their newfound status as powerbrokers. The message they are sending by placing the financing conference before the SDG conference is simple: without the means to implement these ambitious goals, we may as well not have them. But the fundamental problem remains. Far more effort is put into setting the agenda than in working out how to pay for it. And with the MDGs, far more time was spent mapping progress than holding governments to account for the pledges they made on financing – the crucial driver of that progress. So here is a novel idea, one suggested by the scholar and former head of the UN policy department Inge Kaul. Instead of measuring outputs, we should measure inputs. The financing for development (FFD) conferences of the past have been commitment-fests, but with no serious follow-up mechanisms. This time could be different.
The zero draft of the outcome document for the Addis conference is not bad. It identifies the main inputs required if the SDG targets, the outputs, are to be met: setting ambitious levels of tax and spending that countries have to reach to pay for social and infrastructural progress; supportive public finance from international partners; changes to the global financial architecture that will enable poorer countries to develop faster. It is by no means perfect, but it covers most of the bases. But it doesn’t much matter what the commitments are if no one is following them up. We need a concerted effort by negotiators to devise accountability mechanisms that are both politically acceptable (most governments are touchy when it comes to external monitoring) and rigorous. The opportunity lies in the relationship between the FFD commitments and the “means of implementation” in the SDG agenda. If poor countries have to come to the UN every year and report on progress on education, health and so on, then their richer counterparts should follow suit. They should come and report on how they have implemented their financing promises – from aid to tax evasion, climate finance to unfair debts and private sector regulation – because one without the other will no longer wash. Instead of spending all their precious time fine-tuning the precise wording of the various documents to be presented to the world this year, negotiators – and those in civil society who seek to influence them – need to spend just as much time working on how they will be monitored. We need international monitoring processes with real name-and-shame potential. And we also need national mechanisms whereby governments have to report to civil society, parliament and other accountability bodies. The world doesn’t need another round of unkept financial promises. Less ambitious commitments that are kept are preferable to lofty promises that are soon forgotten.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/13/sustainable-development-wont-happen-without-the-means-to-implement-it,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/13/sustainable-development-wont-happen-without-the-means-to-implement-it
2015-04-10T16:31:49Z,global-development,Global development,Kenya criticised for closure of money transfer firms following Garissa attack,"NGOs have raised concerns about the disruption of a vital humanitarian lifeline after Kenya ordered the closure of 13 remittance companies specialising in money transfers to Somalia. The closures, a response to allegations that the firms have links with al-Shabaab, follow the Islamist group’s deadliest attack on Kenyan soil, the Garissa University shootings that left 148 people dead on 2 April. The shutdowns will make it harder for ordinary Somalis to pay for food, water, healthcare and education, according to a statement issued by 15 NGOs. Somalis depend on their friends and relatives abroad to send home about $1.3bn (£890m) annually. This amounts to more than all development and humanitarian aid to the country combined, according to Keeping the Lifeline Open, a report by Oxfam, Adeso and the Inter-American Dialogue. Rahma Mohamed, 39, lives in Hargeisa, the capital of Somaliland, a self-declared country in northern Somalia. She depends on money transfers from her ex-husband, who lives in Europe, to support herself and her eight children. “I don’t work and I do not have any other source of income, so I can’t imagine any other way I would support my family if the remittance companies are closed,” she said. The concerns raised by Mohamed were reflected in the NGOs’ statement. “Somali families are losing their only formal, transparent and regulated channel through which to send and receive money,” they said. “Many of the companies whose licences have been suspended are delivering legitimate, formal remittances to the country and should be allowed to continue their services.” The Kenyan government is under pressure to respond to last week’s attack, which left students hiding in cupboards for days. On Sunday and Monday it launched air strikes against al-Shabaab camps near the border with Somalia.
On Tuesday, the government issued a blacklist of 85 individuals, groups and companies that will have their licences revoked, preventing them from conducting business in Kenya. Included in the list were al-Qaida, Islamic State and the Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram. Banks in the US and the UK have also closed accounts used by Somali remittance firms for international money transfers, likewise fearing that funds could end up in the hands of al-Shabaab and other militant groups. But the aid agencies warned that closing money transfer firms would hinder humanitarian and development operations, making them more difficult to pay for. Experts have long raised concerns that such closures will drive money transfers further underground, making them even more difficult to monitor. As Laura Hammond, senior lecturer in development studies at Soas, University of London, has observed: “People will send money the way they did before Somali money transfer companies were formed: in cash, stashed in bags and pockets, or in other ways that will be impossible to track.” Rights groups and NGOs said the Kenyan government was punishing civil society groups rather than stifling funding sources for militants. “This list raises more questions than answers,” said Leslie Lefkow, deputy Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “Individuals and entities on the list, including licensed agencies providing essential funds, have a right to transparency and due process. Including respected human rights groups like Muslims for Human Rights and Haki Africa, who have done excellent work documenting abuses by security forces, also raises the suspicion that this may be backlash for their critical work.” The statement was issued by Adeso, CARE, CEFA, Concern Worldwide, COOPI Cooperazione Internazionale, the Danish Refugee Council, KAALO Aid and Development, Mercy Corps, Mercy-USA for Aid and Development, Norwegian Church Aid, Oxfam, Polish Humanitarian Action, Solutions for Humanity Somalia, VSF Suisse, and World Vision Somalia. The statement said: “While recognising the many challenges faced by the government of Kenya in trying to stem terrorism, a disruption to flows of genuine remittances to Somalia should be avoided. If sustained, these closures could prove costly, cause inefficiencies, and at worse force some aid agencies to close their operations.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/10/kenya-closure-money-transfer-firms-garissa-attack-al-shabaab,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/10/kenya-closure-money-transfer-firms-garissa-attack-al-shabaab
2015-04-10T12:23:43Z,global-development,Global development,Women's human rights defenders under threat – podcast transcript,"Reporters and presenters: LF: Liz Ford DF: Daysi Flores NF: Nimalka Fernando MAAK: Maryam Abdulhadi al-Khawaja TB: Tania Branigan PMN: Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka KM: Khouloud Mahdhaoui DF She’s now convicted of the crime of defamation because he’s a very powerful man. He sued her and he won. There is no justice here. LF That is the voice of Daysi Flores, a human rights defender from Honduras, and she’s referring to the case of Gladys Lanza, a human rights activist from the country. DF Women are really in a very bad position in the whole world but in countries like Honduras, where we actually face no rights at all, women have the worse part. And women who speak up are really worse. LF Gladys Lanza was convicted for defending a woman who accused a government official of sexual harassment. Lanza is just one of the many recent examples of what appears to be a systematic targeting of human rights defenders. For women, this can often have a more sinister dimension.
My name is Liz Ford, and in this edition of the Guardian’s Global development podcast we look at the challenges faced by women human rights defenders around the world. In 1995, 189 governments signed a historic agenda for women’s empowerment. The Beijing Platform for Action, agreed at the fourth world conference on women, made a specific call for women engaged in the defence of human rights to be protected. Twenty years on, that call seems to be going unheeded. NF I’m Nimalka Fernando from Sri Lanka. I have been a human rights activist for over 30 years. As a woman activist I was always portrayed as a bad woman, an evil woman. The newspapers’ editors would write or refer to us as sex workers or charlatans. And the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, in one of the programmes, titled [it] Stoning the Sinner Woman because I spoke about the rights of sex workers, I spoke about the manner in which we have the right to go and work in the UN openly, transparently. They discussed the ways and means of how to kill us, kill me and kill other human rights defenders while cooperating with the UN. LF As we reach 20 years since Beijing, many believe we are experiencing a global crackdown on human rights defenders and specifically those who are fighting for women’s rights. MAAK My name is Maryam Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, I’m a Bahraini human rights defender and a co-director of the Gulf Centre for Human Rights. At the Gulf centre we focus mainly on working with human rights defenders’ protection training and so on. And we cover the same countries: the Gulf Cooperation Council six and then also Iraq, Iran, Yemen and Sierra, so we keep quite busy. We’ve seen the systematic targeting of human rights defenders in all the countries that we cover. And they range from anything from extrajudicial killings to judicial harassment to defamation and so on, the list is quite long. KF Not long after the conviction of Gladys Lanza in Honduras, female activists in China were detained in what for many were very surprising circumstances. Tania Branigan is the Guardian’s China correspondent. TB There’s been a much broader crackdown on activism in China over the last couple of years so we’ve seen a lot of people detained and charged and convicted. But what’s very striking in this case is that these young women were simply planning to put up stickers campaigning against sexual harassment. Now of course sexual harassment is against the Chinese law as it stands. This wasn’t a big organisation, they see themselves very much as individuals I think, [judging] from my previous interviews with them. And as I said, they were simply trying to highlight the problems women face on public transport. And yet they were detained even before that international women’s day event could take place, just a couple of days before. One of their lawyers said, “Look, the government’s long talked about the protection of women’s rights and the promotion of gender equality, and that’s just what they’re doing.” I think it has to be seen, as I said, in the context of this broader tightening of activists of all kinds. We’ve definitely seen more detentions and more arrests and convictions. And the concern now is that because they’ve been formally detained, they weren’t just taken away by police, but they’re going through a formal legal process now that we may yet see some of them charged. And if they’re charged in China they’re very, very likely to be convicted. LF Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the executive director of UN Women, believes that the wave of extremism around the world has definitely impacted on the way women’s human rights defenders – in fact, women who make any kind of stand at all – are treated. PMN The wave of extremism that we have seen, which is accompanied by extraordinary violence, has definitely impacted on women. Not only is the violence that we see traumatising communities, men as well, but it also particularly targets women almost for additional violence and humiliation. Because I think it is also accompanied by a stand that says, “How dare you get involved as a woman?” MAAK Most of the targeting that we’ve seen being used against women human rights defenders we’ve seen being used against the men human rights defenders as well. Anything from the attacks here in protest, imprisonment, assault, torture – both physical, psychological and sexual. The long sentences that are disproportionate to the charges that people are facing. So it’s a very, very long list of tools of oppression that are being used by the government. LF While both women and men human rights defenders are coming under increasing attack from governments, women from countries where they have little or no rights can be more vulnerable than their male counterparts. PMN Sometimes the law that defends all the citizens in specific countries will not be as protective of women as it is of men who are also human rights defenders, which means that they are much more exposed than their male counterparts. Women are killed, in many cases they were brutalised by rape. When they are captured they would also be tortured in a specific way. KM I’m Khouloud Mahdhaoui, journalist, audio-visual activist and president of Chouf Minorities, an LGBT organisation. So basically two LGBT women, an activist in Chouf and also a board member of the organisation, have been attacked last month. First one was raped by a man who threatened her by knife to her throat and beat her on the face. The second one was physically and verbally [attacked] by two men. We notice an obvious rise of these attacks recently. This week, during the last days of the World Social Forum, activists from Chouf and other LGBT organisations have been attacked by a group of people inside the university campus where the World Social Forum itself was held. The rise of the attacks is also parallel to the courage of activists who are not afraid any more to fight for their right and to call for the abolition of law 230, [which] criminalises homosexuality. LF Daysi Flores. DF Sexual assault, it seems like a way of controlling our bodies and controlling ourselves. After the coup the first thing they actually did was to ban the morning-after pill, and they keep on controlling our bodies like that. Three women were actually killed [recently], they were taken out of the car and killed just over there in the street. And when we were demonstrating there, cars just passed by telling us that they were murdered because they were a whore or because we have to go back home and stay home in order not to be killed and things like that. And people think that way. And still women keep in fighting. LF Sexuality is not the only way that women human rights defenders are being targeted. Maryam Abdulhadi al-Khawaja believes that governments are finding new ways to try to silence activists. MAAK One of the things that I think is very interesting is the unconventional methods that regimes have now learned to use that don’t get as much international attention. Like, for example, preventing sons and daughters of human rights defenders from getting birth certificates, for example, so they become stateless. Or targeting activists through sentencing, which makes their work, of course – and travelling, and their right to movement – much more difficult, which has been the case in my case. LF The extent of the targeting has at times caused many women human rights defenders to question their work. Let’s hear from Nimalka Fernando.
NF There is mental trauma. There are times when we ourselves question whether what we are doing is wrong. There are periods when we have to remain silent because it will have implications [for] our families. So they use these methods to silence us and to divert our attention from actually raising these issues. It becomes so personal sometimes you are involved in trying to defend yourself, and at times this can divert you from actually handling the issue. So I think when they become personal what we try to do is not take it as a personal attack, but to look at it as something that is coming from the system. LF But why are these attacks allowed to continue? As well as the Beijing Platform for Action, the majority of UN member states have ratified a raft of other international conventions to empower women and protect their rights. One of them is the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women, or Cedaw. Cedaw was adopted in 1979 by the UN general assembly, and has been described as an international bill of rights for women. But ratifying a convention is not always enough. For example, Honduras has ratified the agreement, but does not recognise the committee that monitors compliance to the convention and, therefore, cannot be held accountable to it. DF Before the coup d’état we were like going in the path of having the democratic state and just building some laws within the women’s movement and trying to get those laws according to the Cedaw convention. But those laws have just been sat there. They’re just sitting there. They’re not working for us any more after the coup. And they had a lot of challenges before. But now they government has actually shut the doors of the civil society, particularly women’s movement. MAAK I think accountability is at the forefront of what needs to happen. When we’re talking about resolutions being passed like the resolution on women human rights defenders and on human rights defenders in general, that’s a good first step. But if they’re not implemented, then it’s nothing more than just lip service. It’s very important that these governments are held accountable. When you have governments like the Bahraini government, the Saudi government, the Egyptian government who are active participants in the Human Rights Council getting away with targeting women human rights defenders and human rights defenders in general, it really puts this at the forefront of the issues. Well, OK, we passed resolutions – but then what next? How do you actually enforce these mechanisms to hold these governments accountable when they do target women human rights defenders and human rights defenders in general? TB A number of people have expressed concern about this case in particular, and that’s quite striking actually because, very often, when you see detentions it really sort of goes unnoticed or under the radar. LF Tania Branigan, our China correspondent. TB In this case we’ve had the British government calling for their immediate release. We’ve had Samantha Power, the US ambassador to the UN, speaking out and saying they really should be let go and saying that the charge they were being held on, which was creating a disturbance, was really just a pretext for punishing them for the issues they were raising. And the EU has also spoken out. But China has been very clear in saying we think this is an issue of our judicial sovereignty, we don’t think it’s anything to do with you. Don’t get involved, basically. I think what’s very striking about these detentions as well is of course that they happened just before International Women’s Day, that they happened as nations were meeting at the UN to talk about the challenges facing women internationally, and to talk about the fact that it’s 20 years this year since the big Beijing meeting on women, and the Beijing Declaration. Now obviously there were questions at the time about how strong that declaration was. There are concerns this year about whether it will be watered down and so forth. But I think a lot of people have really felt quite strongly that there’s this real disconnect or this very jarring conjunction of these detentions set against plans to mark the 20th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration. LF 2015 also marks the deadline for the millennium development goals and the launch of a new set of targets, the sustainable development goals. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, says the 17 goals must uphold human rights and promote the free, active and meaningful engagement of civil society. PMN Overall, with the sustainable development goals, what is still remaining now is to finish the negotiations. But it’s actually bigger than just violence against women. It is also an issue that must arise where we focus on all aspects of human rights. MAAK There’s two ways of looking at it. It’s always an issue of well, if you separate the two, if you look at women human rights defenders as being a separate issue to human rights defenders in general, are you actually risking making it easier for governments who will say, “We’ll deal with human rights defenders on one hand. And women human rights defenders are a separate issue so we don’t necessarily have to deal with that right now.” So we do have the risk of creating that kind of environment, which I think is very problematic. It’s very important to reinforce the idea that women rights and women human rights, the protection of women human rights defenders, should come hand in hand with human rights in general, and the protection of human rights defenders in general. They should not be seen as a separate issue at all.
PMN It is an issue under the goal that deals with women because in that goal there’s also the issue of violence against women. It also is an issue where we are looking at women in the rule of law, because what happens is that the rule of law where the rule of law exists is set aside, because this violence against women is not only perpetrated by non-state actors; sometimes it is state actors, which means that countries violate their own laws. So we do need to work with the human rights, established human rights bodies in those countries – where those bodies exist – to take the issue of women in a particular way, and to show that women are facing a particular kind of violence. LF Goal five calls for an end to all forms of discrimination against women and girls everywhere, but will this next set of goals make any difference ?PMN It’s a mentality of patriarchy that sees women as lesser beings and therefore they have no rights to stand up. Whether they are standing up in countries that are more democratic where there is rule of law; or in countries where women are much more exposed because the laws in human rights protection is not as strong. LF Daysi Flores believes the case of Gladys Lanza is the government’s way of sending a direct message to women human rights defenders. DF This is actually a warning. They are actually telling us that they have tools to silence us. Even though they’re not really achieving the silence of Gladys Lanza. In the opening statement the lawyer actually said that they wanted to set a precedent for women who work in this kind of organisation, that’s how he referred about us. PMN In one way we have to be pushing for perpetrators to be brought to book, but on the other end which is the first prize? It’s actually to defend the women, so that they do not have to go through this kind of violence in the first place. LF The consensus is that women’s economic empowerment is what is most needed to bring about lasting change. Let’s hear from Khouloud Mahdhaoui in Tunisia. KM What is needed to be done both nationally and globally is to show women their financial independence. In fact, many of them can’t even report attacks because they might find themselves on the street if they do. Sustainable development goals can help women financially and give them an opportunity to ensure their independence from the family and especially from the father. It will give more freedom and security to female activists. PMN A critical mass of women with economic means is important to shift women and to reach a tipping point of the number of women that are living above the poverty line and are able to make their own decisions. LF To put these measures in place what is needed are the finances and resources, and also for governments to agree globally on the scale of gender inequality. How can it be done? PMN We need a lot of advocates for that because it’s almost like woman’s issues are a micro enterprise of the global agenda. And yet this is the global agenda of the majority of humanity. There’s a disconnect between everybody agreeing how big are the issues that impact on women and the amount of resources that are therefore allocated for this agenda that everybody agrees is very big. It cuts across, it arises in every endeavour of life. I try to emphasise to women that we actually have to treat this as a global phenomena. The consequences for women are different in different countries. And in the review of 20 years of Beijing that comes across very strongly, that one thing that has held us back in the last 20 years has been the stereotypes about women; it’s been the attitudes; it’s been the norms and the lack of will, or sometimes strategy among ourselves, as women’s movements, to fight – specifically – those attitudes. I think we’ve fought some of the things that were more tangible, such as access to health services and so on. But maybe the inability to overcome the intangibles has meant that, from generation to generation, we’ve seen the world changing but [the] mentality of most of the men that we have to deal with not changing. LF In the struggle for gender equality, women’s human rights defenders face working against age-old stereotypes and also with the insurmountable tasks of attempting to transform one of the oldest institutions in human history – that of patriarchy. PMN We actually have to remove the wall of patriarchy within which we have tended maybe to try and survive and have the whole world adapting to a world without patriarchy rather than women trying to survive better within patriarchy. LF In Honduras, Gladys Lanza is feeling the power of that system. On 26 March she was sentenced to 18 months in prison for defamation.

2015-04-10T11:18:16Z,global-development,Global development,Yemen conflict leaves nearby countries increasingly stretched as thousands flee,"People displaced by the civil war in Yemen are taking speedboats and ferries across the Gulf of Aden to reach neighbouring African countries where refugee camps are already stretched thin, raising fears that prolonged fighting could strain humanitarian resources. Clashes between Houthi rebel fighters and forces loyal to the internationally recognised president Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who last month fled to Saudi Arabia, have triggered the exodus. So far, more than 600 people have been killed in the conflict. Yemeni fisherman have been the first to flee, using their own boats to cross the Gulf of Aden to Djibouti, the closest safe haven, which can take as little as two hours to reach by speedboat. Ethiopian and Somali migrants, who had made the journey in the opposite direction, are also returning home. Djibouti has received 4,260 migrants from Yemen, according to Chissey Mueller, Yemen project manager for the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). “If the conflict stays at this escalated pace, with the air strikes and the fighting hot in the south, it will strain on Djibouti’s humanitarian resources. Djibouti is a very, very small country and it already hosts many refugees and migrants. It will be very difficult,” said Mueller.
Somaliland, a self-declared country in northern Somalia, has received 270 migrants from Yemen. A further 389 people have arrived in Puntland, another Somali breakaway state, according to the IOM. “There has been some movement of people fleeing Yemen to Somalia and Djibouti,” said Carlotta Wolf, a spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). “The numbers so far are small but we are preparing for a larger influx, should it occur.” Djibouti, Somaliland and Puntland already host tens of thousands of refugees, according to the UNHCR. Djibouti is home to about 24,000 refugees, while Somaliland hosts roughly 9,000 displaced people. The UNHCR is preparing a refugee camp that will host new arrivals in Djibouti, which is less than 30km from Yemen, said Frédéric Van Hamme, a UNHCR spokesman based in Djibouti. Somaliland’s foreign minister, Mohamed Yonis, said he is expecting to receive up to 2,000 Yemeni refugees and is in talks with the EU and USAid about providing assistance for them. “It will be a challenge – we have a lot of Ethiopian refugees in Somaliland, we have a lot of internally displaced people. But we hope the international community will come to the rescue,” said Yonis. People fleeing Yemen face a 12-hour journey by sea to reach Berbera, Somaliland’s main port. Somaliland currently hosts 2,153 refugees and 6,805 asylum seekers, mainly from Ethiopia, according to the UNHCR. “The group [arriving in Somaliland] included elderly men, children and women. They claimed to flee the recent conflict in Taiz, Yemen,” Wolf said. As part of normal migration flows, tens of thousands of Ethiopian and Somali migrants travel across the Gulf of Aden to Yemen hoping to find better economic prospects in Saudi Arabia and freedom from persecution. With Yemen descending into full-blown civil conflict, the fate of nearly 250,000 refugees who have settled in the country – mainly from Somalia – hangs in the balance. About 1 million Ethiopian migrants also live in Yemen, according to the IOM, while UNHCR figures suggest that 330,000 Yemenis are internally displaced by previous waves of violence. Earlier in the week, the IOM said it had evacuated 28 Ethiopian migrants to Djibouti from Yemen by sea. “Thousands of Ethiopians are currently believed to be stranded by the fighting in Yemen and in need of evacuation. IOM Ethiopia is working with the Ethiopian government and its offices in Yemen and Djibouti to evacuate the most vulnerable and provide post-arrival assistance,” the IOM said. Links between Somali Islamist insurgency al-Shabaab and Yemen-based Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) have raised fears that terror groups may take advantage of new migration flows. “We have a task force looking into [the effect of Yemeni migrants on Somaliland] and we are putting contingency planning in place,” Yonis said. “While we welcome [refugees] of course, we have to remain vigilant and ensure there are no radical elements in the groups coming in and we’re doing a proper screening process on the groups coming in.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/10/yemen-crisis-refugees-humanitarian-resources-stretched-thousands-flee,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/10/yemen-crisis-refugees-humanitarian-resources-stretched-thousands-flee
2015-04-10T09:55:43Z,global-development,Global development,Life on the Ebola frontline: 'The virus took a knife to our Easter celebrations' | Isaac Bayoh,"It is a few days after Easter and I can’t believe that so far this year I have not been able to go to the beach or even hang out with my friends. Our lives have been turned upside down by Ebola. We no longer do what normal human beings do. In Sierra Leone, people mostly spend Easter going to church on Sunday; then, on Monday, there’s a new mood as almost everyone goes to the beach. There is lots of food, drinks and partying till morning. That did not happen this year. Many of us still can’t believe how this virus entered our land and took a knife to everything that holds us together. Our lives are on hold and our livelihoods destroyed. Jobs remain difficult to find, as most organisations are still closed and we’ve had to adjust to the available work being related to Ebola. The virus has stopped us doing the traditional things passed down the generations; it has taken away those dear to us and left us traumatised. I was hoping we would celebrate Easter as usual, to make up for the way we could not properly mark Christmas. But as the emergency law is in place, I told my children to be happy even if there was no Easter celebration. I couldn’t buy many things as I did the last time. When Ebola came, Mr Kamara had to switch profession from teacher to grave digger. Kamara’s youngest child wanted to celebrate his fourth Easter by visiting the beach and going out on a boat. But his dream was destroyed by the outbreak. Easter was also ruined for George, an Ebola survivor who has recovered well to a point that, when he passes by, people say: ‘You would never know this boy had the virus’. He told me how he had struggled to integrate back into normal life. He got the virus from a neighbour when he went to fetch water. He still sees in his mind those who were with him at the hospital, especially his brother. George infected him and he did not make it. For now, he spends his time telling people about his survival. One thing keeping him going is the thought that his survival at least gives people hope and faith. Going 42 days without any infectious cases in Bo and Pujehun districts has not led to much change yet, because other areas are still having new cases. Even if we go 1,000 days without any new confirmed cases here, we are still very much exposed to the virus, as all it takes is just one person to bring it here and that would take us right back to the beginning. People are desperate for our beloved country to be free of Ebola. We are tired of being stigmatised locally and internationally, but people are still not doing what they are supposed to do, although I can’t bring myself to judge them. I recently met a woman who kept her sick son at home, afraid of taking him to the hospital. She felt her son could only be cured by a traditional healer. Frustrating though this is, I could never understand what she is going through – even though I know she is putting everyone close to her at risk. According to Mr Ansumana, a religious leader and vice principal of one of the famous schools in the country, we have to continue to do what the health workers have been telling us: stay at home and pray to see the end of this outbreak. We are just waiting for that day when we have zero cases. If we can survive 11 years of civil war, I believe we can get through this Ebola crisis and resume our normal lives. We’re almost at the tail end, but we did not expect the kind of fluctuations of infectious cases we are now having. It is just frustrating to see the rise and fall of this virus. We as a country are not taking anything for granted. And the world should not forget that this virus is still here, and no one on Earth is safe; with Ebola, there are no boundaries. But if we stand as one in trying to prevent disasters like this, we will not lose so many beautiful lives again.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/10/life-ebola-frontline-easter-celebrations,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/10/life-ebola-frontline-easter-celebrations
2015-04-10T06:00:07Z,global-development,Global development,Vaccination reminder band tipped to boost global child inoculation rates,"Efforts to increase the number of children who are vaccinated against infectious diseases such as polio and measles have been boosted by the launch of a new ankle band that changes colour to remind parents when their child’s next vaccine shot should be given. The band, announced by Pakistani researchers last week, is designed to alert parents when each round of vaccine is needed by sending “clear visual markers” over the first four months of a child’s life. As part of its drive to improve vaccination rates, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has set up a lottery system. Under the system, parents who get their children vaccinated are entered into a draw to win cash prizes, with text messages sent out reminding parents to continue their child’s vaccination schedule. Vaccinations are used to immunise children against a host of infectious diseases including hepatitis B, diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus. Many parents struggle to complete all three vaccination doses, which are needed to fully immunise children against diseases. The WHO has said that more efforts are needed to help children complete vaccination regimes, pointing out that: “Despite major efforts to improve immunisation coverage … low uptake and delayed immunisations leave [Pakistani] children vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases.” Immunisations prevent about 2-3m deaths every year, according to WHO estimates. But about 21.8 million infants worldwide are still missing out on basic vaccines, the organisation has warned. Sub-Saharan Africa showed the worst polio immunisation record of any region. In 2013, Central African Republic had the world’s lowest polio vaccination rate, with just 23% of children immunised against the disease according to the WHO.
Although nearly three in four Pakistani children are vaccinated against polio – putting the country on a par with India, Peru and Ukraine – some provinces have registered below 40% immunisation coverage, the WHO said. The Taliban, which has banned vaccinations and attacked medical workers, has been blamed for disrupting the country’s efforts to immunise children. As a result, Pakistan accounted for nearly 90% of all polio cases reported in the last six months, according to the WHO. “The lives of millions of children across Pakistan are at risk because of limited access to vaccines,” Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, said in February. In recent months the Pakistani government has been forcing parents to vaccinate their children, raising hopes that more will be immunised. Last month, local authorities arrested hundreds of parents in the city of Peshawar after they refused to give their children polio vaccinations. “This is the first time such drastic action was taken,” said Feroz Shah, a government spokesman. “This shows the determination of the government to eradicate polio.” In January, officials targeted about 35 million children in a nationwide campaign, while smaller vaccination drives are held more frequently. Officials have also implemented new security strategies to help protect vaccinators. Poor energy supply has made storing vaccinations difficult for many developing countries. Pakistan wasted about $3.7m (£2.5m) worth of vaccinations last month because they weren’t refrigerated properly at a government facility. Noor Sabah Rakshani, one of the researchers behind the new ankle band, said it had led to improved completion rates in preliminarily trials after being shipped to Pakistan last year. The band is timed to change colours after set periods, the researchers said. It was developed by Timestrip, a UK-based company, and Trust for Vaccines and Immunisation, and NGO, together with funding from the Gates Foundation. Timestrip’s founder, Reuben Isbitsky, said: “This project has allowed us to support the creation of a simple but life-saving product that could help millions of children who suffer through incomplete vaccination regimes.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/10/vaccination-ankle-band-improving-inoculation-rates-children,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/10/vaccination-ankle-band-improving-inoculation-rates-children
2015-04-09T10:15:08Z,global-development,Global development,Students Speak: Can volunteer holidays be a force for good? | Carla Kweifio-Okai,"Does volunteering abroad on short-term aid projects do more harm than good? It’s an issue that’s hotly debated. Many argue against the rise of the volunteer tourism industry, claiming it hurts the communities it aims to help. Volunteering overseas has also been the butt of jokes parodying the gap-year armies and well-meaning but possibly ill-equipped adults who take time off to make a difference.
But in the rush to take down the “voluntourism” sector, have the detractors overlooked more worthwhile forms of volunteering? A new report from Voluntary Service Overseas and the Institute for Development Studies says yes, claiming that volunteers contribute positively to sustainable development. The Valuing Volunteering report involved both local and international volunteers in Kenya, Mozambique, Nepal and the Philippines, and found that the often informal nature of volunteering proved helpful in reaching the poorest and most vulnerable communities, with volunteers living and working alongside community members. The report also claimed volunteering had created new ways for communities to collaborate on projects and supported people who may not be heard by traditional NGOs or governments.

2015-04-09T09:00:05Z,global-development,Global development,Egyptian law in the dock as Shaimaa al-Sabbagh witnesses go on trial | Jared Maslin,"When Egyptian police were filmed fatally shooting poet and activist Shaimaa al-Sabbagh at a January protest in central Cairo, it underscored the upsurge in the use of lethal force by security forces since the country’s 2011 uprising. Sabbagh’s dying moments, captured on camera, have come to epitomise the Egyptian state’s clampdown on public expressions of dissent, not least because the witnesses who testified about what they saw now find themselves on trial for violating a law that bans unauthorised street protests. Seventeen defendants have been charged under the 2013 edict; if convicted, they could face up to five years in prison and a fine of 50,000 Egyptian pounds, (£4,388). Among them is Azza Soliman, a human rights lawyer. When the case was called in a small, crowded room at Cairo’s Abdeen courthouse on Saturday, her attorney was joined by 16 others, a sea of black robes sweeping forwards to the judge. That Soliman should require legal representation at all marks the point at which a controversial law lurches towards absurdity. While most of the defendants are members of the Socialist Popular Alliance Party, the group behind the January demonstration, Soliman was an accidental witness to Sabbagh’s killing. She had been eating lunch with friends and family in a cafe in Talaat Harb Square when the shooting took place on the street outside. She heard the gunfire, and saw a man carrying away a young woman, blood coming from her face.
At the suggestion of another human rights lawyer, Soliman – who is also the founder of a women’s rights organisation, the Center for Egyptian Women’s Legal Assistance (CEWLA) – went to the office of Egypt’s public prosecutor to record her testimony. She arrived at 7pm but was made to wait until after midnight to testify. She says she stayed, waiting voluntarily, to state what she had seen. During their meeting, the prosecutor informed her that she could end up a defendant herself. “We were laughing,” Soliman recalled. “We were asking him, what’s the legal situation?” The prosecutor read from a police report stating that Soliman participated in the demonstration and attacked police officers. “I went and told the prosecutor, ‘The police killed this woman’. And [instead] the prosecutor believed the police, who killed this woman,” she said. The defendants in the case say their trial is an attempt to shield the security forces from accountability. “The police are sending us a message about their authority,” says Soliman. “Nobody can talk. Nobody can give testimony against the police. This is the message. The rule of law has been weakened.” Sara Brandt, who works with Soliman at CEWLA and had been eating lunch with her on the day of the shooting, echoes those sentiments. “I think its part of a pretty systematic attack on human rights defenders, not only protesters but also people who try to go and witness,” she says. “That they put her on the defendants’ list, someone who is so well-known and well-respected worldwide, really shows us that they don’t hold back with anyone and no one is safe.” Human rights groups say the state prosecutor’s office and sections of the judiciary have repeatedly failed to successfully prosecute members of the security forces accused of killings. Sabbagh was shot in broad daylight when she joined a group of people carrying flowers to Cairo’s Tahrir Square on the eve of the anniversary of the 2011 uprising that led to the downfall of Hosni Mubarak, Egypt’s former president.
Her death not only prompted an international outcry but has also caused ripples domestically. The state prosecutor has charged a police major general and a security forces conscript with concealing evidence relating to the tragedy, according to Reuters, while a spokesman for Egypt’s medical examiner was ridiculed after telling a TV interviewer that Sabbagh was too thin to withstand the birdshot fired at her and others participating in the event. Saturday’s hearing was a brief affair, ending within minutes. After the proceedings had been postponed until 9 May, Sayyed Abu el-Ela – one of the 17 defendants, he was widely pictured carrying the fatally wounded Sabbagh moments after the shooting – sounded a defiant note. “We’re not afraid of the trial. We’re ready,” he said. “This isn’t a trial of 17 people for protesting. I consider this a political trial of 17 people who saw the officer who killed Shaimaa al-Sabbagh.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/09/egyptian-law-shaimaa-al-sabbagh-witnesses-trial-azza-soliman,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/09/egyptian-law-shaimaa-al-sabbagh-witnesses-trial-azza-soliman
2015-04-09T06:00:03Z,global-development,Global development,The best books on Chile: start your reading here,"The House of the Spirits by Isabel Allende, translated by Magda Bogin Allende’s classic, hugely successful family saga is a masterwork of magic-realism. Fusing the personal with the political and fact with fantasy, it tells Chile’s recent history through several generations of the Trueba family, ending with a savage military coup that leads to the death of a president. The principal protagonist, Esteban Trueba, is used to getting his own way – in his family (as an irascible patriarch), on his farm (as a wealthy landowner), and in the country (as a rightwing senator): “The day we can’t get our hands on the ballot boxes before the vote is counted, we’re done for.” When a socialist candidate finally wins the presidential election, Trueba backs a coup. But in the ferocious denouement that follows, he finds himself sidelined as brutality and terror spiral under the newly installed military regime. The novel celebrates the spirit and resilience of the Trueba women, which shine through the political tumult and family turbulence in this clever, witty and stunningly assured debut. Allende’s father was a cousin of President Salvador Allende, who was overthrown and died during a military coup in 1973. In 1975, the author fled to Venezuela, and later moved to the US. She has said the book is an “attempt to recreate the country I had lost, the family I had lost”. Curfew by José Donoso, translated by Alfred MacAdam Donoso’s engrossing novel spans 24 hours in the stifling and oppressive political atmosphere of 1985 Santiago under General Augusto Pinochet’s military regime. A leftwing singer returns after 13 years of exile in Paris. His fame now faded and his politics softened, Mañungo Vera is no longer the revolutionary he once was. His visit coincides with the death of Matilde Neruda, widow of the Nobel prize-winning poet and icon of the Chilean left, Pablo Neruda. Vera is reacquainted with old friends and comrades as they prepare for the funeral. But, caught out by the curfew, he is forced to spend an eventful night on the streets with his former lover, during which they have a dangerous run-in with her suspected torturer. Donoso paints a harrowing picture of life under the repressive regime, and shows how negotiating its daily horrors damages both individuals and society. He also shines a harsh light on the left, as factions squabble and jockey for advantage from the funeral. This intense, introspective tale reflects the political and spiritual decay of the nation, after more than a decade of dictatorship. The author lived abroad for 15 years, returning to Chile in 1982 while Pinochet was still in power. Curfew was the first novel he wrote after his return. He died in 1996. A Nation of Enemies by Pamela Constable and Arturo Valenzuela Chile’s 9/11 comes in 1973, the date when – with US backing – Pinochet violently overthrows the elected government of Allende. In a “spasm of military fury”, the regime crushes its perceived foes and begins “a reign of professional state terror”. Constable and Valenzuela show how the post-putsch climate of fear and loathing further polarises class and politics, and turns Chile into “a nation of enemies”. The regime allows the Chicago Boys, US-trained, evangelical free-marketeers, to impose their “shock treatment” on the economy, bringing boom and bust, and winners and losers – exacerbating the divisions in society. The authors eschew a chronological account of the 17-year dictatorship, instead offering “a window into each sector of society” through research and interviews with hundreds of Chileans. The ageing and paranoid dictator is finally forced from office after a referendum, in which he discovers he’s much less popular than he’d imagined. Pinochet’s coup followed some 150 years of constitutional government, and the country is still coming to terms with that aberration. This is an accessible, balanced and forensic account of how Chile lost and then found its way back to democracy and respect for human rights. Constable is a former deputy foreign editor at the Washington Post. Valenzuela is a Chilean-American academic and former US assistant secretary of state.

2015-04-08T23:01:04Z,global-development,Global development,"Education for All scheme has failed to meet targets, says Unesco","Fifteen years after 164 countries agreed to work towards education for all, just one-third have achieved the six goals set. Meanwhile, the global focus on universal primary education has diverted attention from other crucial areas, such as education quality, adult literacy and early childhood care, a UN agency has said. As world leaders work on a new set of development targets, those early goals remain out of reach for many, with only half the countries that signed up to the 2000 Education for All (EFA) agenda having achieved universal primary enrolment, according to a report by the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco). The report, released in advance of May’s World Education Forum in South Korea, acknowledged that the scorecard for the EFA movement was mixed. “Despite not meeting the 2015 deadline, millions more children are in school than would have been had the trends of the 1990s persisted. However, the agenda is far from finished,” said Irina Bokova, Unesco’s director general. “We need to see specific, well-funded strategies that prioritise the poorest, especially girls, improve the quality of learning and reduce the literacy gap so that education becomes meaningful and universal.” Unesco said that although the pupil-teacher ratio decreased in 121 countries between 1990 and 2012 at primary level, 4 million more teachers were needed to get all children into school. “Trained teachers remain in short supply in one-third of countries: in several sub-Saharan countries, less than 50% are trained,” the report said. The millennium development goal on education stated that by 2015 all boys and girls should complete a full course of primary education. However, although the MDGs have been praised for focusing international attention on specific development needs, Unesco said this emphasis on primary education negatively affected the education for all policy once the MDGs became the dominant agenda. “Efforts since 2000 to advance education around the world became almost synonymous with ensuring that every child is in school … Meanwhile, the focus on universal primary enrolment meant less attention to other crucial areas, such as education quality, early childhood care and education, and adult literacy,” the report said. The report added that education for all could nonetheless be deemed a qualified success. “A lesson re-emerging over the past 15 years is that, while technical solutions are important, gaining political influence and traction is of even greater significance, particularly to realise the scale of reform and action required to achieve EFA at the national level. The current discussions on the post-2015 agenda may be offering just such a chance.” The draft sustainable development goal (SDG) goal on education has 10 targets, including quality primary and secondary education for all boys and girls by 2030, equal access to quality early childhood development, and equal access for all women and men to affordable quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university. Unesco said an extra $22bn (£14.7bn) a year was needed on top of “already ambitious” government contributions to achieve the SDGs by 2030. Despite the progress made since 2000, 58 million children are still out of school, while about 100 million do not complete primary education. The report found that 52% of countries achieved universal primary education, but the world’s most marginalised continued to lose out.
“The world’s poorest children are four times more likely not to go to school than the world’s richest children, and five times more likely not to complete primary school. Conflict remains a steep barrier, with a high and growing proportion of out-of-school children living in conflict zones,” the report said. “The quality and availability of teacher training, scarcity of textbooks and resources, and class size remain serious challenges affecting education quality,” according to the authors, who also noted that the sector remains underfinanced. “Many governments have increased spending, but few have prioritised education in national budgets, and most fall short of allocating the recommended 20% needed to bridge funding gaps. The picture is similar with donors, who, after an initial boost in aid budgets, have reduced aid to education since 2010 and not sufficiently prioritised those countries most in need.” Between 1999 and 2012, 38 countries increased their spending by one percentage point or more of national income, but education was not a priority in many national budgets. The report urged governments to make at least one year of pre-primary education compulsory, and to abolish fees for tuition, textbooks, uniforms and transport. One area where progress was particularly slow was in achieving the EFA goal of a 50% drop in adult illiteracy by 2015. Only 25% of countries managed this, with 32% falling far short. “While globally, the percentage of illiterate adults fell from 18% in 2000 to 14% in 2015, this progress is almost entirely attributed to more educated young people reaching adulthood. Women continue to make up almost two-thirds of the illiterate adult population. Half of sub-Saharan African women do not have basic literacy skills,” the report said. Gender parity would be achieved at the primary level in 69% of countries by 2015, and by 48% at secondary level, said the report, which also noted that child marriage and early pregnancy are hindering girls’ progress, as is the need for teacher training in gender-sensitive approaches and curriculum reform.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/09/education-for-all-scheme-failed-meet-targets-unesco,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/09/education-for-all-scheme-failed-meet-targets-unesco
2015-04-08T10:40:42Z,global-development,Global development,Foreign aid close to record peak after donors spend $135bn in 2014,"Aid spending by the world’s richest states hovered around an all-time high last year, but development assistance to the least-developed countries (LDCs) fell by 16% from the year before, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has said. Member states of the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC) spent more than $135bn (£90bn) on official development assistance (ODA) last year, a 0.5% decrease from 2013, when a record amount of development aid was sent, according to the OECD. Huge debt relief to Burma was behind much of the fall in aid to LDCs, the OECD said in its annual report (pdf). But excluding this relief, aid flows to the world’s poorest countries still fell by 8% as donors favoured loans to middle-income states, the OECD said. Last year the world’s largest aid donors by volume were the US, the UK, Germany, France and Japan, the data showed. Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and the UK spent more than 0.7% of their gross national income (GNI) on ODA, exceeding the UN’s suggested level of aid spending for rich countries. Last month, the UK became the first country to enshrine in law its commitment to spending 0.7% of GNI on overseas aid.
“I am encouraged to see that development aid remains at a historic high at a time when donor countries are still emerging from the toughest economic crisis of our lifetime,” said the OECD secretary general, José Ángel Gurría. Crises such as the Ebola outbreak in west Africa and mass displacement in Central African Republic, South Sudan and Syria triggered a 22% rise in humanitarian spending among the DAC’s 28 member countries, which spent $13bn in that area last year, the OECD said. Sub-Saharan African countries received $36bn in ODA last year, the most of any region, according to the OECD’s preliminary estimates. South and central Asia received $21bn, making it the second-most funded region. Last year Finland, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland showed the biggest rise in aid flows, while development spending by Australia, Canada, France, Japan, Poland, Portugal and Spain fell the most, the data showed. “ODA remains crucial for the poorest countries and we must reverse the trend of declining aid to the least-developed countries. OECD ministers recently committed to provide more development assistance to the countries most in need. Now we must make sure we deliver on that commitment,” said Erik Solheim, the DAC chair. The DAC’s total aid spending has increased by 66% since 2000. But aid flows to LDCs, which comprises two-thirds of their external finance, must be increased, the OECD said. “The decline in ODA to LDCs is something that we’ve been worried about for a couple of years,” said Yasmin Ahmad, database manager at DAC, noting that the group has incentivised more lending to the poorest countries. The DAC said in December that it would target more assistance to LDCs and other vulnerable nations. It said it would change the way concessional loans are calculated and reported to offer donors more credit for aid that is sent to the poorest countries. “The share of total development assistance invested in the poorest countries is at its lowest level since 2005, when world leaders gathered in Gleneagles and made historic pledges to end extreme poverty,” said Adrian Lovett, the ONE campaign’s Europe director, who urged donors to send at least 50% of their aid to LDCs. Some donors, such as the UK’s Department for International Development, have come under fire for ramping up spending on fragile states without proper monitoring or safeguards against corruption. But the DAC said peer reviews of the aid spending by DAC member countries are conducted every four to five years. “We examine the policies and programmes of DAC donor countries to see what the positive aspects are that other countries can implement and what can be improved,” Ahmad said. Aid spending has targeted good governance and improved health and education since the adoption of the millennium development goals, according to Ahmad. The report projects a slight increase in aid spending up to 2018 as rich countries continue to emerge from the financial crisis. Gurría said: “Our challenge as we finalise post-2015 development goals this year will be to find ways to get more of this aid to the countries that need it most and to ensure we are getting as much as we can out of every dollar spent.” The donor community is gearing up for the UN’s Financing for Development conference in Addis Ababa in July, which will need to address funding for the sustainable development goals (SDGs), scheduled to be introduced at the end of the year. Ahmad said preliminary estimates indicate that the SDGs could cost up to $4tn a year, meaning that more funding will need to be generated. “If every donor met the 0.7% target, we’d be nowhere near that sum, so ODA cannot be seen as one of the only sources for inputting into the SDGs, there will be a wide variety of actors involved in that,” she said. “There is no way that public funds can be assumed to meet the SDGs.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/08/foreign-aid-spending-2014-least-developed-countries,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/08/foreign-aid-spending-2014-least-developed-countries
2015-04-08T08:00:05Z,global-development,Global development,Syria: ‘My family called from Idlib. They wanted my help to flee the fighting’,"I got the call last Friday. My family in Idlib city wanted me to help them to escape the fighting and air strikes. It was two days before I was able to get there, and in that time I couldn’t speak to them as all the phone lines were down. I didn’t sleep those two nights. By last Sunday morning I was in a car with two of my friends; we were going back to our home city, which we had not seen for more than two years – all three of us were searching for the families we had lost contact with.
We travelled in silence, lost in thought about how the city would look. We held our breath as we crossed deserted checkpoints. We were three grown men in a car with eyes full of tears shouting: “We are here, inside our city. We are finally here.” All around were destroyed tanks and cars, and gaping holes in the sides of the buildings. We drove past the main petrol station that had been destroyed by an airstrike, before reaching a hospital in the city centre that was still on fire after having just been hit in an airstrike. It is here that those caught up in the latest fighting are brought – both the injured and the dead. Finally, I arrived at my at my family home. I knocked on the door, but there was no response. I sat on the stairs feeling hopeless and wondering: “Where are they? Are they safe?” I struggled down the stairs. As I reached the street, I saw three dead bodies on the pavement in front of my house. Driving around the city trying to find my family, I stopped at a number of schools that now stand abandoned. I met three teachers I knew who were worried about their relatives and their students. With a heavy sigh, a teacher asked me: “Do you know Mohammed? His child is a student in my class. Their house was destroyed by an airstrike last night; I don’t know what happen[ed] to them. I hope they are alive.” As we stood watching a group of children in the street, another of the teachers said: “Poor children, they have lost everything. They’ve lost their happiness, their education, and their dreams! Who is going to help them?” I drove around, and saw the fear on the faces of people as they stared up at the sky. A few minutes later, I heard a huge explosion close by. Driving away, I saw a family of three adults and five children desperately squeezing into a small car. The children were crying and a woman was saying to the youngest ones: “My dears don’t cry, the aircraft is far from us.” Once they were in the car they quickly left – just one of the many families fleeing the city. Trucks and cars filled with people are leaving the city in droves. Many are moving in with extended family members, into collective shelters, or into makeshift camps on farmland. Basic services in the city have stopped, although a few shops are open and some organisations are providing emergency food and shelter. One of my friends is a doctor. He said that because there is no electricity he is worried about the vaccines stored in fridges. Another friend’s sisters told me that the government building where all the students’ records are stored is in an area where there is frequent shelling and air strikes. If these are lost, what will happen to those children’s futures? Since the fighting in Idlib began more than two weeks ago, children have stopped attending school and many teachers have fled. My sister is among those teachers. She is worried about how and when she will be able to start work again. Before this latest fighting, attendance at the schools in the city was very high – at odds with much of the rest of the country. Parents tell me that education is one of their major concerns for their children. But with teachers and families dispersing, and schools filling up with displaced families, where will these children go and who will teach them? Finally, having driven through my deserted city for hours, I went back to my house hoping my family might be there. They weren’t, but a neighbour told me they had managed to leave the city and are living in a small town just two hours away. I have not yet seen them but at least I know that, for now, they are safe. • Mohammed (surname withheld) is an aid worker for Save the Children in Syria",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/08/syria-my-family-called-from-idlib-they-wanted-my-help-to-flee-the-fighting,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/08/syria-my-family-called-from-idlib-they-wanted-my-help-to-flee-the-fighting
2015-04-08T06:00:02Z,global-development,Global development,Women's organisations fighting Ebola should be funded as a first-line defence,"Ebola is far from over, but funding is slowing to hard-hit Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Long before international aid arrived, and long after international aid workers leave, community organisations and local volunteers will be grappling with the disease and its effects. In Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, women have been disproportionately affected by Ebola, and many of those on the frontline in the fight against it are women’s organisations, and individual women. Fatmata Sesay was one of the first nurses sent to the Ebola ward at the Kenema government hospital, the worst-hit district in Sierra Leone, a country with more than 3,600 deaths since the World Health Organisation officially declared the outbreak a year ago. Sesay nursed many people back to health, including her 12-year-old daughter and one of her colleagues, but with inadequate equipment and protection she became infected. She now has serious medical side effects, including partial blindness, and depression. Her property was burned down as a health precaution. She was taken off the payroll by the hospital, after her name was mistakenly put on the list of deceased medical personnel. She has received no compensation, salary or other benefits for several months when the mistake came to light. She stayed active by volunteering at a private clinic that helps Ebola orphans, which has now closed. Isolated, her main source of comfort has been members of an Ebola survivors’ group. Many survivors of the disease face similar issues and some are receiving help, often by local groups. A group of funders has pulled together to support on-the-ground initiatives with a call to action launched by more than 30 donors in this open letter. Funders want broader recognition of the effectiveness of in-country organisations and more intensive funding for them. The letter draws attention to the fact that women’s grassroots groups can get resources to under-served women and young people facing cultural and economic constraints. Seventeen of the signatories are already getting funds to local organisations, including women’s community groups. The impact of Ebola on women has been significant, in their role as caregivers in the home and the community, traders travelling across borders, and nurses in local clinics.
In July 2014, Liberia’s minister for gender and development, Julia Duncan-Cassell, learned from the country’s health teams that 75% of those who were infected or died were women. In August, the UN children’s agency, Unicef, reported that 55% to 60% of those who died from ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone were women. While large aid organisations and international NGOs have focused on setting up clinics and delivering healthcare workers and much-needed supplies, local organisations, embedded within affected communities, have played a vital complementary role in the fight against Ebola. These local groups reach tens of thousands of individuals in hard-to-reach communities and provide much needed information, supplies and services. As is often the case, funding local groups often means funding women’s organisations. In a crisis, they become frontline responders. In Guinea, Association pour la Défense des Droits des Enfants et des Femmes en Guinée – a women’s association reaching a large network of women particularly in rural areas – carried out a radio awareness campaign in multiple languages, went door to door to visit families, particularly speaking with female carers and trained religious leaders to communicate Ebola prevention facts and counter misinformation. As a result, families were more likely to seek testing when sick, and to delay burial rites, which can transmit Ebola, until the deceased were tested and cleared. In Liberia, the Let Girls Lead network of local organisations educated communities about preventing Ebola, packaged and distributed free sanitary kits, and worked to help families remain healthy. In Sierra Leone and Guinea, women’s rights organisations funded by Urgent Action Fund-Africa carried out sanitisation activities, and developed and disseminated materials to raise awareness on prevention techniques within the home and in women–oriented workspaces such as markets. Women’s community organisations and women’s rights organisations are critical first responders and need to be funded as such. They’re also there for the long haul and will remain on the frontline long after outside help has moved on. They provide an opportunity for long-term strategic funding with measurable impacts in the shifting landscape of Ebola, and other crises in the future.

2015-04-07T14:06:50Z,global-development,Global development,Afghanistan: US watchdog criticises aid scheme for women's rights,"A high-profile US aid scheme in Afghanistan, hailed as the largest ever women’s empowerment programme, has come under criticism for lack of transparency and for failing to consult the women it is supposed to benefit. In another reproach of international aid efforts, an Amnesty International report released on Tuesday details how women’s rights defenders, despite achieving significant gains over the past decade, are being abandoned by the international community. The US aid scheme Promote, launched in October last year, aims to funnel $416m into programmes to strengthen women’s rights groups and boost women’s role in the economy and national decision-making. However, it is uncertain whether the 75,000 women expected to engage in the programme will actually receive any tangible benefit, says a US watchdog. In a recent inquiry letter, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (Sigar), which reports to the US Congress, raises concerns that USAid may not be able to “effectively implement, monitor, and assess the impact of Promote”. The watchdog quotes Afghanistan’s first lady, Rula Ghani, warning against falling “into a game of contracting and sub-contracting”, generating a lot of paper certificates without real skill behind them. Her husband, president Ashraf Ghani, has also previously criticised foreign aid delivery to Afghanistan, claiming that the majority of American aid returns to the US through contracting. Women’s activists have raised concerns similar to Sigar’s. “I emphasised again and again that the programmes should be designed based on the needs of the women of Afghanistan,” said Hasina Safi, executive director of the Afghan Women’s Network. Safi was appointed to an advisory committee for one of Promote’s three contractors, Tetra Tech, Inc, which is responsible for training 25,000 participants in “women leadership development”. She said Promote’s beneficiaries are selected too narrowly. “Promote was only designed for literate women, while in Afghanistan there is a big majority of non-educated young women,” Safi said. “They need to have more confidence in the women of Afghanistan, that they really can design a programme based on their needs.” USAid said the criticism is “unfounded”. According to a USAid official, civil society actors were consulted, “to ask about what the project needs to do”, including women’s leaders in and outside the capital, as well as the Ministry of Women’s Affairs. The official added that over 300 “implementers” had submitted 175 questions in a “robust discussion”, and that a procurement document had been made available online for comment in early 2013. “I can very confidently say that the outreach has been significant and taken a lot of time,” the official said, stressing that Promote does not replace USAid’s existing investments in rural education and healthcare. In its inquiry, Sigar also questions the amount of money Promote claims to oversee. At its inception, USAid committed $216m over a five-year period, while seeking another $200m from other donors. So far, no other donor has offered money, and USAid has awarded only $42m to one contractor. At a time of transition in Afghanistan, rights advocates worry that the attention of western countries on women’s issues will wane along with their military engagement. In the face of a worsening security situation and a stagnant economy, gender equality is a priority only for a small minority of the country’s power brokers.
Six months after his inauguration, President Ghani is struggling to keep electoral promises to include more women in the country’s higher echelons. His pledge to appoint the first woman to the supreme court seems to be floundering, and his goal of naming at least four female ministers has proved difficult. In late March, Ghani introduced a cabinet for parliamentary approval for the second time, after lawmakers rejected half of his nominees in January, including all three of his female choices. Amnesty International said that efforts to strengthen women’s rights have been “piecemeal and ad hoc, and much of the aid money is drying up”. In its report, the organisation echoed Sigar’s criticism of international aid, pointing to “hundreds of millions of dollars” spent on women’s rights since 2001, on projects that have “too often focused on short-term gains, and been implemented without consulting women’s activists themselves”. Amnesty also said that violence against women’s rights proponents such as lawyers, politicians, journalists and teachers is on the rise in Afghanistan. On 19 March, an Afghan woman, Farkhunda, was killed by a mob in central Kabul for speaking out against what she saw as un-Islamic practice by a mullah, who retorted by claiming she had burned the Qur’an, enraging the men around her. Though more than a dozen alleged perpetrators have been arrested, the incident has become emblematic for the impunity with which men in Afghanistan can abuse and attack women. Farkhunda’s public defiance of a male authority has turned her into an icon for women’s rights defenders. Amnesty said despite the existence of a hard-won legal framework to protect women, “laws are often badly enforced and remain mere paper promises”.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/07/afghanistan-us-watchdog-criticises-aid-womens-rights,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/07/afghanistan-us-watchdog-criticises-aid-womens-rights
2015-04-07T10:54:34Z,global-development,Global development,Medics in Yemen: ‘We are on lockdown inside the hospital’,"When I first arrived in Aden in late January we could leave the hospital where we live and work to go out into the city. That all changed drastically, almost overnight, when the fighting and bombings began just over two weeks ago. Since then we have been on lockdown inside the hospital. Our surgical project now regularly deals with influxes of war wounded people. Since the fighting started we’ve treated 580 patients. The worst day was 26 March, the day after the Saudi-led air strikes began, when 110 injured people came in for emergency care. One of the major roads to the hospital is now blocked, so there may be people out there who have been injured but cannot get through to us. We’d like to send more ambulances out into the city to pick people up, but at times it is too dangerous. Most of our patients are young men, but we’ve also treated women and children. Almost all of them have been injured by gunshots, snipers or shrapnel. I’ve seen men in their 20s come in with their legs blown off – I’ve never seen injuries like it before. We’ve also had children who have been badly injured while they were playing. We are a surgical project, but at times people have injuries to their heads or necks that are too serious for us to treat so we have to refer them elsewhere.
Our small team of six international staff work 24/7 with our team of 140 Yemeni staff – they are the lifeblood of the hospital. Although it can be dangerous for our local staff to come to work, so many do every day. Often it is too insecure for them to leave, so we try to take people back home in an ambulance or they stay overnight at the hospital. The atmosphere is tense and very stressful. We hear fighting outside the hospital and bombs falling a little further away. We take it in turns to sleep for a couple of hours at a time, though it is often on the floor in the corridor – a safe distance from the windows in our rooms. We desperately need more international staff to come and relieve us. Our surgeon, anaesthetist and head nurse are exhausted. A backup team are stuck in Djibouti. The airports have closed so the only way into Aden is by boat, but there are serious restrictions in place at the port. We also need more drugs and medical supplies. Unless we get supplies through in the coming days, we will run out. We don’t ask how our patients were wounded – our business is only to provide medical care. I do ask where in the city people were injured so that I can try to piece together where heavy fighting is taking place and where is unsafe for our drivers to go.
Some of those who come to us for treatment will doubtless be fighters, but they respect our rules to leave the conflict at the door and know that we treat people from both sides. Our neutrality and impartiality are the best protection we have, and enables us to keep the hospital open. Because we have been providing free surgical care here since 2011, people have a good understanding of what we are trying to do. For the moment the hospital is relatively safe and we have not been affected by the insecurity, but of course at times we worry that we are in danger. There are fighters everywhere and we don’t know who is controlling the area outside the hospital – it seems to change on an hourly basis. When a large influx of patients arrive there is no time to think – we have to be strong, focused, and keep a distance so that we can do our jobs. It is when we sit down to debrief and make a list of the cases that have come in that day that we can reflect a little more on what is happening. • Valerie Pierre is the project coordinator at Médecins Sans Frontières’ surgical project in Aden",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/07/medics-yemen-lockdown-hospital-aden-msf-fighting-air-strikes,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/07/medics-yemen-lockdown-hospital-aden-msf-fighting-air-strikes
2015-04-07T10:01:45Z,global-development,Global development,Ebola: media ‘overlooked Africa's role in combating crisis’,"Africa’s efforts to tackle the Ebola crisis have been largely overlooked even though Africans have taken the lead in providing frontline staff and shown themselves “better placed to fight infectious diseases in their continent than outsiders”, according to the African Union (AU). Dr Olawale Maiyegun, director of social affairs at the AU commission, said that despite the fact that Africans had proved both willing and able to deal with Ebola, the focus had been on the work of international agencies and those with the greatest media clout. “Unfortunately, Africans do not have the international voice of CNN, BBC and France 24, therefore much of our work is overlooked in the western media,” he said. “Most of the assistance provided by the international community is in the areas of finance and infrastructure. In the most critical human resources for health, Africans – including the affected countries – have had to take the lead.” His comments come six months after Nelson Mandela’s widow, Graça Machel, accused African leaders of failing to do enough to address the health crisis. “Ebola has exposed the extreme weaknesses of our institutions as governments; countries which are affected were found totally unprepared,” she told African business leaders in November last year. “It’s time Africa began to give real value to human life, in other words African human lives.” Others have criticised the AU for waiting 10 months before holding an emergency summit on the outbreak. However, Maiyegun argued that the AU and the Economic Community of West African States had reacted well to the crisis, with the AU deploying more than 835 African health workers to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea at the peak of the epidemic. “The success of African health workers – including the heroic health workers of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea – shows one thing: African health workers are better placed to fight infectious diseases in their continent than outsiders,” he said. Maiyegun said the AU’s response had been guided by the philosophy that it should not dictate how the the affected countries should run their fight against Ebola. “We put volunteers at the disposal of the governments of the affected countries,” he said. “They told us what to do and we have performed creditably.” He added: “The people of the affected countries must be given credit for doing a good job. With so many actors in the field, it’s important that it’s not just those with the loudest voices who are credited in the press for bringing Ebola under control.” Maiyegun said the recent report from the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières‎ (MSF) – which accused the governments of Guinea and Sierra Leone of obstructing the early response and contributing to the loss of life – had shown that everyone involved in managing the crisis needed to reflect on their actions.
“There is no doubt that MSF has played a very important role in the fight against the epidemic and they should be well acknowledged,” he said. “However, MSF also needs to have a comprehensive assessment of its involvement, particularly in its approach and its methods in the fight against Ebola.” In January and February, lab workers in two Guinean medical centres – one of them run by MSF – put blood samples in the wrong test tubes. The mix-ups led to the release of at least four patients who later tested positive for Ebola, two of whom went on to die. Rather than “pointing accusing fingers at others”, said Maiyegun, the charity should be conducting an internal review. MSF said it had taken the incident very seriously and worked with the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Guinean ministry of health to make sure the situation was contained and lessons learned. “We are relieved that no one else contracted Ebola as a result of coming into contact with a patient who wrongly tested negative and have taken steps to make sure such an incident does not happen again,” said a spokeswoman. She described the report as an “initial reflection on the past year”, adding: “With our teams still heavily involved in tackling the ongoing outbreak it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions; we do not yet have the necessary distance for a thorough critical review. More in-depth assessments – including of MSF’s own work – will certainly follow.” Maiyegun counselled against premature talk of an end to the Ebola crisis, describing the race to halt new infections as a “bumpy road”. He said the hundreds of potential new cases discovered following Sierra Leone’s three-day lockdown last weekend underlined the need for continued vigilance. Maiyegun declined to put a date on an end to the crisis – which has killed more than 10,300 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea – pointing out that unpredictability was one of the hallmarks of previous Ebola outbreaks in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. “One thing is certain,” he said. “We cannot completely declare one of the three affected countries free of Ebola if the outbreak persists in two other countries.” According to the latest figures from the WHO, 79 new confirmed cases of Ebola were reported in the week to 22 March – the lowest weekly total in 2015. Guinea reported 45 new cases and Sierra Leone 33. Liberia, which had seen no new cases for three consecutive weeks, confirmed a new one on 20 March.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/07/ebola-media-overlooked-africas-role-combating-crisis-african-union,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/07/ebola-media-overlooked-africas-role-combating-crisis-african-union
2015-04-07T06:00:05Z,global-development,Global development,Health sustainable development goal must tackle inequity head on to succeed,"Last month’s intergovernmental negotiations in New York put the spotlight back on the proposed sustainable development goals (SDGs) and how to measure their impact. It kicked off a series of high-level meetings in 2015 that will focus on the nitty-gritty of the goals and their respective milestones. The 17 goals (and 169 accompanying targets) represent the international community’s response to the post-2015 development question: how to harness, and build on, the momentum established by the expiring millennium development goals (MDGs). The SDG negotiations provide a crucial window to address some of the shortcomings of the MDGs, which had a relatively narrow focus and failed to address questions concerning equity and the inclusion of the poorest and most marginalised groups. It is disappointing and worrying, therefore, to see some of these issues cropping up in the SDG framework. Perhaps the most striking example is goal three: the health goal. Achieving universal healthcare has become a policy priority for many countries. Defined as “access to good quality health services for all who need them without any associated financial hardship”, in its purest form universal healthcare encompasses the three crucial pillars of any national health agenda: financial risk protection, quality service provision and 100% population coverage. Despite widespread lobbying from international agencies and NGOs, it became obvious at the beginning of 2014 that universal healthcare was likely to be relegated within the SDG framework discussions. It is currently an individual target within the much vaguer goal of “ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing at all ages”. While this sends a pretty stark message about the perceived importance of universal healthcare, it becomes even more alarming when we begin to unpack some of the minutiae around the target.
The meetings in March reinforced an uncomfortable, previously overlooked, element: the proposed indicators for the universal healthcare target – both of which focus on measuring levels of financial protection – are currently rated as BBB or below. These ratings capture the feasibility, suitability and relevance of each indicator as perceived by the international community. Put another way, the majority of countries involved in the SDG consultations think that measuring progress towards universal healthcare is feasible only with significant effort and that, at best, the suggested indicators are merely “somewhat relevant” to the overall target. While the proposed targets are unlikely to change, the indicators are still open to negotiation. Experts from national statistical offices will come together in May to start a series of in-depth discussions around the provisional indicators. Final agreement is not expected until March next year. Given the general lacklustre ratings for the universal healthcare target indicators, it is likely these will be near the top of the list for discussion. One of two outcomes seems probable: either the indicators for the target will be removed altogether, or they will be replaced with measures deemed easier to calculate than financial protection. Both options would be catastrophic. As the Center for Global Development’s Charles Kenny notes, governments will only be motivated to meet targets if they can be measured. Stripping out indicators altogether would effectively render the target redundant; universal health coverage would be “nice to have” rather than a standard against which to hold governments to account. On the other hand, measuring universal healthcare by access to services alone is severely missing the point. This might sound counterintuitive, but universal healthcare is about much more than just drugs and resources. It is about ensuring everyone is on an equal footing when it comes to receiving essential healthcare services whenever, and wherever, they need them. Some say that protecting against financial hardship is just too difficult. We know this is not true, however. There are ways to ensure that everyone can access adequate health care services without being out of pocket, as highlighted in the World Health Organisation’s seminal report. Oxford Policy Management is working with the governments of Morocco and Ethiopia to develop finance strategies that support the move towards universal healthcare in each country, with remarkable results. There is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to universal healthcare. Health finance reforms must be country-specific and based on in-depth analysis. But it is clear that universal healthcare can only be achieved when financial protection is fully accounted for, at all levels and across all sections of the population. Without adequate financial protection, only the wealthiest would be able to afford good quality healthcare, widening the gap between the richest and the poorest and thus accentuating, rather than tackling, one of the root causes of poverty. Clarity of vision will therefore be crucial during the next rounds of negotiations. It is easy to get bogged down in the detail when discussing indicators, but it is essential that we do not lose sight of the proposed targets and why they were included in the first place. What may seem like minor tweaks to make something more palatable to overburdened policymakers could actually have lasting implications, creating winners and losers on the global stage – we need to learn from the MDGs, scale up our ambitions and face inequity head-on.

2015-04-04T08:26:57Z,global-development,Global development,Migrants building UAE cultural hub 'working in prison conditions',"Trade unions and artists have condemned the conditions faced by migrant workers building a £17bn cultural hub in the United Arab Emirates, including new branches of the Louvre and the Guggenheim museums, as akin to an open prison. The International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) and Gulf Labor, a coalition of international artists, said the several thousand workers in the official labour camp on Saadiyat Island in Abu Dhabi were subject to segregation, a 10pm curfew and monitoring by security guards, and could only enter or leave on authorised buses. The researchers found that thousands more Saadiyat workers living in camps elsewhere in the UAE, which they also visited in March, endured similar restrictions. Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the ITUC, said: “People are treated like battery hens. They’re locked in. There are guards. They leave at 5.30-6am, they go home at 6-7pm in the evening, or later if they are forced to work overtime, often unpaid.” Two of the Gulf Labor activists, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals by the UAE authorities, said the Saadiyat Accommodation Village (SAV) was inaccessible by foot and workers could only travel the 2km between the camp’s entrance and perimeter checkpoint by hourly shuttle buses. The camp shuts down at 10pm and any workers who miss the curfew are locked out overnight. Workers are only permitted to access their designated accommodation block. Gulf Labor will present their findings at the Venice Biennale, the world’s most prestigious contemporary art event, in July, where the group is staging a series of talks highlighting the plight of the Saadiyat workers. Although the UAE authorities have said working conditions are improving on Saadiyat, Gulf Labour said they found forced labour persisted. Many workers said they had to pay illegal recruitment fees to secure their jobs and also reported being forced to work overtime without additional pay. One of the activists said: “I can’t imagine a situation being worse than what we saw in terms of the lack of respect for human dignity.” The activists saw squalid conditions in other camps in Abu Dhabi and Dubai including bathrooms shared by 20 men without proper sanitation, sewage outside the main entrance, and makeshift food markets that looked like refuse dumps. They said workers were in serious debt as a result of paying illegal recruitment fees to gain work on the island. One worker from Nepal said he would need to work for two years before he paid off his recruitment fee. Meanwhile the ITUC has begun a social media campaign targeting the Guggenheim and one of its major sponsors, Dior, in a bid to push the museum to address labour conditions on Saadiyat, where the construction of its largest branch is expected to begin this year. The first phase of the ITUC campaign highlights the disparity between the wealthy art patrons who paid up to$75,000 for a table at the Guggenheim’s international gala fundraising dinner in New York last November, sponsored by Dior, and the squalid and impoverished conditions of Saadiyat workers. Burrow, who met Guggenheim director Richard Armstrong on Saadiyat earlier this month, said the campaign would also target the museum’s other sponsors, such as Hugo Boss, Tiffany & Co, Samsung and Phillips. It will also target western institutions and companies involved in Saadiyat, where a branch of New York University has been built and a new Louvre museum is due to open next year. The Guggenheim declined to comment. The Louvre and the Tourism Investment and Development Company (TDIC), which overseas the development of Saadiyat, did not respond to requests for comment. The UN International Labour Organisation has launched an investigation into the abuse of migrant workers in the UAE, partly prompted by concerns about conditions on Saadiyat, which is due to be published by the end of the year. The most recent audit of Saadiyat Island by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which was appointed by TDIC to monitor workers’ welfare, found that the company had not consistently enforced its employment practices policy, which is supposed to ensure the fair treatment of labourers. According to the audit, TDIC imposed financial penalties against only three of the six contractors who were found to be in breach of the policy last year. However, the audit noted that TDIC has pledged to introduce a fairer employment code this year and has already made some improvements to facilities at the SAV, including door-to-door laundry services and new kitchens. • This article was amended on 8 April 2015 to clarify that the Guggenheim sponsors Hugo Boss, Tiffany & Co, Samsung and Phillips are not directly involved in the Saadiyat project.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/04/migrant-workers-uae-saadiyat-island-abu-dhabi-battery-hens,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/04/migrant-workers-uae-saadiyat-island-abu-dhabi-battery-hens
2015-04-03T06:00:09Z,global-development,Global development,Blue economy: why women must ride the wave of Africa’s maritime sector | Jane Dudman,"The African continent has a two-pronged weapon in its race to industrialise and make use of its natural resources, according to Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, chairwoman of the 54-member African Union (AU): women and oceans. In March, while the former South African home affairs minister was attending a conference in Ethiopia on getting more women into parliament, the AU was hosting the first event specifically for women in Africa’s maritime sector in the Angolan capital, Luanda. The agenda covered how women can best make inroads into areas including shipping and maritime transport, fishing, offshore mining and other aspects of the “blue economy”. For Dlamini-Zuma, the two themes are intertwined. She believes that developing African sea power presents an unrivalled opportunity for women. Not only, she says, is the blue economy a vital part of Africa’s 50-year industrialisation plan, Agenda 2063, but it also provides a great chance to achieve the continent’s post-2015 development goals on women’s involvement in employment and leadership. “The majority of our countries are coastal, or islands, so the oceanic space is bigger than our land mass,” says Dlamini-Zuma, adding that women have a key role to play in addressing the longstanding neglect of Africa’s oceans. “Now we’re trying to get everybody to focus on this and we are also saying to women that this is an underdeveloped area. Don’t let the men develop it. Don’t come in at the end. You must be part of that development.” The Luanda conference, originallyscheduled for last year but postponed because of the Ebola outbreak, included female maritime professionals from public and private sectors, and highlighted the growing number of young female entrepreneurs in the blue economy. “Women have come together and … those who work in the industry … want to see how they can be entrepreneurs in the industry,” says Dlamini-Zuma. One of those entrepreneurs is Ipeleng Selele, founder and chief executive of the South African Khumo Group. The main Khumo business is marketing and branding, but Selele is a keen entrepreneur in the shipping industry who is now investing in her first vessel.
Selele says it’s encouraging to see other young African women taking an active economic role in the maritime sector, from shipping, maintenance and port services to financing. “I want to become an African maritime champion,” she says. Selele is working with the AU, maritime authorities, operators and ports to identify opportunities to develop a sustainable, integrated maritime sector, which will create jobs – both directly and indirectly – in areas such as logistics and transport. It’s still early days for African female shipowners, but Selele is excited by the possibilities. Dlamini-Zuma says the only way to achieve economic growth is by building an infrastructure across the continent that links its capitals and centres. China is taking a leading role in this process. In January, the country signed a memorandum of understanding with the AU to invest in a high-speed rail project to link all 54 members of the union. Dlamini-Zuma won’t reveal how much China is investing, but says it will be important to also encourage homegrown investment. “We want to find a way where any African who wants to put something into that project will be able to do so,” she says. “We want to do it in a more creative way. We don’t know if that will work, but we are looking at it.” Dlamini-Zuma outlined her plans for the African blue economy as part of her speech at last week’s Women in Parliaments conference at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa, at which more than 400 mostly female parliamentarians gathered to discuss how to get more women into political power. Over the past 20 years, the number of female parliamentarians has risen, although worldwide only one in five is female. The AU chairwoman says issues that are critical to women must be at the centre of the post-2015 development agenda, including giving women access to education, training, technology and finance. “We know this will happen faster and be more sustainable through the empowerment of women and girls,” she says. “That is why it is so important to ensure that in all our countries we reach this critical mass of women in parliaments and governments.” She has little patience for those who dislike the use of quotas or affirmative action, both of which have been used in South Africa. The country, where 42% of parliamentarians are female, is ninth in the list of the top 10 countries with the highest number of female parliamentarians. “I’m very happy to say that the ruling party [in South Africa] introduced quotas and whether I would have made it or not without quota, I’m here,” she says. “Quotas have brought many more women and that’s very important. If you’re alone or there are just a few of you, you can’t bring about change. You need a critical number of women and we have to ensure we do everything we can to get more women.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/03/blue-economy-women-africa-maritime-sector-nkosazana-dlamini-zuma,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/03/blue-economy-women-africa-maritime-sector-nkosazana-dlamini-zuma
2015-04-02T14:58:17Z,global-development,Global development,Domestic workers: 47 million people worldwide denied basic labour rights,"An estimated 53 million people – the vast majority of them women – are employed as domestic workers around the world. These workers are an increasingly powerful economic force: worldwide, they account for nearly 4% of all wage employment and 7.5% of female employees. Yet, though critical to the functioning of national economies, 90% of domestic workers – around 47 million – do not have the same basic labour rights as workers in other sectors. A quarter of all domestic workers are not afforded any legal rights at all. They are effectively invisible, isolated behind the closed doors of private households. Global ILO data shows that more than 21.5 million domestic workers do not benefit from minimum wage regulations covering other types of work, and have no protection against being paid whatever their employer decides. A further 3 million are entitled to a minimum wage, but one that is less than that set for other workforces. The overwhelming majority of domestic workers in Asia and the Middle East are entirely ignored by minimum wage laws.
More than half of all domestic workers – about 30 million people – are also excluded from laws setting out normal working hours and almost half (44.8%) are not entitled to rest periods in the form of days off or holidays. When it comes to maternity rights, domestic workers are also significantly discriminated against, with more than one-third of female domestic workers left with no rights to maternity leave and almost 40% with no entitlement to maternity pay. In countries throughout the world, human rights campaigners have documented accounts of domestic workers being abused, beaten, forced to work up to 22 hours a day, and not being given food or paid for their work. When domestic workers are so systematically denied the basic labour rights afforded to other workers, employers cannot be held accountable for the mistreatment of those working in their households. Workers themselves also have no way of protecting themselves from exploitation. When national laws ignore the rights of millions of employed people, the message that these are not “real” workers filters down, adding to the vulnerability and abuse experienced by domestic workers. Unless this changes, there is no way truly to hold those responsible to account.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/02/domestic-workers-47-million-people-worldwide-denied-basic-labour-rights,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/02/domestic-workers-47-million-people-worldwide-denied-basic-labour-rights
2015-04-02T13:23:00Z,global-development,Global development,Women from Sierra Leone 'sold like slaves' into domestic work in Kuwait | Pete Pattisson,"In the basement of an old tower block near Kuwait City, recruitment agents brandish files full of healthy, work-ready domestic workers. “Choose the one you want,” says one agent with a smile. “I will give you a hundred days’ guarantee. If you don’t like her you can send her back.” In Kuwait the domestic workers business is booming, with nearly 90% of Kuwaiti households employing at least one foreign maid. Yet while dozens of recruitment agencies are pulling out the stops to attract potential employers – including parading women in front of potential employers who can take them home on the spot – they are also being accused of selling women and duping them into a life of domestic servitude. Women from Sierra Leone formerly employed as domestic workers in private Kuwaiti households said they had been “sold like slaves” by recruitment agents to families in the Kuwaiti capital and then resold multiple times. Each said that they had paid about £1,000 ($1,480) to recruitment agents in Sierra Leone on the promise of jobs as nurses in hospitals or in the hotel industry, only to find on arrival that they were to be offered to families as housemaids and expected to work for up to 22 hours a day. “[The agents] took us to their offices and people would come to look at us,” said one woman who worked as a nurse in Sierra Leone. “If they said, ‘I want this person’, they took you to their house.” Adama, 24, said that after being selected by a Kuwaiti family she was taken to their house and treated “like a slave”. “You have to work 24 hours [with] no day off. You can never leave the house … You are not allowed to use mobile phones. These people are not good.” She raises her skirt to reveal a deeply scarred leg. Adama claims her employer paid her nothing for her work and deliberately spilled hot oil on her while she was cooking. “I was crying, [but] she did not even look at me. I said, ‘Madam, why you do this to me?’ She told me that I’m a slave … I’m too slow, I’m not fast enough.”
Employers are given a 100-day guarantee by agents, which allows them to return domestic workers they are not happy with and get a refund. As well as keeping employers happy, this also creates a booming “second-hand” market where returned domestic workers can be resold to other families for up to two years. Thousands of women travel to Kuwait every year to work. Workers come from across Asia but also, increasingly, from Africa, with women being recruited by agents in countries such as Sierra Leone, Cameroon, Kenya and Ethiopia. Once employed as domestic workers in Kuwait, women find it difficult to leave if they suffer abuse. Under Kuwait’s kafala sponsorship system, domestic workers are not allowed to leave or change jobs without their employer’s permission. With their residency status also tied to their employer, if they run away they become “illegal”. Last year, stories of abuse suffered by Sierra Leonean women in Kuwait prompted the country’s authorities to follow other governments, including those of Indonesia and Nepal, in banning its citizens from being employed as domestic workers in the country. Yet they continue to come through informal channels. Despite the official ban, when staff from the Sierra Leonean embassy visited recruitment agents recently they found about 100 women from Sierra Leone on their books. Saidu Bangura, the cultural attache at the Sierra Leone embassy in Kuwait, believes the real figure is “far above that”. “It’s a total deception,” said Bangura. “Recruitment agents in Kuwait contact agents in Sierra Leone through the internet and ask them to recruit workers. I want to appeal to these women not to believe anyone who wants them to come to Kuwait. It’s only going to bring punishment and distress.” Once in Kuwait, women often completely disappear from view. Isolated in private households and excluded from Kuwait’s labour rights legislation, they are extremely vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.
Human Rights Watch says that the embassies of labour-sending countries in Kuwait received more than 10,000 complaints from domestic workers in 2009. The grievances included “nonpayment of wages; withholding of passports; excessively long working hours without rest; and physical, sexual, and psychological abuse”. “The sense of having ‘paid for’ or having ‘bought’ a worker makes some employers feel entitled to treat the worker however they wish,” concludes a 2010 Human Rights report into the abuse of domestic workers in Kuwaiti households. Kuwait has the highest ratio of domestic workers to citizens in the Middle East, with one domestic worker for every two Kuwaiti citizens, according to the same report. Figures from Kuwait’s population census state there were 246,000 men and women in domestic service in 2005, accounting for 21.9% of total employment in the country, but some estimates put the latest figure at approximately 660,000. Once in their place of work, many remain hidden behind the closed doors of the vast tan-coloured mansions in the city’s wealthy residential areas. One long-term resident, who didn’t want to be named, said that workers are effectively abandoned once placed with employers. “The recruitment agents never check on their domestic workers; whether they get food, are able to talk to their family or get a day off,” he said. “They have already got their money, so they never check.” Rima Kalush, co-director of migrant-rights.org, says that although agents are legally responsible for a domestic worker for the first three months of their contract, in reality – unless an employer has a problem with their worker – checks are rarely made. “The concept of monitoring domestic work is contested by many governments worldwide, who claim such check-ups would comprise the privacy of the home,” she says. “There are many cases of women disappearing – we’ve received reports from several family members. Sometimes workers are later found, but many cases remain unresolved.”
Some of the domestic workers interviewed by the Guardian allege that they have also been mistreated by the agents who are supposed to represent their interests. Adama claims that, after her employer returned her to her agent, she was locked inside a house for three days with no food while her agent tried to find another buyer. She escaped and sought refuge at the Sierra Leonean embassy, before she was moved to a Kuwaiti shelter for runaway maids, where she joined an estimated 300 former domestic workers awaiting deportation to their home countries. Many of those stuck there has been sent by their embassies, who considered it the best way to help them return. At the shelter, women find themselves in another type of prison. Under Kuwaiti law, employers are obliged to report any worker who has “absconded” from a private home. Their residency permit is then cancelled and orders are issued to detain and deport them. While the facility is immaculate, with a large outdoor area and spotless corridors, those sheltering here are not allowed to go outside or use mobile phones. They can contact their families, but only on the shelter’s phone, and only at weekends. Women can be trapped here for months, if not years. Despite promises of reform, the Kuwaiti government has not yet passed a law to protect domestic workers, who are not given the basic labour rights provided to other workers under national law. “There has been a draft law for domestic workers for a long time, but it has not been passed by parliament,” said Abdul Alghanim, head of the migrant workers office at the Kuwait Trade Union Federation. “In my opinion the government and parliament are not interested in taking serious steps for that.” Until then, women like Alima, another Sierra Leonean in the government shelter, will continue to suffer in Kuwait. A few weeks after arriving in the country, Alima discovered she was pregnant, but her agent refused to send her home unless her family sent money for the flight, which they could not afford to do. And so Alima gave birth to her son Richie alone in a Kuwaiti hospital. “I just want to go home,” she sobbed, clutching her three-week-old boy. “I have suffered too much here.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/02/women-sierra-leone-sold-like-slaves-domestic-work-kuwait,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/02/women-sierra-leone-sold-like-slaves-domestic-work-kuwait
2015-04-02T11:46:30Z,global-development,Global development,IFC funding decried as 'shrouded in darkness and riddled with abuse',"The World Bank must “completely overhaul” a funding model built on heavy investment in financial companies that leaves the organisation with little control over where its money ends up, a group of NGOs has warned. The bank’s private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), invested $36bn (£24.5bn) in financial companies including hedge funds, private equity firms and commercial banks between 2009 and 2013, according to a report released on Thursday. The study, prepared by NGOs including Oxfam, Global Witness and the Bretton Woods Project, said these funds would be better used to pursue development targets in areas such as education and public health. The report noted that, between 2009 and 2013, the IFC lent three times more to financial intermediaries than education programmes in the developing world. Over the past decade, there has been a threefold rise in the percentage of World Bank Group funding that goes to the IFC (pdf). In 2000, just 13% of the group’s total spending was allocated to the IFC, but by 2013 that figure had soared to 35%, a trend that the report describes as “out of control”. “The IFC has grown so rapidly and [become] so big that it now forms half of the World Bank Group,” said Kate Geary, Oxfam’s land rights policy researcher. “The IFC is giving its money to a third party, and then the third party lends that on again,” she explained, noting that 62% of the IFC’s total portfolio is invested in financial companies. “Through that process the IFC is losing control of the way that money is spent.” Several projects funded by the IFC have come under fire for their alleged implication in human rights abuses, the report said, noting that: “Instead of development benefits, local communities have endured displacement, loss of livelihoods, fear, violence, criminalisation and repression.” An IFC spokeswoman said: “The IFC’s work through financial intermediaries provides much-needed access to finance for millions of individuals and micro, small, and medium enterprises that we would never be able to reach directly. Our work with private equity funds brings both capital and expertise to fast-growing companies, and mobilises money for renewable energy, infrastructure and other projects in some of the world’s poorest countries.” NGOs have urged the IFC to make its contracts with private lenders public and to allow third-party vetting of projects. Natalie Bugalski, legal director of Inclusive Development International and a co-author of the report, said: “IFC’s lending to third parties is now so huge, its portfolio so shrouded in darkness and riddled with abuse, that it needs to completely overhaul this lending model.” The opaque nature of the IFC’s lending has been compounded by a lack of communication, added Nicolas Mombrial, head of Oxfam’s Washington DC office. “Because public information from the IFC is so meagre – whether by design or ignorance – we fear such projects are just the tip of the iceberg,” he said. Citing projects funded by the IFC in Central America and Asia, the study described alleged rights abuses carried out by private firms using World Bank funds. In 2009, the IFC invested $70m in a Honduran bank, Banco Ficohsa, which in turn loaned $15m to a local agribusiness company, Corporación Dinant. The latter has been accused of carrying out violence against farmers on oil palm plantations in the fertile Bajo Aguán valley in north Honduras. “Local people reported house raids, warrantless arrests, sexual violence, theft, intimidation, destruction of property, and other forms of abuse of authority,” the report said. Responding to the allegations in a letter published in the Guardian last year, Dinant denied any role in human rights violations. The World Bank’s independent monitoring group, known as the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO), said in a 2014 report that the “IFC took insufficient measures to identify activities where Ficohsa was exposed to environmental and social risk”. The IFC loaned more than $25m to a Vietnamese investment group that forced about 15,000 Cambodians from their land to make way for rubber, sugar cane and palm oil plantations, according to the NGO report. The NGO study said the bank has taken positive steps to improve how it monitors lending to financial intermediaries, including “streamlining its risk assessment, forming a new committee to assess high risk projects, and pledging to give more environmental and social risks the same weight as financial or credit risks”. In March, the World Bank president Jim Yong Kim admitted shortcomings in the bank’s policy towards preventing and monitoring forced resettlement in the projects that it funds. “We must and will do better,” he said. On Thursday, the IFC will defend its environmental and social risk policies at a board meeting ahead of the World Bank’s annual Spring meeting on 17 April. Other NGOs involved in the production of the report include Madre Selva, Nisgua, the Research Collective – PSA, the Bank Information Centre, Urgewald and Equitable Cambodia. • This article was amended on 9 April 2015 to clarify the source of claims relating to Banco Ficohsa and the International Finance Corporation.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/02/world-bank-funding-darkness-abuse-ngo-report,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/02/world-bank-funding-darkness-abuse-ngo-report

2015-04-01T11:27:30Z,global-development,Global development,Kenya court urges change to law that penalises women who pass HIV to baby,"Human rights groups have welcomed moves to change Kenya’s 2006 HIV and Aids Prevention Act which at present effectively criminalises pregnant women who pass HIV to their babies. The law says that a person knowing they are HIV positive must tell “any sexual contact” of their status in advance and could be jailed for seven years if they “knowingly and recklessly” placed another person at risk of being infected. Kenya’s high court ruled this section of the law unconstitutional on 18 March as “it could be interpreted to apply to women who expose or transmit HIV to a child during pregnancy, delivery or breastfeeding”. The law was introduced to curb the spread of HIV and Aids in Kenya, which has the fourth largest HIV-positive population in the world – 1.6 million people. Rights groups argue that it discriminates against women, who are often the first members of a family to find out their HIV status as they are usually tested when pregnant. “This law has inflicted fear, shame and punishment on countless Kenyans, especially pregnant women,” Evelyne Opondo, Africa director of the New-York based Center for Reproductive Rights (CRR), said in a statement on 30 March.
“Now is the time for the Kenya government to immediately amend this legislation and ensure people living with HIV can get the care they need without fear of discrimination or criminalisation.” CRR submitted an amicus brief in a case brought against the government by the Aids Law Project, a charity providing legal services and counselling to people living with HIV. The charity argued that the law discourages people from finding out their status and could even prevent those with HIV giving first aid or playing sports for fear of being prosecuted. The law also puts women at risk of violence or rejection by their husbands because it allows doctors to disclose the status of patients to their next of kin, it said. “If we want to reduce the spread of HIV and Aids and put an end to the stigma, violence and discrimination surrounding the disease, our public policies must be based on medical evidence and grounded in human rights,” Jacinta Nyachae, executive director of the Aids Law Project, said in the statement. The high court advised the government to review the law to avoid further litigation.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/01/kenya-court-urges-change-law-penalises-women-pass-hiv-baby,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/01/kenya-court-urges-change-law-penalises-women-pass-hiv-baby
2015-04-01T06:00:08Z,global-development,Global development,"In Thailand’s Muslim south, authorities turn a blind eye to FGM","Eight-week-old baby Amiyah grimaces when sunlight falls on her face as though she isn’t used to the idea of having been born yet. On a Saturday afternoon, in Thailand’s southern Pattani province, her Muslim mother has brought her to a small clinic so midwife Dah can slice her clitoris for sunat.The practice, a form of female genital mutilation (FGM), has been banned by the World Health Organisation. In majority Buddhist Thailand, the public health department says FGM does not happen. But in the three southernmost provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani, ethnic Malay Muslims are a majority. Some are locked in an intractable conflict with the Thai government, which labels them insurgents. Here, midwife Dah says she has cut almost all female births she has attended.
“Her clitoris is so small,” says Dah, 64, who seems a little flustered as she swabs the crying baby’s vulva with alcohol with her gloved hands. Despite her experience, she is having difficulty finding the clitoris as the baby squirms on the operating table. She holds a sterile surgical blade, for which she has fashioned a handle out of tin foil. After five long minutes, during which the baby cries relentlessly and the mother tries to comfort her, the incision is finally made. The midwife mops up a drop of blood with a cotton swab, recites the name of God, and declares the baby “circumcised”. “I feel relieved that I have done my duty,” the mother says. The conflict in the southern Thailand can make it hard for women to access healthcare, according to Dr Sudarat Teeraworn, a public health supervisor for maternal health in neighbouring Yala province. Sudarat says FGM isn’t on the health ministry’s agenda – though according to her, almost every Muslim baby girl in the south is cut. “There are no laws about it because there are not many health consequences, and it’s a cultural practice,” she says. Thai health authorities have taken a pragmatic approach, apparently turning a blind eye. FGM as practised in Thailand falls under type IV in the WHO’s classification, which involves pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterisation. Types I and II involve excision of either clitoris or labia or both, and type III includes a procedure where the vulva is sutured together after removal of the clitoris and labia. The WHO says the procedure has no known health benefits, arises from a deep-seated gender-bias, and amounts to a violation of both children’s and women’s rights. Just across the border in Malaysia, a study conducted in 2011 showed 93% of Muslim women have been cut, including in Kelantan state on Thailand’s border, which is culturally and religiously similar to Pattani. Though the practice dates back centuries for Muslims living across the Malay peninsula, Malaysia’s highest religious authority did not issue a fatwa until 2009 requiring the cutting of all Muslim women. Malaysia’s fatwa has put health workers in an awkward position. As women increasingly give birth in hospitals, mothers looking for a safe way to cut their female babies are essentially asking doctors to break WHO guidelines. To reduce the prevalence of FGM in Malaysia , Saira Shameem, who works for the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) in Kuala Lumpur, is working with health authorities to make the practice symbolic, with a routine alcohol swab performed by obstetricians at birth. “What the fatwa does not do, is it does not specify what the procedure should be,” she says, “that allows us an avenue to define the procedure in a non-invasive, non-harmful manner and shift the practice accordingly.”
In southern Thailand women are also increasingly giving birth in hospitals. Traditional midwives who pass their trade on from generation to generation are disappearing, and mothers are increasingly having their babies cut by doctors. Many women in southern Thailand don’t even know they’ve been cut until adulthood, when they read about it. The practice is not talked about. Dr Patimoh Umasa is one of the only female doctors in Yala, where she runs a small clinic on the edge of the city’s Muslim quarter. She knows the WHO guidelines, and doesn’t believe what she does directly contravenes them. “If it is done by a doctor and they are using the right technique, then never mind,” she says. “It’s just a little. Just an incision, no excision.” But doctors such as Nawal Nour, director of the Global Women’s Health Centre at Harvard Medical School, believes a “right technique” does not exist. “There are girls who suffer short and long-term consequences, even from type IV,” she says. “The clitoris on a baby girl is tiny, and in error, cutters can remove it completely. Also botched jobs can lead to haemorrhage, infection, sepsis and death.” Back in Pattani, Peung, 33, has gathered her family together to watch her eight-month-old daughter, Mia, being cut by her mother-in-law, who is sterilising a pair of nail scissors with alcohol. Some of Mia’s cousins are playing on the floor in the living room. Peung’s two older daughters are curious. “What are they doing? Will it hurt?” they ask. “Sunat, we all must do it,” Peung responds. “The children are so eager, but it is not good for them to watch this. It will become a phobia for ever.” She caresses her youngest infant, about to be cut. “At least she doesn’t know what’s going on here.” The baby’s grandmother draws blood from the clitoris with the curved tip of the nail scissors, a technique she says she developed herself to be safer. Mia cries loudly. Peung is pleased her daughter is now “complete”, but she isn’t sure why. “I don’t know what the benefit is behind it, but I believe there must be one. I know the prophet said it is desirable for the husband when women are cut. Actually in Islam we believe that women have more desire than men, so there must be something to control the women, give them humility and modesty – and this could be one way to do it. Maybe in the future the scientists will find out and then we will know the benefit. All the girls here in the south do it.” Some names have been changed",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/01/thailand-muslim-south-authorities-blind-eye-fgm-who,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/apr/01/thailand-muslim-south-authorities-blind-eye-fgm-who
2015-03-31T16:39:02Z,global-development,Global development,Donors pledge $4bn in humanitarian aid for Syrians | Sam Jones,"The international community has pledged $3.8bn to tackle the humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Syria – less than half the amount the UN says is needed this year to help the millions of people affected by the ongoing conflict. At the start of the Third International Pledging Conference for Syria – which was held in Kuwait on Tuesday – the UN asked for $8.4bn: $2.9bn for people inside Syria and $5.5bn to help those who have fled to Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt. The largest sums came from the EU, which pledged $1.2bn, the US ($507m) and Kuwait ($500m). Ahead of this year’s gathering, the German government said it would pledge $277m in new aid. Kuwaiti state media said local charities and aid organisations pledged another $506m just before the conference started.
Gulf envoys addressing the conference said the United Arab Emirates pledged $100m, Saudi Arabia $60m, and Norway $93m. The UK has promised $150m. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, described the Syrian situation as the “worst humanitarian crisis of our time” but said the sums promised represented “very generous pledges”. According to UN estimates, the war has killed more than 220,000 people and displaced 11 million. Nearly 4 million Syrians have fled to five neighbouring countries, where their presence is straining resources and host communities. The UN high commissioner for refugees, António Guterres, said the situation for the Syrian people was “unsustainable”. He added that the current UN appeal differed from previous ones because it recognised both the immediate and the longer-term imperatives of responding to the crisis. Oxfam said that although some donors had been generous in Kuwait, the total pledge was still less than half the amount needed. “Unless more donor countries massively step up in the wake of the conference, the increasing numbers of people fleeing their homes and struggling to survive will be less and less likely to receive assistance,” said a spokesman. “What does the international community expect millions of Syrians to survive on?” On Monday, the charity had criticised the international response to the Syrian crisis, saying money pledged was woefully inadequate. At last year’s donors’ conference, about $2.4bn was pledged through the UN – well below the $6.5bn requested. In 2013, $1.5bn was pledged, less than half of the UN’s appeal for $4.4bn. The UN humanitarian office’s Financial Tracking Service said in November that nearly a quarter of last year’s pledges, $585m, remained unfulfilled.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/31/donors-pledge-4bn-humanitarian-aid-syrians-kuwait-un,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/31/donors-pledge-4bn-humanitarian-aid-syrians-kuwait-un

Their respective pledges – for $1.2bn, $507m and $500m – were made at the opening of the third international donors’ conference for Syria, which is being hosted by Kuwait. In his address to delegates, Kuwait’s emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, described the Syrian conflict as “the biggest humanitarian crisis in recent history”. According to UN estimates, the war has killed more than 220,000 people and displaced 11 million. Nearly 4 million Syrians have fled to neighbouring countries such as Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt, where their presence is straining resources and host communities.
“The Syrian people’s plight has spilled over to hosting countries, exhausting their resources, and it is our role to support the host countries,” Sabah said. The UN says $2.9bn is needed in 2015 for people inside Syria, and $5.5bn for those who have fled to the five surrounding countries. Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, told the conference the crisis was not going to end soon. “There will be at least five more years of intense humanitarian activity even if – in the best of cases – progress on a negotiated political settlement were immediate and substantive today,” he said. Maurer, who described the war as “brutal and unrelenting”, called for a change of direction and greater respect for international humanitarian law. “We need more room for a neutral, impartial and independent humanitarian action,” he said. “We need protection for the vulnerable and for medical services. Humanitarian workers must be able to carry out their work in safety. I ask all those with influence on the parties to the conflict to ensure respect for these vital rules.” The UN high commissioner for refugees, António Guterres, said the situation for the Syrian people was “unsustainable”. He added that the current UN appeal differed from previous ones because it recognised both the immediate and the longer-term imperatives of responding to the crisis. Ahead of this year’s gathering, the German government said it would pledge $277m in new aid. Kuwaiti state media said local charities and aid organisations pledged another $506m just before the conference started. Gulf envoys addressing the conference said the United Arab Emirates pledged $100m, Saudi Arabia $60m, and Norway $93m. At last year’s donors’ conference, about $2.4bn was pledged through the UN – well below the $6.5bn requested. In 2013, $1.5bn was pledged, less than half of the UN’s appeal for $4.4bn. The UN humanitarian office’s Financial Tracking Service said in November that nearly a quarter of last year’s pledges, $585m, remained unfulfilled. Some 78 countries and 40 international aid organisations are present at this year’s conference. Kuwait, consistently one of the largest donors at the conference, pledged $500m last year and $300m the year before that.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/31/us-eu-kuwait-pledge-more-than-2bn-aid-syrians-un,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/31/us-eu-kuwait-pledge-more-than-2bn-aid-syrians-un
2015-03-31T10:44:16Z,global-development,Global development,UN official decries toxic backdrop as EU debates new migration policies | Clár Ní Chonghaile,"Describing migration as “one of the great issues of our time,” UN special representative Peter Sutherland warns that negative portrayals of migrants, often by politicians fearful of antagonising voters, are coalescing with rising nationalism and anti-Europeanism to create a toxic backdrop that has favoured the growth of anti-immigrant political forces. The European Commission is to produce new policy blueprints on migration by May amid a growing realisation that radical action is needed to tackle the humanitarian tragedy that sees thousands of migrants drown each year in the Mediterranean. Sutherland has been working to get migration into the sustainable development goals (SDGs) that are being drafted now to guide development priorities until 2030. He said there might be some opposition, but he expected the issue to be referred to in a significant way. “For a long time in the development community, there was a mental reaction that if we accept migration as being part of the development conundrum, we are conceding defeat ... It’s complete rubbish. [Migrants] make an enormous contribution ... Remittances are far bigger than export growth and foreign direct investment. It’s huge but everyone ignores it.” The European policy review was triggered after more than 300 people drowned off the Italian island of Lampedusa in October 2013. Sutherland, who was appointed the UN secretary general’s special representative on migration in 2006, said politicians were too scared to discuss migration in an honest, constructive way.
“In some political environments, it’s considered politically negative to mention the word ‘migration’ – so it’s hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil ...The result is that nobody explains, for example, that the total number of migrants is far less than the popular perception,” he said. “Why don’t they? They don’t because if a politician stands up and says, ‘Look, we have far less migrants than you actually think we have’, then that politician is branded, and so is his party, or that’s the fear, with being pro-migrant and it’s considered to be a negative,” he said. “The conjuncture between migration as an issue, and nationalism and anti-Europeanism is creating a toxic backdrop for an already difficult economic climate in Europe, and this is leading to the growth of movements like Ukip, Le Pen and Geert Wilders and so on across Europe,” he added, referring to Britain’s Ukip party, Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s Front National, and Dutch politician Geert Wilders – all of whom are vehemently anti-immigrant. Sutherland said this toxic backdrop led to “xenophobic and sometimes racist attacks” on migrants, and contributed to the absence of a coherent and realistic debate about the positive fiscal and financial contributions made by many migrants. So far, leaks from discussions on the new policy blueprints reveal measures aimed at stopping people from boarding unseaworthy boats manned by unscrupulous smugglers to cross the Mediterranean. Last year, at least 218,000 people, including migrants and refugees, crossed the Mediterranean by irregular routes and around 3,500 people drowned.
On the table is an Italian proposal to outsource sea patrols to North African countries, such as Egypt and Tunisia, by funding and training navies. There are also proposals to establish “reception centres” for migrants in North Africa and the Middle East. Sutherland, who was dubbed the “father of globalisation” during his time as director of the World Trade Organisation, said locating reception centres in North Africa or the Middle East could raise some problems but the advantages were significant. “How many deaths would be avoided? It’s not simply an issue ... of pushing away the problem. If the processing can take place in North Africa, it’s better because it would save lives,” he said. But Ska Keller, a leading German Greens MEP and spokesperson on migration issues, has said called the proposal on sea patrols “cynical”, as it would mean that “rescued refugees are dealt with by countries like Egypt and Tunisia and that they never become the responsibility of an EU jurisdiction”. Sutherland sharply criticised EU states for failing to support Italy’s Mare Nostrum search-and-rescue operation, which was replaced this year by the more limited Triton, which patrols no further than 30 miles from Italy’s coast. “Where are the British ships? Who else is doing it? The Italians were left to do it on their own and nobody was prepared to even financially help them. Let’s grow up,” Sutherland said. In February, the UN refugee agency said around 300 migrants and refugees, mainly from sub-Saharan Africa, may have drowned trying to cross from Libya to Europe in one weekend. “There can be no doubt left after this week’s events that Europe’s Operation Triton is a woefully inadequate replacement for Italy’s Mare Nostrum,” said UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres. “The focus has to be about saving lives. We need a robust search and rescue operation in the Central Mediterranean, not only a border patrol.” Amnesty International has also called for an EU-wide mission with at least the same mandate and resources as Mare Nostrum, which saved more than 170,000 lives. “We have to unite in our response to this in Europe,” said Sutherland. “We have to have ... a far more proactive policy development at national level where much of the responsibility is left in the hands of home affairs or justice ministries ... All they think about is stopping people coming in rather than the problem of how to treat them when they do come in.” The UN has drawn up radical plans for an “orderly relocation” of thousands of Syrian refugees from southern Europe to richer countries in the north, and is pressing the EU to agree to a year-long pilot programme. “I think that is important because if you have a temporary settlement you create a capacity to relate to the society,” said Sutherland. While the complex issue of migration could not be addressed by “waving a policy wand”, measures could be taken, such as offering temporary protection visas to asylum seekers to allow them to work while their cases were assessed, Sutherland said. And, above all, lives must be saved as an immediate priority. “We saw what was done with Mare Nostrum ... Why can’t we have a situation where Triton is given resources? This is urgent. And it’s going to lead to internal unrest in Europe unless it is handled,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/31/un-official-eu-debates-migration-policies-peter-sutherland,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/31/un-official-eu-debates-migration-policies-peter-sutherland
2015-03-31T06:00:09Z,global-development,Global development,African Development Bank president calls on successor to focus on poorest | Mark Anderson,"The next president of the African Development Bank (AfDB) must improve the livelihoods of the continent’s poorest people, address huge energy shortages and fill infrastructure funding gaps, according to the bank’s outgoing president, Donald Kaberuka. “For the next leader of the bank … inclusion and broad-based growth is absolutely the number one [item on the] agenda,” says Kaberuka, who steps down in May after presiding over the bank for a decade. With worsening levels of inequality and soaring population growth across Africa, Kaberuka calls on the biggest lenders to African countries to refocus their efforts on providing services and opportunities for the poor. “How do you ensure that everything [financing institutions do] asks the question: does this reach the ordinary citizen in our countries? Not simply, Senegal [has] 10% GDP growth – and a taxi driver says, ‘Well, I can’t eat the GDP’,” he says. For Kaberuka, a Rwandan who served as his country’s finance minister from 1997 to 2003, navigating the bank through the 2008 financial crisis and helping it to keep its credit rating intact are among his proudest achievements. But plenty of challenges remain for the bank and for the continent. “Each time I land in a rich African country, I count the number of private jets and I think, what could be the origin of this wealth? It’s unlikely to be enterprise or innovation,” says Kaberuka. “The test of a nation is not how many millionaires you have, it is how many millions of people you [lift] from poverty into the middle class.”
Kaberuka also warns that Africa’s economic development is being choked by chronic energy shortages: “Today, in every single African country, from South Africa to the north, the biggest impediment to economic growth is energy,” he says. He adds that the continent must find an extra $92bn every year to fill its infrastructure funding gap – to build new roads, schools, hospitals and airports. Kaberuka has said climate change is one of the “greatest calamities” Africa faces, but he is encouraged by successful solar projects in Morocco and windfarms in Kenya. The AfDB has an investment policy to finance renewable and non-renewable energy projects in equal measure. Kaberuka defends African countries using non-renewable energy sources. “It is hypocritical for western governments, who have funded their industrialisation using fossil fuels … to say to African countries: ‘You cannot develop dams, you cannot develop coal, just rely on these very expensive renewables,’” he says. With oil, gas and mineral production at the forefront of Africa’s economic growth, Kaberuka has called for better management of the continent’s natural resources. China, the main buyer of Africa’s oil and minerals, has taken a prominent role in financing infrastructure projects, leading some to question the AfDB’s place in Africa’s funding ecosystem. Last year, the bank announced a $2bn partnership with the People’s Bank of China, known as the Africa Growing Together Fund, which will use AfDB’s policies, procedures and safeguards to help African governments strike better deals with Chinese investors. But Kaberuka stands by the progress the bank has made under his stewardship, and shrugs off the suggestion that he could have done more for Africa’s poor. “Infrastructure is now 60% of everything we do, and we backed the mission of the bank, which was creating the single market in Africa,” he says.
Regional integration has been an AfDB priority since its founding in 1964. Despite a number of false starts, Kaberuka is “very confident” that regional blocs such as the East African Community (EAC) and the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) will realise long-held ambitions to tighten political unions and merge into a single market. But last week the Tanzania president, Jakaya Kikwete, said the “slow progress” towards the EAC’s common market was “discouraging” to citizens of Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Burundi, which make up the bloc. Kaberuka bemoans the minimal role African governments have played in the Ebola crisis. The early stages of the response saw “thousands of NGOs with all these huge vehicles with radio antennas, but there was no involvement of communities or governments”, he says, adding that the AfDB’s priority has been to channel funds to governments dealing with the crisis. So far, the bank has given$230m to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, he says. The final cost of the Ebola crisis will be about $3.2bn, according to Kaberuka. He applauds the international response to Ebola, describing it as “people putting their politics on the side, dealing with the problem”. But he criticises African governments for “failing to explain to the communities how Ebola could be contained”. The AfDB will elect its next president in May. Eight candidates – from Nigeria, Ethiopia, Tunisia, Chad, Cape Verde, Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe and Mali – have been named. The next president will be judged by their ability to spread Africa’s economic growth and lift people out of poverty, says Kaberuka. “Think of a citizen looking at power lines going above them, and they live in darkness because they can’t afford [electricity].”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/31/african-development-bank-president-kaberuka-successor,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/31/african-development-bank-president-kaberuka-successor
2015-03-30T13:06:36Z,global-development,Global development,Cambodian child labour laws flouted with fake ID | Jamie Elliott,"Like most teenagers, Jorani, who says she is 14, has plenty of stamina. She has just spent the day making hundreds of shoes at the New Star Shoes Co factory in Sihanoukville, Cambodia. “I punch holes in about 300 shoes every day, and work eight hours a day, six days a week,” she says, in a barely audible voice. “But I don’t get too tired.” Jorani lives with her sister in one of the dark, cramped rooms in an accommodation block opposite the factory. “I have come to work in the shoe factory because my family is poor,” she says, as she washes dishes on the ground in a tiny alley, where women have to bathe due to the lack of private washing facilities. “If I had a choice, I would like to have time to study and go to school.” Taiwanese-owned New Star makes shoes for brands including Geox, an Italian firm with 1,225 stores worldwide and sales of $873m (£586m) last year. Until January, sports shoe company Asics was also a New Star customer. Jorani, like many underage workers, lied about her age to get her job. “The factory doesn’t know I’m 14,” she says. The legal minimum age to work in a factory in Cambodia is 15. But the law says “juveniles”, those aged 15 to 17, must not work overtime or do heavy work. So, like many factories, New Star – which employs about 4,000 workers, most of them female – sets its age limit at 18. Some factories try to hide underage workers when visitors come, according to a Human Rights Watch report into the Cambodian garment industry published this month.
One 15-year-old, who started work in a clothes factory aged 14, told HRW researchers: “They told me to hide under the table and put a pile of clothes on us. We tried to keep very quiet when the visitors were there.” A 17-year-old at a different factory told HRW that early last year, a day before visitors were due, management called a meeting of all young workers and told them to stay at home the next day. One of the main problems is the ease with which workers can get fake IDs. “My daughter was too young to work, so we borrowed a family book and birth certificate from another family,” says Tha, the father of a 17-year-old New Star worker. “Families help one another.” As there are no photos on Cambodian IDs, his daughter simply memorised the new details. Tha used the same procedure for his niece, who was 16 when she started work at the factory. Poverty often leaves parents with few choices, according to Oxfam’s country director for Cambodia, Chris Eijkemans. “If they help their children lie about their age to get a job, it is usually because they have no other way of providing the basic necessities of food and shelter for their family,” he says.
Weak safeguarding of children is another problem. “For many children in Cambodia, the child protection situation is dire,” says Unicef’s chief of communication, Denise Shepherd-Johnson. “Strengthening the child- and social-protection systems is a priority.” At 5pm, thousands of young women, and a few hundred young men, stream out of the New Star gates. “There is almost no one aged over 25 at this factory,” says Ath Thorn, head of the Coalition of Cambodian Apparel Workers’ Democratic Union (C Cawdu), Cambodia’s largest garment workers’ trade union. Nearly all the workers we speak to at roadside cafes that serve New Star say they are aged between 16 and 18. “I’m not happy working here, but I have no choice,” says one young woman, who seven months ago used fake ID to get a job when she was 16.
Her prospects are not good, according to Dave Welsh, country director for US-based labour rights group the Solidarity Centre. “At the end of their career, at the ripe old age of 35, the majority [of workers] are left with no savings, no transferable skills, and very little education,” he says. “The companies are taking the best years of these young women’s lives and working them to exhaustion.” Tha’s daughter, Neary, bears this out. “Sometimes I get tired and get swollen hands because we have to pull the soles of the shoes very hard, which makes my wrists and hands hurt,” she says. Factories and brands know all about the role of fake IDs in age-rule breaches, says Welsh. “Any major brand which says they are unaware of the connection between the fake ID problem and the underage worker problem is either being untruthful or admitting that they cannot monitor an industry where a given brand is only invested in 20 or 30 factories.” Moeun Tola, head of legal advice at Cambodia’s Community Legal Education Centre, makes the same point. “Because the manufacturers don’t want to abide by the rules for juvenile workers, they accept falsified documents and pretend not to know that workers are under 18.” A spokesperson for New Star Corporation, the parent company of New Star Shoes Co, says that the company makes every effort to ensure that workers are not under 18, interviewing all applicants in person. If suspicions are raised the company asks for additional proof of age, such as a birth certificate with the stamp of the village elder. A senior manager at New Star Corporation, Living Lu, blames the Cambodian authorities for the fake ID problem. “Because of the weak control of fake certificates by the Cambodian government, some workers can get fake certificates easily,” he says. Geox says it has no evidence of underage workers at New Star, which signed its code of conduct and manufacturing agreement, binding suppliers to respect local legal requirements for age of employment and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) convention 138 – it publishes its code of ethics on its website. Any worker aged below 18 should be clearly identified, the company adds. On 31 October and 1 November 2014, Geox says, it audited New Star, based on site observations, interviews with employees, questionnaire data and examination of the company’s records. The audit did not identify any underage workers according to Cambodian laws on juvenile work protection. An Asics spokesperson says the company has sponsored child labour prevention training for all its Cambodian factories (including New Star). At Keeptop garment factory, which employs about 250 people in the Cambodian countryside, we meet 16- and 17-year-olds working extremely long hours. “Because there is a rush on, they are making us work [from 7.30am] until 10.30pm, Monday to Friday,” one young woman says. “If we don’t do the overtime that we are asked to do two or three times, the factory will sack us.” Despite the ban on overtime for 15- to 17-year-olds, there is little incentive for employers to stick to the rules. “If an employer breaks the law, they don’t get punished, so the employer will break the law again and again,” says C Cawdu union organiser Rama An. A spokesperson for Keeptop says that they are aware that some of their workers are aged between 16 and 18. “We have put [this] on record in [the] labour department.” The spokesperson also says that staff are not pressured to work excessive extra hours, adding that all overtime takes place between 4.30pm and 6.30pm. To qualify for an export licence, garment factories must register with the International Labour Organisation’s Better Factories Cambodia (BFC) monitoring programme. BFC also started to work with shoe factories in 2012, but on a voluntary basis.
Brands are often vocal about working with BFC, although, until late 2013, findings from the monitor’s factory visits were available only to the factories themselves and the brands they supplied. But after a 13-year-old worker died in a ceiling collapse at a Wing Star Shoes factory in 2013, BFC came under pressure to be more open, and launched its “transparency programme”. Summary reports now show whether New Star, and 524 other BFC-registered factories, have passed or failed on 21 “critical issues” including child labour. However, details of individual failings and the identity of brands that the factories supply remain secret. The big gap, according to BFC deputy programme manager Camilla Roman, is enforcement, which is the Cambodian government’s responsibility. Although BFC gives the government details of every child labour case it uncovers, it does not know of a single instance of enforcement action being taken. “At the moment we don’t have any information about follow-up action by the ministry of labour,” Roman says. “We would like to have … more information about action they take when we pass on to them confirmed child labour cases.” This may explain why last month it took only half an hour to find a New Star worker who said she was 14, exactly a year after BFC identified two other workers under 15 at the same factory. Despite these cases, there has been no further assessment visit by BFC to New Star since February 2014. No date has been set for one, and BFC cannot say whether such a visit will happen this year. Nonetheless, Thorn is optimistic. “I think in the future the government will implement the law, and conditions for workers will get better,” he says. “The pressure from brands will make companies improve.” Heng Sour, spokesman for the ministry of labour, says: “The ministry of labour and vocational training always has taken the child labour as a serious issue. The ministry not only follows up cases uncovered by BFC, but also has its own random inspections to prevent… child labour.” He says that when any child labour case is uncovered, the ministry – along with the BFC, the Garment Manufacturers’ Association in Cambodia (GMAC) and the ministry of commerce – always carries out a joint inspection. In a letter to the Cambodia Daily, Ken Loo, secretary general of GMAC, says the organisation takes a zero tolerance approach to underage workers. “The numbers of underage workers found in GMAC members’ factories is very small, and those that are found have mostly either presented fake IDs or opted to impersonate someone else, all… their own violations.” In Sihanoukville, as she washes the last of her dishes, Jorani answers instantly when asked what she would like to do with her life. “I want to be a teacher,” she says.

2015-03-30T11:05:28Z,global-development,Global development,"Aid must be smarter to stop conflict and end poverty, report says | Clár Ní Chonghaile","Despite sending more than half their aid to countries marked by conflict, donor states have not been successful in promoting peace and building institutions, and this failure risks torpedoing efforts to lift the world’s most vulnerable people out of poverty, according to a new report. States of Fragility 2015, which has been produced by New York University’s Center on International Cooperation (CIC) for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), says many countries will not be able to eradicate poverty if concentrated efforts to address fragility are not made now. “To rise to the challenge of the post-2015 era, aid needs to be made smarter,” the report said, adding that the development debate offered a “historic opportunity” to make the international approach to fragility and financing “fit for purpose”. “If institution-building and conflict reduction continue at their existing pace, by 2030 nearly half a billion people could remain below the poverty line of $1.25 a day,” it said.
While fragile states had made progress towards achieving the millennium development goals, as a group they lagged behind other developing countries: nearly two-thirds are expected to miss the goal of halving poverty by 2015, with just a fifth halving infant mortality and just over a quarter halving the number of people with no access to clean water. The report said: “These trends point to a growing concentration of absolute poverty in fragile situations – today, the 50 fragile countries and economies monitored by the OECD are home to 43% of people living on less than $1.25 a day; by 2030, the concentration could be 62%.”. Sarah Hearn, associate director and senior fellow at CIC, said the big flaw of the MDGs was that they did not directly address governance, conflict and fragility. “A lot of aid has gone into health and education and social sectors, which is really important and a part of peace-building but there has been insufficient emphasis on security and justice and policing and politics, and those are really important areas for countries trying to exit conflict,” she said. UN member states are due to meet in New York in September to finalise a new set of 17 goals and 169 targets – the sustainable development goals – that will set development priorities until 2030. The draft includes a target to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development. “Far greater international political will is needed to support nationally owned and led plans, build national institutions at a faster rate and help countries to generate domestic revenues and attract private finance,” the report said.
The report found that some countries received the lion’s share of the aid, which has nearly doubled over 15 years: Afghanistan and Iraq accounted for 22% of all official development assistance (ODA) sent to fragile states and economies. Hearn said a new model of global monitoring would help to address such inequalities and improve efforts to prevent crises. “Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea are a really important example of that ... They were actually aid orphans before the Ebola outbreak. Only about $9m was going into those countries for infectious disease control, and now of course it’s billions that are going to have to flood into the region,” she said. The report also highlighted the critical role of remittances, which it said constituted the largest aggregate financial flow to fragile states. However, the benefits of money sent home by migrants were limited mainly to a small number of middle-income countries with large diaspora populations, such as Nigeria and Egypt. Without international will to expand migration, poorer regions would continue to lose out, the report said. But Hearn acknowledged that the political environment now did not allow for a rational discussion on this. “On a pragmatic level, we can cut the cost for migrants to transfer remittances. There are many costs associated with banking, and the war on terror,” she said, noting the example of Somalia, where millions have been affected by western banks’ decisions to close the accounts of money transfer firms because of fears the funds could find their way into the hands of extremists.
“We are in a globalised economy. Remittances have an important impact on development,” said Hearn. “(They are) probably as important, if not more important, than aid ... There is a long-term argument to be made about mutual benefit, building mutual economies, mutual trade.” The list of fragile states analysed in the report range from conflict-ravaged countries like Yemen and Libya, through Afghanistan and Iraq to more stable states like Kenya and Cameroon. Hearn said the list was controversial because it only looked at developing countries, and that the OECD hoped to adopt an alternative approach within three years to look at fragility on a universal level, including in rich and middle-income countries. The report also highlighted the absence of an international norm to track peace and security spending, outside of UN peacekeeping costs, which stand at around $8.5bn a year, and official development assistance funding for security. Hearn said some countries were concerned that an increased focus on peace-building and governance in the new SDGs could lead to more militarised and securitised aid. “It’s something western donors are going to have to prove: that it’s not just about creating opportunities to flood money into Syria or Libya. It really is about building peace everywhere.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/30/aid-fragile-states-cic-report-stop-conflict-end-poverty,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/30/aid-fragile-states-cic-report-stop-conflict-end-poverty
2015-03-30T06:00:06Z,global-development,Global development,Rural women in Tunisia: ‘We have been silent for too long’ | Nay Elrahi,"Growing up in a village in north-eastern Tunisia, Ahlam Ben Ahmad had to walk up to 4km to reach a hospital, buy food or attend school. She often got sick from the long journey, and dropped out of school two years before graduation because of her long commute. “I woke up at 5am every day, carried my sick brother on my back and walked to school to reach it by seven,” she says. “But I still carried my brother there every day because at least one of us nine had to finish school.” Fifteen years after Ben Ahmad, now 30, dropped out of school, the government has not improved the roads near her home. It still takes her several hours to travel from her hometown of Boucha to Kelibia, the nearest city. In a private vehicle, the same journey would take just 30 minutes. Like Ben Ahmad, many women in rural Tunisia face long trips to access essential services, which are usually located in urban centres. But it’s not just better road networks and health systems these women want. They want to improve women’s rights at the national level and bring female leaders into their country’s politics. Tired of her grievances going unnoticed, Ben Ahmad now works on the Amal programme, which aims to increase rural women’s and girls’ awareness of their rights, and to empower them to play leading roles at the community, regional and national level. Tunisia’s women have a long struggle ahead of them. According to a recent study by the Tunisian Association of Democratic Women (ATFD), 40% of women in rural areas are illiterate, while 60% suffer from health problems, 93% of which are work-related. Just 10% had access to free healthcare. Amal, which means “hope” in Arabic, is a three-year programme aimed at boosting women’s access to power in the Middle East and north Africa. It has been rolled out in Morocco, Tunisia, Yemen and Palestine by Oxfam and 15 local organisations with funding from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency.
“The overall goal of this programme is for women in the Middle East and north Africa region, including poor and marginalised women, to have increased ability to participate and exercise leadership at all levels of decision-making, gaining power over their lives and ensuring their practical needs and rights are central for existing and emerging governance structures,” Oxfam said. Tunisia’s rural women, with support from local and international organisations, are trying to bring their ideas to the country’s decision-makers. On 17 March, women from five regions of Tunisia travelled to the capital, Tunis, to meet members of parliament and representatives of ministries for the first time, and raise the issue of female development priorities, which has been long-neglected. They also made their voices heard at the World Social Forum, which ran in Tunis from 24-28 March. Ben Ahmad and other women in Azmour say they want easier and more transparent access to social services, and better roads between villages and urban centres. Most importantly, they want to establish a committee of local men and women to follow up on the progress and implementation of development projects in their region. The women say they have always had strong opinions about how Tunisia should be governed, but until now didn’t know how to influence the political system. Through local organisations such as the League of Tunisian Women Voters (LET), the Tunisian Association of Democratic Women, and the Association of Tunisian Women for Research and Development, Amal is working to empower rural and marginalised women with the skills, tools and knowledge to challenge political system in five of Tunisia’s regions: Kef, Kasserine, Sousse, Ben Arous and Kelibia. When they were approached by LET to help improve political representation, the women of Azmour were quick to engage. Through their advocacy process, Ben Ahmad and her neighbours found out that the local council for development in Azmour had already allocated budget for improving the roads in 2012, but implementation was put on hold. So they circulated a petition demanding its implementation and met with their local council last December. The government made promises, but they want more. “We want action,” says Ben Ahmad. “We have been silent for a long time, today we want to act. I want my children and grandchildren to go to school without getting sick. I want them to go out on weekends, and join clubs and enjoy their hobbies.” Nay Elrahi is communications and partnerships officer for Oxfam’s Regional Gender Justice Programme in the Middle East and North Africa, and is currently supporting Oxfam’s office in Tunis",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/30/rural-women-rights-tunisia-world-social-forum,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/30/rural-women-rights-tunisia-world-social-forum
2015-03-28T09:00:00Z,global-development,Global development,"'Farkhunda belongs to all of the women of Kabul, of Afghanistan' | Frozan Marofi","It started very small; none of us had a plan. When I saw on Facebook that Farkhunda would be buried on Sunday morning, I quickly posted the information on my timeline and got myself together. I wore black, for my sorrow; I wore trainers on my feet, so that I could be strong. My daughter Regwida and I went to the graveyard where Farkhunda would be buried. I wanted to express our sorrow, nothing more. There was just one other woman there.But more and more women began to arrive. Soon we were about 35, all come to pay their respects to this martyr of Afghanistan. You know Farkhunda: she was the young woman – just 27 – beaten to death by a mob in the centre of Kabul last week. This did not happen in some remote village, in some dark area, but right in our capital, among police checkpoints, embassies, ministries. Even the presidential palace is nearby. A mullah said that Farkhunda had burned the Qu’ran. It was a lie; all she did was tell him that his business of selling tawiz – small scraps of paper with religious verses that are supposed to be powerful spells – was against Islam. This mullah began to yell that Farkhunda had desecrated the holy book. Soon a crowd formed, and began to beat her with sticks, stones, their feet. They tied her to a car and dragged her through the streets; they threw her body on the riverbank and set it alight.
I do not know what made these men so wild. I do not know what was in their hearts. They shouted “Allahu Akbar!” as they killed her. As a Muslim, it is painful to hear “God is great” chanted while taking an innocent life. It is a manipulation of the Islam I know, which promises women their rights – to be educated and to have a voice. Some of our public figures approved of the killing. Afghan cleric Maulawi Ayaz Niyazi said the people who killed Farkhunda should not be punished. The deputy minister of information and culture, Simin Hassanzada, agreed. Farkhunda was laid out on a playground, where children play football. There was no room in the graveyard itself. Maulawi Niyazi came to pray over her body, but I stood in front of him and told him, respectfully: “Sir, we do not allow you to pray for Farkhunda.” He had a man with him who said: “This is our dead body. Who do you think you are?” I told him: “This is not your dead body. Farkhunda belongs to all of the women of Kabul, of Afghanistan. Her body belongs to all Afghan mothers.” The other girls started to shout, “We do not want Niyazi here.” And he left. When the time came to take the body to the grave, the women said they would do it. They did not allow a man to touch Farkhunda. Her brother said Farkhunda’s sister should take his place.
It was the very first time in Afghanistan – maybe in all the Islamic world – that women took a dead body to the grave. Men from Farkhunda’s family made a ring around us to protect us. They supported us and respected us. I think that if such a small number of women could make such a big change in the minds of so many men, we can do anything. The demonstration in Kabul was scheduled for Tuesday. The word spread on Facebook, on Twitter, on Viber. We were in touch with the whole world; everyone supported us. It began to rain on that morning. I was afraid that no one would come. But when we arrived at Massoud Circle, there were thousands of people. Every political party was there, as well as civil society organisations, women’s rights activists, university students and ordinary people. There were women in full chadori, only their eyes exposed; there were 12-year-old girls. There were men and boys. We all came together with one voice, with one goal: justice for Farkhunda. We marched in the rain, all the way to the supreme court and back. We shouted, “Farkhunda is our sister!”, “We want justice!” and “We have been silent long enough!” I think the most moving tribute was from Rawand-e-Sabz, the Green Trend movement organised by the former intelligence chief Amrullah Saleh.
There were a lot of men and boys, all with green scarves or ribbons around their necks, standing silently along the route, with their heads bowed. “We are ashamed,” said Saleh, who attended the rally. “We are ashamed that we could not defend Farkhunda.” There are people who want harsh punishment for those who killed Farkhunda. Some say that the mullah who started it should be burned, the way they burned Farkhunda. But if we do that, how are we different from them? We have laws, we have a policy. They should be punished according to the law. At the end of the demonstration, a bunch of men showed up and began to shout: “Allahu Akbar!” Some people think they may have been sent to make trouble. But I prefer to think that even they were supporting us, supporting Farkhunda. I have hope for my country. People all over Afghanistan, in Badakhshan, in Herat, in Bamyan, all are saying the killing of Farkhunda was bad. Even the Taliban have come out to say it was not a good thing. So I am optimistic. I hope that I am right. Frozan Marofi is Women for Women International’s manager for social empowerment.

2015-03-27T16:37:27Z,global-development,Global development,Asylum requests to rich countries at highest point for almost 25 years,"The number of people applying for asylum in wealthy countries soared to a 22-year high in 2014, as hundreds of thousands fled conflicts in Syria and Iraq, the UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has said. Humanitarian crises and the threat of human rights violations were also behind the rise last year, when more than 850,000 people applied for asylum in 44 wealthy countries in Asia, Europe and North America, according to the UNHCR. More asylum applications were filed in 2014 than in any year since 1992, when fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina displaced 900,000 people. Last year, Germany received the most asylum seekers of any wealthy country, with more than 173,000 asylum applications, including nearly 40,000 from Syrians; the US accepted 121,000 applications, while Turkey took 88,000. European law requires people to be physically present in the country they are petitioning for asylum. Syrians put forward 150,000 asylum applications in 2014, or one in five of all submitted. They were followed by Iraqis, who filed nearly 70,000 requests, and Afghans, with 60,000 applications, the UNHCR said. Overall, this marks a 45% rise from 2013.
Germany accounted for 30% of all asylum claims made in the EU, while Sweden received 13% of the applications, the UNHCR said. The report did not include asylum applications to Russia, but estimated that it had received 265,000 asylum applications from Ukrainians last year, who fled fighting in the country’s east. António Guterres, the UN’s high commissioner for refugees, said: “Today, the surge in armed conflicts around the world presents us with similar challenges, in particular the dramatic situation in Syria. Our response has to be just as generous now as it was then – providing access to asylum, resettlement opportunities and other forms of protection for the people fleeing these terrible conflicts.” Sweden hosts the most asylum seekers as a percentage of its population, averaging 24.4 refugees for every 1,000 Swedish nationals, according to the UNHCR.
Asylum seekers are defined by the UNHCR as people whose claims of persecution have not yet been substantiated. According to the 1951 refugee convention, which was amended in 1967, “refugees deserve, as a minimum, the same standards of treatment enjoyed by other foreign nationals in a given country and, in many cases, the same treatment as nationals”. • This article was updated on 30 March 2015 to clarify that Sweden hosts 24.4 refugees per 1,000 Swedish nationals.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2015/mar/27/asylum-applications-rich-countries-highest-since-1992,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/datablog/2015/mar/27/asylum-applications-rich-countries-highest-since-1992
2015-03-27T12:47:33Z,global-development,Global development,"Yemen on brink of humanitarian crisis amid rising food shortages, says Unicef","Yemen could suffer a “major humanitarian crisis” within months if the international community does not urgently step up efforts to help the disintegrating Gulf state feed and vaccinate its children, Unicef has warned. The country, which is now on the verge of all-out civil war, is the poorest nation in the Arab world, with 10 million people in need of food assistance and 8.4 million requiring healthcare services. Yemen’s already precarious humanitarian situation has been exacerbated by four years of political unrest that have now pitted the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels against a Saudi-led coalition backed by the US, Gulf states, Egypt and Turkey. The anti-Houthi coalition’s bombing campaign entered a second day on Friday with airstrikes pounding the rebels’ northern stronghold and other key military installations. The bombing is thought to have killed at least 18 civilians. Julien Harneis, Unicef’s Yemen representative, said the UN children’s agency was desperately trying to plug the gap left by the crumbling state and the withdrawal of donor funding. Last week, he said, Unicef flew in 6m doses of basic polio and tuberculosis vaccines to help bolster the immunisation effort. “If there isn’t the humanitarian support to the country, in six months or a year’s time, you will get a major humanitarian crisis around food security and around malnutrition,” he said. “If a country runs out of vaccines, that has an immediate impact; if a country stops providing health services, that has an immediate impact.” A fortnight ago, the World Bank announced that it was suspending its operations in Yemen because the situation had “deteriorated to the degree that the bank was unable to exercise effective management over its projects”. Saudi Arabia, another key donor, pulled most of its financial aid from Yemen late last year after the Houthi rebels took the Yemeni capital, Sana’a. Harneis said he was worried that recent, hard-won gains – such as reducing the number of children suffering severe and acute malnutrition from 280,000 last year to 160,000 this year – could swiftly be undone. “We are quite capable of continuing our programming: we still get across most of the country, we’re still able to execute our programmes through our governmental and non-governmental partners,” he said. “However, we aren’t in a position to make up for a huge gap in shortfalls that result from the Saudis freezing their funding or the World Bank suspending its programmes, so we need to find a solution to that for the sake of Yemeni children.” Harneis said Unicef was in talks with the World Bank and praised the UK’s Department for International Development for its funding support. “The British government has been good in that they’re continuing to support Yemen, but it would be good to make sure other actors step up to the plate,” he said. Harneis said malnutrition and a drop in immunity were not the only threats facing Yemeni children. Unicef estimates that the number of boys being recruited into armed groups has doubled over the past year, with children now making up about 30% of fighters. “The Houthis mobilised their fighters, who are basically armed tribesmen, to take Sana’a,” he said. “In response, other tribes have mobilised back to oppose them, and it turns out many of their tribesmen aren’t tribesmen, they’re tribesboys. So you get everybody taking up arms and preparing to fight – and everybody means boys.” Cedric Schweizer, the head of the delegation of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Yemen, also expressed concerns over the effect the growing violence was having on the civilian population. Schweizer said the ICRC had been told that the bombing sorties by the Saudi-led coalition had killed or wounded a “considerable number” of civilians. “We are worried by the recent escalation of violence in the country, and feel concerned at reports of civilian casualties following the air strikes in the capital Sana’a and other parts of the country,” he said. “Ordinary Yemenis – already hit hard by years of conflict – are now enduring the effects of this escalation.” Steven Zyck, a research fellow at the Overseas Development Institute, said the intensification of the fighting and fragmentation of the state would only exacerbate the suffering of Yemenis and make it harder for aid workers to reach those most in need. “Even before the current conflict, this country has been facing major challenges regarding aid access: there’s al-Qaida in the Arabian Pensinsula in certain parts of the country and tribal militias and other armed groups that have concerns about aid groups operating in their areas, and that’s led to dozens of attacks and threats per year among aid agencies operating in the country,” he said. “The current situation is just exacerbating all of that. We see aid agencies really not knowing who’s in charge.” Last month, Oxfam described Yemen’s humanitarian situation as a “forgotten crisis”, adding that nearly 16 million people, or 61% of the population, were in need of assistance.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/27/yemen-major-humanitarian-crisis-food-shortages-malnutrition-unicef,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/27/yemen-major-humanitarian-crisis-food-shortages-malnutrition-unicef
2015-03-27T11:58:39Z,global-development,Global development,"Ebola crisis points to wider global threat on a par with al-Qaida, warns UK medic","Ebola should be seen as an early wake-up call to world leaders of the potential for an international health disaster in the same way that the 1998 US embassy bombings highlighted the possibility of further attacks by al-Qaida, a leading British medic in Sierra Leone has warned. Dr Oliver Johnson has called for “a big political shakeup” at the World Health Organisation and says Britain’s Department for International Development must decide whether to “nationalise” aid and deploy the army the next time a humanitarian emergency hits. “I hope this Ebola outbreak is as bad as it gets, I hope this is a one-off,” he said. “But it could be that it’s much more like the US embassy bombings [in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam in 1998].
“They were a warning to us. At the time, we thought: ‘This is as bad as it can get – this organisation, al-Qaida, can you believe they’ve just demolished a US embassy?’ “Actually, it was a warning sign for 9/11 … there was an emerging threat, and we – and the US – were not in a position to respond effectively to that.” Johnson has been a leading figure in health policy in Freetown for the past two years, heading a partnership between the UK’s King’s Health Partners and key health institutions in Sierra Leone, including the Connaught hospital. He was previously policy director for the Parliamentary Group on Global Health. But Johnson said the issues raised by Ebola go beyond Africa, highlighting the world’s vulnerability and “how incredibly limited our capacity is to identify and respond to emergencies”. He said the UK has to ask itself why it has no domestic agency, no equivalent of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) to deploy health workers in a humanitarian emergency, be it Ebola or the Haitian earthquake. “This was a market failure. DfID, in September, said: ‘We have a blank cheque we need NGOs to go.’ Deafening silence. They had to strong-arm Save the Children into [running] Kerry Town, the Freetown Ebola hospital built by the British army. “We are the second largest donor in the world. MSF Spain deployed, MSF Swiss, Brussels deployed, the German Red Cross, the Americans deployed, Goal in Ireland deployed; we’re about the only country that didn’t have their own domestic NGO that was able to deploy to a health emergency, that had the right relationships with DfID,” he said. The closest the UK had to MSF was Merlin, but it merged with Save the Children. Johnson said the UK government must grasp the nettle, either nationalising its response to emergencies by sending in the army or keeping it private but making sure Save the Children or the Red Cross have access to NHS workers to deploy. The government should also look at establishing the equivalent of America’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a federal agency that currently has 80 staff stationed in Freetown alone. Johnson agrees this is a politically fraught challenge, but says: “You can be on the left and say we are doing this to save Africans, and you can be on the right and say we are doing this as national security to save ourselves.” However you look at the problem, it has to be addressed, he added.
Johnson also called for the world’s largest nations to restructure the WHO as a matter of urgency. He fears that, with Ebola in retreat – and because it hasn’t really threatened the safety and the security of people in the west – there “isn’t the appetite for addressing those failings”. The WHO’s director general, Margaret Chan, has been heavily criticised for the organisation’s delayed response to the Ebola epidemic, which has claimed more than 10,000 lives. Johnson says the repeated budget cuts emasculated the WHO and sent it into a “negative spiral” that blunted its ability to respond to the Ebola crisis when it first hit in December 2013. But, he says, the answer is not more money or a new WHO leader. “Learning from Ebola shouldn’t just be about learnings about Africa or Ebola, I think it’s much more about the WHO – and the problems with the WHO are not small. “When I raise the WHO issue with national governments, they say: ‘Oh, we know, we know, we’re working on it,’ and I keep saying: ‘Guys, you’re not working on it on the level you need to be working on it.’ “This has got to be a G7 summit issue. There’s a structural problem with the agency that a little bit of change of leadership or change of structure is not going to solve. “There’s something fundamental about the WHO. This director general, when she became DG, said very clearly that she saw her role as supporting national governments and she wasn’t going to do anything that national governments weren’t going to be happy with.” Johnson said this meant challenges at the African regional level went unaddressed, with Geneva failing to intervene until eight months into the outbreak. His comments chime with those in a recent report by MSF that said WHO had initially stood on the sidelines offering nothing but advisory support. “We need a WHO which has a mandate to be more autonomous, to say to a country: ‘We don’t agree with you’ … That goes to the very constitution of the WHO,” said Johnson. He is now concerned that, with Ebola in retreat, global leaders and the media will “let it slip from public consciousness and wait for something worse to happen”. This article was amended on Friday 27 March to clarify that Dr Oliver Johnson’s reference to 9/11 was intended to highlight a failure to learn lessons from the US embassy bombings.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/27/ebola-crisis-al-qaida-oliver-johnson-global-threat-uk-medic,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/27/ebola-crisis-al-qaida-oliver-johnson-global-threat-uk-medic
2015-03-27T07:00:06Z,global-development,Global development,South Sudan food crisis leaves people of Ganyiel desperate for a peace deal | Antony Loewenstein,"Angela has been living in the remote town of Ganyiel, in South Sudan’s Unity state, for 18 months. Trying to feed her five children has been hard. Angela is angry with the country’s warring parties. “I pray for peace,” she says. “But if they won’t stop the conflict, I’m telling [president] Salva Kiir and [rebel leader] Riek Machar to fight each other with their own hands and stop killing our kids.” Many internally displaced people in the area share Angela’s frustration. Their views were heard by Ertharin Cousin, the executive director of the UN World Food Programme (WFP), and the deputy special representative of the UN secretary general in the UN mission in South Sudan, Toby Lanzer, when they toured Ganyiel last weekend. “It’s important the world recognises the crisis here,” Cousin said. “People here are victims, and without us they have nothing.” She said the WFP had a shortfall of $250m (£168m) to operate its programmes for the next six months. Although in a rebel-held area, Ganyiel is a relatively safe village, away from the fighting that started in December 2013 after Kiir accused his vice-president, Machar, of plotting a coup. The war has caused the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians and displaced almost 2 million people. Ganyiel’s isolation is worsened by constant flooding. An estimated 110,000 people are seeking refuge in the region, tens of thousands more than a year ago. With roads barely functioning, the best way to deliver aid is by air.
According to the WFP’s head of nutrition, Darlene Raphael, 32% of children in the region are malnourished; rates above 15% are considered critical. Raphael assists locals in teaching others how to prepare food four times a day and wash their hands with soap and water. More funding alone won’t solve the food shortages. “We have logistical limitations such as not having anywhere to land and park more planes. Furthermore, donors have limits to how much more they will fund,” said a WFP representative. The organisation has airdropped food around Ganyiel since March 2014. This year, 10 planes are regularly delivering cooking oil, sorghum cereal and yellow split peas. Almost 70% of South Sudan is inaccessible during the rainy season and WFP is using the current dry period to prepare for the coming downpour. According to WFP figures released in March, nationwide food distribution reached 377,000 beneficiaries in February. The UN says that 2.5 million people across the nation are food insecure, and that number could easily rise to 4 million by the end of the year.In Ganyiel, things have improved greatly since the start of the war. One year ago the market was almost empty; today, it is filled with basic goods. There is a feeling of semi-permanence among the population. But everybody complains of regularly going hungry, despite the aid. The local commissioner, John Tap Puot, said government intimidation against journalists and civilians was ongoing and there weren’t enough medicines, doctors and water available. In 2014 the floods killed many cattle and destroyed crops, forcing locals to become dependent on the WFP and NGOs for food.
The political and economic crisis in the country is growing. A recently leaked African Union report recommended that both Kiir and Machar be barred from any future government and – more controversially – that the AU take control of the country. Lanzer says the government is printing money to avoid financial collapse, risking hyperinflation. Officials deny they are increasing the money supply. With a 60% drop in oil production due to the war and a falling global oil price, the country recently announced it would vigorously pursue mining. But a lack of proper regulation risks profiteers exploiting untapped resources. Washington, which had hoped South Sudan would be a reliable, African success story, appears uninterested in further, serious engagement. During a public rally for Kiir in the capital, Juba, last week, attendance was low – roughly 4,000 people turned out – and few solutions were offered to the crisis. The threat of sanctions hangs over the nation. The latest UN figures show that 112,590 people are living in refugee camps across five states. In Ganyiel, people know about the recently collapsed peace talks. “I want the international community to force Kiir and Machar to sign a peace deal,” said Angela.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/27/south-sudan-food-crisis-ganyiel-child-malnutrition,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/27/south-sudan-food-crisis-ganyiel-child-malnutrition
2015-03-26T18:41:26Z,global-development,Global development,MPs take aim at DfID as inaction on FGM in Sierra Leone heads list of 'failures',"Britain’s Department for International Development (DfID) should have worked harder to pressure the government of Sierra Leone to end female genital mutilation (FGM), according to a group of British MPs. In its final report ahead of the UK elections, the International Development Committee (IDC) said Sierra Leone had “ceased to matter to the development community” before the Ebola outbreak drew the world’s attention to west Africa, where more than 10,300 people have been killed by the disease. The IDC chided DfID for failing to do more to stamp out FGM in Sierra Leone and said that, since the practice had stopped during the Ebola outbreak, the department – one of the country’s biggest bilateral donors, with a stated aim of ending violence against women and girls – should now make the issue a priority. About 88% of girls undergo FGM in Sierra Leone, often during mass initiation ceremonies led by powerful secret societies. The IDC said it was disappointed that Sierra Leone was not included in the DfID-funded UN Joint Programme on Female Genital Mutilation. In the report released on Thursday, the IDC reviewed its work between 2010 and 2015, arguing that it had succeeded in influencing government policy, including on the need for reform of the international approach to health emergencies. Sierra Leone aside, the IDC said DfID had failed to exert enough pressure on donors and the Afghan government to entrench hard-won progress in women’s rights in Afghanistan. The department’s refusal to reconsider a decision to end bilateral aid to Burundi was also censured. The IDC defined DfID’s “failures” as recommendations the government had rejected. The committee expressed hope that policies would still change in the longer-term. Sir Malcolm Bruce, the IDC chair, said he had asked Justine Greening, the international development secretary, about FGM during parliamentary questions on 18 March. “She informed him that following the Ebola outbreak FGM had stopped because it was one of the main ways in which the disease could spread and that she was having discussions about how to prevent it becoming back. We urge DfID Sierra Leone to make this a priority,” the IDC said. In response to the report, DfID said the issue of FGM had to be handled sensitively, and led by Sierra Leoneans, pointing out that it had worked with survivors, local NGOs and partners in the country to advocate against FGM. The committee also noted that its work on Sierra Leone and Liberia had been hampered by the fact that, prior to the Ebola outbreak, it encountered difficulty in getting evidence from different development actors. “Evidently, Sierra Leone and Liberia had ceased to be of interest in the first half of 2014, although the situation changed as the Ebola outbreak refocused international attention on the country. We initially received fewer than 10 written submissions; in other inquiries we received closer to 100,” the IDC said. Last week, Baroness Lindsay Northover, parliamentary undersecretary of state at DfID, urged donors, aid agencies and campaigners to use the apparent cessation of FGM in Sierra Leone during the Ebola crisis to eradicate the practice altogether. “We are aware that at the moment, with the Ebola crisis … cutting has temporarily stopped,” Northover told a conference on FGM in London, according to Reuters. “We have to seize this opportunity and see if we can move forward and end FGM.” The IDC said DfID told the committee that, because FGM was legal in Sierra Leone, the UK could only take limited steps. The IDC rejected this argument. “We believe that the UK and DfID holds considerable influence in Sierra Leone and it should be putting far more pressure on the leadership to end this practice,” said the committee. Another failure identified by the IDC related to DfID’s policies on women and girls in Afghanistan. The department has committed to putting women and girls at the heart of the UK’s development assistance, and London hosted a high-profile summit last year on ending sexual violence in conflict, setting itself up as a world leader on the issue. Before last year’s London conference on Afghanistan, however, DfID was criticised by some activists for sidelining women’s rights. It said the rights of Afghan women and girls were a priority for the UK. The IDC’s final report suggested there was still a gap between rhetoric and reality. The committee said it had asked DfID to pressure other donors and the government in Kabul to back commitments to women, and to set up a joint donor-government plan to ensure money was funnelled to specific programmes for women and girls. “It is to our great regret that DfID rejected these recommendations and we are now receiving reports from Afghanistan that women are being kept out of peace negotiations,” the report said, citing an Oxfam study from late last year highlighting the absence of women in peace talks with the Taliban. “Without women and women’s rights activists being included in the process there is a risk that their hard-won rights may be lost in a peace settlement. We hope that our successor committee looks again at the position of women in Afghanistan,” the IDC said. DfID said it was supporting girls’ education and women’s economic and social empowerment, and working with the Afghan government to ensure it upholds its commitments to protect women. The department had provided £3.2m to strengthen access to justice for women and build awareness of women’s rights in six provinces, it said. The IDC also listed the closure of DfID’s bilateral aid to Burundi under its failures, noting its 2011 recommendation that DfID should reconsider this decision. The government did not accept the recommendation, saying Burundi, where tensions have been rising ahead of elections this summer, would continue to benefit from DfID-funded multilateral organisations. “We do not consider the decision to close the bilateral aid programme was rational or consistent. We urge our successor committee to maintain a focus on DfID’s portfolio of priority countries in Africa, including Burundi, and to ensure the smallest and poorest countries continue to receive the bilateral support that they need,” the IDC said. Mary Creagh, the shadow secretary of state for international development, said the IDC report showed the government had missed opportunities to ensure the equal treatment of women and girls. “DfID failed to include Sierra Leone in its project to end female genital mutilation despite the country having one of the highest prevalences in the world.

2015-03-26T12:37:15Z,global-development,Global development,"Ebola upsurge could undo progress in blink of an eye, warns expert","Despite the massive push to bring the number of new Ebola cases down to zero as quickly as possible, there will inevitably be “flare-ups” that could reverse the overall downward trend and prove difficult to contain, the UN’s response co-ordinator has warned. Dr David Nabarro, the UN’s special envoy for Ebola, said the huge medical, administrative and logistical operation to fight the disease could still be set back by individuals ignoring official advice. “There will be flare-ups, there will be disappointments; there will be people who evade quarantine – because nobody likes being told to stay put – there will be people who choose not to declare that they’ve got a relative ill, there will be people who get ill and just misdiagnose themselves,” he said. “I’m afraid there will be difficulties and we are, to a degree now, steeled for that.”
If people “ducked under the radar” – as recently happened in one case in northern Sierra Leone – and if they are not quickly located and treated, said Nabarro, they could cause a spike in the infection rate. “[That case] was dealt with, but if we didn’t have the capacity, both national and international, to do this work – and to do it in a really coordinated way – then these flare-ups occur and, frankly, before you can blink, we could be back to a situation where it starts climbing up again,” he said. If the infection rate began to rise once more, Nabarro explained, it would be hard to get it down again, “just because people are really tired”. “You need the cooperation of the local communities all the time – it can’t be done by outsiders on their own.” The challenge now, said Nabarro, was to avoid stigmatising individuals while keeping communities motivated for the final push, which he likened to the “last five kilometres of a marathon”. The Ebola outbreak in west Africa has so far killed more than 10,300 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. According to the most recent figures from the World Health Organisation (WHO), a total of 79 new cases of Ebola were reported in the week to 22 March – the lowest weekly total of 2015. In Guinea, which was reporting almost 300 cases a week during the peak of the crisis, there were 45 new cases. Sierra Leone reported 33 new cases, down from a peak of 500 a week. Liberia, which had reported no cases for three consecutive weeks, confirmed a new case on 20 March, breaking the country’s 42-day countdown to Ebola-free status. In August and September last year, the country was reporting 300 cases a week. While the numbers are heading in the right direction, Nabarro cautioned that the scale of the task facing those trying to get them down to zero should not be underestimated. He said more than 700 WHO staff were working in 63 different local administrations across Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea trying to coordinate the final push. In each local government area, said Nabarro, national and international workers were trying to maintain surveillance of the population, identify those with the disease, trace contacts, identify the chains of transmission and keep entire communities engaged. “These are all big demands of communities and responders and it’s very intrusive and difficult stuff,” he said.
As well as running a huge community mobilisation programme using radio, door-to-door work and cooperation with local religious leaders – not to mention ensuring the “logistical backbone” of helicopters, boats and other vehicles was working effectively – there was also the question of data, said Nabarro. “It’s [about] getting the full geographical coverage and linking everyone together with the most excellent data systems so the databases are comparable and we don’t end up with a mess because different people can’t talk to each other,” he explained. Nabarro reacted cautiously to this week’s scathing report from the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). The report said the Ebola crisis had laid bare the “age-old failures” of the humanitarian aid system, and accused the WHO of repeating the mistakes of previous public health emergencies. It also argued that the governments of Guinea and Sierra Leone had obstructed the early response and contributed to the loss of life. “As always in a major health crisis, there will be different perspectives on what went on and why particular problems occurred, so let’s wait and see what the others have got to say through their own exercises before final conclusions are reached,” said Nabarro. He did, however, fully agree with MSF’s plea for lessons to be learned from the crisis: “This time our memories must stay very long and we must remain very mindful of the enormity of the suffering, so we can be ready to apply the lessons even a year or two afterwards, even if this calls for quite a lot of investment in different ways of working or in resources.” Earlier this week, the head of the UN Ebola mission, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, told the BBC the epidemic would be over by August earlier this week. Nabarro, however, refused to be drawn on dates. “We are all working to see this come to zero as quickly as possible,” he said. “We know it’s going to be difficult but we all want to sustain the effort to try to get it to zero in all three countries as quickly as possible.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/26/ebola-expert-david-nabarro-renewed-outbreaks-inevitable-guinea-sierra-leone-liberia,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/26/ebola-expert-david-nabarro-renewed-outbreaks-inevitable-guinea-sierra-leone-liberia

By 2012, significantly more girls were enrolled in, or had attended, primary school, globally. Southern Asia has made strong gains in getting more girls into primary school. In 1990, 74 girls for every 100 boys were enrolled in school. By 2012, equal numbers of girls and boys were enrolled. Nepal has increased the percentage of seats held by women in national parliament from 6% in 1990 to almost 30% in 2014. Benin, Burkina Faso, Senegal and Sierra Leone are among the countries in sub-Saharan Africa that have made the greatest improvements in enrolling more girls into school. Over this period, between 30 and 40 additional girls were enrolled in school for every 100 boys. Rwanda has the most female lawmakers in the world. Women now make up 64% of MPs in the lower house. More girls than boys are enrolled in secondary school across Latin America and the Caribbean. The number of women employed in paid work in non-agricultural jobs increased, with the global share rising from 35% to 40% between 1990 and 2012. Since 1990, Grenada and Zimbabwe have both registered a 20% increase in the number of female MPs in their lower and upper houses, respectively. In 2012, Nicaragua recorded the most women holding ministerial positions in the world – 57% – ahead of Sweden, Finland, France and Norway. Cameroon’s elections in 2013 resulted in 56 female deputies out of 180, up from 25 under the previous parliament. In February, Malawi passed a bill that increased the age of marriage from 15 to 18. Early marriage is a prime reason why girls do not attend secondary school. Bolivia has revoked laws that did not allow women to work at night. According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the number of UN member states that have ratified the equal remuneration convention has risen from 126 in 1995 to 171 today. The number of countries that have ratified the discrimination (employment and occupation) convention has risen from 122 to 172, according to the ILO. What would you add to this list?

2015-03-26T10:00:05Z,global-development,Global development,Why gender equality by numbers will never measure up | Andrea Cornwall,"The guiding ideals of the Millennium Declaration – freedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, respect for nature and shared responsibility – promised a better world for all. These glistening ideals were transformed by the technocrats of the development industry into goals and targets that for the most part reiterated existing unmet commitments, and seem as far from being achieved today as they did in 2000. Coming so soon after the Beijing platform for action set out a roadmap for achieving gender equality, millennium development goal number three served as both detour and deflection from the structural barriers to gender equality. It fed a percentages game in which the urgent need to improve the quality of education and political representation was subordinated in favour of fast-track efforts to increase the number of girls and women entering schools and formal political arenas. MDG3 was promoted with scant regard for education’s “hidden curriculum” or politics’ intensely patriarchal codes and practices. Sexual harassment, stultifying stereotypes in the curriculum and the classroom, lack of opportunities for political apprenticeship and for seats in the places of power, and a myriad other obstacles greeted women as they entered these institutions. The transformative potential of education remains unrealised. Women’s rights networks and coalitions are continuing to show what a transformative agenda looks like. But while the push to fulfil the numerical targets set by the MDGs gets billions of dollars, the transformational work of women’s organisations is often absent from decision-making tables and starved of funds.
In the name of “gender equality”, the development industry has entrenched tired and limiting stereotypes and left untouched the deep structures of privilege and power. Divided into neat categories that bypass any real concern with power, inequality or difference, “men and boys” and “women and girls” could hardly be imagined as having a common interest in justice. “Women and girls” are clustered into a homogenous category as the deserving objects of empowerment, with scant mention of intersecting inequalities or of the reality of some women’s stakes in preserving patriarchy. And amid all the talk about engaging men and boys, we see a narrow focus on ameliorating the harms and hazards presented by those living precarious lives in the wake of neoliberalism’s structural violence and a baffling silence about the work that’s needed to challenge and change the vested power held by those able to take full advantage of the “patriarchal dividend” – and their role in sustaining structural inequities. It’s time for a change. There is much that those concerned with transforming development institutions can learn from the frames offered to us by the Occupy movement, Black Lives Matter and a transnational sexual rights politics. All take us back to a concern with our shared humanity, a concern captured in a concept that is ever more salient in these times: Hannah Arendt’s notion of “interest”, that which lies between us and “creates the conditions for reaching towards others and trying to become visible to them”. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights gives us a vision of a world in which there is justice. To realise that vision, we need to go beyond the restrictive tropes of “investing in women and girls” and “engaging men and boys”, and to reclaim a vision of what it means to be human, and to be equal. If the sustainable development goals are to offer anything, they must provide us with the tools to achieve this vision, rather than another set of grossly reduced targets and metrics that leave the real barriers to a fairer, better world for people of all genders unaddressed.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/26/why-gender-equality-by-numbers-never-measure-up-mdg3-stereotypes,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/26/why-gender-equality-by-numbers-never-measure-up-mdg3-stereotypes
2015-03-26T09:00:03Z,global-development,Global development,Have the millennium development goals empowered women? | Liz Ford,"The millennium development goals sought to improve the lives of people living in the global south by reducing poverty and hunger, as well as improving access to health, education and water and sanitation. Six of the eight goals mention women and girls as priority targets. Goal three seeks to promote gender equality and empower women. As the deadline for achieving the MDGs looms, how successful have the goals been in empowering women? UN Women predicts that, at the current pace of change, it will take about 50 years to achieve parity in parliaments, and more than 80 years before women are on an equal footing with men in terms of economic participation. According to the executive director of UN Women, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the MDGs presented a much narrower focus than the Beijing platform for action, which was signed at the fourth world conference on women, five years before the Millennium Declaration was agreed. Quite a lot of the content of the Beijing document was left out of the MDGs.
“The MDGs five years later [than Beijing] had a much smaller agenda. In a way, goal three focused on leadership and education. Certainly one regret is that [the goal] didn’t include violence against women or have an emphasis on human rights. In some cases, governments put a lot of energy into implementing the MDGs so much that Beijing, which was more comprehensive, began to fall between the cracks,” she said. Olivia Mensah, a community leader from the Brong-Ahafo region of central Ghana, who was in New York last week for the Commission on the Status of Women, was more positive about progress. She said the MDGs had resulted in more girls going to school in her country. “Firstly, few were going to school, but now more are going. The government is providing it for free, so schooling has become much easier.” She said there were also fewer instances of early marriage and domestic violence. Farmers have received equipment, like fertilisers and rubber boots, “and women with small-scale businesses have been provided with loans to enhance their businesses”. She added that more women are now entering into politics, on local and national platforms, but “we’re striving to get more, we want 50-50”. Lydia Alpizar, executive director of the Association for Women’s Rights in Development, has mixed feelings about the MDGs. “The processes that led to this framework were undemocratic, and showed a limited understanding of what is required for gender equality, social justice and sustainability more broadly. The comprehensive and forward-looking UN agreements of the 1990s were reduced and limited to the eight goals. The design of this framework left little impact due to this limited vision for what was needed, a lack of political will and the reduced allocation of necessary financial resources,” she said. But it has not been all negative. Alpizar noted some progress on access to primary education and political participation, and having a standalone goal on gender equality meant it became “an important priority that opened some opportunities”. What do you think? We want to hear from you. Have the MDGs served a purpose or did they miss a trick? Should they have factored in the 12 action points from the Beijing conference?

2015-03-26T08:00:02Z,global-development,Global development,What is the millennium development goal on gender equality all about? | Liz Ford,"What is MDG3? Launched as one of the eight millennium development goals, MDG3 calls for the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women. It has one target: the elimination of gender disparity in primary, secondary and tertiary education by 2015 (an interim deadline of 2005 for primary and secondary schooling was missed). Progress on the goal is tracked by the ratio of girls to boys in class, the share of women in paid employment in sectors other than agriculture, and the proportion of female MPs in national parliaments. Will the goal be met? The goal has promoted gender equality globally, and is likely to have empowered some women. In that sense, it has served a purpose. But the target to end gender disparity in education will not be met by the end of 2015. And while there have been improvements in the share of women in paid employment, and the number of female MPs has increased, it is safe to say the achievements have been far from transformative for women. Parity in education at primary level has almost been attained, but there is still some way to go in secondary and tertiary education.
South Asia has made the greatest gains in enrolling more girls into school. Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest gender parity rates in primary education, but has had big gains in countries including Sierra Leone, Senegal, Chad and Burkina Faso. In secondary education, central Asia, northern Africa, south-east and east Asia have achieved gender parity. But, in sub-Saharan Africa, western Asia and southern Asia, boys still significantly outnumber girls in class. Conversely, gender disparity in Latin America and the Caribbean favours girls. Despite a significant step forward, gender disparity in tertiary education is still a huge global problem. On the work front, since 1990, the percentage of women employed in non-agricultural settings has increased, from a global share of 35% in 1990 to 40% in 2012. These increases are evident in all regions, with sub-Saharan Africa showing the most impressive gains. According to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the percentage of female MPs has doubled over the past 20 years, with more women taking seats in almost 90% of the 174 countries for which data was available. Rwanda has the most female lawmakers, with 64%, while 13 countries have 40% or more women occupying seats in the lower houses of parliament, and, as of 2014, in 46 countries more than 30% of MPs were women. Roughly 715 women now hold ministerial posts. Comparatively, however, the figures offer little to celebrate. Globally, women still occupy less than a quarter of seats in parliament (the percentage has risen from 11.3% in 1995 to 22.1% in 2015), and only 17% of all government ministerial posts. UN Women says that, given the slow pace of progress since the MDGs were adopted, it will be another 40 years before gender parity is achieved in parliament.
Which issues weren’t addressed in MDG3? Just about all the issues needed to achieve gender equality and women’s empowerment were left out of MDG3. But then the goal did keep things loose by only calling on leaders to promote equality rather than actually realise it. On the plus side, other MDGs – such as numbers two and five, on education and maternal health – did have targets that were geared towards gender equality. And a target in goal number one made reference to women’s role in the job market. But many key issues were overlooked by MDG3, including: eliminating violence against women; recognising the unpaid burden of care work that falls disproportionately on women; women’s limited access to assets and resources, such as land; protecting women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights; ending harmful traditional practices, such as early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation; and the vital role women play in peace and conflict reconciliation. The goal also failed to challenge discriminatory laws and constitutions that endorse the view that men are superior to women, and did not specifically mention lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights. Why were these issues missed out? Good question. None of these are easy topics to get governments to sign off but, by 2000, four world conferences on women had made progress. Held in Mexico, Copenhagen, Nairobi and Beijing, the conferences clearly highlighted the issues that needed to be addressed for gender equality and women’s empowerment to be realised. Declarations from each were signed by the majority of UN member states. The fourth world conference in Beijing, in 1995, which is regarded as the blueprint for women’s empowerment, was signed by 189 governments, the same number that signed the Millennium Declaration, which paved the way for the goals, five years later. How does MDG3 translate to the sustainable development goals? SDG5 is the one to watch specifically on women’s empowerment. Unlike its predecessor, the goal calls on governments to achieve, rather than just promote, gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls. Proposed targets include ending violence, eliminating harmful practices, recognising the value of unpaid care, ensuring that women have full participation – and equal opportunities – in decision-making, and calling for reforms to give women equal access to economic resources. There is also a target to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, but the absence of the phrase “sexual rights” highlights ongoing unease around LGBT rights. There are also specific mentions of women’s empowerment in other SDGs. Goal three, for instance – to ensure healthy lives – proposes a target on universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services, including family planning. Goal six highlights the needs of women and girls in improving sanitation, while goal eight calls for decent work for all women and men. While the SDGs are broadly welcomed, the Women’s Major Group at the UN would have liked to see stronger wording in the goals in relation to the protection of sexual and reproductive rights, women’s unpaid care work, and their role in peace and security. The group also said the proposed goals would not transform the global economic system that deepens inequalities and discriminates against women. But most women’s right activists are relieved to have a standalone goal on empowerment with some strong targets.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/26/millennium-development-goal-three-gender-equality-explainer,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/26/millennium-development-goal-three-gender-equality-explainer
2015-03-26T07:00:01Z,global-development,Global development,Kyrgyzstan's cocktail of conservatism and apathy a bitter draught for women | Liz Ford,"When Guliaim Aiylchy opened her cafe-bar in Bishkek two years ago, it wasn’t just because she wanted to run her own business or make money. The 31-year-old also wanted to support other women in the city. Sitting at a wooden table in the Chocolate Bar in Erkindik Boulevard – by day a cafe serving food and coffees, by night a cocktail bar – Aiylchy explains why she only employs women. “Women are better to work with. If women want to work in restaurants, they’re only taken on as waitresses, not bar workers, which is seen as man’s work,” she says through an interpreter. “I don’t know why that is. I teach women to make cocktails and work the bar so they can take that skill somewhere else. It’s seen as more prestigious working in a bar than waitressing.” She also sells crafts produced by women, who sometimes work from the cafe, and allocates a percentage of her profits to support women who want to set up new businesses. “I support women opening businesses. I try to train them to be economically independent.” Her motivation to support women comes from what she sees as a slow erosion of women’s rights in Kyrgyzstan. She noticed a change five years ago, when she returned from a four-year stint in Turkey. For her, the sign of shifting sands was the increasing number of women in the capital wearing hijabs. “There were a lot more women in headscarves when I came back,” says Aiylchy, the single mother of a five-year-old daughter. She sees male influence behind the trend. Although not from a Muslim family, two of her sisters began wearing hijabs when they married Muslim men; one of them later removed hers when she got a divorce. Aiylchy has seen something similar happen with friends, too. “It feels like things are going backwards,” she says. “In my family, I grew up believing that men and women are equal. I was surprised to find other families are not like that.” She worries that, agreeing to wear the headscarf today will have a negative impact on women tomorrow. “It will be even easier to take away the rights of the next generation. Our daughters and granddaughters will have fewer and fewer rights,” says Aiylchy. A report published by the Forum of Women’s NGOs of Kyrgyzstan, which represents more than 85 organisations, said the influence of religious ideology – both Islamic and Christian – “substantially contributes to discrimination against women”, especially in rural areas. The study suggested such influence had gradually increased in the vacuum created by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the country’s independence in 1991. “Islam has a strong influence on women, how to dress and act and it’s now being discussed widely, in mosques and on television, that women should live moral lives,” says Bermet Stakeeva, programme officer at the forum.
On paper, though, the country looks progressive. Over the past 25 years, Kyrgyzstan has ratified more than 30 international conventions upholding women’s rights and empowerment. The country also signed up to the Beijing platform for action to advance women’s rights in 1995, and the Cairo agreement a year earlier promising to uphold women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights. It promised to meet the UN millennium development goals. Gender equality is enshrined in the country’s constitution, gender action plans have been drawn up, and parliament has 30% quotas for women. Kyrgyzstan also has legislation protecting women from domestic violence, liberal abortion laws, and has set the legal age of marriage at 18. However, a lack of funds and political will, and religious conservatism that casts women as inferior to men, means high ideals have rarely been translated into action. The latest World Bank figures show that Kyrgyzstan has the highest number of maternal deaths in the region, and the country will not meet the millennium development target to reduce maternal mortality rates by three-quarters. The number of women who die from pregnancy-related causes stands at 75 for every 100,000 live births, which is about three times higher than neighbouring Kazakhstan, where the population is significantly bigger. The number of married women using contraception has dropped from 60% in 1997 to about 36% in 2012, partly because of the influence of religious leaders, partly due to the prohibitive cost of modern family planning methods, which is pushing some women towards abortion as a cheaper option. The Reproductive Health Alliance of Kyrgyzstan (RHAK), a member of the International Planned Parenthood Federation, estimates the monthly cost of oral contraception is $5. The average basic salary for a doctor is less than $80 a month. Sex is still a taboo subject, and sex education in schools is rare or non-existent, making the large youth population – more than 30% of people are aged 10-24 – particularly vulnerable to sexual transmitted diseases. Violence against women remains common and is carried out with relative impunity. And while the official age of marriage is 18, this can be reduced by a year if local authorities deem there to be a “good reason”. Many marriages go unregistered, particularly in rural areas, and the practice of bride kidnapping remains widespread, despite being illegal. The Kyrgz parliament is also debating an anti-gay propaganda bill, styled around one passed in Russia. Rising poverty levels over the past five years have also complicated the picture for women. Roughly 38% of the population still lives below the national poverty line of $1.50 a day.
Galina Chirkina, executive director of RHAK, said the government’s support for women’s rights lacked both funding and clear strategies. For example, there is provision in law to teach sex education in school but it’s not being implemented, she says. “There is no funding or support, and teachers don’t have the skills. No one made a programme. There was no specific training for teachers, no manuals to teach children in the school system. And nobody told them they had to teach it. There are also cultural barriers … and the influence of religious groups, who were very aggressive and negative about it.” The RHAK was called before a parliamentary hearing in 2013 over complaints that sex education booklets it produced for young people ran counter to cultural beliefs. The complaints were made by members of the Russian Orthodox church, Muslim leaders and conservative MPs. But women’s groups are pushing back. Earlier this month, Bishkek staged Kyrgyzstan’s first national women’s forum, attracting representatives from more than 1,000 groups nationwide, as well as politicians and female ministers. Ahead of November’s parliamentary elections, there were calls for a specific government ministry to address gender equality and for the reproductive health bill currently being debated by parliament to be beefed up. Local women’s groups, supported by the forum of women NGOs, are developing their own policies that have women at the centre. For the moment, Ailychy plans to stay in Bishkek, to support women and fight from the inside. “I want to believe it will be good,” she says.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/26/kyrgyzstans-cocktail-of-conservatism-and-apathy-a-bitter-draught-for-women,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/26/kyrgyzstans-cocktail-of-conservatism-and-apathy-a-bitter-draught-for-women
2015-03-25T17:03:52Z,global-development,Global development,Bean breakthrough bodes well for climate change challenge,"Scientists are hailing a new breed of bean seed as a breakthrough, thanks to its ability to grow amid rising temperatures and yield more nutritional value, qualities they believe can thwart the anticipated destruction of nearly half of all bean production. The new seed was launched on Wednesday by scientists from the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa. As well as being more resilient to heat, the bean has a higher iron content. About 400 million people rely on beans for subsistence, according to CGIAR. But by 2050 nearly half of the world’s bean production could be wiped out by rising temperatures if new seed varieties are not rolled out immediately. “Beans are not very well adapted to high temperatures because they originated in the cool hills and mountains of central America, Mexico and South America. So pushing them down into the warmer areas has always been a challenge,” said Steve Beebe, a researcher at CGIAR, based at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture in Colombia. In 2012, CGIAR researchers began to test more than 1,000 types of beans in a bid to find “heat beater” beans able to grow amid high temperatures and drought. Scientists cultivated test plots on Colombia’s Caribbean coast and in greenhouses, before eventually discovering 30 heat-tolerant bean types that can withstand a 4C increase in temperature. CGIAR said it used natural breeding to discover the seed. “In the short run, [bean production in] central America is going to be up against the wall, in terms of high temperatures, droughts and hurricanes. In east Africa currently, the bean production is at mid to higher altitudes, so – in the short-term – Africa won’t be under quite as much threat. But by the end of the century, east Africa will be under serious, serious threat from climate change,” said Beebe. Beebe believes seeds should be distributed in small, affordable packages that farmers can test before committing to more. “When you sell seeds in very small packets it gives the farmer the option to invest in a very small amount – it’s the cost of a cup of tea – and then test it in their back yard. If they like it, they can buy more,” he said. “Otherwise you might have NGOs giving seeds away, which is not sustainable, or you have private sector firms selling 50kg bags, which farmers can’t afford.” Rising temperatures and ambitious food security targets have created an urgent need for better seeds that can grow in warmer climates and yield more nutritional value to farms in the world’s poorest countries. But how this is done, and how farmers access the seeds, is hotly debated. Earlier in the week, protestors gathered outside the London office of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to demonstrate against a meeting they said would promote corporate interests in Africa’s seed sector. Dangling a cage full of seeds in front of passersby, they yelled, “Come and free the seeds!” before smashing open the cage, which they said symbolised the corporate takeover of Africa’s seed markets. As seeds spilled on to the pavement, the meeting, hosted by the Gates Foundation and the US Agency for International Development (USAid), promoted production and distribution in Africa’s seed sector. The attendees were listed as key donor organisations, private seed companies and agricultural research centres, but did not include any groups representing farmers, according to a leaked document seen by the Guardian. The Gates Foundation and USAid have said they are working to improve food security in the world’s poorest countries. USAid’s flagship programme, the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition, has been criticised for requiring African governments to change laws and policies in favour of businesses.
The Gates Foundation said the meeting would focus on “[encouraging] the development and promotion of appropriate models for the production and delivery of early generation seeds of improved varieties for a diversity of food crops in sub-Saharan Africa”. Attendees are understood to have discussed seed markets for maize, rice, sorghum, cowpea, cassava and sweet potato in Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. African agricultural groups said the conversation around improving Africa’s seed sector needs to involve groups that represent small-scale farmers. The Gates Foundation was not immediately available for comment. Mariam Mariet, director of the African Centre for Biodiversity (ACB), said: “Public-farmer partnerships that integrate farmer and scientific knowledge will generate a more accountable process, and produce longer-lasting and more meaningful solutions for African agricultural production, than these profit-driven, exclusive and narrow processes,” she said. Ali-Masmadi Jehu-Appiah, chairman of Food Sovereignty Ghana, added: “This meeting will push this corporate agenda to hand more control away from our small farmers and into the hands of big seed companies.” • This article was amended on 26 March to clarify that Ali-Masmadi Jehu-Appiah is the chairman of Food Sovereignty Ghana and not chairwoman as previously reported",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/25/heat-resistant-bean-climate-change-cgiar,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/25/heat-resistant-bean-climate-change-cgiar
2015-03-25T10:38:12Z,global-development,Global development,EU restores ties with Guinea-Bissau five years after coup,"The EU has restored political ties to Guinea-Bissau nearly five years after a military coup threw the country into chaos and soured relations with the international community. On Tuesday, the EU’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, applauded the west African country for “embarking on a new path of peace, reconciliation and development” after it held elections and restored its constitution last year, adding that a new aid package would be announced in the coming months. Guinea-Bissau has struggled with frequent military coups, and its role in the international drugs trade has cemented its troubled reputation as the world’s first narco-state. “Today’s decision allows us to support the efforts of the authorities to rebuild the country, entrench democratic institutions and lay the foundations for long-term stability,” said Mogherini. The EU will host a meeting on Wednesday to “mobilise support for the implementation of reforms in Guinea-Bissau and its development programme,” Mogherini said. Delegates from the EU, the Guinea-Bissau government and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) will attend. At the meeting, Guinea-Bissau will ask international donors for $1.8bn in aid to fund its 10-year development plan, which aims to boost tourism and investment, according to the country’s finance minister, Geraldo Martins. Martins said his country’s political climate has finally calmed down after decades of instability. “[Our] government includes members of the opposition. This is a strong signal to the country and the international community. This is a sign of unity never before seen,” he said.
The EU’s commissioner for development, Neven Mimica, said: “Guinea-Bissau is back on the international scene and ready to move forward with the support of the EU. We will in the coming months finalise the programming of the 11th European Development Fund and align our cooperation with the priorities of the national development strategy of the government.” Since Guinea-Bissau won independence from Portugal in 1974, no elected leader has completed a five-year term. In the absence of strong leadership, the country has become a transit point for South American cocaine destined for European markets. In the aftermath of a military coup in April 2010, the EU imposed restrictions on its relations with Guinea-Bissau, saying that appointing those involved in the rebellion to high-ranking military posts was “in breach of the democratic principles”. The army, emboldened by its involvement in frequent military coups, has been accused by the US and other governments of complicity in drug-trafficking. After Guinea-Bissau’s elections in May last year, which the EU dubbed “free and credible”, the union temporarily suspended restrictions on its relations with the country. But lingering tensions between President José Mário Vaz and Domingos Simões Pereira, the prime minister, continue to simmer and could lead to a new political crisis, said Rinaldo Depagne, west Africa director at the International Crisis Group (ICG). “The two must keep disagreements out of the vital initiative to improve the security establishment, a burden that has blocked the country’s path to development for too long,” he said. Martins said the 2014 election has given the country the chance to make a clean start, but it needs support from foreign partners. Jean-Marie Guéhenno, president of the ICG, said: “Help from international partners is of critical importance to support Guinea-Bissau’s security reforms. When they meet in Brussels on 25 March, they should approve more funds to support the government’s five-year reform plan, confirm aid for the Economic Community of West African States’s military mission until 2019, and create an appropriate monitoring committee. This will send a strong message of support for a country that could become a bright spot in west Africa.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/25/guinea-bissau-eu-restore-ties-elections-development-programme,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/25/guinea-bissau-eu-restore-ties-elections-development-programme
2015-03-25T09:00:07Z,global-development,Global development,Central African Republic farmers ‘need seeds to avert disruptive food shortages’ | Clár Ní Chonghaile,"Two years after Séléka rebels ousted the president of the Central African Republic and plunged the country into chaos, farmers urgently need seeds and tools to plant crops and avert food shortages. Failure to supply them could increase tension between communities, delay the return of displaced people, and ratchet up the costs of the humanitarian response, the UN has said. Around 1.5 million people do not have enough to eat in the country, where religious violence has killed thousands since the mainly Muslim Séléka rebels deposed President François Bozizé on 24 March 2013. The rebels withdrew to the north-east last year, after international pressure and violence by mainly Christian anti-balaka militias. However, security remains fragile, with armed groups still attacking civilians in the north and east and reports of widespread human rights violations. The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned that the number of hungry people was likely to rise if immediate support were not provided to farmers, many of whom lost their seeds and tools to armed looters. “If there are no seeds in many areas, it means that people will try to move to towns. It means more displaced populations and definitely, it will mean more food aid, which is so expensive in terms of logistics and volumes,” said Jean-Alexandre Scaglia, the FAO’s representative.
Farmers and their families were in an “extremely fragile” situation, with seeds urgently needed before the start of the rainy season at the end of April or beginning of May. “In Bangui, they want vegetable seeds, they want maize seeds, and it is essential for them,” Scaglia said, adding that without seeds, the lean season – when households are between harvests – could stretch until November. The FAO is distributing maize, sorghum and vegetable seeds, as well as cassava cuttings, but it has only received half the required funding and urgently needs an additional $6.2m to support more than 60,000 vulnerable households ahead of the April planting season. “If we can help to restart agriculture, which is the main source of income of the population, it will automatically generate stability, social cohesion and peace,” Scaglia said. A dearth of funding has long stymied humanitarian efforts in CAR, which lacks the immediate visibility of other global crises. The UN has only received 11% of the $613m it requires for its programmes in 2015. Agricultural production has fallen by around 60% from levels seen before the crisis, and the FAO warned that the lean season was likely to begin four months earlier than usual. In an update from 18 March, the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) said the number of people in need of humanitarian aid had risen from 2.5 million to 2.7 million, out of a population of 4.6 million, over the past year. Around 436,000 people are displaced, and almost half a million have fled to neighbouring countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Ocha said the situation remains “volatile” with criminal activities continuing in Bangui, and armed groups fighting in several northern and eastern provinces. As fighting flares, people leave their villages and seek refuge in the bush, but some people are also returning from the capital to their homes in the countryside.
Livestock numbers are down by up to 77% compared with figures before the crisis began in late 2012, and fish supplies have fallen by about 40%. Food reserves are 40%–50% lower than average, Ocha said. In late February, the UN refugee agency said an upsurge in violence had forced almost 50,000 people to flee their homes since the start of the year, including more than 19,000 who crossed into DRC’s Equateur province. A spokeswoman said many were escaping violence linked to the seasonal movements of livestock with clashes between herders and the local and farming populations. The faultlines, in some cases, mirrored those between the ex-Séléka and anti-balaka militias. Catherine Samba-Panza took over as interim president in January 2014 and pledged to restore peace. Parliamentary and presidential elections are due to be held in July and August. Abdoulaye Mar Dieye, head of the Africa bureau at the UN Development Programme (UNDP), has said these polls are vital to restart development, and has called for more UN peacekeepers to be deployed ahead of the polls. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has asked the security council for 1,030 more peacekeepers, to strengthen the peacekeeping operation, known as Minusca, and boost numbers to almost 13,000 uniformed personnel.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/25/central-african-republic-farmers-need-seeds-urgently-food-scarcity-shortages,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/25/central-african-republic-farmers-need-seeds-urgently-food-scarcity-shortages
2015-03-25T07:00:04Z,global-development,Global development,Fragile truce brings limited respite to war-weary people of eastern Ukraine,"Just over a month after a fragile ceasefire came into effect in eastern Ukraine, a traumatised population is struggling with a lack of basic services, critical shortages in medical supplies and power outages, and the mental scars caused by the conflict. At least 1.1 million people are displaced in the region, while a further 743,000 have left Ukraine because of the conflict between pro-Russia rebels and government forces. The UN estimates that more than 6,000 people have been killed. “In non-government controlled areas, the greatest need now is food because people have no income, especially when the government has seized welfare payments. This has the biggest impact on the most vulnerable,” said Vanno Noupech, interim representative for the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. “In the areas affected by fighting before the ceasefire, there has been a lot of destruction, [there is a] lack of access to water and sanitation, and a need for food and shelter,” he added. Loïc Jaeger, deputy head of mission for Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) in Ukraine, said access to healthcare was dire, with drug stocks running out in some places, while in other areas people could not afford to buy what was available. MSF has shifted its focus from dealing with the wounded to general healthcare and the treatment of chronic diseases. “We are worried about tuberculosis because it is endemic in the area, and with people being displaced and living in crowded places, the risk of transmission is higher,” said Jaeger.
“Besides the direct effect on physical health, the lack of access to basic services is affecting people’s mental health. It was very tough when the conflict resumed in January. A lot of our patients, who were attending mental health consultations, were really depressed,” he added. In early March, the United Nations human rights office warned that Ukraine stood on the brink of a “new and very deadly chapter” after fighting escalated in mid-February, causing hundreds of deaths and “an untenable situation” for people trapped in conflict zones. Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, the high commissioner for human rights, said all sides must abide by the Minsk peace agreements signed in February. “The human rights situation in Ukraine remains grave,” he said. “Should this trend continue, this would represent a new and very deadly chapter in this conflict, expanding the areas where the rule of law and the protection of human rights are effectively absent.” Although attacks have fallen significantly since the ceasefire was agreed, there have been accusations of continued violence on both sides. Jaeger said the uncertainty was taking its toll in a declining industrial region where the closure of mines meant many young people had already left before the war, leaving behind mostly older people. “[The people] need to be able to get back to a more or less normal life because whatever humanitarian organisations might do here, it will remain a drop in the ocean. It’s not a refugee camp of 30,000 people that we can handle as humanitarian organisations. We are talking about three million people, in Europe,” he said. Noupech said some people were now trying to return to their homes in areas previously affected by fighting, but unexploded ordnance remained a problem. “People would like to go back and see what has happened but it is probably too early to talk about a sustainable return,” he said. “The response by the civilian society has been extraordinarily good for the last year, but there is also already a certain fatigue, especially because of the general economic situation, so that is quite worrying,” he added. Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund signed off a $17.5bn (£11.8bn) four-year aid programme for Ukraine, including an immediate payment of $5bn for general budget support to help stabilise the economy. Jaeger said stocks of anaesthetics and psychotropic drugs, such as anti-depressants and sedatives, were running very low and hospitals were no longer carrying out planned operations, but instead saving their anaesthetics for emergency surgery.
The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) said on 13 March that supplies of critical medicines were “alarmingly low”, adding that bureaucracy continued to hinder entry to non-government controlled areas where access to benefits and services has been cut off since last December. Humanitarian funding remains “critically low” with just 15% of the $316m required for 2015 funded or pledged. Jaeger said more aid had arrived in Donetsk over the last two months but that the Luhansk area lacked support. “Even before the war, Luhansk was much poorer than Donetsk so the coping capacity of the population is less,” he said, adding that MSF was also concerned about people around Slavyansk, where mobile clinics are being used to meet medical needs.
“The main aid providers so far have been local organisations, which are doing a great job, but they don’t have the capacity to scale up to big volumes. They used to collect clothes for the people of Africa before the war and they now collect food and clothes for displaced people in their area,” he said. The UN’s children’s agency says more than 140,000 children have been displaced, with more than 100,000 children and caregivers needing psychosocial support. Jaeger said the mental toll was especially acute because war was a relatively new experience. “We are not talking about people who have been living in a conflict environment for 20 years. They were in Europe. Euro 2012 was played in Donetsk. In that stadium now, you have hundreds of volunteers preparing food parcels for the population,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/25/ukraine-fragile-ceasefire-humanitarian-crisis-war-weary-people,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/25/ukraine-fragile-ceasefire-humanitarian-crisis-war-weary-people
2015-03-24T14:57:08Z,global-development,Global development,A loophole in the slavery bill could allow companies to hide supply chain abuses,"As a barrister who has been working at the highest levels on the global issues of slavery and trafficking for many years, I feel there is an urgent need to hold our corporations to account when they have subjected workers to enslavement either in the UK or overseas. At the moment, the UK parliament is discussing a modern slavery bill, which the government says will hold big business to account and force companies to keep their supply chains slave free. To do this, it has included a transparency in supply chain (Tisc) clause into the bill, which this week is being debated again in the Lords. This is a huge step forward in ensuring that companies become directly responsible in law for the condition of their supply chains. If passed, the Tisc clause will require large firms that do business in Britain to produce mandatory statements reporting on the steps they are taking to ensure any goods produced or services provided by workers are free of slavery and trafficking. It also, crucially, puts a legal responsibility on company directors to ensure this is happening. This is a critical development in accountability and should introduce into the law of England and Wales a culture of corporate accountability that has, so far, been absent. Yet a few days ago when I looked carefully at the wording of the Tisc clause, and after consulting a team of legal experts, I discovered there has been a startling omission, which could have far-reaching consequences for people trapped in conditions of forced and bonded labour and other forms of modern slavery around the world. The Tisc clause will require companies carrying out all or some of their business in the UK to report on steps they are taking to identify and prevent slavery in the goods and services produced, used or brought back to the UK. But, as it is currently drafted, it does not require companies in the UK to report on all the supply chains in their groups overseas, such as those of wholly owned subsidiaries abroad. In essence, this means the clause – in its current form – provides the perfect cover for companies that are not inclined to report, for example, on the conditions of workers overseas who are making goods and providing services not coming to the UK. So the Tisc clause will not prevent parent companies in the UK from profiting from any slave labour used in their supply chains abroad by non-UK subsidiaries. The message this is sending is that it is OK for British companies and other big businesses operating in the UK to pollute somebody else’s country with slave-tainted supply chains, it’s just not OK for them to pollute ours. One example that will chime with anyone who has been following the reporting of exploitation on World Cup construction sites in Qatar is that if this bill is passed in its current form, British construction companies with wholly owned subsidiaries in countries such as Qatar or Dubai will not have to include the supply chains of these businesses in their mandatory reporting statements. At the moment, it doesn’t seem that any of the big companies or charities supporting the Tisc clause have any idea of the limit on extra-territorial jurisdiction included in the modern slavery bill. Indeed, what has been extremely encouraging is the support and willingness of big companies in the UK, which have expressed genuine support for getting their supply chains slave free. Yet the clause will not seek to enforce that willingness in the way it is currently drafted. This leaves a dangerous loophole for companies that would prefer their overseas supply chains to remain out of sight. What is needed is an amendment that would require companies carrying out a business in the UK to report on all of the supply chains from which it profits and for which it is responsible. This would ensure clear accountability running through the supply chain wherever in the world that good or service is provided. That is what should be expected of the UK government and of British businesses. The introduction of the Tisc clause in the modern slavery bill represents a huge step forward in the development of corporate accountability. Yet we will never really begin to tackle modern slavery unless we ensure that the supply chains of all of our companies, whether doing business in the UK or overseas, are not tainted by trafficking, exploitation or abuse.

2015-03-24T12:09:25Z,global-development,Global development,Ethiopia: new TB treatment means patients will no longer need a miracle | Carla Kweifio-Okai,"When Endalkachew Fekadu contracted a strain of drug-resistant tuberculosis 12 years ago, it was still considered a death sentence by health professionals in Ethiopia.
Endalkachew was 16 at the time, and remembers being told the medication he’d received had failed to have any effect on the disease. “In my case, my TB was resistant to all five medications that were considered first-line drugs – the drugs that treat regular tuberculosis. It was so bad to hear. I was desperate for the next line of medications that could fix it, but at that time they weren’t available in Ethiopia – and even if you could get them it was so expensive, thousands of dollars. No one could afford it,” he recalls, sitting in his small office in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa. Multi-drug resistant, or MDR-TB, occurs when patients show resistance to at least two powerful first-line antibiotics used to treat the disease. The spread of drug-resistant TB strains has been fuelled by patients receiving intermittent medication or failing to complete the gruelling course of treatment, which can include up to 20 pills a day plus injections. As a result, almost half a million cases of MDR-TB emerge each year, with only 3% of patients receiving the treatment they need. When Endalkachew received his diagnosis he was told there was nothing that could be done, and he anticipated a similar fate to those he’d known who had died from the disease. “They would put you in a small room and quarantine you, that’s all they could do. Only a miracle could save you.” Endalkachew was granted his miracle when a US-based NGO sponsored him to receive treatment with drugs that were unavailable in Ethiopia. He had received assistance from the NGO Compassion International throughout his childhood. When it heard of his case, the NGO raised the funds required.
Despite being the only person he knew to receive second-line treatment for MDR-TB, Endalkachew discovered it presented a new set of challenges. The intensive course of treatment lasted two years, and he spent most of that time bed-ridden and self-quarantined in his room. He lists the eight drugs he took each day in detail, their side effects still clear in his mind. “They’re toxic, some people even commit suicide because of the side effects of those drugs. I could not walk most days, sometimes I’d forget my name, I couldn’t use my hands or legs. Sometimes it felt the treatment was worse than the disease and you just wanted it to end.” He recovered, graduated from university, and now leads his own NGO with other TB survivors. He’s a busy 28-year-old – a trained pharmacist, publisher of his own health magazine, and volunteer counsellor to people recovering from TB. When asked how he fits everything into his day, Endalkachew is emphatic: “I’ve been given a second chance, and I have to do something important before I die.” More than a decade since he received his life-saving treatment, Endalkachew says things have improved for MDR-TB patients today. “Back then, even the government didn’t really recognise the presence or prevalence of this disease, so of course you didn’t have a chance of getting the medication you needed. Now, things are better,” he says. “Treatment is minimised to 18 months, and now you can get the medication for free. You have early diagnostic access too – it took three to four months to get an MDR-TB result at that time. Now you get your results sometimes within a day.”
Despite progress in Ethiopia and abroad, MDR-TB cases are rising as diagnostic technology improves. In a report released for world tuberculosis day on Tuesday, the UK’s all-party parliamentary group on global TB warned that up to 75 million people risk dying over the next 35 years if the world fails to tackle TB drug resistance. The report says treatment for MDR-TB is so “complex, expensive and toxic” that less than half of people successfully complete treatment. The group calls for shorter and less arduous treatment courses to help patients complete their treatment and reduce further cases of infection. For some MDR-TB patients, hope is already on the horizon. A scheme will see two new drugs introduced in 17 high-risk countries, including Ethiopia, with the aim of halving treatment times, eliminating the need for injections, and improving patients’ chances of a cure from 48% to 70%. Funded by Unitaid, a global health financing system expanding access to drugs and diagnostics, the $60m end-TB project will bring two drugs to the market in partnership with Médecins Sans Frontières, Interactive Research and Development and Partners in Health. Unitaid’s executive director, Lelio Marmora, says the two drugs, bedaquiline and delamanid, are a welcome addition to a treatment regime in desperate need of updating. “No new TB treatments or tests were developed for more than 50 years. The increase in the number of MDR-TB cases being identified brings with it a pressing need for more effective medicines,” Marmora says. “Unitaid’s investment will help make MDR-TB treatment more effective and easier to bear, thereby helping patients to be better treated and to halt the disease’s spread.” For Endalkachew, the potential for easily accessible new treatments is profound. “I’m happy to think people who get MDR-TB today won’t go through my experience. When I was cured it was a miracle. Now it is much more likely.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/24/ethiopia-new-tb-treatment-tuberculosis-drugs-mdr-drug-resistant,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/24/ethiopia-new-tb-treatment-tuberculosis-drugs-mdr-drug-resistant
2015-03-24T07:00:01Z,global-development,Global development,Uganda to expand successful Kampala scheme in battle against tuberculosis | Andrew Green,"It is common for patients to arrive at Dr Kasauli Mahmoud Zinda’s private clinic in Bwaise, just north of Kampala’s humming business district, with a persistent cough, little appetite and a fever that, even after various treatments, just will not break. Zinda knows the symptoms usually add up to tuberculosis. With itinerant residents crowded into poorly ventilated homes and shops, the conditions in the impoverished neighbourhood are ideal for transmitting the disease. But when he first opened the clinic, Pillars Medical Centre, in 2003, there was little Zinda could do about the suspected cases. “We didn’t have the laboratory knowhow, we didn’t have the expertise to actually identify the TB cases,” he said. As a private clinic it also did not receive any support from the ministry of health. National TB funding is mostly funnelled through public and non-profit facilities. Zinda was simply left “to guess” and then refer suspected patients to a nearby government facility for follow-up.
Zinda felt he was failing his community each time a probable TB patient walked out of his clinic without being tested, in all likelihood to spread the disease. So when representatives from the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease approached him in 2011 to join a new initiative that would equip Pillars to test for and treat TB, “it looked like it was a dream,” he said. The initiative – the Slum Partnerships to Actively Respond to Tuberculosis in Kampala (Spark-TB) – recognised that Uganda, one of the world’s 22 high-burden TB countries, needed new approaches to reach probable patients. “There are so many other people in the communities who remain undetected,” said Dr Anna Nakanwagi-Mukwaya, the union’s country representative. “The slums are one of those areas that have undetected TB patients.” Along with Pillars, the union signed up 69 other private health facilities scattered across Kampala’s poorer urban areas, offering them equipment and intensive training, partnering them with public facilities and, eventually, facilitating access to national programmes that provide TB drugs free to patients. These centres became the frontline in the city’s fight to stop the disease’s spread. And their success has inspired the government to begin expanding the programme. Uganda expects to have 60,000 new TB cases annually, said Dr Frank Mugabe, who heads the country’s National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Programme (NTLP), though health workers only diagnose around 44,000 patients each year. “We are not finding all the cases that we should be finding,” he said. “So as a country, we are struggling to control tuberculosis.”
Mugabe attributes that to several factors, including a general lack of public awareness about the disease and little commitment from political leaders to increase that knowledge. “If we don’t get the voice of the leaders, people are likely not to think that TB is a big problem,” he said. There is also a perpetual funding shortage. Last year, 81% of the country’s national TB programme was completely unfunded, according to the World Health Organisation. The shortfall is why, said Nakanwagi-Mukwaya, “important sectors, like the private sectors, were often left out” of the response. This is a particularly harmful omission, because it is “the small, private, for-profit facilities that are used by the majority of the poor people in urban areas” – the same people most at risk of contracting TB. More than half of Uganda’s urban residents turn first to private clinics when they get sick, according to government statistics, rather than contend with drug and staff shortages at free, government-run facilities.
Zinda said the results at his clinic were immediate. In 2012, the first year of the partnership, Pillars diagnosed 21 patients with TB. Last year that number grew to 45. They were all started on treatment. “We know the regimens now. We know which people need to get which regimens,” he said. Across all of the Spark-TB-trained facilities, the number of TB cases diagnosed increased from 666 in the first year of the programme to 1,059 in the second. The organisers tried to shepherd more people showing potential symptoms into facilities. That meant shoring up knowledge of TB among village health team volunteers – community members who have local awareness and monitor their neighbours for symptoms. One of those volunteers, John Kisembo, said that he “found in the community that people didn’t know what is TB and people were only reaching [health services] at a severe point”. That is slowly changing. Basic knowledge of the symptoms of TB jumped from 37% in an initial 2011 survey of Kampala to 80% when a follow-up survey was conducted last year. Nakanwagi-Mukwaya said Spark-TB was “an eye opener,” especially for the ministry of health. “I think they realised that in order to increase the total number of TB cases found in the country, they cannot ignore the urban areas,” she said, nor the private clinics working there. When the $980,000 Spark-TB project drew to a close last year, the ministry decided not only to take it over but to expand it. If an anticipated grant from the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and malaria comes through, the NTLP plans to roll out similar programmes in 10 additional urban centres by the end of the year. “These facilities play a crucial role,” Mugabe acknowledged. “They are much closer to the communities. If given knowledge and helped, they can become a very firm bridge to the public and the community.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/24/uganda-tb-expand-kampala-scheme-battle-against-tuberculosis,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/24/uganda-tb-expand-kampala-scheme-battle-against-tuberculosis
2015-03-24T00:01:03Z,global-development,Global development,"Youth unemployment 'a timebomb' in developing countries, UK MPs say","The world needs to wake up to “the ticking timebomb” of youth unemployment in developing countries and treat the issue as seriously as humanitarian disasters and global efforts to eradicate disease, a group of British MPs has warned. In its latest report, the Commons International Development Committee (IDC) says population increases – especially in Africa – are making it harder for people to earn a livelihood, let alone find full-time employment. With 600 million young people competing for a predicted 200 million jobs over the next decade, the committee says there is a danger of widespread social and political unrest. “No one, not national governments nor donor agencies, are doing enough to defuse the ticking time bomb of youth unemployment in developing countries across the globe,” said its chair, Sir Malcolm Bruce. “The complacent assumptions about population growth slowing are being proven wrong and we need to see that this is now a situation that needs to be addressed with the same kind of passion as children’s vaccinations or humanitarian emergencies.” While the committee acknowledges that donors, including the World Bank and Britain’s Department for International Development (DfID), are aware of the problem, it discerns “a lack of passion in attempts to address it”. The IDC notes that DfID is planning to spend £1.8bn ($2.7bn) on economic development this year – more than double the amount spent three years ago – but says the department needs to do more to ensure that money is spent effectively. Although DfID has increased its engagement with the private sector, which creates 90% of new jobs, the committee still has “several concerns” about its ability to understand and work with businesses.
“DfID has been criticised in the past for its lack of understanding of the private sector,” says the report. “The situation has improved, but there is room for further improvement. We recommend that DfID needs to continue to develop its understanding of the private sector and to employ advisers with experience of working in the private sector, especially those who have run their own business particularly in a developing country.” As well as heeding the advice of its own country offices as to what works best locally, says the committee, DfID needs to use its influence with recipient governments to help them focus on tackling corruption and making conditions more attractive for businesses and investors. It advises the department to widen its focus beyond manufacturing, agriculture and food processing and look at sectors such as tourism and travel, where 73 million jobs could be created in the next 10 years. A considerable number of jobs, it adds, could be created in health and education. The committee also says that DfID needs “specific interventions” to help marginalised groups benefit from economic growth. “Women and girls carry a greater burden of unpaid domestic and care work than men, limiting their education and employment opportunities. We recommend that DfID take further steps to help lift this barrier.” It questions the wisdom of reducing spending on reproductive health at a time when fertility rates are still high in many parts of Africa: “We recommend that work and spending in this area be significantly increased and that DfID assess whether the main problem is access to or attitudes towards contraception.” The committee also notes that some NGOs have criticised DfID’s decision to end core funding to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) following the multilateral aid review four years ago, with one group noting “if DfID is serious about working on employment, you had better be working with the one multilateral organisation that knows absolutely what is going on there”. The international development secretary, Justine Greening, told the committee that her department still worked on individual programmes with the ILO and said DfID was likely to perform a “light-touch review” of the organisation as part of the next multilateral aid review. Mary Creagh, the shadow secretary of state for international development, said the IDC report expressed reservations over the government’s “trickle-down approach to private sector funding” that had already been raised by others. “The government has massively increased UK funding for centrally managed finance funds rather than working through country offices to improve the lives of the poorest,” she said. “A Labour government will reverse this government’s ideological funding cut to the ILO to stamp out slavery in supply chains, as the committee recommends, and we will increase UK spending on health and education services in the poorest countries to create decent jobs.” A DfID spokesman said that creating job opportunities for young people in developing countries was key to ending poverty, adding that the department’s work on economic growth had seen 70,000 young people trained in Nepal, increased pay for more than 100,000 factory workers in Bangladesh and India, and commercial loans given to 25,000 female-headed businesses around the world. The spokesman added: “This is exactly the reason we are focusing on economic development and why we have put in place the right people and the right systems to deliver on our strategy.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/24/youth-unemployment-timebomb-developing-countries-committee,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/24/youth-unemployment-timebomb-developing-countries-committee
2015-03-23T11:05:21Z,global-development,Global development,"Ebola crisis brutally exposed failures of the aid system, says MSF | Lisa O'Carroll","The Ebola crisis has brutally exposed the “age-old failures” of the humanitarian aid system with the World Health Organisation and governments repeating the mistakes of past public health emergencies, the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has said. In a highly critical report on Monday, marking the first anniversary of the official outbreak in west Africa, the charity said the governments of Guinea and Sierra Leone obstructed the early response and contributed to the loss of life. “The Ebola outbreak has often been described as a perfect storm: a cross-border epidemic in countries with weak public health systems that had never seen Ebola before,” said MSF general director Christopher Stokes. “Yet this is too convenient an explanation. For the Ebola outbreak to spiral this far out of control required many institutions to fail. And they did, with tragic and avoidable consequences.”
The lessons learned by the WHO from the last international pubic health crisis, the cholera outbreak in Haiti that began in 2010 – were simply ignored and not put in place, says the report. The WHO should have been fighting the virus by stepping into the obvious leadership vacuum, but instead stood on the sidelines and limited its role to advisory support. MSF said its early warnings of an “unprecedented” situation in March last year were dismissed as “alarmist”, with the WHO calling into question its declaration that this outbreak was different to those before in places such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The WHO’s “willingness to assume responsibility to respond robustly” was not present, says MSF. The charity warned that the number of cases “have not significantly declined since late January” and numbers are “still higher than in any previous outbreak”.
As of 18 March, the death toll from Ebola in west Africa was 10,251, with one new case on Friday in Liberia breaking the country’s 42-day countdown to Ebola-free status. “We have learned a lot, but it does not mean anything if you do not have the political will to change,” said MSF operations director Brice de le Vingne. He fears a similar outbreak in another country with weak health systems could result in the same inaction. The report recalls the “indescribable horror” the charity faced when Ebola first struck last March. It had to turn away patients because it could not cope and no other organisations were on the frontline. It says efforts to contain the spread were thwarted by “political blockages”. The Guinean government complained MSF was spreading panic to help raise funds, for example. The Sierra Leone ministry of health refused to share data in the early outbreak and instructed the WHO to report only lab-confirmed deaths, thereby excluding the “probable” and “suspect” cases that could not be tested because of the lack of testing facilities. MSF set up a hospital in Kailahan, but the hospital in neighbouring Kenema was not sharing information and by the time it did, the disease had “mushroomed”. By contrast, it said, the Liberian authorities were transparent about the spread of cases from the outset. “This contributed to an epidemic of fear”, which had the positive effect of making the public quickly grasp the importance of isolation and safe burial, says De le Vingne.
De le Vingne also blamed the change in direction of many of the world’s charities for exacerbating the problem, adding that too often MSF is the first to respond to emergencies around the world. “Many NGOs have taken the path of lobbying and advocacy, which is a good thing, but they have abandoned emergencies. Oxfam 10 years ago had a huge water and sanitation capacity. That’s not the case now,” he said. The report says 2014 was a very demanding year in which MSF was stretched way beyond its limits. It only had 40 experts in infectious diseases to call upon, but because of WHO’s inaction, MSF was left to set up and run operations, as well as train 1,300 international staff and 5,000 local staff. “The flexibility and agility for a fast, hands-on emergency response still does not sufficiently exist in the global health and aid systems,” says Joanne Liu, president of MSF. “Lessons that should have been learned in the mass cholera epidemic in Haiti four years ago were not,” she added. MSF said restoring healthcare systems in the region will not be enough. Systems must be put in place involving labs and effective emergency responses in each of the countries at risk of future outbreaks. The knowledge of the world’s health communities has been shared, but it risks being useless if not immediately deployed the next time. “Political will is crucial to put this knowledge into practice,” MSF said. The charity called for a global strategy to help push the need for emergency aid up the agenda to create world-readiness for the next public health crisis. On Monday, the head of the UN Ebola mission, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, told the BBC the epidemic would be over by August. He admitted that when the virus first struck “there was probably a lack of knowledge and there was a certain degree of arrogance”, but he said he believed lessons were being learned.

2015-03-23T07:00:02Z,global-development,Global development,World Social Forum can inspire activists to unite against the global power grab | Adriano Campolina,"There’s no snow, fewer celebrities, and a lot less glitz, but the World Social Forum’s 10th global meeting, which opens in Tunis on 24 March, is the critics’ answer to the Davos World Economic Forum. Here in Tunis, I’m meeting people who have come together from around the world to consolidate efforts to reverse the global rush to oligarchic rule and environmental catastrophe. I have been part of the World Social Forum since it began in my native Brazil in 2001. When we started, global movements were energised by mass public actions that focused global attention on how the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and other institutions were creating a global economy that concentrated wealth and power in the hands of a small, privileged class. We’ve won some victories over the past 15 years, including several over big institutions. In 2003, there was the defeat of the WTO’s Doha round, from which the organisation has never recovered. There was also the defeat of the Free Trade Area of the Americas; the IMF and World Bank’s disavowal of harsh economic austerity programmes; the important policy changes won on equality, such as the new land laws in Bolivia or Brazil’s Zero Hunger and poverty eradication programmes. But we have not yet reversed the most dangerous trends. And now the big picture – an entrenched political and economic elite willing to manipulate laws to prevent us from challenging them, and a society hurtling toward climate catastrophe in the absence of global leadership willing to face the facts – is too plain to ignore. For the second time in a row, the World Social Forum will gather in Tunisia, the birthplace of the Arab spring. The courage it took to stand up to regimes that were so secure in their isolation from the people continues to inspire, despite the powerful backlash in some places. We know we’re challenging the most powerful interests in the world, but we also know that the persistence of those dedicated to openness and democracy can create permanent change. Following the appalling attacks in Tunis last week, we have seen the courage of ordinary people once again taking to the streets to denounce violence, insist on human rights, and continue to demand a better world of justice, freedom and peaceful coexistence. In the past couple of years, international civil society organisations like ActionAid, and our counterparts at national and local levels, have seen the spaces we use to defend human rights, economic justice, and democratic process come under sustained attack in country after country. Just last month, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, activists reacting to a brazen move to indefinitely postpone presidential elections were confronted with a government willing to shut down the entire country’s internet and phone services to prevent groups from organising. In a growing number of countries, such manoeuvres have been institutionalised as full-time bans on social media outlets. But they can’t stop people from learning about successful global movements, nor about the critiques of the status quo that point to alternative economic and social futures. Whatever the restrictions, people are braving them – as well as braving, too often, violent responses – to demand more enlightened policies. In Africa, many countries are constantly imposing new restrictions on what civil society groups can do and say, and using extrajudicial intimidation and infiltration to hobble any efforts to hold authorities accountable. And it happens in rich countries, too: infiltration and surveillance against groups – most of them far from revolutionary – supporting justice and human rights are widespread. The Canadian government last year said that aid groups can relieve poverty, but violate their charters if they talk about preventing poverty. The resolve of people pushed too far, and the democratisation of communications, has put the people on a collision course with those benefiting from the illicit hoarding of wealth and power. A web of obscure laws and complex financial connections, maintained by armies of accountants and attorneys, has wound its grip around those not among the favoured few. The siphoning of money away from people and governments and into the pockets of super-wealthy corporations and individuals has reached proportions that few of us can fathom. The system, in the shape of its most successful exploiters, is consuming itself while marshalling its forces to silence those who sound the alarm. That’s why, as the World Social Forum begins, ActionAid has issued a joint call with the Association for Women’s Rights in Development, Greenpeace, Civicus and Oxfam to tackle the damaging power of the 1%. That’s why, at this year’s meeting, there is a stronger sense than ever that what once were viewed as different causes are now seen by frontline activists as one common cause. Global efforts to end poverty and marginalisation, advance women’s rights, defend the environment, protect human rights, and promote fair and dignified employment are all being undermined as a consequence of the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few. The clampdown on civil society is precisely because it represents a challenge to the nexus of money and power. Activists at the World Social Forum are clear that the different issues that have brought us into activism – tax dodging or land grabbing, social justice or climate justice, economic rights or civil rights – are all part of a common struggle for a world in which everyone matters and in which the power of ordinary people can challenge the people with power. That’s why the World Social Forum is so urgent, so necessary. A great example of the many inspirational organisations attending the World Social Forum is Fe-Male, a group that brings women and men together around the issue of women’s human rights, and which started the first feminist radio programme broadcast live in Lebanon, Sharika wa Laken. They are joined by groups from South Asia pressing for the rights of oppressed castes, and by Latin American movements for the rights of indigenous people. Coming together provides opportunities to gain strength from the success, struggles and solidarity of others. In Tunis we are coming together to share, to learn, and to strategise. Repression normally happens at the national or local level, but when it does, we must become an international force that rallies people from every part of the globe to stand up. Our political space is valuable real estate; at the World Social Forum we’ll be deciding how we can protect it. If we don’t stop the global power grab now, we may not get another chance.

2015-03-22T22:30:03Z,global-development,Global development,World's first academy for humanitarian relief to be launched,"The world’s first academy for humanitarian relief is to be launched, aimed at training 100,000 aid workers from over 50 countries in organising rapid responses to disasters and emergencies. The Humanitarian Leadership Academy, launching on Monday, is a response to the growing number of humanitarian crises around the world, driven by climate change and conflict, combined with a severe and worsening shortage of people with the skills necessary to coordinate the large-scale response required in the critical first days to prevent mass casualties. The HLA is being set up by a global consortium of aid organisations with initial £20m funding from the UK Department for International Development, out of a target of £50m. The Save the Children charity has paid the startup costing and is hosting the academy’s hub in London. Further centres will open in Kenya and the Philippines later this year, and by 2020 the plan is to have ten training centres around the world, which would offer both classroom and virtual training for the surrounding regions, in mobilising the rapid response in resources and manpower needed in the wake of a disaster. Jan Egeland, a former UN head of humanitarian affairs and emergency relief, will be the academy’s first chairman. He said the initiative “may revolutionise the entire humanitarian sector”. “Investment in a new and better trained generation of humanitarian workers closer to where we find the greatest needs will bring development and sustainability to many of the world’s most fragile communities,” Egeland, the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said. Last year witnessed a record number of severe global humanitarian emergencies and the highest number of refugees the world has seen since the second world war. 50 million people were forced to flee their countries. Justin Forsyth, chief executive of Save the Children, said: “If we are to save more lives in some of the toughest places in the world we need to train and support local people themselves to become the humanitarian workers and volunteers of the future. The academy will do this by bringing together an extraordinary and unique coalition of actors to train and share best practice, transforming the humanitarian system.” The idea behind the establishment of ten national and regional centres around the world is that each should be able to tailor responses to crises in terms of local conditions and local culture. Aid experts have said that previous attempts to increase local and regional capacity to react to large-scale emergencies have foundered because they were seen as impositions of practices developed far away. The plan is for each centre to provide a common pool of knowledge, the latest technology and examples of best practice, as well as solid career structures for humanitarian workers, with internationally recognised certification for successive levels of achievement, recorded in ‘humanitarian passports’. The end result should be to expand the pool of people available in every region to manage the humanitarian response in the first 72 hours of an emergency. “This is potentially one of the most transformational projects I have been involved in,” said Gareth Owen, Save the Children’s director of emergencies, who has been working on the academy project since 2007. “It is based on the recognition that many studies of humanitarian disasters and emergencies point to leadership and decision-making as the critical factor. Really by now we should have a global capacity that we can draw on that is far greater and more diverse. We haven’t invested enough in people on the ground.” Owen said that climate change was adding to the relentless annual toll of humanitarian crises: “We used to have a big natural disaster about once a decade and that has come down to one every two or three years.” Global funding for emergency relief has largely stagnated. Owen said the $20bn (£13bn) spending on the response to humanitarian emergencies is a third of the amount the world spends on yoghurt, for example, and that there is no comparison with the $1.5tn spent on arms. “The Humanitarian Leadership Academy will help create a faster and more effective disaster response system by empowering local people in the most vulnerable countries to be the first responders after a disaster strikes,” Justine Greening, the secretary of state for international development, said. “The high quality training and expertise delivered by this academy will mean humanitarian responses not only provide immediate, life-saving relief, but also help build a more secure and resilient world.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/22/humanitarian-leadership-academy-aid-workers-disasters-emergencies,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/22/humanitarian-leadership-academy-aid-workers-disasters-emergencies
2015-03-22T09:00:06Z,global-development,Global development,Water pans offer lifeline to female farmers in Kenya | Moraa Obiria,"It’s mid-morning and the sun is blazing. It is so hot that germinating seeds struggle to grow. In Moi Ndabi, about 44km (27 miles) south of Kenya’s Lake Naivasha in Nakuru County, the vegetation dotted sparingly across the village has turned yellow. More than 100 people have lined up at the Moi Ndabi borehole to wait their turn to fetch water sold at five Kenyan shillings ($0.05) per 20-litre jerry can. But about 12km away from the water point in this region of the Rift Valley two greenhouses of different sizes stand adjacent to the homestead of Zainabu Malicha. By the end of March, she hopes to have pocketed at least 1.2m shillings ($13,100) from the sale of the tomatoes she grows there. For the widow who is now solely responsible for the care of her five children, this venture into agribusiness has transformed her life, which for much of the last two decades has been dominated by hunger, poverty and malnutrition. “Living in this semi-arid area [used to mean] no viable farming activity,” she says. Malicha’s business venture relies on a simple water-harvesting technology: a water pan. Constructing the pan – a circular container 20m across – involves digging a dam and covering it with a dam liner. The pan then stores the runoff water during the heavy rains. Once full, it can provide enough water for Malicha for up to four months until the next rainy season. “Before 2011, when the water pan was constructed, life was hard. Extremely hard. Maize would fail due to [the] scorching sun. Vegetables withered every so often. Going to sleep hungry was common,” Malicha says. Having made 600,000 shillings ($6,500) from produce grown in the smaller greenhouse, Malicha used the proceeds to set up the bigger one. “I have so much joy now because I can comfortably feed my children with [a] balanced diet and meet the education expenses,” she says. A few miles from her homestead, Florence Muthoni is also enjoying the fruits of the water reservoir. Having access to a greenhouse has enabled her to grow watermelons, a crop she once attempted and failed to grow on her hectare (2.5 acres) of land. “After two months, I harvest and make 135,000 shillings ($1,475). This is good enough to pay for my two sons on parallel programmes in local universities,” says the widow, who has lived in the area since 1992. On a separate half-hectare of land she has also grown vegetables, some bananas and sugarcane, made possible through using water pans. “I plan to buy a plot and then rear two Friesian cows. This could raise my profits, and when I finally become old, my children would take over,” she says. Having the water pan, Muthoni says, has emancipated her from hunger and “opened up her mind to hope for great things” not just for herself but for other women in the village. Muthoni and Malicha now lead a group of 286 women who form the Chemi Chemi ya Tumaini Jangwani Women Group (Springs of Hope in the Desert Women Group) as chair and secretary respectively. Even though the water pans led to solutions to the problems of food scarcity and related health issues, their construction was possible only with the assistance of an NGO. Muthoni says the NGO spent 20m shillings ($200,000) on setting up 50 water pans in the area for the women to irrigate their farms. The amount includes the 560,000 shillings used for their smaller greenhouses. “We hear the government has loans for women, but how to get them is what we do not know. If it wasn’t for the NGO, we could still be suffering in hunger,” says Muthoni. “We need people to reach out to us in the villages and give us a sense of direction, just like non-governmental organisations do.” The Kenya Institute of Economic Affairs report (2014), Public Spending in Agriculture in Kenya: Is It Beneficial to Small Scale Women Farmers? (pdf), notes the increasing importance of NGOs as a source of credit to farmers in the country. Although women are the backbone of the agricultural sector, the report showed that many of them had not benefited from agricultural credit. Worryingly, the lack of gender-disaggregated information on credit beneficiaries continues to hamper balanced distribution of available resources, it says. Despite the creation of government funds specifically for women, only a few have benefited from them. Women make up more than half of Kenya’s population of 44 million. Through community groups, women can access money from the Women Enterprise Fund, established in 2007, and the Uwezo Fund, launched in 2013. So far 707,435 women have received funding from the WEF while 274,857 have been trained in business management skills, according to statistics from the Ministry of Devolution and Planning.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/22/world-water-day-2015-pans-lifeline-female-farmers-kenya,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/22/world-water-day-2015-pans-lifeline-female-farmers-kenya
2015-03-22T07:00:04Z,global-development,Global development,Africa's first public-private water fund launched in Kenya,"In a first for Africa, a public-private water fund was launched in Kenya on Friday, bringing together businesses, utilities, conservation groups, government and farmers to fund upstream water conservation through activities such as watershed protection and reforestation. The Upper Tana-Nairobi Water Fund was launched by the Nature Conservancy, a US-based NGO, which has used the same model in 32 initiatives in Latin America. Its partners in Kenya include East African Breweries Ltd, Coca-Cola, Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company (NCWSC), and electricity provider KenGen. The 1,000-km Tana river, which flows from the Aberdare mountains north of Nairobi to the Indian Ocean, is Kenya’s longest, and supplies 95% of the water used by the capital’s estimated 3.4 million residents. Since the 1970s, forests and wetlands in the Tana river basin have been converted to agricultural land. Where water would once have been stored in the soil and filtered, it is now running straight into the rivers, increasing sedimentary deposits. These deposits clog up reservoirs and push up the cost of water treatment. An estimated 60% of Nairobi’s residents do not have a secure water supply, and demand has grown by 350% since 2004, according to NCWSC. The new fund will be managed by a trust, which seeks to raise $15m (£10m) to invest in soil and water conservation activities in the Upper Tana watershed. Landowners and NGOs will work upstream to protect the watershed and “harness nature’s ability to capture, filter, store and deliver clean and reliable water”, according to the Upper-Tana Nairobi Water Fund business case report. The report said a $10m investment will return $21.5m in economic benefits over 30 years, including gains for farmers, Nairobi’s water and sewerage company, and KenGen. “It’s good economic science and the best we could do,” said Colin Apse, senior freshwater conservation adviser at the Nature Conservancy. He added that the Zambian capital Lusaka was preparing to launch a similar scheme, with other cities in sub-Saharan Africa also expected to roll out water funds in the future. The project’s partners have already raised nearly $2m, which has been used to launch the initiative, carry out a business case study, and fund conservation activities in an initial two-year pilot phase. Water security is a priority issue in the sustainable development goals (SDGs), which will be finalised this September. About 748 million people do not have access to an improved source of safe drinking water, according to the UN, and 40% of these live in sub-Saharan Africa. The Nature Conservancy, whose list of corporate partners includes BHP Billiton, Boeing, BP, Coca-Cola, Rio Tinto and Shell, says it aims to alleviate the pressures of climate change, pollution, population growth and deforestation on the world’s clean water supplies. However, there has been some criticism of its funds in Latin America. Jaime Ignacio Veléz Upegui, a professor at Medellín’s National University of Colombia, where the Nature Conservancy established one of its first water funds, said such schemes were too speculative, arguing that the environment should not become a business chain. “Despite investing in water, they do not directly result in water,” he told the US environmental publication Ensia. He said such schemes could result in the public’s environmental sensibilities being harnessed to build a system for business, leaving people feeling cheated and less inclined to participate in future. Backers of the new fund believe it will save money for businesses and consumers. Water in the Upper Tana basin is becoming increasingly turbid, the land is being eroded and productivity is declining. Already, $500,000 has been spent by the fund on pilot activities, such as terracing to redirect run-off water, installing drip irrigation systems, and planting to stabilise the soil. Water from the Tana also generates 50% of Kenya’s hydropower, which accounts for 43% of all power produced in-country, according to KenGen, which is on the steering committee of the new fund. KenGen expects the fund’s activities to result in savings of $6m in avoided interruption and increased water yield. “The benefit is huge to us,” said Joshua Were, an environment manager at KenGen. “It comes with increased rate yield to avoid interruptions in our operations, which ultimately means better services … and lower bills for our customers.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/22/world-water-day-kenya-upper-tana-nairobi-public-private-water-fund,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/22/world-water-day-kenya-upper-tana-nairobi-public-private-water-fund
2015-03-21T00:01:07Z,global-development,Global development,British MPs urge DfID to think long-term rather than lavish aid money,"The UK is spending too much on humanitarian aid and funding big international agencies when it should be concentrating on its own long-term development programmes in sub-Saharan Africa, an influential group of MPs has warned. In its latest annual report on the Department for International Development (DfID), the International Development Committee (IDC) says the government’s focus on responding to disasters and emergencies is allowing other wealthy countries to shirk their responsibilities. The committee also notes that the push to spend 0.7% of the UK’s gross national income on overseas aid has given DfID a series of financial headaches. Last year, to help it meet the four-decade-old UN target of spending 0.7% of gross national income on official development assistance (ODA), DfID’s budget rose by about a third to £11.46bn. Although the committee expressed pride in achieving the 0.7% goal – which will now be enshrined in law – it said it had caused problems and skewed when, how and where DfID spends its budget, with more money now going to multilateral organisations such as the EU, the World Bank and the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The UK is now the world’s largest funder of multilaterals, spending £6.3bn on multilateral organisations in 2013, and providing 50% more multilateral ODA than any other country. “We are concerned that the scale of the increase in spending in the time of restrictions on administrative costs has led DfID to overuse multilaterals and large suppliers at the expense of smaller specialists,” said the committee’s chair, Sir Malcolm Bruce. The IDC said that funding multilaterals was attractive to DfID as it allowed the department to use promissory notes, which count as ODA expenditure but do not have to be paid for until the cash is drawn down – often years later. The rise in multilateral funding, the IDC noted, had been accompanied by a relative decline in spending on programmes in sub-Saharan Africa and on some key millennium development goal targets. It urged DfID to spend more on bilateral programmes, on sub-Saharan Africa, and to “significantly increase spending on reproductive health”. The committee expressed dissatisfaction over the fact that DfID now provides 13% of all the money spent on humanitarian assistance by the 34 members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD): “This is too much and enables other OECD donors to fail to meet their obligations.” One NGO, Water Aid, told the committee that DfID spent more on addressing health crises than preventing them through basic sanitation, while two other NGO networks said the increase in humanitarian spending had coincided with a reduction in non-emergency spending on governance and security. DfID, however, prides itself on its reputation for providing humanitarian aid, on which it spent £891m in 2013-14. The department’s permanent secretary, Mark Lowcock, told the committee: “It is absolutely the case that the secretary of state feels quite strongly that this is something that the department is good at, the needs are very acute and it resonates with the public, so it is an important thing for the UK to contribute to.” Others witnesses disagreed, saying the large increase in humanitarian expenditure “that gets government ‘a rosy glow’ reacting to the news spotlight might be coming at the expense of longer-term development work needed”. In response, the committee suggests DfID introduce a ceiling on its humanitarian assistance expenditure to ensure that long-term development does not suffer as a result. Mary Creagh, the shadow secretary of state for international development, said the report showed that the coalition government was failing to help many of those most in need. “70% of the world’s poor are women, yet DfID under the Tories and Lib Dems has spent less on women’s reproductive health despite overall budget increases,” she said. “Labour will ensure more UK taxpayers aid money goes to the poorest people in the world’s poorest countries and ensure the needs of women, children and other excluded groups are not forgotten.” DfID defended its funding decisions, arguing that the proportion of UK development aid spent as multilateral aid had stayed roughly the same, while the proportion of bilateral aid spent in Africa had not changed over the past two years. “We fund multilaterals when they are the best partners to work with us to deliver our objectives, whether that be in a humanitarian crisis, natural disaster or on a specific topic such as migration and refugees,” said a spokeswoman. “We are living in a world that is facing unprecedented humanitarian pressures. The UK is proud to be a world leader in responding to emergencies.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/21/british-mps-dfid-aid-spending-multilateral-bilateral,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/21/british-mps-dfid-aid-spending-multilateral-bilateral
2015-03-20T13:35:12Z,global-development,Global development,Vanuatu won't be the last poor country devastated by climate change inaction | Mark Goldring,"As the world keeps warming, it is expected that both the speed of winds and the amount of rainfall associated with tropical cyclones will increase. And as sea levels rise, storm surges and other coastal flooding will only get worse. For Vanuatu and other Pacific Island nations, cyclone Pam has been the worst-case scenario: in Port Vila, Vanuatu’s capital, 90% of the housing has been badly damaged; kids have nowhere to go to school, and the town’s hospital was left with no power. In the country’s outer islands, where most people live, about a quarter of a million people had little or no protection from the cyclone’s 160mph winds. And if people cannot get clean water and at least temporary toilets very soon, a “second emergency” could follow from water-borne diseases. That is why the world’s focus must be on meeting these urgent needs before any more lives are lost.
At Oxfam, we are already providing trucks of drinking water to people living in the evacuation centres. We are also distributing kits around the capital that include items designed to maintain high levels of hygiene. We have been carrying out assessments on some of the outlying islands and are working with local organisations to support food supplies amid fears that stocks will run out in two weeks. No other city in the world is as exposed to disasters as Port Vila – an unenviable distinction recently recorded by the Natural Hazards Risk Atlas. What makes this all the more tragic is that Vanuatu was doing all the right things to prepare for disasters. Its people, government and all the local organisations with which Oxfam works knew only too well how vulnerable Vanuatu was to typhoons, earthquakes and tsunamis. These efforts were not wasted – setting up cyclone evacuation shelters in advance, for example, saved lives – but they could never have equipped this small country for something as big as cyclone Pam. Last year, I saw in the Philippines that nothing could have prepared the people there for the power of typhoon Haiyan. Even the US struggled to cope with superstorm Sandy, which struck New York, New Jersey and other states in 2012. So who or what is to blame? According to Vanuatu’s president, Baldwin Lonsdale, climate change has contributed to “the level of sea rise … the cyclone season, the warm, the rain, all this is affected”. Whether we will see a greater number of cyclones as a result of climate change is uncertain, but scientists say one thing is clear: those that we do see are likely to be stronger and more destructive. This is the threat that the people of Vanuatu and millions of people in coastal or low-lying areas will increasingly face. Millions more in other parts of the world will encounter drought, increased flooding and other hazards. In a 2013 report, the Met Office and Overseas Development Institute said “climate change and exposure to ‘natural’ disasters threaten to derail international efforts to eradicate poverty by 2030”. According to the same study, by 2030 “up to 325 million extremely poor people will be living in the 49 most hazard-prone countries” in the world. The world’s poorest people are being hit harder and harder by disasters. It was so poignant that, as cyclone Pam was tearing across Vanuatu, the world’s governments were gathering in Sendai, Japan, to plot a supposedly bold course to reduce the risk of future disasters. Back in 2005, in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami, the international community agreed a 10-year plan – the Hyogo Framework – to make the world safer from natural hazards like typhoons.
But a decade on, all the measures to reduce the risk of disasters are being overwhelmed by the rising tide of calamities the world faces. What was needed was a step change in response. That’s why I’ve been arguing for a new framework with ambitious, measurable targets to reduce the risks for vulnerable people, a target that really ensures local authorities and NGOs have the funding, technical capacity and decision-making power to make meaningful changes where they are most desperately needed. But rather than that, the world’s governments have agreed only minimal improvements on the Hyogo Framework. The Sendai Framework will have its value, but it would have had far more worth if it had gone further, and if wealthy countries had offered far more financial and technical support to the countries struggling to recover from disasters. Back in 2009, developed countries promised to mobilise $100bn a year by 2020 to help developing countries adapt to climate change and reduce their emissions. The UK’s record on contributing its fair share of that has been good. But global progress is slow, and uncertainty of finance for this purpose looms large over countries like Vanuatu. Cyclone Pam reminds us again that so much more than money is needed. We must recognise that poorer countries like Vanuatu – with the least responsibility for climate change – are already suffering the devastating consequences of inaction. Like every richer country, the UK must act on this stark fact more than ever before. Whoever finds themselves in government after 7 May must lead the way in tackling climate change at home and abroad: in the former, by committing to phase out coal emissions from the British economy by the early 2020s; in the latter, by standing strong on the need for new concrete commitments on climate finance at the UN conference on climate in Paris this December. My heart goes out to those whose lives have been devastated in the Pacific. But in my head I know the challenge of climate-driven poverty, inequality and disasters is likely to get dramatically worse.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/20/sendai-climate-change-inaction-poor-countries-vanuatu-cyclone-pam,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/20/sendai-climate-change-inaction-poor-countries-vanuatu-cyclone-pam
2015-03-20T13:10:48Z,global-development,Global development,Global weapons trade targets Africa as imports to Algeria and Morocco soar | Mark Anderson and Achilleas Galatsidas,"The global arms trade has grown by 16% over the past decade, with military hardware including tanks, missiles and artillery flowing to African countries faster than to any other region, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). African governments and rebel groups imported 45% more weapons in 2014 than in 2005, Sipri reported in its latest arms transfers database. Weapons sales to the Asia and Oceania region grew by 37% over the same period, while the Middle East bought 25% more weapons. Sipri’s data, which accounts for purchases of military hardware including tanks, aircraft, radar, artillery, rockets, missiles and ships, is measured over five-year periods because weapons orders can fluctuate significantly from year to year. Violence and destruction associated with rising arms imports into Africa costs the continent an estimated $18bn (£12.1bn) a year as infrastructure is destroyed, businesses are closed and children are kept out of school, said Martin Butcher, arms policy adviser at Oxfam. “Burundi spends an average of $5 a year on healthcare for each citizen, but the cost of treating a victim of armed violence in Burundi averages $165 a year,” Butcher explained.
The leading African importers of military hardware were Algeria, Morocco and Sudan. Many countries used soaring oil revenues to buy weapons, but a sharp drop in the price of oil has cast doubts on their ability to continue heightened defence spending. Driving arms purchases in the continent is Algeria’s long-standing rivalry with Morocco and Uganda’s involvement in South Sudan’s civil war, according to Pieter Wezeman, senior researcher at Sipri. Cameroon and Nigeria showed “urgent demand” for weapons in their fight against Islamist rebel group Boko Haram, Sipri said. The involvement of Uganda, Ghana and Kenya in military operations mandated by the African Union and the UN also contributed to a rise in arms imports. “Competitive acquisition plays some role in [rising arms sales to Africa], but concerns over domestic insurgencies are becoming increasingly important in shaping what the military buys,” said Malcolm Chalmers, director of UK defence policy at the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies. But Sipri is not able to include imports of small arms – widely used in civil wars such as those in South Sudan, Central African Republic and Somalia – in its data. “We do recognise the importance of small arms imports, especially in a region like Africa, where major arms are not so widely available. Alas, we cannot record them in the way we would like to,” Wezeman said, noting the limited transparency of military spending as another impediment to the accuracy of Sipri’s data. Russia sold the most arms to African countries, mainly to Algeria, while France’s sales to Morocco made it the second-largest arms dealer to the continent.
Worldwide, the biggest arms exporters were the US and Russia, which accounted for more than half of all weapons sales between 2010 and 2014, the data showed. China’s arms sales have soared by 143% since 2005, making it the world’s third largest arms dealer. In contrast, Europe’s arms exports fell by 16%. Wezeman played down the link between rising African arms imports and China’s soaring arms exports. “Chinese arms exports are still very much going to a small number of states – mainly Pakistan followed by [Burma] and Bangladesh,” he said. The biggest importers of US arms were South Korea, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Australia. Russia sent the bulk of its arms shipments to India, China and Algeria. India imported the most arms between 2010 and 2014, followed by Saudi Arabia, China, the UAE and Pakistan. These five countries accounted for 33% of all arms imports over the period, Sipri said. Sipri takes the production costs of a set of commonly used weapons and analyses arms deals to calculate the “transfer of military capability”, Wezeman said. “We do not look at the financial value that has been agreed between the recipient and the supplier … because quite often weapons are transferred for no price at all.” The institute estimated the value of the world’s arms trade in 2007 at more than $50bn, with the US selling $12.8bn of weapons, making it the leading global exporter. Russia ranked second, with $7.4bn in arms sales, followed by France with $6.2bn, Israel with $4.4bn and the UK with $4.1bn. “The US has long seen arms exports as a major foreign policy and security tool, but in recent years exports are increasingly needed to help the US arms industry maintain production levels at a time of decreasing US military expenditure,” said Aude Fleurant, director of Sipri’s arms and military expenditure programme.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2015/mar/20/africa-arms-imports-algeria-morocco-global-weapons-trade,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/datablog/2015/mar/20/africa-arms-imports-algeria-morocco-global-weapons-trade
2015-03-20T07:00:06Z,global-development,Global development,Are there too many sustainable development goals? | Carla Kweifio-Okai,"If you were shaping a set of goals to end some of the biggest global problems, how many would be on your list? Can the world have too many goals and targets? We asked development students for their thoughts on the proposed 17 goals and 169 targets that form the sustainable development goals (SDGs) – the new agenda set to replace the millennium development goals (MDGs) in September. The response from students on the number of goals varied – some argued that the set of goals were overly-bureaucratic, while others said a complex problem warranted a complex set of solutions. Below are four of our favourite replies. Goals must recognise that each country is different The reason that the sustainable development goals are so long is that they are trying to be all things to all people. The UN wants the SDGs to be universally applicable. Instead, they should contain some recognition that different countries have different needs and capabilities. This is especially important in the area of environmental protection. Here, the roles of developed and developing countries are very different. Can we really expect a country with citizens in extreme poverty to spend money on reducing overfishing? Separate lists of goals for low-income, middle-income and high-income countries would be shorter and less unwieldy.
Goals to protect the environment conflict with goals to end poverty and promote industrialisation. For example, target 12c concerns the removal of fossil fuel subsidies. This helps the environment in the long term but hurts the poor in the short term. Rich countries can protect the environment without increasing poverty by investing in greener energy. The SDGs should take into account this dynamic, rather than treating rich and poor countries as equals. One respect in which the MDGs failed was that they were seen as only applicable to developing countries. They did not consider the role of developed countries to extend beyond funding. Yet developed countries have huge ability to promote or limit development in areas such as trade or tax policy. By explicitly aiming goals at developed countries, the SDGs could solve this problem. Shreya Nanda, St Catharine’s College, University of Cambridge, UK The devil is in the detail Specific goals are extremely effective: while committing to “end poverty” is valuable, committing to “halve the number of people living on less than $1 a day by 2015” is operational. In this sense, the MDGs revolutionised development by taking the field from committing to values to committing to results. However, the MDGs also presented a false sense of simplicity by leaving out critical aspects of development, overlooking harmful loopholes, and deviating from more ambitious agreements. While setting specific, realistic, and time-bound goals offers a way to progress forward, the format of a single goal-set encompassing all of development is not the most effective. Instead, bodies like the general assembly should agree to big-picture policy objectives (like “end poverty”) and let the UN expert entities develop the goals to implement the plan. This is similar to what is already being done through the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) with the Aichi biodiversity targets. Rather than cram as much biodiversity into the SDGs as possible (and then worry if there are too many targets), why not agree that biodiversity is important and let the CBD (with its own oversight bodies and technical experts) or the United Nations Environment Programme lay out the best ways to protect it? While it would be great to have an all-encompassing development agenda that can be still be counted on the fingers of one hand, that’s simply not the way the world works. Specific goals should have a place in development, but not as another round of “all-encompassing” development goals. Ryan Brenner, College of Law, Michigan State University, US Sometimes, less is more To pave the way for continued development and economic growth for the world’s poorer countries, a narrower set of measurable development targets is needed. With fewer goals – following the model of the eight original millennium development goals – a specific vision can be presented to the world, one that will improve the lives of hundreds of millions of people. That way, it’d be harder for governments to ignore a massive global effort, given the relative modesty of the number of objectives. Although the newer sustainable development goals offer the opportunity of even greater advancement with 17 goals, ambition must be balanced with viability. Too many objectives will scare away bureaucratic policymakers and will doom the project to failure. Fewer development goals make it more likely for governments to craft political policies that will put their country on the pathway of progress, along with providing international aid groups with a road map to focus their efforts. Ethiopia has been an MDG success story: spurred by rapid economic growth and substantial support from the UN, the country is “on track” or “likely to be on track” on all eight goals, according to the World Bank. The strength of the original MDGs came from their prioritisation of a small number of clear goals. With 17 goals, the SDGs run a great risk of becoming another quixotic UN project. The world must be given a proper plan to follow if it is to succeed in its moral quest. Sometimes, less is more. Joseph Zeballos, Florida State University, US Development is complex, so development goals should be too The number of proposed SDGs is excessive, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. The issues in development and environmental management are so complex and interlinked that they could not possibly be resolved in eight simple goals as the MDGs attempted to do. Those goals were just “themes” which really needed to be broken down further, and I believe the SDGs will make a better effort to do that. It’s important for international policymakers to have more streamlined targets to follow, otherwise they run the risk of just “tick-boxing vague objectives” without really considering their long-term impact. For example with the MDGs, many countries were able to achieve universal primary education for children, but the quality of teaching, curriculum and post-primary education were not necessarily up to standard. The pressure to meet one target on education simplified the problem and neglected other secondary development indicators. Poverty is highly complex, therefore its solutions shouldn’t be overly simple. By having more tailored goals, related indicators can be addressed earlier in decision-making rather than later and we can avoid a generalised perception of the world’s most vulnerable people. Takyiwa Danso, University of East Anglia, UK Do you think there are too many goals, or does it even matter?

2015-03-19T16:40:47Z,global-development,Global development,Women's rights activists alarmed by UK unease over development targets,"Activists have accused the British government of undermining negotiations on a set of global goals that will shape the development agenda for the next 15 years, sparking fears that crucial commitments for women could be lost. The UK is understood to be unhappy with some of the targets contained in the proposed set of sustainable development goals (SDGs) and wants to reopen negotiations. Women’s rights groups said on Thursday that renegotiating the targets at this stage could prompt renewed debate on the inclusion of targets on women’s reproductive rights, still a controversial area for some governments, and violence against women. It could also result in the loss of targets on equitable trade and climate change. Reopening the discussions could also threaten goal 16 to promote peaceful societies, something the African bloc of countries is keen to avoid. Sascha Gabizon, executive director of Women in Europe for a Common Future and co-facilitator of the Women’s Major Group, which represents the views of women in UN processes, said: “Women and girls have much to gain from strong development goals and targets for achieving gender equality. The UK’s push to reduce the scope of the SDGs could seriously undermine efforts to improve the lives of women and girls around the world.” The draft set of SDGs, formally presented to the UN general assembly in September last year, were the result of 18 months of discussions by an open working group (OWG) of 70 countries, drawing on global, national and regional consultations. It is by far the largest consultation process conducted by the UN. The OWG has proposed 17 goals and 169 targets. Some countries, including Britain and Japan, believe there are too many goals to be effective. But others maintain that the wide spectrum of goals reflect the complexities of sustainable development. EU countries appear broadly supportive of the 17 goals. However, the UK prime minister, David Cameron, said in September that he wanted no more than 12. The government reiterated this message last year in its statement to the environmental audit committee on the SDGs. The Department for International Development told the committee: “Aside from being long and unwieldy, many proposed targets are unworkable or unmeasurable. If adopted, it would struggle to inspire international action, drive meaningful accountability or implementation, and would be a burden on the governments of developed and developing countries alike.” The UK is not keen on a specific climate change goal, but would prefer environmental sustainability targets to be integrated across all goals. The government is also understood to be opposed to the specific goal on inequality. It has not stated which of the goals or targets it would want removed in order to reduce the number. The G77 group of developing countries, which represents 134 UN member states, is resisting attempts to reopen discussions on the goals that many of the countries helped draft during the OWG process. While it was generally accepted that there was little chance of reducing the number of goals after last September, it was believed that the targets would still be open for discussion over the coming months. However, a blog on the Huffington Post in February by Macharia Kamau, one of the co-chairs of the OWG and Kenyan ambassador to the UN, appeared to put paid to that idea, suggesting that the SDGs had already been locked down. It is understood that African countries are aligning themselves more to the G77 than their traditional donor countries in the global north. The readiness of China to invest in African countries with fewer strings attached than northern donors is believed to be a major draw for some of the continent’s leaders. China, along with Brazil and India, is becoming a dominant voice in the G77 group. Shannon Kowalski, director of advocacy and policy at the International Women’s Health Coalition and another co-facilitator of the Women’s Major Group, said although the proposed SDGs were not perfect, “this agenda can be truly transformative if governments commit to rights-based targets and a detailed monitoring system to track progress”. “The sustainable development goals are the strongest consensus we have in recognising women’s rights and addressing the root causes of gender inequality and poverty,” she added. Speaking about inequality, Mari-Claire Price, from Realising Sexual and Reproductive Justice (RESURJ), a global alliance of young feminists, added: “Inequality and poverty are indivisible. This is true across the world, including within the UK, where the government’s experimental and long impacting austerity measures continue to deepen already profound gaps between the poorest and the wealthiest of our society. For the UK government to speak of ‘leaving no-one behind’ in this agenda, then refuse to prioritise inequality and therefore people, is unjustifiable.” Member states will continue their negotiations on the goals next week. Focus will turn to the indicators by which the targets will be measured. It is understood 300 indicators have been drafted. The wording of the indicators is unlikely to escape controversy. Concern has already been raised over an indicator to measure a target to eliminate violence against women and girls. The indicators just focus on women of reproductive age, between 15 and 49. HelpAge US said this week that such an indicator will ensure violence against older women remains invisible. A DfID spokesman said: “The UK remains focused on developing a comprehensive and ambitious set of new goals that are both inspiring and workable. “The rights and equality of girls and women are absolutely critical in the fight against chronic poverty in the developing world. We are determined to achieve a strong and dedicated goal on gender equality.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/19/womens-rights-activists-uk-dissatisfaction-sustainable-development-goals-gender-equality,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/19/womens-rights-activists-uk-dissatisfaction-sustainable-development-goals-gender-equality
2015-03-19T14:17:36Z,global-development,Global development,"Eritrea blighted by 'ruthless repression' and human rights violations, says UN","The Eritrean government has been linked with “ruthless repression” and systemic human rights violations, including carrying out widespread detention and forcing citizens into indefinite military service, according to the UN’s first inquiry into human rights in the secretive country. Rights abuses perpetuated by Eritrea’s government, coupled with dismal economic prospects, are driving hundreds of Eritreans out of the country every day, according to an interim report by the UN’s commission of inquiry on human rights in Eritrea. “Most Eritreans have no hope for their future,” said Mike Smith, chairman of the commission, which was formed in June last year. “National service, whether in a military unit or in a civil assignment, is the only thing that from the age of 17 they can expect to spend their life doing – paid between less than $1 and a maximum of $2 a day.” Describing Eritrea’s culture of “pervasive state control”, Smith said a network of spies had been created that permeated the basic fabric of everyday life. “A man employed by national security might not know that his daughter is similarly employed,” he said, noting that extra-judicial executions, enforced disappearances and incommunicado detentions were commonplace. “Is it surprising that, faced with such challenges, Eritreans leave their country in their hundreds every day?” As of July last year, more than 320,000 Eritreans had fled the country, according to the UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). After Syrians, Eritreans are the second most common nationality to arrive on Italian shores. The UN commission’s interim report, released on Monday, is based on interviews with about 400 people, including government officials, in five different countries. It incorporates 140 written statements relating to human rights abuses in Eritrea. The commission expressed concern that Eritrea’s government had “so far not cooperated” with its investigation and did not respond to repeated requests to visit the country to carry out research. But the commission said that Eritrea was making some progress in improving human rights, noting that it had ratified the UN’s convention against torture and promised to reduce national service to 18 months. The commission will deliver its final report on Eritrea’s human rights situation in June. Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the interim report showed “that it is essential for Eritrea to remain on the Human Rights Council’s agenda for the foreseeable future”. In the past, HRW has urged the Eritrean government to release political prisoners, let independent monitors into the country, allow independent media and end indefinite national service. HRW said there is no indication of progress on any of these points. Eritrea has long been regarded as one of the world’s most secretive states, even drawing comparisons with North Korea. It was ranked at the bottom of the 180 countries assessed in Reporters Without Borders’ (RWB) 2015 press freedom index. “Eritrea systematically violates freedom of expression and information. It is Africa’s biggest prison for journalists, with at least 16 currently detained – some of them held incommunicado for years,” said RWB.
Eritrea’s president, Isaias Afewerki, who has been in power since de facto independence from Ethiopia in 1991, has for decades used the threat of an outbreak of war with Ethiopia as a means of keeping his people under tight authoritarian rule. In 1998, a brutal border war broke out between Eritrea and Ethiopia, killing an estimated 70,000 people on both sides. Despite agreeing to a new border under the 2000 Algiers agreement, which ended the conflict, Eritrea claims that Ethiopian forces continue to occupy positions in its territory. The ensuing military stalemate between the two sides has led Eritrea to adopt a “no war, no peace” position with Ethiopia, according to the commission. “It is an expression abusively used by the Eritrean authorities to disregard international human rights law as if Eritrea was in a legal limbo,” Smith said. Accusations that Eritrea was supporting the Somali Islamist group al-Shabaab led the UN security council to impose an arms embargo on the country in 2009. The UN also levied asset freezes and travel bans on some officials. Human rights activists are pushing for tighter sanctions against key figures in Eritrea’s government, saying they continue to commit crimes against humanity under the guise of protecting the country from Ethiopian aggression. “If the UN inquiry concludes there is a situation of crimes against humanity in Eritrea, which I very much hope it will do, then we can say the international community is duty bound to respond with actions commensurate to that of crimes against humanity,” said Daniel Mekonnen of the Eritrean Law Society, who added that he is hoping Eritrean leaders would be referred to the International Criminal Court. The Eritrean government responded to the UN’s inquiry by criticising its reporting methods. Tesfamicael Gerahtu, an Eritrean diplomat, said: “My delegation is dismayed at the protracted reliance on unreliable, unproven and sensational information and interactions. Preconceived ideas and conclusions on Eritrea have become rampant.” Leslie Lefkow, HRW’s Africa director, said: “The [Eritrean] government’s refusal to cooperate with human rights investigators is symbolic of its broader rejection of essential human rights reforms. Until that stance changes it is impossible to have meaningful impact on the domestic crisis and the massive exodus of Eritreans provoked by the dire human rights situation.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/19/eritrea-ruthless-repression-human-rights-violations-un-commission,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/19/eritrea-ruthless-repression-human-rights-violations-un-commission
2015-03-19T13:29:23Z,global-development,Global development,"Mali conflict: south is south, north is north, never the twain shall meet? |  Katarina Höije","The story of modern Mali may at first look like a battle for supremacy between the Bamako-based government in the south and rebel factions in the country’s north. Time and again, attempts to broker a peace deal have faltered. The latest talks, which ended inconclusively in Algiers last week, promise to perpetuate the pattern, with some rebel groups unimpressed by the government’s offer of locally elected leaders, greater representation of northern populations in national institutions, and the transfer of one-third of state budget revenues to local authorities from 2018. But while the apparent north-south divide makes it easy to classify the crisis as a centre-periphery conflict, the reality is more complex. Witness the large population of ethnic Songhai in Gao, the regional capital and the north’s biggest city, who do not necessarily agree with the ambitions of the mainly Tuareg population in the key northern town of Kidal, who want the northern territory they call Azawad recognised as an independent state. “While the rebels issue passports and collects taxes in the Republic of Azawad, this is still Malian territory,” says Hamadou Ag Kaoussane, the mayor of N’Tilit, a local community south of Gao. In recent months, the area has been the scene of clashes between rival armed Tuareg groups and their allies in northern Mali. According to Issa N’Diaye, a professor and political analyst at the University of Bamako, this regional infighting – like the wider struggle against Bamako – is motivated largely by economic considerations. “What much of the fighting in the north comes down to is territory and trade routes,” he says. As well as allowing the passage of pasta, canned sardines and tomatoes across the Sahel desert, trade routes provide a conduit for smuggled cigarettes, arms and drugs. Over the summer, fighting picked up in Tabankort, a town in the Tilemsi valley that is also an important trade route. “The power struggle between Kidal and Bamako is just as much about ideology as economic interests,” says N’Diaye. “The separatists’ claim for independence is also a way to control the traffic of goods.” For ordinary people, sympathy for rebel groups is fuelled by more basic considerations. Lack of access to services such as education and healthcare, and high unemployment – especially among young people – has spawned widespread discontent with authorities in the southern capital. Malnutrition and food insecurity threaten 1.5 million people, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, while more than 60,000 people are internally displaced. A further 135,000 Malians have fled to neighbouring countries. Since the national army was chased from Kidal last May, the population has come to rely on the armed groups for protection. The situation is similar in towns and villages across the north, where the army has retreated and rebels are in control. Discontent has also been fuelled by the failure of the government to deal with corruption and impunity, which has led many people to lose faith in their leaders. When the German research institute Friedrich Ebert Stiftung asked the population in the northern towns of Gao, Kidal and Menaka what they saw as the most important issues to tackle, corruption and injustice came out on top, even ahead of insecurity and the need for reconciliation. The population has grown tired of bad governance, according to Bruce Whitehouse, a cultural anthropologist at Lehigh University, Pennsylvania, who has monitored developments in Mali for the past 20 years. “Many Malians see their country’s present political and security crisis as an outgrowth of the state’s inability to uphold the basic rule of law and to protect the weak from the predations of the powerful,” he says. Profiting on the growing frustration, jihadist groups are already recruiting youth disappointed by the outcome of the Algiers agreement, according to security sources in the region. Two years after a French military intervention pushed the Islamist militants out of their urban strongholds, western and regional powers now worry they could return. Less likely to return, for now at least, are northerners living in camps in Burkina Faso and Niger, many of whom have affiliations to the armed groups. Some say they will only return to an independent Azawad, while others are waiting for the French military to leave the Coordination of Movements of Azawad, who many here support, to go back to war against Mali. Those who have returned have faced harassment and arbitrary arrests. “Even if you never carried any arms, if you’re innocent, they can still arrest you,” says Mista Ag Mohamed Ansari, a government service technician from Timbuktu who has spent three years in a refugee camp near the Malian border. “What happened back then, and is still happening, isn’t about insecurity, it’s about money. It’s the authorities profiting from the situation. This is the old Mali that we know. It’s back in control and it will stay the same under a corrupt system,” says Ansari. With the arrival of a UN peacekeeping mission in Mali, and Algeria providing neutral ground for talks, there was optimism that an agreement would finally be reached. However, after much debate, the coalition of armed groups said on Sunday that they could not accept the accord, arguing that it failed to address their demands for political and military autonomy. The collapse of talks leaves the prospect of a UN-brokered deal looking uncertain.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/19/mali-conflict-south-north-divide-algiers-peace-talks,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/19/mali-conflict-south-north-divide-algiers-peace-talks
2015-03-19T00:01:01Z,global-development,Global development,Women's rights activists use social media to get their message out,"Hashtag activism has helped to propel women’s rights to the forefront of political agendas, bringing attention to issues often under-reported by mainstream media, panellists have told an event at the UN in New York. Social media has helped women to share experiences of sexual violence, such as on the HarassMap platform, launched in Egypt, and has kept international attention focused on events that have slipped off the news agenda, such as the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, launched in 2014 after the abduction of more than 300 schoolgirls in Chibok, Nigeria. The hashtag has punctuated more than 4.5m tweets globally. But speakers at the event, held during the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) and organised by the OECD Development Centre and UN Women, conceded that the extent to which online engagement translates into policy change or practical action remains unclear.
Mollie Vandor, a product manager at Twitter, said conversations about feminism on Twitter had increased by 300% over the past three years. A performance by the singer Beyoncé in front of the word “feminist” underpinned a 64% increase in tweets containing that word. Patricia Arquette’s Oscar speech this year, in which she referenced pay inequalities, resulted in 320,000 tweets about #equalpay in two hours. “I definitely feel like there’s a moment happening right now, where we’re reaching a tipping point,” Vandor said. “It’s easy to dismiss these social media moments as just ‘talk’, but I really believe that the more we talk about what gender equality means and why it’s important, the more that conversation picks up volume and the harder it is to ignore.” Keshet Bachan, a gender equality activist and girls’ rights expert at Plan International, added that social media had opened up space for young feminists and activists to air their views “where once only the ‘specialist’ was allowed to speak”. “The exchange of views, the proliferation of opinions, and what I believe to be the consciousness raising process that takes place any time there is a feminist debate online is invaluable to the women’s movements,” she said. However, a paper published by the OECD Development Centre this month found that the extent to which social media had helped lever women’s voices into decision-making processes had been patchy and unpredictable, which, it noted, reflected the struggle that grassroots activists experience when trying to get their concerns heard in public life. Despite success in increasing the number of female MPs globally, women still occupy less than a quarter of parliamentary seats. Limited access to technology and language barriers mean many women are still unable to make use of social media, according to the OECD research. Some blogs and websites written by women have been censored by governments, and sexual harassment of activists in online discussions has also been witnessed. “There are some challenges, such as women’s access to the technology, their training to use it adequately, or the need for a strong women’s movement to link with on-the-ground efforts,” said Estelle Loiseau, gender progamme officer at the OECD Development Centre. “But we have to acknowledge that women’s voices are more visible than ever thanks to social media. There is a proliferation of blogs and online collaborative platforms that have arisen as another way to organise for gender activists,” she added. Online platforms were absent 20 years ago when leaders at the fourth world conference on women held in Beijing agreed to increase women’s representation in decision-making at all levels, and their access to the media and new technologies. The Beijing outcome document also called for steps to be taken to promote a balanced portrayal of women in the media.
The OECD launched its own Wikigender online platform seven years ago to encourage debate on gender equality and women’s rights. It now attracts an average of 40,000 unique monthly users. A French version of the site is due to launch later this year. The OECD research paper recommended that, as well as increasing women’s access to technology, women’s rights activists could benefit from training in ways to maximise the use of social media for campaigning. It said increasing the number of female leaders in the media could also help the success of online advocacy, and that social media campaigns needed to build on and collaborate with local women’s movements. Bachan said Plan’s activities on social media had been complemented with offline advocacy “ensuring girls meet and talk directly with their own governments” and capturing the moment on video or in a photo to hold decision-makers to account for their promises. “Our focus on including girls in the post-2015 agenda has translated into real accomplishments in terms of policy outcomes, and it has, I believe, also fostered a new generation of girl-advocates and empowered citizens,” she said.

2015-03-18T18:19:41Z,global-development,Global development,Sendai talks establish targets to reduce damage from natural disasters,"Governments at a UN conference in Japan set targets on Wednesday to substantially reduce deaths and economic losses from disasters, in the first of three major global agreements to advance development and tackle climate change this year. After a marathon negotiating session that ended just before midnight, the talks adopted the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, a 15-year plan that will replace the existing 10-year blueprint. “This new framework … opens a major new chapter in sustainable development, as it outlines clear targets and priorities for action which will lead to a substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods and health,” said Margareta Wahlström, head of the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR). Implementation “will be vital to the achievement of future agreements on sustainable development goals and climate later this year”, she added. Experts described the inclusion in the agreement of seven targets to measure progress on protecting people and assets as a leap forward. But some were disappointed that earlier proposals for percentage goals were rejected. Instead, the draft text includes targets to lower the global mortality rate from disasters between 2020 and 2030, compared with 2005 to 2015, and reduce the proportion of people affected. Another target is to reduce economic losses in relation to global GDP by 2030. In the decade covered by the expiring Hyogo Framework for Action, more than 700,000 people lost their lives, and more than 1.5 billion people were affected by disasters. Total economic losses topped $1.3tn. The new, non-binding agreement also includes targets to reduce damage to infrastructure and disruption to basic services, including health and education facilities, and to increase access to early warning systems and disaster risk information for the public. But some disaster experts said a lack of a firm commitments in the agreement to ramp up international aid for risk reduction would undermine poorer countries’ efforts to make progress on the goals. Only Japan put money on the table in Sendai, promising to provide $4bn in support over the next four years. “Rich nations have pushed making financial commitments to reduce disaster risk to a separate round of financing negotiations later in the year,” said Farah Kabir, country director of ActionAid Bangladesh, referring to a conference in Ethiopia in July. Without larger financial commitments, “the results for vulnerable communities in poor countries will be catastrophic”, he added. The devastation caused by cyclone Pam in the south Pacific island nation of Vanuatu at the start of the conference last week highlighted the need for greater efforts to protect those most at risk from extreme weather and other hazards. “Disasters, many of which are exacerbated by climate change and [are] increasing in frequency and intensity, significantly impede progress towards sustainable development,” the Sendai framework said. “It is urgent and critical to anticipate, plan for and reduce disaster risk in order to more effectively protect persons, communities and countries … and thus strengthen their resilience,” it added. Maggie Ibrahim, World Vision UK’s resilience manager, said the Sendai conference had spotlighted issues affecting disabled people, women and children in disasters. But the agreement would not equip them and other vulnerable people with the resources and tools to build skills so they can better prepare for disasters and avert crises, she said. “This new plan in its current text and form has only become weaker with every subsequent draft,” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/18/sendai-un-talks-targets-damage-natural-disasters,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/18/sendai-un-talks-targets-damage-natural-disasters
2015-03-18T17:16:42Z,global-development,Global development,EU bank's alleged lack of transparency 'like something out of a Le Carré novel',"The EU watchdog has accused the union’s bank of flouting its own transparency rules and hiding what it knows about allegations of tax avoidance by a Zambian mining firm largely owned by the Swiss commodity trader Glencore. On Tuesday, Emily O’Reilly, the European ombudsman, said she was not satisfied with the European Investment Bank’s claims that, despite an internal investigation, it had been unable to establish whether Mopani Copper Mines had avoided paying local tax running into tens of millions. Ten years ago, the EIB – which is owned by EU member states – loaned Mopani $50m (£30m) for the renovation of a smelter to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions. Six years later, after a leaked audit report suggested that Mopani had avoided paying tens of millions of dollars in local tax, the bank announced an investigation into the company. It also halted loans to Glencore because of “serious concerns” about its corporate governance. Glencore has always denied the allegations, which it maintains are based on “fundamental factual errors”. Mopani repaid the EIB loan in full in 2012. After the EIB refused to release the findings of its investigation, the charity Christian Aid referred the bank to the European ombudsman, who was granted access to the internal report. In her ruling, O’Reilly disputed the bank’s assertion that “it was not possible to comprehensively prove or disprove the allegations” made in the leaked audit report. She said: “The ombudsman considers that this statement does not adequately reflect the information contained in the [EIB] investigation report on this issue.” But O’Reilly said she could not reveal the information supporting her conclusion as doing so would mean disclosing details from a report that the EIB had chosen not to make public. However, she said she would let the EIB know the reasons for her findings and explain why she felt it had failed to fulfil its duty to publish a “meaningful summary” of the report. O’Reilly also found the bank’s refusal to release any “meaningful information” about the findings of the investigation “constituted an instance of maladministration”. She criticised the bank for breaking its own openness guidelines, saying: “In its handling of the request for access to the report in question, the EIB failed to meet its obligations under its own transparency policy.” Christian Aid said that while it welcomed the ombudsman’s ruling, it was staggered by the refusal of both the bank and Glencore to address the allegations directly. “This is the sort of thing you expect in a John Le Carré novel – not in reality,” said Rachel Baird, a Christian Aid spokeswoman. “What we see so far is that important evidence about alleged crimes by a major multinational company in Zambia has been repeatedly concealed by a bank which is wholly owned by the UK and other EU countries.” She added: “How are developing countries supposed to collect the tax billions that multinational companies owe them, when the European Union’s own bank engages in what appears to be a conspiracy of silence with a company accused of being one of the perpetrators?” While acknowledging that Glencore and Mopani had always denied the allegations of tax avoidance, Baird said their continued silence was not helping their case. “For Glencore to refute these allegations, it must reveal far more about its finances, in Zambia and around the world, than it has ever been willing to do,” she said. “For now, it is hard not to conclude that the company has something to hide.” The EIB said that although it was examining the ombudsman’s ruling and had noted its recommendations, it still had no plans to release the internal report. A spokesman added: “The EIB remains committed to achieving the highest possible levels of transparency while taking into account the necessity to strike the right balance between public interest concerning the bank’s investigative activities and the effectiveness of present and future investigations.” Glencore declined to comment, referring the Guardian to its previous statements on the matter.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/18/eu-bank-mopani-copper-mines-glencore-tax-avoidance-john-le-carre,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/18/eu-bank-mopani-copper-mines-glencore-tax-avoidance-john-le-carre
2015-03-18T12:30:07Z,global-development,Global development,Honduran women refuse to be silenced in face of yet another setback | Catalina Ruiz-Navarro,"Gladys Lanza, a Honduran feminist activist, was recently convicted of defamation for defending a woman who accused a Honduran government official of sexual harassment. The verdict is aimed at sending a powerful message to all defenders of women’s rights in the country: “If you don’t want to be prosecuted, stay silent.” In Honduras, violent deaths among women increased by 263.4% from 2005 to 2013. In 2009, the year of the coup d’état, femicide rose by 62%, while in 2013, a woman was murdered somewhere in the country every 15 hours. Between 2012 and 2013, 525 cases of harassment against women’s rights activists were documented. From 2009 to 2012, victims filed 82,547 accusations of domestic violence, 92% of which came from women. In 2013 alone, 2,851 charges of sexual violence were filed. More than 90% of cases end up with no conviction. The work of women’s rights activists is more important than ever. Lanza has been fighting injustice in Honduras for more than 30 years and is one of the most widely known and respected feminists. She is the legal representative of the Visitación Padilla movement, one of the most highly regarded women’s organisations in Honduras, members of which are commonly known as the “Chonas” (women of feminist ideals).
Lanza has served time in prison on bogus charges, her name has appeared on lists of political dissidents sought by a paramilitary squadron, and in 1991, a bomb destroyed her house. In 2010, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ordered the government to guarantee the protection of Lanza, which she says has not happened. In 2009, the Chonas took on the case of Lesbia Pacheco, human resources director of the Foundation for Development of Social, Urban and Rural Housing, who said she had been dismissed from her post and had faced harassment at work for rejecting the sexual advances of her supervisor, Juan Carlos Reyes, a public official. Reyes was charged with sexual harassment and workplace harassment. He was cleared of workplace harassment and the investigation into the sexual charges was stopped and filed, and effectively lost in the system. In 2011, the Chonas organised a sit-in demonstration during which they publicly denounced Reyes. Lanza, who took part in the protest, was charged with defamation and found guilty. Her sentence will be announced this month. Reyes now alleges that he is being discriminated against for being a man, an accusation that could add two more years to Lanza’s sentence. Yet it is evident that the entire case is about silencing the Honduran feminist movement, currently facing intense repression and harassment. The Honduran government is using its institutions to silence people who speak out and to perpetuate violence against women. The judicial system is one of the greatest obstacles to applying international instruments that would protect women, such as the Belém do Pará Convention (Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against Women) and the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women, which Honduras has not ratified. This year, Honduras will appear before the Universal Periodic Review of Human Rights, an obligation for all UN member countries. The Honduran government is determined to show some progress, since a favourable judgment will bring international aid aimed at alleviating the country’s precarious economic situation.
Yet the guilty verdict handed down to one of Honduras’s most respected human rights defenders sends a clear message about the repression and censorship faced by the entire human rights movement and the lack of freedom of speech. The government cannot hope to show progress in matters of human rights when it uses the power of its institutions to persecute defenders of women’s rights, who are undertaking the work that authorities refuse to do. “We women are leading the way on the road we must follow. We must refuse to give in or feel disappointment, this is our work and we must be convinced that we are doing the right thing; we will face obstacles because breaking chains is not easy, but we shall push forward,” Lanza said recently, expressing confidence in the strength of the Honduran feminist movement. She is convinced that the case against her is a testimony to the important political change that women have brought about in Honduras. Regardless of her sentence, Lanza knows feminists will carry her voice to all corners. Even though laws may convict women, legitimacy envelops their work, their courage, their resistance. For this reason, Lanza’s case is not a warning but a story of resilience and endurance. As she has said repeatedly: “Only the strength of united women can overcome the system.” Catalina Ruiz-Navarro works for Jass Associates in Mesoamerica",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/18/honduras-women-gladys-lanza-feminism-human-rights,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/18/honduras-women-gladys-lanza-feminism-human-rights
2015-03-18T10:30:02Z,global-development,Global development,Ghana's democracy is driving great progress in health and education | Alina Rocha Menocal,"Can democracy lead to development, or is it the other way around? The question remains far from settled, and the stakes have never been higher. Most countries today are formal democracies; two out of every three people live in such countries. Yet, there is growing disillusionment about the way democracy works, and concerns about whether it can deliver in terms of social and economic wellbeing. The phenomenal success of countries like China and other “Asian tigers” in lifting people out of poverty has also increased the appeal of authoritarian models of development. This is what makes the case of Ghana so compelling. Over the past two decades, it has experienced one of the world’s most successful transitions to multiparty democracy, and it is one of the few democracies emerging from the “third wave” of democratisation that has taken root. This is no small achievement, especially in a multi-ethnic setting. Since 1992, the country has held six elections, and power has been transferred from government to the opposition on two occasions. It has also experienced what several observers call an explosion of political voice, with the growth of an active and engaged civil society that includes professional associations, NGOs, unions, thinktanks and the media. At the same time, the provision of basic services, especially health and education, has improved dramatically. In 2003, Ghana became one of only a handful of countries not part of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to provide free and universal health coverage (under the National Health Insurance Scheme); and between 1998 and 2008 child immunisation rates soared from 19% to 70%. In 2007, it became the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to make pre-primary education compulsory, and the number of kindergartens doubled from 6,321 to 13,263 between 2001-02 and 2010-11. According to research from Afrobarometer, three out of four Ghanaians are satisfied with the quality of their country’s democracy and what it can deliver – an approval rating that would be the envy of many other countries. What has driven this progress in political voice, health and education in Ghana? Ghana’s progress is rooted, in part, in its history, and in particular in the way that state-society relations have evolved over time and the nature of political competition, as well as in the kind of socioeconomic transformation that the country has experienced since independence. Ghana has a long history of tolerance and accommodation. State formation processes and state-society relations based on the promotion of social cohesion and a unified “Ghanaian identity” emerged early on, and the notion of a social contract linking state and citizens has been an integral part of its state-and-nation-building project from the start. Leaders and both formal and informal institutions have fostered inclusion and incorporation in ways that transcend narrower ties based on kinship or ethnicity. And an expanding, more urban, and increasingly educated middle class has been actively engaged in political processes and is deeply committed to the country’s democratic values.
There is also evidence that different elements of Ghana’s newly established democracy have reinforced or even accelerated progress on health and education over the past 10 years. Elections are one such example: clientelism – the exchange of goods and services for political support – is not the decisive factor that determines who people will vote for. They want their members of parliament to deliver public and collective goods, and our research finds that the votes of Ghana’s poor are just as focused on the performance of elected representatives as those of the more educated urban middle classes. Citizens’ expectations about service delivery and the provision of health and education have made these sectors electoral battlegrounds, and have been crucial in lowering their costs and expanding access to them. Another example is Ghana’s oversight committees in parliament, which have the right to subpoena, supervise and monitor government decisions, particularly in health and education, thereby opening up policy formulation to the public and Ghana’s thriving thinktanks. Their hearings have attracted growing audiences since they began to be televised. The media in Ghana have been instrumental in pushing for increased accountability and improved service delivery. The 1992 constitution enshrined articles of free speech and, in 2001, a key criminal libel law was repealed under which members of the media had been charged and jailed. Despite all of this remarkable progress, it is also clear that democracy in Ghana is far from perfect –and there are still many challenges to be addressed.
The nature of the political system remains extremely centralised – including very strong presidential formal powers – and this makes key mechanisms of accountability (especially parliament) very weak. There is still clientelism and corruption. Election campaigns still tend to focus on more short-term objectives, even if they are oriented towards the provision of public goods. This makes it more difficult for political elites to be willing to undertake more fundamental reforms over the long term, and there are ongoing concerns about the (financial) sustainability of many of the policies that have been introduced, popular – or populist – as they are. How to make the state accountable through increased democratic space remains a key challenge. There are many examples of political voice making a difference, but there is a real issue of scale – such changes tend to be one-offs and have rarely become systemic. What needs to change? Politics is all about contesting for power and resources, so these conflicts for power are likely to be endemic. The crucial difference is that in functioning democracies this competition is channelled through a pre-established and publicly accountable framework, and through peaceful mechanisms. Processes of change are complex, and not always pretty – some of the dynamics prevalent in Ghana do not look any better in more established democracies (look at the US, for example). If the ultimate definition of democracy is “institutionalised uncertainty”, as renowned political scientist Adam Przeworski has defined it, then Ghana seems to be on a good (enough) path, and it has proved that it is a democracy that can deliver, despite challenges and limitations. Alina Rocha Menocal is a senior research fellow at the Developmental Leadership Program, based at the University of Birmingham. Together with Amanda Lenhardt from the Overseas Development Institute, she is the author of a case study entitled “Ghana, the rising star: progress in political voice, health and education”, which is being launched in conjunction with the Financing the Future conference in Accra",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/18/ghana-democracy-progress-health-education,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/18/ghana-democracy-progress-health-education
2015-03-18T07:00:20Z,global-development,Global development,Women's rights activists call for UN to protect them in their work | Liz Ford,"Nimalka Fernando was called a sex worker and a traitor for campaigning for peace in war-torn Sri Lanka. A photo of her head was pasted on to a naked women’s body and published. People were encouraged to stone or kill her. Sara García was threatened with criminal charges when she campaigned on behalf of women imprisoned under El Salvador’s draconian abortion laws. And Maryam al-Khawaja was arrested, assaulted and imprisoned for three weeks when she attempted to visit her political activist father in prison in Bahrain last year. At an event on Monday, organised by the civil society network Civicus and hosted at this year’s Commission on the Status of Women, in New York, the three women called on the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, to show leadership on defending the rights of female activists, and on member states to act on the resolution passed in 2013 to ensure they are protected in their work. The women spoke of the sexual and misogynist nature of the attacks on them when they defended women and spoke out against their governments.
Fernando, president of the International Movement Against All Forms of Discrimination and Racism, said attacks against her were “very nasty and sexist”. The media began a smear campaign against her in 2012 and death threats followed. “I was called a traitor to the motherland as I wanted peace,” said Fernando. “Then I became a collaborator and a prostitute because we were calling for peace and coming to the UN to raise accountability for humanitarian violations. We were portrayed as women selling the country and selling our bodies.” García, from the Agrupación Ciudadana por la Despenalización del Aborto (Citizen Group for the Decriminalisation of Abortion), was also on the receiving end of a media campaign by conservative groups that threatened criminal charges against her and the organisation working to free women imprisoned on abortion-related charges in El Salvador. “They said we were condoning crime. The abortion law says it’s illegal to facilitate women having an abortion, but it doesn’t explain what that means – so they say that even talking about abortion and wanting to change the law is illegal,” said García. Khawaja, co-director of the Gulf Centre for Human Rights, told the meeting that one of the only areas in which the Bahrain government doesn’t discriminate against women is in its treatment of human rights activists. Both women and men experience abuse. She said that if a woman is imprisoned, her child will often be forced to go to jail with her. “Where women are already being targeted on political grounds and babies are having to suffer the consequences is something that has to be brought up and addressed by the UN,” said Khawaja, who is now in exile and was sentenced in absentia to a year in prison after visiting her father last year.
She added that the cause of women in Bahrain is not helped when Ban praises the government’s efforts to empower women. “Women continue to be imprisoned in countries that work closely with the UN and are active members of the Human Rights Council,” Khawaja said, adding that while the passing of the resolution 2013 was a good first step, if not implemented, “they [governments] are just paying lip service”. A report published last year by the Association for Women’s Rights in Development (Awid), Our Right to Safety: Women Human Rights Defenders’ Holistic Approach to Protection, said female activists are targeted for who they are – women – as well as what they do. It added that human rights defenders “working in contexts where religious and cultural fundamentalisms are present are at greater risk of attacks than their male counterparts because they are deemed to have transgressed social norms”. It also said: “Violence against WHRD [women human rights defenders] may be gendered or sexualised as a way to recast women back into their traditional roles.” The 2013 resolution, the first to specifically protect women’s rights defenders, was introduced by Norway and co-sponsored by 35 other countries. The resolution recognises the specific risks, discrimination and violence women face in their work as activists. It called for governments to introduce policies to protect female activists, and to bring perpetrators to justice. However, Awid noted that there was strong resistance to the wording in the resolution from more conservative governments in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, which did not want to acknowledge that violence against activists was linked to gender or their work to protect women’s rights.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/18/womens-rights-activists-call-un-protect-them,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/18/womens-rights-activists-call-un-protect-them

Government ministers opened proceedings by declaring their commitment to achieving gender equality by 2030, but the wording of the declaration was a point of contention for many women’s rights activists, who branded it bland and unambitious.

2015-03-17T13:46:58Z,global-development,Global development,"Mali: 'Now we have the clinic in the community, we feel very secure’","In Kalabancoro town on the southern outskirts of Bamako and the right bank of the Niger river, matron Maimouna Maiga is off to do a follow-up visit to the home of 15-year-old Adiaratou Togo, whose baby, not yet named, is only three days old. He will be given a name, as is the custom, on the seventh day.
It’s toddler bath time when we arrive at the two-storey compound. Five boys wait their turn to be washed in a bucket. Given that it’s 37C they don’t take long to dry off and recover from the perceived indignity of their dunking. Laundry is out to dry. Other small children play in the shade of a mango tree. While the courtyard matriarch prepares millet for lunch, a neighbour gets the sweet potatoes under way. Water is drawn from a well inside the courtyard and stored in a tank of the roof. Drinkable water has to be bought. Maiga has come to support Adiaratou with breastfeeding, checking the baby for signs of infection, and ensuring he’s gaining weight. The newborn’s father is a student at the local lycée. The brand new treated mosquito net came from the health centre. Adiaratou says things are going well but that both she and the child are still getting to grips with breastfeeding. “My labour started at 1pm and I delivered at 3pm. It was my first pregnancy so I was worried, but the medical team was very good and kept trying to talk to me. “The midwife told me not to give my baby to everyone, she asked me to take care of the umbilical cord with alcohol and not to let kids come and play with him.”
The clinic where Adiaratou was helped to deliver her baby is in Kalabancoro Nèrèkoro Extension Sud Sangaat, about 10km south of Bamako, at the top of a slope offering views over the sprawling city. Around the health centre the ground is baked hard, but construction continues apace. The community came together in 2007 to establish the clinic but it wasn’t until July 2013 that they were finally able to open. There are between 80,000 and 120,000 people living in the area. Local residents get priority. It has wards for men and women, a delivery room, treatment rooms, a small laboratory and three latrines. The clinic primarily offers prenatal advice and general consultations, and is part of the national vaccination plan for children aged 0-11 months. Along with polio immunisation, the team – a doctor, a nursing team headed up by two matrons, a midwife, a caretaker, a pharmacist, lab technicians and a team of interns – distribute free anti-malarial pills and vitamin A. Health promotion and family planning advice are available too.
The centre’s small basins are served by a traditional covered well from which water is pumped to a holding tank on the roof. Staff must either buy safe drinking water or ask nearby households and patients to bring it in. Dr Daniel Bouàré, 30, who is from the area, runs the centre with a local management committee. “Generally the patients we receive here suffer from malaria,” he says. “Many people come for sexually transmitted infections and some come for pneumonia or other breathing problems. When the rainy season comes, we have many cases of diarrhoea and other infections – and this is because of consumption of unsafe water.” Funding, as ever, is a challenge. The government has recently supplied benches for the waiting rooms and some storage, but this isn’t enough. There can be drug shortages – doctors can only give prescriptions or use appropriate medicines, when they are available. Bouàré also wants to improve the disposal of medical waste, which is currently burned in a locked underground chamber. “We need to be able to incinerate all the medical material we are using,” he says. “We are putting the community at risk. Children can come and play here and risk becoming contaminated, and this is unfortunate because our mandate is to protect them.” Each consultation at the clinic is 500 CFA ($0.80). To deliver a baby costs 5,000 CFA if there are no complications, plus 600 CFA for folic acid and iron. “Generally, infections in newborns have two main routes,” says Bouàré. “Mothers can contaminate babies when mothers are also infected. But the second thing we notice is that from 0 to three months they have many cases of diarrhoea. The government has introduced a new vaccine called rotavirus, which is a very interesting solution.” So far the clinic hasn’t lost any mothers during delivery but there have been two cases where they have had to intervene following still births after deliveries at home. “There are still women who prefer to deliver at home, and there are old women in the community who help them,” says Bouàré. “All we can do in these cases is to go to the family and witness the deaths, and we focus on the mother, to see if there is any haemorrhage or any other problem and try to help them.”
Sountou Sissoko, 22, is here for a vaccination appointment for her week-old son, Alaye Sogoba. She gave birth to him at the clinic. She says her delivery was complicated this time. The centre wanted to refer her elsewhere, but in the end, after “suffering a bit”, she delivered successfully during the night with help from the matron. She already has a three-year-old son. “When I came for the delivery to the hospital I’d prepared some things – clothes for the baby, a bucket, some wrappers, some old clothes for me in case I bled,” she says.Following her consultation, Sissoko shows us her home, which is a few minutes away. She has to first seek permission from her husband and in-laws, in whose house they live. The carefully maintained one-storey house is fronted by a neat courtyard with welcome shade provided by small fruit trees – pomegranates, lemon, olives, a tall papaya and a young mango tree.
Lunch is being prepared outside by Sissoko’s two sisters-in-law. The onions have been peeled and are being pounded to make soup. A meat accompaniment is covered in oil with some added dijon mustard, salt and a Maggi stock cube. Potatoes are stored nearby, along with bananas and garlic. Firewood for the stove is stacked against a wall, and in one corner of the attractive courtyard stands the latrine and wash station. The family need 16-24 jerry cans of water a day – each costs 15 CFA. In some places a can is 10 CFA but this area is at the top of a hill and off the Bamako district supply, so kiosks can charge what they like on the open market. Baby Alaye’s proud grandmother, Koroutouna Coulibaly, invites us into her immaculate four-room home. Each wall in the welcoming central reception area sports a lace wall-hanging with peacock motifs. The breeze-block walls are intermingled with bricks featuring a star-shaped cut-out design, which allow a refreshing flow of air into the room. Some gaps functions as shelves – tucked inside are the family’s toothbrushes and paste, a comb and some soap powder. Muslin curtains with a rose detail hang in doorways, swaying in the harmattan breeze. In this landlocked Sahelian country, it’s a constant fight to keep out the dust and sand out. Multiple calendars mark the days until the children’s father, Amadou Sogoba, 31, has to return to Kayes in the west to resume his livelihood as an artisanal gold-digger. Yes, it’s dangerous work, he agrees, but he doesn’t get scared going deep underground. It’s worth it as sometimes you “get luck”. Since he’s self employed, he’s free to be at home right now with his one-week–old son. The other salary in the 10-strong household is provided by Amadou’s brother Abdramaher, 26, a soldier. Grandfather Niangolo Sogoba is the head of the household and also a member of the health centre association. “The health centre is very beneficial, before we had to go elsewhere, far away, which was especially difficult at night. Now we have the clinic in the community, we really feel at ease – very secure,” he says.
The top three killers of babies are malaria, respiratory infections and diarrhoea. The family maintains the highest possible hygiene standards for their children. As Sissoko says: “It’s a priority. To me, safe water can’t be replaced – it is very important both for the mum and the baby. Without safe water the mum sometimes has infections and diseases, and the same is true for the babies.“ Mali facts and figures Mali is a large, landlocked country in western Africa, two-thirds of which is desert. As many as 4.9 million people lack safe water. Some 11.6 million people, nearly four-fifths of the population, don’t have access to adequate sanitation. More than 15,000 children die every year from diarrhoea caused by unsafe water and poor sanitation.

2015-03-17T10:04:58Z,global-development,Global development,"Lack of safe water, sanitation and soap ""an embarrassment"" says WHO | Lucy Lamble","Alarming figures on a lack of clean water in health centres have been highlighted in a joint report published on Tuesday by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef). “Access to water in health centres and even in delivery rooms has fallen between the gaps in the millennium development goals,” said Bruce Gordon, coordinator of water, sanitation, hygiene and health for the WHO. “It’s an embarrassment for the health sector that this issue is so ignored. It’s a fixable crisis. It’s a crisis because it’s hidden.” In low- and middle-income countries, 38% of health centres have no access to water, according to the report. It says that adequate sanitation is lacking in 19% of health centres, and 35% do not even provide water and soap for staff and patients to wash their hands and maintain basic hygiene.
Dirty water and the lack of safe toilets are among the top five killers of women worldwide. Without these basic facilities, health centres cannot adequately prevent and control infections, placing mothers and children at risk during delivery. Where latrines are not provided, mothers in labour may have to go outside to relieve themselves, and tend to leave health facilities within hours of giving birth, leaving little time for them to receive advice and support. Drawing on data from 54 countries, the report covers more than 66,000 centres. But the data is likely to overstate actual access significantly, since most surveys merely note the presence of water within 500 metres of the health centre rather than indicating whether supplies are piped, safe to drink or year-round. The report is a first step towards a baseline study as NGOs and health organisations encourage governments, donors and stakeholders to make water, sanitation and hygiene (Wash) in health contexts both a higher political priority and measurable as part of the new sustainable development goals. Better data is crucial for Wash access to be included in indicators on heath, education and gender goals. The findings show that Mali is currently the poorest performer, with just 20% of health facilities providing clean water. There is inequity within many countries – for example in Kenya, where 58% of hospitals had access to water but only 35% of primary health clinics. In Ethiopia, there is access to drinking water in 99% of the capital’s health facilities but only 23% in the Gambela region. Vietnam is one country that now monitors Wash in health centres. It has encouraged progress by holding a clean toilet contest and offering incentives to improve services. Globally, one in 50 babies die before they are a month old. According to a report released by WaterAid on Tuesday, one in five newborn deaths could be prevented with safe water, sanitation and clean hands. In 2013, more than 2.7 million newborns did not survive a month, and 99% of these neonatal deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries.
Barbara Frost, WaterAid’s chief executive, said: “The links between dirty hands, dirty water and infant mortality have been known about for over 150 years so this is not a solution waiting for an answer, but an injustice waiting for action. “The ability to keep a hospital or clinic clean is such a fundamental basic requirement of healthcare that you have to question whether a facility without clean running water or basic sanitation can adequately serve its patients.” Diatoula in Mali, 15km south-east of Bamako, is a community of 1,000 people. Vinima Baya, 29, the only nurse, runs the centre with the support of a pharmacist, Soungalo Diarra, 30, who had three months’ training in the typical medicines likely to be required at the centre. She did three years’ specialist nursing training after completing her baccalaureate. Baya, who is originally from Bamako, has two children herself. She came at the request of the community, but can only afford to stay on by growing onions to sell in her spare time. Her husband lives near his work in a nearby town. It costs 3,500 CFA ($5.60) for an uncomplicated delivery at the centre, plus any necessary drugs. This fee covers salaries and the basic equipment at the centre – there is no state or other external funding. As there is no water within the facility, patients need to bring in 25-30 litres of water or five buckets’ worth to try to maintain a clean environment during the birth. There is a hand pump on the other side of the village near the school (donated by Japan), but the nearest water point to the centre is a deep well, which can run low at certain points of the year. Reviewing her register, Baya notes that there have been 33 births at the centre so far this year; three of the babies were born dead and two died within their first month. Sixteen-year-old Fatoumata Djarra’s son, Allaman Sidiqi Djarra, her first child, died 15 days after he was born.
“When I was pregnant, I came for consultation and advice. I gave birth here in the community health centre. It was at night. I came with my family members,” she said. “They went to collect water at the well in the village. I didn’t have any special circumstances in my delivery.” When Fatoumata noticed her baby was not well she gave him traditional medicine. “I just noticed some black spots on his legs and his body. He wasn’t feeling good, he didn’t eat anything, he didn’t drink anything. It took only one day before he died.” Though Fatoumata did not return to the health centre for confirmation, the symptoms suggest sepsis infection. Funding challenge Ahead of the development finance meeting in Addis in July, ways of raising the necessary capital for water, sanitation and hygiene are under urgent consideration. A live debate is whether Wash would benefit from a global fund mechanism like HIV and aids, vaccines or education, or whether it would be better served by more cross-cutting funding. Currently, it is often down to households and communities to find their own solutions. The WHO-Unicef report found that only 25% of countries have funded plans to address the issue.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/17/lack-safe-water-sanitation-soap-embarrassment-who-priority,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/17/lack-safe-water-sanitation-soap-embarrassment-who-priority
2015-03-17T06:00:12Z,global-development,Global development,'My employer hit me in the face and pushed me down the stairs' | Rebecca Falconer,"Sol Pillas winces as a sobbing Filipina maid gives an all-too-familiar account of fleeing her Saudi banker employer following a vicious attack that left her physically and emotionally scarred. As secretary-general of Migrante International, a non-profit group that deals with approximately 5,000 cases of Filipino migrant abuse a year, Pillas helps many domestic workers. Most cases are reported from the Middle East, and approximately 80% are from Saudi Arabia, where exploitation thrives under the restrictive kafala sponsorship system, which tethers workers to employers. Maria de Santos* explains from the sanctuary of Migrante’s headquarters, in a poor neighbourhood of Quezon City in Manila, how the wife of the banker had attacked her moments after the 23-year-old was forced to strip naked in front of the family on 25 December. The maid had just told them that she was leaving after more than four months of working long hours without pay and eating nothing but morsels of food left on the children’s plates. “She was asked to ‘spread her legs’,” says Pillas, a former Hong Kong domestic worker who now volunteers full-time at Migrante. “She was strip-searched in a humiliating way.” Domestic workers who flee employers are considered undocumented “runaways” who have broken the law, and are often detained for months. In this case, police granted De Santos an exit visa because they said her attacker had committed “haram”, a sinful act. Exit visas are notoriously difficult to get hold of because they must be granted by employers or, in extreme circumstances, the authorities. Rothna Begum, Middle East women’s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch, said there could be hundreds of runaway domestic workers arriving at shelters on a monthly basis in Saudi Arabia. About 1.5 million domestic workers are found in Saudi Arabia, more than in any other Middle East country. “Of the countries that I have worked on when it comes to domestic workers, Saudi Arabia was one of the highest in terms of abuse cases that would come through, and [in terms of] some of the most horrendous,” says Begum. The Philippine embassy shelter in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, is understood to be home, currently, to 200 runaway maids and eight children aged between two and five. Their mothers face detention in Saudi Arabia for having had illicit relations, even though some of the women have been raped. Manilyn Germono is among the women at the shelter. She fled there after being physically abused by her employer in Saudi Arabia. She returned to the Philippines last month, destitute and in urgent need of treatment for a tumour on her thyroid gland. The 26-year-old mother-of-two says her employer had known she was being treated for the tumour when he hired her, but he forbade her from receiving medical treatment in Saudi Arabia. “He hit me in the face and pushed me down the stairs,” recalls Germono, who returned to Manila on 10 February after fleeing to the Philippine embassy shelter in October. She waited more than three months for police to grant her an exit visa. Her employer refused to do so. “I worked for seven months, but I couldn’t finish my contract because I was really scared of my employer.” On Tuesday, Germono filed a claim with the National Labor Relations Commission in Manila against Pisces International Placement Corporation for failing to provide her with a safe placement. She wants compensation for a total loss of earnings of 36,000 Philippine pesos (£526). The company said it was not aware of the abuse and offered her 15,000 pesos. Germono rejected the offer, and says she needs to win the case to pay for the treatment she needs. Migrante’s chairman, Garry Martinez, a survivor of domestic worker abuse and human trafficking to South Korea, says the exit visa systems of Saudi Arabia and Qatar are among the biggest issues migrant workers have to deal with.
According to the executive director for the Centre for Migrant Advocacy, Ellene Sana, another major issue concerning the Middle East is that families “farm out” maids to relatives in other countries, so the women become undocumented workers. In the most serious cases, some women have become trapped in war-torn Syria. “You can be recruited legally here to Saudi, and then the employer in Saudi can be at liberty to take you anywhere else,” says Walden Bello, chairman of the Overseas Workers Affairs Committee in the Philippine House of Representatives. “They actually will give them to their siblings in Jordan, in Lebanon, or in Qatar. “There were two cases of domestic workers who were rescued in Virginia, where their employer was Saudi and one of them was sent back to Jeddah to take care of the mother. This is common practice for those with families in many places.” Bello says that on a recent visit to Qatar he and Sana found that the practice of contract substitution, whereby workers sign contracts for a higher wage only to have them replaced with a new contract agreeing to less money once they arrive, is rife in Doha. “We brought this to the attention of the Qatari authorities, that this is such a prevalent practice, that you have to shape up because this is something that cannot be tolerated in a country that sponsors the World Cup,” says Bello. Qatar has yet to act on reforms it announced in May, including proposals to amend the sponsorship and exit permit system and substantially increase fines for employers that withhold passports, according to Amnesty International’s James Lynch, who wrote a damning report documenting domestic worker abuses in the Gulf state last year. Lynch says there has been no enforcement of the existing 10,000 Qatari riyals (£1,770) fine for passport confiscation, which affects almost every domestic worker. “The standard way of reporting a domestic worker for leaving their sponsor without permission, which is known as running away, is to hand their passport in to the authorities and that is accepted as a form of proof that they’ve absconded,” he says. “So the government is actually accepting confiscating passports as part of its processes to enforce the sponsorship law.” Begum says Saudi authorities have taken steps to improve the situation for domestic workers, including adopting labour regulations for domestic workers in 2013 that guarantee a monthly payment of wages, paid holiday and nine hours’ rest per day, but this falls short of international standards, while the kafala and exit visa systems still exist. *Name changed to protect identity",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/17/my-employer-hit-face-pushed-down-stairs-filipina-migrant-maids,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/17/my-employer-hit-face-pushed-down-stairs-filipina-migrant-maids
2015-03-17T06:00:12Z,global-development,Global development,"The global plight of domestic workers: few rights, little freedom, frequent abuse | Rebecca Falconer and Annie Kelly","An estimated 53 million people, mostly women, are employed as domestic workers in private households around the world. While domestic workers are now considered crucial to the smooth running of national economies, as a workforce they remain one of the most vulnerable to exploitation, abuse and modern-day slavery. Human rights campaigners have catalogued a litany of exploitation faced by domestic workers at the hands of their employers, including forced labour, rape, daily beatings and being forced to work long hours with no breaks. According to the International Domestic Workers Federation, employers who exploit or underpay their domestic workers make $8bn (£5.1bn) a year in illegal profits. The vulnerability of domestic workers is rooted in the nature of their work – typically undertaken behind closed doors in private homes far from their own communities – and the lack of legal protection they receive. Though critical to the functioning of national economies, only 10% of domestic workers have the same basic labour rights as other sectors. A quarter of all domestic workers are not afforded any legal rights at all. “I think one of the problems is that there is an assumption that domestic work is just done by women. There is no inherent value attached to this work by employers or by governments,” says Ai-jen Poo, director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance. “The discrimination and isolation these women face is compounded by their absence from many labour laws. It means they can be effectively disappeared behind closed doors in private homes, with nobody aware of what is happening to them.” In some countries, including the UK, domestic workers are bound to their employers through tied-visa systems, which prevents them from leaving to seek employment elsewhere even if they face violence and exploitation. In the Gulf, the International Trade Union Confederation estimates that 2.4 million domestic workers are enslaved (pdf). Most are migrant workers from poor countries such as the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Nepal who are recruited to work in private households in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman. Upon arrival in any of these countries, domestic workers fall under the regional kafala system, meaning the consent of the “sponsor” family is required if they wish to leave their employment. In countries that enforce the kafala system rigorously, such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar, it is illegal for domestic workers to flee abusive employers. Those who do risk being detained as “runaway” undocumented workers. They are unable to leave the country without the permission of their employers. Human Rights Watch and others have documented horrendous abuse of maids and domestic servants in private households in the UAE, with widespread sexual violence, beatings, confiscation of passports and non-payment of wages. Unmarried domestic workers who become pregnant can be charged with illicit relations and imprisoned with their babies. In Saudi Arabia, eight maids sheltering with their children at the Philippine Embassy in Riyadh could be jailed for illicit behaviour, even though some of them had been raped by their employers, according to the NGO Migrante International. A 2012 survey of 3,000 domestic workers in Hong Kong, home to an estimated 320,000 domestic staff, found that 58% had reported verbal abuse, while 18% said they had been physically assaulted and 6% claimed to have suffered sexual abuse. In the past few weeks, Hong Kong has been rocked by a landmark case in which the wealthy employer of an Indonesian domestic worker was convicted of 18 counts of inflicting grievous bodily harm. Meanwhile, a survey of domestic workers in the US found that 25% were paid less than the minimum wage. A total of 10% said they weren’t paid anything at all. In Australia, where an estimated 54,000 of Asia-Pacific’s 21 million-plus domestic workers are based, a Salvation Army report catalogued 16-hour days without breaks, non-payment of wages and physical violence. The study, published last year, concluded that private homes in Australia were becoming “prisons that people cannot leave”. In the UK, 67% of domestic workers work seven days a week and 60% are not allowed out of the house alone, according to the NGO Kalayaan. The UK’s stance towards domestic workers was criticised when it became one of eight countries, including El Salvador and Sudan, not to vote in favour of a new International Labour Organistion (ILO) convention giving domestic workers the same legal protection afforded to other workers. Falling into this form of modern slavery is not exclusive to migrant domestic workers, or adults. Globally, an estimated 10.5 million children are domestic workers. A 2013 study found that about 17% of child domestic workers were sexually abused in Bangladesh’s capital, Dhaka, while 83% suffered physical abuse from their employers. In Nigeria, Unicef, the UN children’s fund, reports that hundreds of thousands of children work as domestic servants, which puts them at risk of sexual violence and other forms of abuse. . In Indonesia, where national laws setting the minimum working age are not enforced for domestic labour, child domestic workers earn as little as 1p an hour.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/17/global-plight-domestic-workers-labour-rights-little-freedom-abuse,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/17/global-plight-domestic-workers-labour-rights-little-freedom-abuse
2015-03-17T01:00:06Z,global-development,Global development,Farming absorbs 22% of cost of disasters in developing countries | Clár Ní Chonghaile,"Nearly a quarter of the damages caused by natural disasters in the developing world affect the agricultural sector, exacting a heavy cost on poor farmers who do not have insurance or the resources to rebuild their lives after floods, droughts or other extreme events, the UN’s Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) has said. The initial findings of a new report on the impact of natural disasters on agriculture and food security were released by the FAO at the third world conference on disaster risk reduction in Sendai, Japan, and showed that the cost to farmers was considerably higher than previously estimated. Between 2003–2013, natural hazards and disasters in developing countries affected more than 1.9 billion people, and caused more than $494bn in damages. Economic losses from natural disasters have tripled over the past decade, and continue to rise. The FAO analysed 78 post-disaster needs assessments in 48 developing countries during that decade, and found that 22% of all damages were absorbed by the agricultural sector, including crops, livestock, forestry and fisheries – compared to previous assessments of around 13%. Out of a total $140bn in damages, $30bn affected agriculture, but only 4.5% of post-disaster humanitarian aid in the same period targeted agriculture, it said. “This (22%) is quite a large number and we think it is underestimated because ... we have been facing a huge data gap ... Yet this 22% is much bigger than results for previous studies,” said Dominique Burgeon, FAO’s resilience coordinator, who is attending the UN conference in Sendai. In its report, the FAO also compared decreases in yields during and after disasters with yield trends in 67 countries affected by at least one medium- to large-scale event. Using this methodology, it estimated total damages to crops and livestock over the 10-year period at $70bn. Asia was hardest hit, with estimated losses of $28bn, while Africa registered losses of $26bn. The FAO found that 82% of production losses were caused by droughts and floods, with 77% of all agricultural production losses worldwide due to drought occurring in 27 sub-Saharan countries and costing those economies $23.5bn. After natural disasters, trade flows were also jolted, the FAO said, noting an increase of $18.9bn in agricultural imports, and a decrease of $14.9bn in exports after natural disasters in the countries it surveyed.
Around 2.5 billion small-scale farmers, herders, fishermen and forest communities depend on agriculture to survive, and their labours account for more than half of global agricultural production. These people are particularly at risk from disasters – storms, tsunamis, earthquakes, floods, volcanic eruptions – that destroy or damage harvests, equipment, supplies, livestock, seeds, crops and stored food. “We know we need to increase global food security by 60% ... Bearing in mind that around 50% of global food production is produced by these 2.5 billion smallholders, we have a huge challenge ahead of us, and an increasing number of disasters affecting these people,” Burgeon said. The FAO announced it was launching a special facility to help countries reduce risk and limit impacts of natural disasters in food production sectors. Under this new scheme, technical support will be provided to those who need it most. “One thing that is emerging is countries’ realisation that they have to make sure that the risk dimension is mainstreamed into their sectoral policies – livestock, crops and fisheries,” Burgeon said. “We consider that for a country to adjust its policies accordingly, you need six to nine months and therefore there is a cost involved to organise the capacity development, (and) the training ... so that people can own the process,” he said. The FAO has estimated the cost at around $500,000 per country, and Burgeon said they needed $10m to be able to support 20 countries to start this process.
The work of the new facility will be guided by the FAO’s Framework Programme on Disaster Risk Reduction for Food and Nutrition Security. This calls for better information-gathering and early warning systems, as well as investment in more sustainable models of food production, and wider use of improved technologies and practices. The importance of disaster risk reduction took on a particularly poignant relevance in Sendai, where the president of Vanuatu, Baldwin Lonsdale, spoke on Monday of the devastation caused by cyclone Pam, which ripped through the Pacific island nation of mainly subsistence farmers at the weekend. Lonsdale said climate change was contributing to more extreme weather conditions and cyclone seasons. “This is a very devastating cyclone … I term it a monster that has hit Vanuatu,” he said. “It is a setback for the government and for the people of Vanuatu … All the development that has taken place has been wiped out.” Around 4,000 government officials and civil society participants are in Sendai, which was devastated by a tsunami and earthquake four years ago, to agree a new protocol to update the Hyogo Framework for Action, adopted 10 years ago in Kobe, Japan.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/17/farming-absorbs-22-per-cent-cost-disasters-developing-countries-un-report,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/17/farming-absorbs-22-per-cent-cost-disasters-developing-countries-un-report
2015-03-16T10:57:42Z,global-development,Global development,Venezuelan woman's 14-year wait for justice after rape and torture,"It was Linda Loaiza’s dream to study veterinary medicine when she arrived in Caracas at 18. Those plans were shattered when she was abducted, repeatedly raped and tortured for four months. By the time she managed to escape, her ears had been destroyed, her jaw dislocated, and one of her nipples had been cut off. Her malnourished body was covered in scars from cigarette burns. She had a ruptured spleen and could no longer bear children. In the 14 years since, Loaiza has undergone more than a dozen surgeries to try to repair the physical damage she suffered at the hands of her abductor and she continues to receive psychological support for the emotional trauma. Now she is trying to address the injustice she feels she suffered at the hands of the Venezuelan court system. “My abductor caused me a lot of damage. But the Venezuelan justice system did as well,” says Loaiza, now 32, whose soft-spoken manner belies her strong character. In 2004, after years of investigations and court dates, her abductor, Luis Carrera Almoina – the son of a powerful political figure – was acquitted of all charges for lack of evidence. The statute of limitations was almost reached because of multiple pre-trial delays. The ruling was overturned and Carrera Almoina was eventually convicted for “grievous bodily injuries and the illegal deprivation of liberty”, but not on the rape and attempted murder charges. After serving six years in jail, he is now free. But Loaiza is not free of her torment. “There were a series of abuses and irregularities, omissions and delays that affected the investigation and trial process,” she says, with a lawyerly detachment. After her abduction, she decided to study law and now specialises in international human rights law. Her studies gave her the courage and strength to challenge the Venezuelan state before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which will hear arguments on the case on 17 March. “I was revictimised throughout the process,” says Loaiza. Loaiza’s lawyers argue that the criminal investigation and subsequent trials were deeply flawed. Lawyer Juan Bernardo Delgado, who will argue the case before the commission, notes that 59 judges declined to hear the case. “The accused was the son of a person with a lot of power in Venezuela and nobody wanted to hear the case,” he says. He says the state failed Loaiza repeatedly. For example, Loaiza’s sister had reported that she was missing during the abduction but there was no investigation. The lack of due diligence in investigating and punishing Carrera Almoina constituted a form of discrimination, argues Delgado. In 2013, Venezuela withdrew from the Inter-American Human Rights system, which includes the commission and the Inter-American Human Rights Court. But the country is still subject to the jurisdiction of these bodies because the complaint was filed before that date. A ruling in Loaiza’s favour would represent a great moral victory, but would also mean that the case would pass to the Inter-American Human Rights Court. This court could then impose a financial award, and might require Venezuela to change its policies on gender-based violence, or to ensure adequate funding for its existing programmes. Venezuelan officials did not respond to requests for interviews about the case but, in documents filed before the commission, the government argues that it was not responsible for the abuses Loaiza suffered at the hands of her attacker. The documents claim that delays in the case were also caused by the victim, who could not attend hearings because she was hospitalised. The government paperwork also points out that, in 2007, legislators passed the Act on Women’s Right to a Life Free from Violence, which created specialised police units, prosecutors and courts dedicated to cases of gender violence and women’s shelters in each of Venezuela’s 23 states. “Venezuela is at the forefront of normative instruments in defence of the women,” Andreína Tarazón, the minister for women, said at an event last year, noting that the law lists 19 types of violence against women as crimes and recent reform added the crimes of femicide and incitement to suicide. But women’s rights activist Ofelia Alvarez says the law has not been implemented fully. At the end of 2014, for example, only six shelters were up and running in the country. “It does little good to write up a magnificent law and then not appropriate the money to fund all the institutions it creates,” Alvarez says. She adds that many judicial officials have not been trained properly and often still send women away when they try to report abuse. “A woman has to be very strong to insist on filing a report or to return another day,” says Alvarez. “This leads to a double victimisation of women.”
As for the specialised courts for gender violence, Alvarez says it’s an important step but cautions that women face so many hurdles that trials are the exception. “The cases that make it that far are very few,” she says. According to the latest figures published by the prosecutor’s office, in 2013 71,812 reports of gender violence were reported. Formal charges were filed in less than 15% of the cases. Amnesty International said in its latest report on Venezuela that while more courts and prosecutors’ offices specialising in gender-based violence were established, they remained “insufficient to deal with the high volume of cases”. In a review of Venezuela’s compliance with international conventions in 2014, the UN Commission on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women noted the adoption of legislation against gender violence but said it was “deeply concerned … that violence against women and girls is widespread and on the rise”. “A victim of gender violence in Venezuela has to be very strong and very persistent to find any sort of justice,” says Loaiza. Her lawyers say her case is paradigmatic of a context in which sexual violence goes unpunished and that, by presenting it before the Inter-American Commission, they hope to affect a change in the status quo. “I have already suffered plenty,” says Loaiza. “I don’t want anyone else to suffer what I went through. “I cannot rest until the Venezuelan state recognises its responsibility for failing me.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/16/linda-loaiza-venezuela-rape-torture-justice-human-rights,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/16/linda-loaiza-venezuela-rape-torture-justice-human-rights
2015-03-16T07:00:06Z,global-development,Global development,Drive to end violence against women needs more money and better data | Clár Ní Chonghaile,"Despite the rhetoric on eradicating sexual violence in conflict, there are few signs of a commensurate increase in donor funding for programmes to protect women. Meanwhile, a lack of accurate data on what’s being spent where is hindering efforts to monitor and evaluate what is working. From the adoption of UN Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security in 2000, to the 2013 call to action that saw donors and international agencies commit to reducing violence against women in emergencies, and last year’s high-profile conference on violence against women in London, there is no lack of talk about what needs to be done. But figuring out whether words have been matched by funding is difficult. Campaigners say the use of gender markers to categorise funding according to its role in promoting gender equality is not widespread enough, nor are the available tools sufficiently detailed. At present, there is no way to monitor spending devoted specifically to preventing sexual violence in conflict, although the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development plans to introduce a new code to track such flows later this year.
Until now, this funding was only identified as part of aid for gender equality, and even that is hard to measure. A number of gender markers exist and, while they do not capture everything, they do give some idea of the amounts involved and the recipient countries. Emily Esplen, lead policy analyst on gender equality and women’s rights at the OECD’s Development Cooperation Directorate, said more than 90% of bilateral aid given by OECD members was screened against the group’s gender marker. “It’s a strong indication of the degree of political will from a particular government for supporting gender equality through their aid programmes,” she said. “We’re at a time where there are unprecedented policy commitments around gender equality and gender-based violence and you are getting a lot of donors saying, ‘This is one of our top priorities for our whole aid programme’ … but there’s always this question of – are you actually going to back that up?” Outside the OECD, other markers are used, but the empirical evidence they offer can be patchy. In a report in September 2014 on Funding Gender Emergencies, the Global Humanitarian Assistance (GHA) programme, run by Development Initiatives, looked at funding from the top 10 donors between 2011 and 2014. The report highlighted an “unreliable picture” of whether commitments to gender equality had been met. “Reporting on gender remains poor – both in terms of using the gender marker in the first place (only two-fifths of humanitarian assistance was coded in 2013) and, where the gender marker has been used, specifying the extent to which the project contributes to gender equality,” the report said. Since 2012, there have been no notable improvements in the use of the gender marker by donors, the report said. The gender marker tool was introduced in 2010 by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee to track gender funding in UN appeals; the report said the IASC marker should be applied systematically to each project reported to the UN’s Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) financial tracking service (FTS). On the basis of the available data, the GHA found that the proportion of aid allocated to projects that focused “principally” or “contribute significantly” to gender equality decreased from 22% in 2013 to 19% in 2014. The European commission’s humanitarian aid and civil protection (Echo) department has also introduced a gender-age marker to assess the extent to which humanitarian actions integrate gender and age considerations. It came into effect for all Echo projects in January 2014. But no marker provides an overview of global aid flows, and this hampers monitoring and evaluation as well as making it more difficult for donors to coordinate efficiently.
Last September, in a progress report on commitments made during the 2013 Call to Action, Ocha said: “Inadequacies of collection and utilisation of sex and age disaggregated data and information remains as an overarching challenge for Ocha and the humanitarian system.” The information gap “continues to compromise holistic gender analysis and identification of differential concerns, risks and threats facing women, girls, boys and men”, the report added. Bridging this gap is critical as world leaders work on a new set of goals to define the development agenda until 2030 – the sustainable development goals (SDGs) – and figure out how to finance the comprehensive list of targets. The draft SDGs, which will be finalised at a summit in New York in September, call for the elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls, including trafficking and sexual exploitation. For Esplen, the drafting of the SDGs represents a huge opportunity. “It’s highly likely there is going to be a target in there on GBV [gender-based violence], and there is going to be a huge push for strong mechanisms,” she said. “There might only be one or two indicators agreed on violence against women, and they are unlikely to be specific to sexual violence – but those are an entry point to say we have targets and indicators that have been agreed to apply to all countries universally. We need some kind of very simple tool that tracks accountability.” Esplen’s team has drawn up a code to allow OECD members to specify if projects help end violence against women and girls. The proposal has received widespread support from members and will be adopted later this year. “What it won’t be able to do is disaggregate whether that aid is going to sexual violence, or female genital mutilation, or domestic violence. We might be able to get a sense of that by going into the data … but it’ll give us a sense generally about what amount of money we are talking about and which donors are giving it,” Esplen said.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/16/drive-end-violence-against-women-needs-money-better-data,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/16/drive-end-violence-against-women-needs-money-better-data
2015-03-15T09:00:06Z,global-development,Global development,Syrian refugees: 'A whole generation is growing up displaced and uneducated' | Patricia Mouamar,"It has already been four years since the beginning of the conflict in Syria. The war has caused more than 3.7 million people to flee Syria, mainly to neighbouring countries like my home, Lebanon. Iyad and Ziad are 10-year-old twins from Syria. About two years ago, the boys dug a hole in the ground next to their house and buried their special marbles. It wasn’t to hide them, but to serve as a landmark. Knowing that their house would be destroyed, they created this landmark so that they would know where their house used to be when their wish to return home came true. This wish, to be able to return to Syria, is shared by every refugee I’ve met over the past four years. I never imagined that I would still be seeing some of the faces I met two or three years back. Sadly, like a time-lapse video, I have seen eyes wrinkling, hairs greying and faces ageing; even more disconcertingly, I have seen the skin on children’s hands thickening from labour. Syrian refugees are in now in every corner of Lebanon. In rural areas there are tents covering almost every spare piece of grass or dirt. Sometimes you find just two or three crowded on to a small piece of land; in other places there are hundreds sprawling across what used to be a paddock. Some of the Syrian refugees who are living in the Bekaa Valley, now home to 400,000 refugees, used to come across the border for seasonal agricultural work. Now those same people are here with their families, and there is not enough work to go around. Even with assistance from humanitarian organisations such as World Vision, refugees struggle to pay for basics like food and fuel for heating as well as the rent for their small square of land.
Unfinished apartments and houses, in effect construction sites, have also become makeshift homes across rural areas and into the suburbs. The bare concrete offers little more protection from the elements than a tent, and the building materials are unfinished. In Beirut, the scale of the problem is just as arresting. People sleep under bridges and overpasses, and you can’t walk down the street without coming across a Syrian person begging, or trying to sell small keepsakes, to earn some money. More than a million Syrian refugees in Lebanon is a great burden to carry for a country that previously had a population of about 4.5 million. Proportionally, that represents a higher figure than if the entire population of Greece moved to the UK. Our infrastructure, health services and education systems are all stretched to breaking point and poorer Lebanese are suffering alongside refugees. More than two-thirds of school-age refugees in Lebanon are being denied an education, either because they cannot afford the expenses or because they are forced to work to help support their families. In some areas, there are simply no schools available, or a lack of transport prevents children from attending classes. For these children, the future citizens and leaders of Syria, it’s hard to maintain hope. Some children are facing their third or fourth year out of school. When they’ve been out of school for so long they know they won’t go back – it would be too hard to catch up on everything they have missed. Humanitarian organisations like World Vision are struggling to find ways and means to get more refugees into classrooms. Our programmes include accelerated learning for “out-of-school” children, remedial classes for those who are struggling to keep up, and informal education in child-friendly meeting places. We’re also supporting more teachers, adding bathroom facilities and providing supplies. But it’s not enough. The resources of local schools, government and humanitarian organisations are stretched and the needs keep growing. The truth, no matter how you view it, is that a whole generation of children is growing up displaced and uneducated. This will have real, long-term impacts, not just for them but for the future of their country. While lack of access to education is just one of the many challenges facing Syria’s children, ensuring their continued access to learning is an essential platform for their protection, social stabilisation and economic recovery, and one the world cannot ignore.

2015-03-13T10:00:10Z,global-development,Global development,Opening up airspace could make sky the limit for African trade and tourism | Mark Anderson,"Glancing around a crowded terminal in Kenya’s Jomo Kenyatta airport, one of the busiest international hubs in Africa, it’s obvious that more passengers are streaming to the continent than ever before. Chinese businessmen stretch out on benches, trying to catch a few hours’ sleep before continuing their journey to Angola, while American tourists trade loud jokes as they board a flight to Mount Kilimanjaro, one of Tanzania’s most popular holiday destinations. For decades, Asian investors have been travelling to Africa, attracted by the continent’s emerging economies. And surging numbers of labourers, executives and families flying between Africa and Asia have now made it the world’s fastest growing transcontinental route, according to the International Air Transport Association (Iata). But it’s not just Asian travellers who can benefit African economies. Experts say improved regional and internal air networks could drive economic growth and encourage trade. Regional trading blocs, like the East African Community and the Southern Africa Development Community,could use air transport to increase trade and encourage business between member states. Promoting internal air links could reap huge economic rewards, such as more trade between African countries and other parts of the world, as well as a reduction in the expensive transport costs with which African businesses are saddled at present. Growing affluence across Africa has created greater demand for air travel. By 2034, eight of the 10 fastest growing aviation markets will be in Africa, while nearly 300 million passengers will travel to and from African destinations, Iata has forecast. Much of this growth is expected in routes within the continent. Nigeria’s aviation minister, Osita Chidoka, says African airlines can take advantage of emerging middle classes and Asian links, but need to enact a longstanding agreement between 44 African governments, known as the Yamoussoukro Decision,that would enable airspace to be shared without the imposition of fees. “One of the ways [African airlines] can have an advantage is the ability to go with the Yamoussoukro Decision of African ministers to liberalise air space in Africa, which would allow them to coordinate [flights between] African cities and bring them together in a hub and spoke manner.”
Iata bemoans the slow march of progress towards implementing the Yamoussoukro Decision. “The benefits have not been realised,” said the group, which estimates that liberalising African airspace in 12 countries could create more than 150,000 jobs and add $1.3bn (£872m) to the continent’s gross domestic product by encouraging tourism. There is a growing belief that tourism can bolster African economies and that improved air networks will encourage more travellers to visit the continent. Despite travel warnings surrounding west Africa’s Ebola outbreak, sub-Saharan Africa drew 3% more tourists last year than in 2013, according to the UN’s World Tourism Organisation. In 2014, more than 50 million tourists travelled to Africa, making it one of the world’s most popular regions. This number is expected to increase further in 2015.
Many question whether more passengers on Asian routes will benefit African carriers. With stiff competition from Gulf carriers such as Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways, African airlines will need to provide faster journey times and smooth transfers while continuing to shed a reputation for poor safety. Low-cost carriers serving internal destinations and regional hubs can expect a greater economic fillip than expansive international carriers, says Brendan Sobie, chief analyst at the Centre for Aviation.“Low-cost carriers in the intra-Africa market would usher in a new era of rapid capacity growth, paving the way for growth in travel … which in turn could result in the greater linking of African economies,” Sobie told This Is Africa. “The potential economic implications are huge.” There are just eight low-cost carriers operating in African skies, with a total of 34 aircraft between them, according to Sobie. Although low-cost carriers including Kenya’s Fly540,South Africa’s Kulula and Tanzania’s Fastjet have already enjoyed success, their fleets make up less than 3% of all commercial aircraft operated by African carriers. For the first time, African airport operators now boast a better safety record than the world average, allaying fears that have plagued the continent’s aviation industry for decades. But Chidoka says: “What I believe we need to do going forward is to intensify the regulatory oversight, especially in the area of general aviation.” Chidoka remains optimistic that African skies will open up. “What the western aviation companies cannot do, the African companies can do – if we fully liberalise the air space in Africa. So you will find an Arik airplane bringing people from Sierra Leone, from Liberia, from the Gambia, and being able to pool them together in Lagos or Abuja for onwards flights. African airlines can do more if we work towards the liberalisation of air space.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/13/opening-up-airspace-sky-aviation-african-trade-tourism,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/13/opening-up-airspace-sky-aviation-african-trade-tourism
2015-03-13T07:00:06Z,global-development,Global development,International collaboration vital in reducing impact of natural disasters | Julian Hunt and Joy Pereira,"The third world conference on disaster risk reduction, which begins on Saturday in Sendai, north Japan, is a landmark event. Held every decade since 1994, the meeting brings together key government decision makers and experts in an effort to mitigate the impact of future natural disasters. One subject up for discussion will be regular intergovernmental assessments of scientific advances that can support the work of UN agencies dealing with natural disasters. The introduction of such a forum would be an important step forward: the enormous human and economic loss associated with natural disasters dwarfs the total loss associated with all other disasters, but it could be reduced through better science. As part of this process, the meeting will hopefully initiate international collaboration into better understanding and prediction of earthquakes. Research reported by Russian institutes and privately funded, individual US scientists shows how atmospheric and ionospheric electrical signals above the ocean and the land occur up to a few days before significant earthquakes. Several countries are now constructing satellites to detect these signals, although there is no scientific consensus yet about exactly how the atmospheric signals are produced by the earthquake. An international programme is needed to investigate and, if possible, establish systems of warnings of earthquakes and their aftershocks, and also other relevant geophysical information. Malaysia offers a potential model for what could be achieved; here, a science platform has brought together multiple agencies and scientists from multidisciplinary backgrounds to support the National Security Council in seeking a comprehensive solution to prevent reoccurrence of the recent devastating floods. The focus is seeking a holistic solution for the hazards that will affect the country in a changing climate. The location of this year’s meeting in the Tohoku region is where the highly damaging earthquake and tsunami struck four years ago. Since then, we have better warnings from greatly improved scientific understanding of how elevated and depressed tsunami waves are formed in the ocean above sub-marine earthquakes. We also have a much better idea of how they then progress upwards on sloping beaches or move backwards followed by even more dangerous upslope surge. This is important because, as a result of climate change, sea level is rising and high wind events are changing. Tsunami waves impacting on coast lines will only become more dangerous and some Pacific islands are already planning evacuation.
In northern high latitude countries, wind storms are also likely to become more frequent and last longer, as indicated by recent research on sensitivity of the polar jet to climatic warming in the Arctic. Recommendations from Sendai about the likely future of natural hazards and their impact should emphasise the connection with rising global temperature and acidification of oceans which destroys protective action on coasts and islands of coral reefs. There is pressing need for emphasis at the UN meeting on enhanced information and training for communities to reduce social effects of future hazards. A good case study is the Philippines government agency NOAH, which has pioneered methods for enabling communities to respond to complex, chaotic impacts when different natural hazards strike simultaneously, such as typhoons, landslides or volcanic eruptions. The prospects of moving these agendas forward at the conference in Sendai is unclear. However, these conferences have a track record of some success. For instance, at Yokohama in 1994, critical scientific and technical problems were identified as well as issues with international arrangements for communicating warnings about disasters and for assistance in their aftermath. As a result, errors in cyclone tracking have been reduced by 30%, through significant advances in research using satellite data and computer modelling, coordinated by the International Committee of Scientific Unions. Tornado warnings are also now more reliable, enabling more communities to take precautionary measures. Another, less welcome, conclusion in 1994 was that warnings about natural disasters could not be freely transmitted between countries because of national sensitivities. This meant that in several disasters, although the warnings by international centres were accurate they still did not reach thousands of people in exposed areas such as along coastlines, as was the case in the Burma cyclone in 2010. However, thanks to subsequent work by the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction and other agencies, which was incorporated into the Hyogo framework in 2004, warnings are now transmitted internationally. This is sometimes within minutes in the case of earthquakes and tsunamis. The UN meeting has potential not just to vet implementation of the Hyogo agenda, but also to set ambitious post-2015 frameworks for disaster risk reduction. One important development may be the creation of an inter-governmental platform.

2015-03-12T15:15:33Z,global-development,Global development,'My home in Syria had everything … now we live in a caravan' | Sam Jones,"In the small bag that seldom leaves his shoulder as he traverses the dusty thoroughfares of his surrogate hometown, Younis carries a bottle of aftershave, a photographic portfolio and a copy of his CV. The perfume is always close to hand because Younis is, like most 19-year-olds, more than fleetingly concerned with the way he smells and looks. But his pictures and résumé – not to mention the cribsheets on interviewing techniques and the history of journalism that also nestle in the grimy bag – are evidence of a deeper preoccupation. “I have them,” he says, “so that I am ready to show my work to anyone who asks. I’ve memorised the sheets and I know them like I know my own name.” A little more than two years after he and his family fled their village in southern Syria, Younis spends his days crisscrossing Za’atari in search of fresh pictures and stories for the camp’s refugee-run magazine. With 83,000 residents – it is the fourth largest city in Jordan – the camp makes up for in tales what it lacks elsewhere.
“I want to be a photojournalist so I can tell the world how people are living here and what Za’atari looks like,” he says. “When I take pictures and see them published, I feel proud.” Despite his enthusiasm for the stories of others – from the children who tied their scarves around the necks of the snowmen that rose from the desert floor during a white January, to the man who makes perfumes from roses and wood in the camp – Younis is matter-of-fact when it comes to his own. By the beginning of 2013, existence in his village in the southern Syrian governorate of Daraa had become impossible. In March the previous year, government soldiers looking for opposition spies found the sheltering villagers and began a random slaughter. “They went along us, saying ‘You’re going to heaven’ to one man, and ‘You’re going to hell’ to another one,” says Younis. “If they sent you to hell, you were either stabbed or shot. If they sent you to heaven, they let you live. I thought I was going to die, but the soldier said I was going to heaven.” Eight months later, he watched most of a family die as their car drove over one of the mines the soldiers had sown around the village. The device itself was a small one but the family, who were fleeing a neighbouring village, had a gas cylinder in the back of the car. Younis helped drag out and bury the bodies of the mother and her four children. The father, who was driving, was hit in the leg but survived to join the Free Syria Army (FSA).
“He went looking for death,” says Younis. “He wanted to join his family.” As soon as the FSA had cleared the mines and opened the road, Younis’s family headed over the border to Jordan, making for Za’atari camp. The initial plan was to stay for a fortnight and head back when things were calmer. That moment has yet to arrive and their home today is a cluster of prefabricated caravans gathered around a small yard that is protected from the elements by orange sheeting. Although the early March sun that finds its way through a tear in the fabric is fierce, it has its uses: one of Younis’s first jobs of the day is clambering on top of the caravans to set up the solar charger that powers the family’s lights and mobile phones. The television in the room where he sleeps is a decorative feature rather than a source of distraction; concerned by either the safety risks or the financial cost of the brightly coloured tangles of wire that tap the mains supply for power, the camp authorities shut off the electricity supply three months ago. Younis passes the time working on his journalistic projects, playing games on his mobile and hanging out with his friends at a gym and volleyball court run by Save the Children. “It’s really the only place where me and my friends can meet, so I spend most of the day here,” he says. “It would be good if there was a youth centre where people could meet and become more responsible: a fight here between two kids can quickly spread if their fathers get involved and then the villages and tribes pile in.”
Younis is phlegmatic about what has happened; he is grateful that his family is safe and pleased to have a nine-month-old baby sister (“made in Za’atari). But there are things he misses. High on the list is his dog, Jack, who was killed just over three weeks before they fled. “I went to see a friend and left him outside our house,” says Younis. “He barked at a police car and the officer got out and shot him. I saw the policeman the next day and he said, ‘If you ever get another dog, I’ll shoot you both.’” He remembers the date – 1 January 2013 – because he wrote it down in his diary. In his own quiet way, in the moments of boredom between the commissions and the visits to the activity centre, Younis is still coming to terms with the loss of his former life. “I feel happy here because I get to meet new people and we can build another house,” he says. “But my home in Syria had everything and now we live in a caravan. I know things won’t be back the way they were, but I can’t help comparing them.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/12/syria-refugees-zaatari-camp-caravan-younis,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/12/syria-refugees-zaatari-camp-caravan-younis
2015-03-12T11:12:52Z,global-development,Global development,Syria crisis: how to donate,"Many NGOs and UN agencies are working in Syria and among refugees in neighbouring countries, but the scale and duration of the crisis mean that needs consistently outpace funding. This list of aid agencies and organisations that have launched appeals for Syria is not comprehensive, so feel free to highlight others in the comments section below. British Red Cross Since 2011, the British Red Cross has given more than £8m to support the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement’s operations in Syria and neighbouring countries. It has worked with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, supporting their day-to-day operations. The British Red Cross has funded several delegates to work in communities in Jordan and it is funding unconditional cash grants for about 375 Syrian families. In Turkey, the British Red Cross also worked with the Turkish Red Crescent to help Syrians in seven refugee camps along the border. It provided 34,000 mattresses, 2,750 electric heaters, 6,000 tarpaulins and 11,500 hygiene parcels to about 6,800 Syrian families. How to donate: UK, International Cafod Cafod is working through trusted church partners in Syria to get vital aid and supplies to vulnerable people. It is also working in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan, to help refugees who have crossed the border. How to donate Care Care is providing services to Syrian refugees and host communities in Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt, and has reached more than 290,000 people. In Jordan, Care provides emergency cash assistance for refugees, and gives information on how to access further health, legal and social support. How to donate: UK, International Christian Aid Christian Aid is working through trusted local organisations and partners in Lebanon and Iraq, and within Syria to provide vital assistance to thousands of displaced families by distributing food, fuel for cooking, bedding, hygiene kits, cash assistance and psychosocial support. Christian Aid is helping especially vulnerable refugees, such as women and people with disabilities, access much-needed services. How to donate Hand in Hand for Syria Set up in 2011, Hand in Hand for Syria delivers medical and humanitarian aid into Syria, using its networks on the ground. The organisation also works with bigger partners, who are unable to gain access. It delivers food aid and educational materials, and works on water, sanitation and hygiene programmes and community projects. How to donate Human Appeal UK-based charity Human Appeal has delivered more than 10.3m kilos of flour across Syria, feeding more than 10 million people. It has provided a CT scanner and intensive care unit; created a safe village for 700 Syrians, including orphans, widows, the elderly and disabled people; and provided 50,000 emergency food, medical and hygiene packs. How to donate International Medical Corps International Medical Corps (IMC) provides critical health services within Syria, including lifesaving help through mobile medical units and by supporting existing healthcare facilities. At static clinics, where IMC provides primary healthcare services, it has nurses and doctors specifically focused on the needs of conflict-affected Syrians. Since April 2012, IMC has reached more than 115,000 Syrians in and around Damascus with general healthcare, mental health services and psychosocial support, blankets, cooking equipment, and other critical supplies. IMC is also scaling up operations in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, and Iraq. How to donate: UK, International International Rescue Committee The International Rescue Committee is marshalling a humanitarian response to help the thousands of people crossing Syria’s borders every day, as well as those trapped by the violence inside the country. It provides medical and other critical aid, helps women and girls who have experienced violence, and ensures refugees have access to their legal rights. How to donate: UK, International Islamic Relief UK Since 2012, Islamic Relief has implemented more than 223 projects to support vulnerable Syrians, not only in Syria but also in neighbouring Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan. These projects have varied from providing food aid, non-food items, education support, shelter assistance, psychosocial support, water and sanitation projects, and medical assistance. The organisation has reached more than seven million people. How to donate Médecins sans Frontières (MSF/Doctors without borders) Syria’s previously functioning health system has collapsed and thousands of medical staff have fled. Many others inside the country have been targeted for their work. There are massive unmet needs, millions of frightened and vulnerable people, and a dreadfully restricted aid response. Despite the extremely challenging security context – five staff were abducted in early 2014, and subsequently released – MSF continues to operate medical facilities inside Syria, as well as supporting directly more than 100 clinics, health posts and field hospitals. MSF is also working with patients from Syria who have fled to Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq. How to donate: UK, International Oxfam Oxfam has reached more than 1.5 million people affected by the crisis. It has provided nearly half a million refugees in Jordan and Lebanon with clean drinking water or cash and relief supplies, such as blankets and stoves and vouchers for hygiene kits. It is also helping families get information about legal and human rights and connecting them to medical, legal and support services. Oxfam has built shower and toilet blocks in refugee camps, informal settlements and on deserted routes used by people fleeing Syria, and has installed or repaired toilets in communities hosting refugees. The charity is also providing clean water to Syrians inside their country by rebuilding infrastructure, as well as water trucking and repairing wells. How to donate: UK, International Save the Children Save the Children says Syrian children are the forgotten victims of the war, and risk becoming a “lost generation”. More than five million children are in need of assistance, including more than a million Syrian children who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries. Save the Children’s teams have helped 275,000 children and family members with food, safe water, medicine, and shelter inside Syria, and are also working with children in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Egypt. How to donate: UK, International UN Syria Emergency Response Fund The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) has teamed up with the UN Foundation to collect online donations for the Syria Emergency Response Fund. Donations will help humanitarian NGOs and UN agencies to help the most vulnerable communities, those urgently requiring food, water, shelter and other basic needs. How to donate UNHCR The UN refugee agency says 3.8 million Syrians are refugees in “the biggest humanitarian emergency of our era”. The UNHCR has provided food aid to 1.7 million refugees, 350,000 children were enrolled in school, and shelter in camps was provided for more than 400,000 refugees. It provides refugees with cash for medicine and food, stoves and fuel for heating, and insulation for tents, thermal blankets and winter clothing. How to donate Unicef Unicef, the UN children’s agency, is working with its partners to minimise the impact of the crisis on children, not least in the life-saving areas of health, nutrition, immunisation, water and sanitation, and through education and child protection. How to donate: UK, International World Food Programme (WFP) The WFP is struggling to meet the urgent food needs of close to 6 million displaced people in Syria and neighbouring countries. Food operations are being run on a hand-to-mouth basis as funding is running out. For some refugees it has already run out. The WFP is assisting more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees in neighbouring countries, and providing food assistance to about 4 million people inside the country every month. How to donate World Vision Since the crisis began, World Vision has helped more than 1.8 million people in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq. It provides food aid, clean water and sanitation, education and psychosocial support for children, as well as other assistance.

2015-03-12T08:30:02Z,global-development,Global development,Young Syrian refugees give up hopes of education in Jordan | Sam Jones,"Ahmed Jabra wakes at seven each morning, eats his breakfast and then decides what to do with his day. If things aren’t unusually desperate – if there’s enough money to buy food for the family and milk and nappies for his two-year-old sister – he goes off to school. If they are, he grabs a big bag and heads out in search of rubbish. On a very good day, six hours spent rummaging through bins and rubbish heaps for tins, cans and bits of plastic will make him seven Jordanian dinars (£6.71). On a very bad day, the local kids will relieve him of every piastre he has been paid by the local scrap merchants. The Jabras fled their home on the outskirts of Aleppo three years ago when the shelling became unendurable. Today, the family of 10 lives in a two-bedroom rented house in the Jordanian town of Mafraq, eight miles from the Syrian border. Ahmed, who is 15, doesn’t mind missing school to support his family, but he can’t understand why the Jordanian children who rob him have to take the money he uses to buy bread for the family. “Syrians wouldn’t do that,” he says. “I can’t say anything to the kids who take my money; I don’t know what to say, except may God forgive you.” His father, Hmoud, could not feed his wife and children, even if he didn’t have a bad back, as Syrian refugees are not allowed to work in Jordan. “No father wants to see his son collect scrap, but what else can we do?” he asks.
Like many of the estimated 620,000 Syrians in Jordan, the Jabras are dependent on their children, who can work and earn under the radar. The support comes at a cost: parents often have to choose between feeding their children and educating them. According to Unicef, almost half of the 2 million children living as refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt and Iraq are not receiving any form of education, while only about 340,000 are enrolled in formal schooling. Most refugees live outside the camps and in host communities, where the strain they place on the public education system and other basic services makes them deeply unpopular. And Mafraq, which means crossroads in Arabic, was not a prosperous place before the the war forced hundreds of thousands of Syrians over the border.
The wealth evident in the capital, Amman, trickles away the further north you head towards the Syrian border. By the time you reach Mafraq, an hour’s drive away, the 4x4s have given way to battered saloons and the upmarket restaurants have yielded to filthy sheep who graze on the rubbish that can’t be collected and sold. Ahmed is aware that he may be sacrificing his future, but feels he has little choice. “When I was a kid in Syria, I wanted to be a judge,” he says. “But now I have to work. What can I do?” His cousin Mohamed, who came to Mafraq with his family in November 2013, often works 13-hour days lugging gas cylinders off a delivery lorry and up and down several flights of stairs. Although his big brother is three years older, 14-year-old Mohamed supports the family as their parents fear the police might mistake their eldest son for an adult if they caught him working and send him back to Syria.
Like his cousin, the teenager knows that each day’s work pushes his dreams a little further away. “I’d like to be a teacher or a doctor, but there’s no way I can do that because I don’t go to school here,” Mohamed says. “I’d rather be at school, but I have a responsibility to my family and I feel I’m contributing what I can.” Saba Mobaslat, Save the Children’s Jordan director, says the charity is doing what it can to ensure that the present circumstances of young refugees do not entirely determine their future prospects. “That’s a tough thing because they are accepting their new reality and they are accepting that they’re not fortunate enough to go ahead with their lives as they should be,” she says. “When you don’t challenge your new reality, you end up accepting whatever life dumps on you.”
As well as working in the Zaatari and Azraq refugee camps, the NGO helps get children to school, laying on buses, offering drop-in centres for working children, and providing cash assistance so that families can afford to send their kids to class. “Every single mother and father understands the value of education, but they can’t afford it,” says Mobaslat. “And it’s much simpler for a child to work than for an adult.” She has also been urging the Jordanian government to do more to bring refugees into the social and educational mainstream, warning that the consequences of ignoring a generation of marginalised Syrian children could be disastrous. “In my last meeting with the ministry of the interior, I said: ‘You either make sure those children go to school, or you’ll end up with a large number of children who are frustrated, angry, and uneducated – and they will be easily recruited by the wrong groups. In that case, the cost of your national security will triple – so you have to make a decision now.’” Mobaslat concedes that radicalisation is an attractive option. Not only does it foster a sense of belonging, it also offers job opportunities and a kind of welfare state. Seven or eight years ago, she talked to an Iraqi refugee in Syria about his options. “He said: ‘I cannot see a future; I cannot see a life. But someone promised me heaven after that. I cannot challenge that; it might be true. Why would I risk losing that opportunity? I’m ready to die for that.’ This is how desperate you become and this is exactly where we don’t want to be.”
When Mohamed thinks about Syria, he thinks of the family home, his friends, and the sheep he used to take to graze after school each day. Sometimes, he even allows himself a moment of optimism: “I hope that eventually things there will get better, but God only knows when.” Ahmed, who is only a few months older than his cousin, doesn’t dare entertain that possibility. “We won’t be going back,” he says. “Syria is in ruins. Even if we did go back, there’s nothing there.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/12/young-syrian-refugees-give-up-education-jordan-work,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/12/young-syrian-refugees-give-up-education-jordan-work

2015-03-11T17:15:22Z,global-development,Global development,Syrian refugees: 3.5 million people flee to neighbouring countries,"Four years after the start of Syria’s civil war, more than 3.5 million people have fled the country and registered in refugee camps in neighbouring states, while nearly 220,000 have applied for asylum in Europe, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The impact of Syria’s refugee crisis on the Middle East has been immense. Turkey hosts more than 1.5 million Syrian refugees, Lebanon is home to 1.1 million, and Jordan has registered nearly 620,000, the UNHCR said. Iraq hosts 232,800 Syrian refugees and Egypt close to 136,000. These five countries host 97% of Syria’s refugees, according to Amnesty International. About 80,000 Syrians live in Jordan’s Zaatari refugee camp, making it the country’s fourth largest city.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a credible source inside the country, estimates that 210,000 people have died in the conflict. About 6.5 million Syrians have been displaced within the country, according to the Migration Policy Centre. Syrian refugees now comprise 26% of Lebanon’s total population, placing a strain on humanitarian resources. Political pressure to stem the flow of new arrivals led Lebanon to impose strict entry requirements on Syrians at the end of last year, raising concerns that more displaced people will remain in danger inside the country as fighting continues. Syrians fleeing the civil war are also streaming across European borders. European law requires people to be physically present in the country they are petitioning for asylum. This has sparked a boom in illegal migration across the Mediterranean. About 218,000 Syrian refugees had applied for asylum in EU countries as of December 2014, according to the UNHCR. Germany and Sweden fielded nearly half of all asylum requests. The UNHCR’s data does not include internally displaced people or those who have not registered at a recognised refugee camp. Refugees are defined by the UNHCR as those with a legitimate fear of being persecuted because of their race, religion, nationality, or affiliation with a social or political group, and who are outside their country of origin. Asylum seekers are people whose claims of persecution have not yet been substantiated. According to the 1951 refugee convention, which was amended in 1967, “refugees deserve, as a minimum, the same standards of treatment enjoyed by other foreign nationals in a given country and, in many cases, the same treatment as nationals”. The UK has fielded asylum applications from fewer than 6,000 Syrian refugees, but the British government has committed £800m in humanitarian aid to the Syrian crisis, its largest response to a humanitarian emergency.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/11/syrian-refugees-asylum-seekers-unhcr,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/11/syrian-refugees-asylum-seekers-unhcr
2015-03-11T07:00:05Z,global-development,Global development,Ambitious goal of universal education needs $22bn annually | Mark Anderson,"Ambitions to achieve universal education and improve teaching quality in the world’s poorest countries will be jeopardised unless the $22bn (£14.6bn) funding required annually is met, a UN agency has warned, urging donors to ramp up donations. Aid to low-income countries for education must be increased fivefold to meet the sustainable development goals (SDGs) being discussed by UN member states, according to a report published on Wednesday by the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco). Donors will need to spend $10.6bn a year on educational programmes in low-income countries in order to progress towards the SDG targets, while middle-income countries will need $11.8bn, according to Unesco. These figures do not include previous aid flows, which have in recent years totalled $4.4bn. Governments cover many educational costs themselves, but ambitious targets will require more external help than is currently on offer, Unesco said. Educational aid to low-income countries amounts to about $2bn a year, and aid to middle-income countries is a similar figure, Unesco said. “This number would have to increase fivefold to enable these countries to meet post-2015 education targets,” it added. The report projects that the annual cost of working toward educational goals in low- and lower middle-income countries will more than double from $100bn in 2012 to $239bn annually between 2015 and 2030.
Programmes to improve educational systems in low-income countries will cost $36.3bn, while lower middle-income countries will need $202.9bn, according to Unesco. Low-income countries are defined by the World Bank as states with a gross national income (GNI) per capita of $1,035 or less. Lower middle-income countries have a GNI per capita of between $1,036 and $4,085. The sustainable development goals (SDGs), which are due to be agreed later this year and come into force in 2016, seek to send all children to school for a minimum of 10 years and call for quality early childhood development programmes. They aim to end dropout rates in primary and lower-secondary schools and improve the quality of learning by recruiting more teachers and driving class sizes down. “Failure to address the current $22bn funding gap for global education will jeopardise the new SDGs, potentially setting progress back over 30 years,” Unesco said. “Without a doubt, substantial new investment is needed if the world is to achieve the key education targets of the post-2015 sustainable development agenda.” The average yearly cost of sending a primary school student to school in a low-income country will rise from $65 in 2012 to about $200 by 2030, the study said. The cost of recruiting more teachers and raising their salaries, providing better learning materials and building new classrooms accounts for this rise, it said. But 121 million children of primary and lower-secondary school age are still not enrolled in educational programmes, Unesco said, underscoring the scale of the challenge ahead. Nigeria, Pakistan and Sudan have the largest number of children not in school.
The educational targets in the SDGs are an improvement from the millennium development goals, said Manos Antoninis, a policy analyst at Unesco and author of the report. “We are happy because essentially the new SDG … sees education as a whole. It doesn’t limit itself to primary education, which I think is essential.” Unesco warned that poor data meant that 49% of public expenditure data was not available between 2000 and 2013, and that no data was available for Nigeria. Costs associated with getting students into tertiary education and vocational training were not included in the report, it said. Gordon Brown, the UN’s special envoy for global education, has called for more funding to boost education networks in low-income countries. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network, which mobilises experts to offer support and advice on achieving sustainable development, has also pushed for more funding. The report called for renewed attention to the financing of educational development targets ahead of the UN’s international conference on financing for development, which will be held in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, on 13 July.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2015/mar/11/universal-education-shortfall-22bn-annually-unesco,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/datablog/2015/mar/11/universal-education-shortfall-22bn-annually-unesco
2015-03-10T13:15:05Z,global-development,Global development,Ebola crisis could force Sierra Leone to diversify economy away from mining | Clár Ní Chonghaile,"As Sierra Leone looks to rebuild after the Ebola epidemic, it may be forced to diversify from a mining-heavy economic base. Falling iron ore prices and the effects of Ebola on the industry signal the need for change, according to the chairman of the Chamber of Mines, who said the diversification could be beneficial. John Bonoh Sisay said mining companies will also have to change the way they interact with local people, placing a greater emphasis on supporting healthcare systems as part of corporate social responsibility. “In the long term, it’s not a bad thing to mature the economy in that way. There are other opportunities especially in agriculture, which, from a stability point of view, really does create a lot of jobs very quickly [and the] skills base is minimal,” said Sisay, who is also chief executive officer of Sierra Rutile, a mineral sands producer with a rutile mine in the south-west. Prices for iron ore have dropped as demand in China has slumped, and amid a global glut, causing a shakeup in Sierra Leone’s mining industry, which has also been battered by costs associated with the outbreak of Ebola.
More than 9,700 people have been killed by Ebola in the three worst-affected countries – Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. In January, the World Bank said the three nations would lose more than $1.6bn in lost output in 2015 alone, more than 12% of their combined gross domestic product. The World Bank said the main source of concern for Sierra Leone’s 2015 economic outlook, beyond Ebola, was iron ore mining and related foreign direct investment. British-based London Mining, which operated the Marampa iron ore mine, went bust in October last year. The mine was bought by Frank Timis, the founder of African Minerals, which operated the Tonkolili mine. Last week, African Minerals said it would appoint administrators after failing to repay its lender and partner in the Tonkolili project, Shandong Iron and Steel Group. In 2013, mining helped propel growth in Sierra Leone to 20% and sparked a flurry of investor interest in a country devastated by a 1991-2002 civil war. However, the boom has not translated into greater wealth for most people. Sisay, who visited London in February to meet business leaders and MPs, said the priority for iron ore companies in the next year would be survival. “We don’t know what demand is going to be, especially Chinese demand. We don’t know what the overwhelming strategy of the majors will be,” he said. “The immediate future is challenging, to be frank.” The mining industry has faced criticism for securing unduly favourable tax concessions from African governments desperate to harness resource wealth. In a report for the Institute of Development Studies in February, research fellow Jeremy Allouche said more investigation was needed into how mining might have left countries in west Africa more vulnerable to Ebola, noting there was no direct correlation but that the issue merited more study. His report also described how local populations had become disillusioned when the benefits of mining projects failed to trickle down. “There have been so many promises … that probably the local populations are losing some form of patience or confidence in the benefits of these,” he said. Sisay said mining companies also brought improvements – such as new roads – to remote areas where governments had little incentive to invest. He said Sierra Rutile maintained 80km of road from the main trunk road to its concession. “With the Ebola situation, we’ve … understood even more the importance of staying really connected with the wider community, and whilst it’s not our primary responsibility, we will focus more, from a CSR [corporate social responsibility] point of view, on public health issues, because obviously they have a direct impact on what we do and our operations,” Sisay said. He said more could be done by the industry to improve the transparency of contract negotiations. As well as iron ore, Sierra Leone has gold, diamonds and bauxite.
“One of the realities we need to accept is that mining investment in some developing countries is a high-risk investment, and the market unfortunately will not lend you money below a certain NPV [net present value],” Sisay said. NPV is a technique used to estimate the value or net benefit over the lifetime of a project. “Governments need that capital to come into country and so concessions are sometimes necessary. I do think there is a case to to be made for transparency … so people can understand why and what’s in [the deals].” The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), a global standard to promote accountable management of natural resources, has helped to improve transparency, Sisay said. Sierra Leone was accepted as EITI-compliant in April 2014, after an earlier suspension. Allouche also said the EITI process could lead to fairer contracts. “In any of these negotiations, there is such an asymmetry in terms of capacity of negotiation … the EITI is an important step and should be recognised,” he said. As it embarked on the recovery process, Sisay said Sierra Leone needed accessible credit for small- and medium-sized businesses, infrastructure investment and improvements in health services. He acknowledged concerns about corruption, spotlighted in a report last month by the auditor general showing the country had failed to properly account for almost a third of the money allocated to fight Ebola. “The headline news is not that people were corrupt … The headline news was that the auditor general was allowed to do the report,” Sisay said. “Getting it into the system now that people will be held to account bodes well for the future. It’s a long process. It’s a painful process, but it’s definitely a move in the right direction.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/10/ebola-crisis-sierra-leone-diversify-mining-economy,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/10/ebola-crisis-sierra-leone-diversify-mining-economy
2015-03-10T11:27:48Z,global-development,Global development,World leaders pledge to achieve gender equality by 2030 | Liz Ford,"World leaders have pledged action to fully implement laws designed to protect women’s rights and end discriminatory practices, following weeks of closed-door discussions that have been criticised by women’s rights activists. At the opening of the UN’s Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) in New York on Monday, government ministers adopted a political declaration confirming their commitment to achieve gender equality by 2030. However, almost 1,000 women’s rights and feminist groups issued a statement attacking the lack of transparency in the discussions around the declaration, which they said had resulted in a document that lacked ambition. The adoption of a declaration or outcome document from the CSW traditionally comes at the end of the two-week meeting, following negotiations that include significant input from civil society groups.
This year, however, the decision was made to agree a declaration before the annual conference, which this year marks the 20th anniversary of the landmark fourth world conference on women, held in Beijing in 1995, where 189 countries signed an action plan that identified 12 critical areas to empower women. The groups maintain that this year’s closed-door discussions, from which civil society had been largely excluded, had led to a political declaration that did not go far enough in committing to the transformative agenda needed to achieve gender equality. Lydia Alpízar, executive director of the Association for Women’s Rights in Development, told member states: “The text of the political declaration is weak and does not go far enough towards the transformative change that is needed for gender equality. We, women of the world in all our diversity, deserve much better than this. We deserve that you put aside your ideological, political and religious differences and fully recognise and affirm the human rights of women and girls and gender justice. Nothing less.” She called on governments to commit to increase funding to support gender equality. She warned leaders against “cherry picking” the rights they want to protect and discard, and added that sexual and reproductive rights should not be traded off in negotiations. In a statement, the International Planned Parenthood Federation said: “The political declaration presented an opportunity to look back at what has been accomplished and look forward to the work that remains. However, although we welcome the affirmation of the Beijing declaration and platform for action and its follow up reviews, and the recognition that the full implementation of these agreements is essential to achieving sustainable development, the International Planned Parenthood Federation is disappointed that the declaration did not go further in setting an ambitious agenda for the future.” In her opening speech to the CSW, the executive director of UN Women, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, told member states that progress towards achieving the ambitions of the Beijing platform for action, which has become a blueprint for gender equality, had been slow and uneven. “Serious stagnation and even regression” was evident in several areas, she added. According to UN Women, at the current pace of change, it will take more than 80 years to achieve gender parity in economic participation, and 50 years to reach parity in parliamentary representation.
Indigenous women, women with disabilities and women who have been marginalised because of their sexual orientation needed to be better served by their governments, said Mlambo-Ngcuka. Despite the adoption of new legislation to uphold women’s rights and amendments to national constitutions, “what has not been done is to implement many of these significant changes”, she said, adding that substantial steps to achieve gender equality must be evident within the next five years. “Yes, much has been done, and much of it worthwhile. However, what we chose to prioritise and act on has not led to irreversible and deep-rooted change,” said Mlambo-Ngcuka. “What has not been done, however, is to change the attitudes that perpetuate the culture of male superiority and the stereotypes that diminish women. This, unfortunately, has subverted the gains that the good laws can bring. There remains an unresolved clash between the modern laws and customary laws that has robbed us of the benefits of these good laws. If we do not address this, our progress will always be compromised. This is what we have to deal with now, once and for all.” The UN secretary general’s review of progress against the Beijing platform for action, launched at the CSW, listed five priority areas for change – ending discriminatory practices, reorienting macroeconomic policy to better serve women, ensuring the full and equal participation of women in decision-making at all levels, significantly increasing investments in gender equality, and strengthening accountability for gender equality and the realisation of the human rights of women and girls. “We seek truly bold actions in order to see accelerated implementation of the Beijing platform for action, so that in 2020, we can register far-reaching progress,” said Mlambo-Ngcuka. “In 2030 we want to be able to talk about a world that has achieved gender equality. A 50-50 planet.” On 26 September 2015, China and UN Women will co-host a meeting on gender equality and women’s empowerment at the UN general assembly.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/10/world-leaders-pledge-womens-rights-equality-csw-2030,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/10/world-leaders-pledge-womens-rights-equality-csw-2030
2015-03-10T07:00:03Z,global-development,Global development,Cameroon lawyer urges world to join her in fight against anti-gay legislation | Clár Ní Chonghaile,"Alice Nkom knows she might not be alive today were it not for international support for her battle to defend homosexuals in Cameroon. But now she wants the world to do more to breathe life into the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and make it tangible for all, including gay people in Africa. Nkom, a lawyer, has been in London to drum up support – both financial and moral – for her decade-long fight for homosexual rights in Cameroon, one of 38 African countries in which homosexuality is a criminal offence. Under Article 347 bis of its penal code, Cameroon prosecutes, sentences and jails “inordinately large numbers of persons” for consensual sexual relations between persons of the same sex, according to a February report by the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH). The report found threats to people identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex activists had risen sharply since 2010. With two cases before the supreme court, Nkom is challenging the constitutionality of the article, which punishes same-sex relations with up to five years in jail and a hefty fine. “If we unite our efforts and our resources, we will get the supreme court to join the other supreme courts in the world to firmly condemn the use of Article 347 as a basis for legal action or verdicts,” she said. “I need everyone because right now, I am a little isolated,” said Nkom, who founded the Association for the Defence of Homosexuals (ADEFHO) in 2003. “It’s on occasions like this that we must show we are one, united, universal in this fight.” The cases Nkom is fighting were spotlighted by the UN in 2012, when it expressed concern over reports of people in Cameroon being harassed, intimidated, arrested and imprisoned because they were suspected of being lesbian or gay. One involves Roger Jean-Claude Mbédé, who was convicted in 2011 of suspected homosexual conduct after he sent a text message to another man that read “I am very much in love with you.” His conviction was upheld by the court of appeal but Nkom has appealed to the supreme court. Mbédé died last year, but the case is still pending. The second case involves two men who were convicted in 2012 “on the basis of their appearance, which was perceived as effeminate, and the fact that they had been seen drinking Bailey’s Irish Cream”, according to the UN. Their convictions were overturned by the court of appeal but the government has appealed that ruling to the supreme court.
Despite death threats from critics who call her “the devil’s lawyer”, fierce opposition from institutions like the Catholic church, and the herculean nature of her self-assigned mission to change entrenched views, Nkom’s passion for the law remains undimmed, nearly 50 years after she became the first woman to be called to the bar in Cameroon aged 24. With an energy that belies her seven decades, Nkom explains that Article 347 bis was not in Cameroon’s original 1965 penal code but was signed into law in 197 by the country’s first president, Ahmadou Ahidjo, using his executive powers. This, she says, violated the principle of separation of powers. “Even in Europe, when we look at the countries that penalise homosexuality today, and I am thinking of Russia, we see that the problem is an absence of democracy. The two are linked,” she said. In July 2013, a leading activist and journalist, Eric Ohena Lembembe, was found dead at his home in Yaounde. His neck and feet were broken, there were signs of torture and his death brought international condemnation. The FIDH report said the police and the justice department used Article 347 bis. to convict people on the basis of their real or alleged homosexuality, “which is deduced from their appearance, their hair style, their attitude, the company they keep and even what they are drinking at the time of their arrest”. As the world prepares a new global agenda to drive development policies for the next 15 years with the stated aim of “leaving no one behind”, Nkom says it is time to make human rights truly universal. “This is a fight for human rights. Its does not pit African traditions against western traditions or the colonised against colonisers. Africa has the same universal values and belongs to humanity. It is not separate, and neither is Cameroon,” she said. Nkom, who is calling for a global coalition to bring minority rights into the mainstream, continued: “We have to teach African heads of state to take on the responsibilities of heads of state, and that means someone who is a guarantor of the lives, happiness and security of all citizens.” She added that support from outside was vital. “Diplomacy has a very important role to play because ... if I did not have the backing of United Nations member states ... I would possibly have been killed,” she said. Nkom needs funds to fight on: she lives in Douala on Cameroon’s coast, but the supreme court is in the capital Yaoundé. She produces documents to educate the legal fraternity and works with the community to dispel ideas that homosexuality is a form of witchcraft or linked to evil sects. “My number one enemy is ignorance,” she said, adding that without a push to change attitudes among the public, she fears any favourable supreme court ruling will have little real effect. However, there are some positive signs of change. Pope Francis’ reference to gays – “who am I to judge” – helped Nkom redefine her discussions with the Catholic church in Cameroon. Some members of the judiciary occasionally send her discreet messages of support, grateful for her willingness to say what they feel they cannot. “We must push the promotion of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in its universality, which has been proclaimed in speeches and studies for too long but which has never become a reality on the ground,” she said. “We must firmly call at UN-level for all countries to honour the commitments they have made, or I don’t know what they are all doing at the UN.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/10/cameroon-lawyer-campaign-against-anti-gay-legislation,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/10/cameroon-lawyer-campaign-against-anti-gay-legislation

The international development bill passed its third reading in the House of Lords on Monday and will now receive royal assent. Britain met the 0.7% target for the first time last year when it spent £11.4bn – or 0.72% of its GNI – on overseas aid. The 0.7% commitment was established by the UN in 1970. In 2013, only five other countries – Sweden, Norway, Luxembourg, Denmark and the United Arab Emirates – had met or exceeded the 0.7% aid spending target. The Netherlands had consistently met the target, but fell short in 2013. The UK’s international development secretary, Justine Greening, said: “Britain is the first major economy to meet the UN’s target on aid spending and I am proud that parliament has now passed this bill, which cements Britain’s global leadership in creating a world that is healthier, more stable and increasingly prosperous. “Tackling poverty overseas is about addressing the root causes of global challenges such as disease, migration, terrorism and climate change, all of which are the right things to do and firmly in Britain’s own national interest.” As well as committing to spending 7p out of every £10 of taxpayers’ money on aid, the law calls for continuous independent evaluation and monitoring of aid spending. The bill has been cleared for royal assent and is expected to come into force on 1 June.
The passage of the bill was met with jubilation by NGOs, who said it would bring stability to poorer countries, while encouraging other donor governments to meet the UN target. Ben Jackson, CEO of the Bond network of NGOs, said: “By enshrining this in law, we are ensuring that British aid will continue until it is no longer needed. It also sends a strong signal to developing countries that we will continue to keep our aid promise to them, and to other rich countries that they too must meet their aid targets.” Concern Worldwide’s executive director, Rose Caldwell, said: “We can be proud that we are the only G7 country to meet the 45-year-old UN commitment to spend 0.7% of GNI on development aid.”Diane Sheard, UK director of the ONE campaign, said: “The promise of a law to protect the UK’s lifesaving aid budget was in all major parties’ 2010 election manifestos. We are delighted that, in the twilight of this parliament, this promise has finally been delivered. “Now the debate must focus on the quality and impact of aid. Whoever forms the next government must ensure that most of the UK’s lifesaving aid goes to those who have the least so that we can end the injustice of one billion people living in extreme poverty.” Kevin Watkins, executive director of the Overseas Development Institute said: “Enshrining the UK’s aid commitment in law is significant, but there is more to development than aid, and the UK Government also needs to play a leading role in combatting tax evasion and climate change.” Despite a promise to enshrine the 0.7% aid commitment into law – it appeared in the manifestos of all three main political parties in 2010 – it took a private member’s bill, introduced by Liberal Democrat MP Michael Moore in September 2014, to secure the debate. Mary Creagh MP, Labour’s shadow international development secretary, said: “I am proud that more Labour MPs voted for this bill than all the other parties combined. This bill ensures that whoever is in government, our promises to the world’s poor will be honoured.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/09/uk-passes-bill-law-aid-target-percentage-income,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/09/uk-passes-bill-law-aid-target-percentage-income
2015-03-09T14:28:36Z,global-development,Global development,Are virtual currencies a plus for poor countries? – podcast transcript,"Reporters and presenters: MA: Mark Anderson AH: Alex Hern ZF: Zoe Flood Interviewees: JO: Josephine Ojiambo TS: Toby Shapshak ER: Elizabeth Rossiello EM: Eliud Mungai TT: Terlumun Tyendezwa TC: Terence Chua MA [Swahili spoken] JO Ah, you speak some Swahili. MA [Swahili spoken] JO Oh, it’s very good. I’m smiling. MA Josephine Ojiambo is responsible for political affairs for the Commonwealth Secretariat. JO Virtual currencies are a direct result of the growth of online communities and the need for a means of value exchange. MA Earlier in February, she chaired a round table on virtual currencies, what they are and what they might do for the economy. There were many nations represented. JO And I’ll name a few. We’ve got at the table indeed Kenya, Ghana. We’ve got at the table, Tonga from the Pacific Islands, India and also the UK and New Zealand. MA If you’ve heard of virtual currencies, you’ve probably heard of bitcoin. We’ll get to how they work in a moment but first, this is the vibe of the meeting. TT The major danger is the likelihood of abuse because of the anonymity factor. MA Terlumun Tyendezwa, head of the Computer Crime Prosecution Unit for the Nigerian government. TT I’m sure that almost every police force in the world will tell you they don’t have enough resources to fight crime, but there is a need to develop human capacity as well as get the requisite funding resources for equipment and training and all of that, and I’m sure no police chief will tell you they have enough resources. MA Terence Chua is from the attorney general’s office in Singapore. TC From a law enforcement perspective, the danger – if you want to call it that – is that anonymity makes it an attractive proposition for criminals to use in terms of hiding the money trails that we would normally use to try to get evidence against them. MA But it’s not all bad. TC I don’t think danger is really the right word. I mean, like any kind of currency, there are the upsides and there are downsides, the upsides of which are to consumers, obviously, is that it’s very convenient, some people like the anonymity, and of course it doesn’t hurt that at the moment bitcoin prices go up and down quite a bit and some people see it as an investment. And there are certainly advantages in terms of people trying to remit amounts back to their home countries, for example, when you’re working in foreign jurisdictions, without having to go through remittance services and then suffering transaction charges as well. So there are a lot of benefits to it. MA That’s what we’re talking about today, the difficulties of working with bitcoin, even just explaining what it is for people around the world. But we’ll also hear how the African continent is best placed to innovate in this area. Why? You’ll find out in this edition of the Global Development podcast from the Guardian. First, what is bitcoin and how do we use it? Alex Hern is a tech reporter, here at the Guardian. AH A virtual currency is any money which exists purely in the digital world. What it looks like is a digital wallet. You open it up, you have a balance at the top, you will have typically a QR code, a small grid of black and white squares, which someone can scan to get your wallet address if they want to send you money, and you have the ability to do similar if you want to send someone else money, or hook up to a smartphone’s camera or a webcam and you’ll be able to send money that way. MA It’s like a very, very basic internet, solely for money. There are other virtual currencies like bitcoin but the basic premise is the same. There’s no bank, no central office your transaction goes through … AH It’s a decentralised virtual currency. Every single person who uses bitcoin stores on their computer a record of where and when every single bitcoin ever has been spent. MA This is like a ledger where every transaction can be found. You’ll also hear it called the ‘blockchain’, so when you hear blockchain think about a virtual ledger. AH And you can go and look at every single bitcoin transaction since then on the computer of anyone who owns any bitcoin. What you can’t see, of course, is who holds these bitcoins The information is all stored under cryptographic signatures. MA Which leads us to our next big feature, anonymity. AH Those two properties combined, decentralisation and pseudonymity, meant the bitcoin was initially, and perhaps still currently, most popular for fringe legal and outright illegal uses online. MA We’re talking drugs, weapons, that sort of thing. AH The big question for the currency and its advocates is whether or not those uses are a majority or even a substantial minority of the currency which is what I would hesitate to say, or whether there are actually much smaller uses and there is a vast pool of legitimate uses. MA It’s a new technology, so governments are worried about how it will be used. Josephine Ojiambo again.
JO The must-haves with every technology would be what you’d call a very balanced line between regulation, which could be seen as restrictive, and what you’d call supportive supervision. Because technology advances in leaps and bounds, we’re now thinking of being more proactive and thinking of developing legal frameworks that will be set in place to address the issues of anonymity before crime or criminal activities actually take place. MA Of course, for all the dangers the prospects for bitcoin and others in Africa could be huge. For an idea of how the continent has got behind new ways of thinking about money, you only have to look at M-Pesa. JO It was an innovation of a young Kenyan and M-Pesa now has grown within the region and it’s used across the income sectors from low income to middle and high income for transacting business. I, as a Kenyan national, and others even know that you can transact M-Pesa from London and now from many settings in Europe and in the United States. MA I was fascinated to hear you say that you’ve used M-Pesa here in London. Do you mean that you’ve used it to send money back home, or how did you use M-Pesa while you were here? JO Both ways. My family sent me M-Pesa, they bought it in Kenya and then sent me money, and also I’ve sent money to friends in Kenya already. TS I have a friend who was driving back from the airport in Nairobi and a beggar knocked on the window and he said, “I’m sorry, I don’t have any local currency yet,” and the beggar whipped out his cellphone, tapped on it and said, “M-Pesa.” MA This is the writer, Toby Shapshak. TS Something like 40% of Kenya’s GDP passes through M-Pesa and something like $30m a day. This is very significant, it’s become a financial institution in its own right. You can pay for school fees, you can buy groceries, I’m told you can even bribe customs officials using M-Pesa. It’s a modern-day cheque system for the mobile era – it’s highly efficient. The friction involved is minimal, transacting is useful and easy, and the most important thing is you can do it on the most basic of cellphones, because Africa isn’t a smartphone continent yet, it’s going to get there but it’s just not there yet. M-Pesa’s activity is so significant that it had an impact on Kenya’s inflation. I mean, that’s a previously unheard-of statistic in terms of new forms of money.
MA But M-Pesa isn’t the only game in town. For Africans looking to send money without a bank account, without access to foreign exchanges, there are other innovations. TS Interestingly, what some people have been doing is sending airtime, you know when you buy airtime from, say, a cashier in a supermarket you get a till slip with a 12-digit number and you type in *111# and you put in the number and it’s a short code using USSD. That’s the technology that underpins it, and what people do is they SMS the code for the airtime to somebody else, so instead of having to actually use money you are using an airtime voucher as it is, and airtime itself has become a currency of its own. I mean this is just the smartest, savviest innovation out of necessity you can think of. People have found a way to get around the fact that there isn’t a banking system they can use or that’s cheap enough for them to use. They don’t have to register for M-Pesa or mobile money of any description, they can just send an airtime voucher and airtime itself is a currency. It’s got value that you can send and trade. MA And it’s not simply about other versions of credit. TS I think we’re going to see quite an increase in electricity solutions. People are going to find ways to use solar or get a solar installation. There’s several examples of how you can lay by to buy a solar torch, which comes in three different parts – the torch, the battery and the solar panel – and you pay for it bit by bit, by bit, and ultimately you own it. And, of course, one of the advantages of having, say, your own solar set up in your house is that not only will it power your own house but you can sell any excess capacity to say your neighbours. You know, there’s fantastic opportunities for small entrepreneurs who can use clever solutions and then be paid instantly by a mobile money. MA But being able to ignore the bank system is only one problem solved. The other is the expense that banks charge for each transaction, and that is something bitcoin could solve. Alex Hern again. AH Because there’s no central authority, there is no central authority setting a transaction fee, there’s no Visa or MasterCard or M-Pesa even taking a cut of every transaction to pay for the infrastructure. With bitcoin, ideally you have none of those costs. You do of course still have to pay for a computer and an internet connection so it’s not perfect. With remittances, potentially it’s even better, because of course a remittance typically someone sends one currency and receives another, so as well as the fee for simply moving money, which most companies will charge you, there’s the fee for a foreign exchange service as well. Those fees can be pretty astronomical actually, remittances firms are not averse to being slightly predatory. So theoretically the advantage of bitcoin is massive. It’s no more expensive, no harder to send a bitcoin from London to Pakistan than it is to send it from west London to east London. The problem is, of course, that most people today who live in London and want to send money to Pakistan don’t have bitcoin and want to send bitcoin, they have pounds and they want the recipient to receive rupees. That means that if you’re going to use bitcoin to make the payment, you still have to do two essentially foreign exchanges: you have to buy bitcoins with your pound and you have to sell bitcoins for rupees. Those there’s no guarantee they’ll be fee-free and in fact they probably will have a fee charged on them. So it’s not perfect yet. MA But if bitcoin takes off and people use it to buy goods … AH That remittance problem goes away. If I already have bitcoin in London because I do some portion of my daily business in bitcoin then I don’t need to pay a fee to turn anything into bitcoin, and similarly at the other end, if the person who’s receiving it has a lot of places they can spend bitcoin they don’t need to turn it back into Pakistani rupees. ER So we moved our offices out here to Karen, which is a leafier suburb of Nairobi, a little further away from the traffic because now we have … MA To see how bitcoin is beginning to take hold on the African continent, we sent reporter Zoe Flood to Nairobi, Kenya, to a start-up called BitPesa. ER So I’m Elizabeth Rossiello, I’m the founder of BitPesa, which is the leading digital currency exchange for Africa and what does that mean? It means we sell bitcoin and we accept bitcoin for remittance payments from abroad. It’s quite an upgrade from our last space, well our first space I guess was Charlene’s couch, then we moved up to the start-up garages with a shared incubator space with horrible coffee, and we graduated to above a dance studio which played classical music nonstop, and finally a real office here at the Karen Stables, where we have lighting and windows and, you know, all the rest. ZF Could you tell me a bit about the story of BitPesa? How did you come into being? ER Sure. I came to Kenya in 2009 to work as a microfinance rating analyst and what you saw was the institutions that successfully incorporated mobile money is their operating expense figures suddenly started to plummet. So, it was a really exciting time seeing this new technology have real change in the way businesses can be built and structured. You know, when I explain bitcoin to people back home in the US or here at my other home in Kenya, I find they get it at the same level. Here they just say oh, an international M-Pesa, and back home they’re like, oh OK, it’s sort of like PayPal but not really. So it’s interesting to see how quickly it’s picked up here. EM My name is Eliud Mungai, I am a Kenyan entrepreneur. Bitcoins I’ve been using since October 2014. BitPesa, I started using in December. I started using it for speculative stuff, buying bitcoins and just checking on the price to see how it’s moving and then I discovered about a platform called BTCJam, it aided in my micro-lending, I actually do micro-lending on the side, so I got into this platform and I found another valuable use for my bitcoins. So once I started using BTCJam and the trading became the conversion of the bitcoins to Kenya shillings frequent, that’s when I started using BitPesa. ER Right now in our beta version a customer has to already own bitcoin. You log on and you’re required to give your name and your date of birth and your address, which we scan against some security measures, so we perform the same sort of basic KYC, which is know your customer and any money laundering that all of the other remittance companies do. So when people talk about the kind of digital currencies being insecure that’s really a business decision, whether you want to put in place the same sort of legal and regulatory requirements that the other businesses have, and that’s something we’ve decided to do. And then it’s a simple QR code that pops up or an address, you’re asked to send the bitcoin to that address and within minutes – usually within two to five minutes – your recipient has received it on their phone. And the recipient has to know nothing about bitcoin, they’re not exposed to the price volatility, they’ve received the bitcoin within minutes before the price has fluctuated and it looks exactly like any other mobile phone payment. So your grandmother receiving the money in Mombasa doesn’t need to know anything about how you sent it. All she knows is that she’s received more money, quicker than usual. EM Trust is a very big issue because it involves money and people will need to gain that trust so that they can gain confidence in the service, but the biggest advantage in the Kenyan market is one, because of the Safaricom M-Pesa we’ve been used to it and also over the years we’ve gained a lot of trust with the brand of Safaricom M-Pesa. It’s a good market because we’re used to the services and because of these platforms that are coming, because they’re linked to M-Pesa, we find is entrusting them but also it’s speculative and it also takes a lot of risk-taking, but being young entrepreneurs it’s something we are used to, yes. ZF At this point bitcoin isn’t that well known in Africa. How do you plan to deal with that? ER Well, we’ve been building a community here in Kenya, which is exciting, so in early 2014 we would have weekly or monthly meet-ups where there’d be like three people, five people, but pretty soon by six months in we had a kick-off event with 120 people. I mean amongst the youth and amongst the tech community we definitely have made a name for ourselves and we do a lot of what we call kind of like information sharing so what is bitcoin, what is the blockchain, how are ways that you can use bitcoin and the technology, the apps that you’re developing in your businesses? We’ve done a lot of grassroots work on that front. We also have seen like sprouting up little mini-bitcoin companies, like companies that are looking to use bitcoin. There’s the first bitcoin conference being held in Cape Town next month, which is exciting, and there’s certainly like pockets of bitcoin adopters and users in Ghana and Nigeria. EM BitPesa, I use it let’s say like two times in a week. The biggest transactions I’ve done with it is for conversion, I’ve been able to get a loan to fund my retail business from BTCJam and I was able to convert, because it was a big bitcoin amount, I was able to convert it choosing BitPesa into Kenya shillings. And also now because I refer a lot of my customers who have been lending to BTCJam the amount that they need to be lent I convert it to bitcoin, so I use BitPesa on a weekly basis because I usually try to get at least two customers in a week, I convert their Kenya shillings to bitcoin so that I can lend to my customers. ZF Why is Kenya specifically an interesting market in which to test bitcoin remittances? ER Well, I happen to live and be working here in Kenya so that was one thing and I knew the market really well. I think it’s important when you’re looking to do a pay-out country exchange or a southern regional exchange to really know the regulatory environments, really know how operations work and that’s what was our competitive advantage. Myself and our COO, Charlene Chan, had been living here for over six years and had been working in this space, building financial products so we felt very fluent in this region. The other benefit of course is what everybody talks about, the penetration rate of mobile money, now that’s a blessing and a curse. It’s really exciting how high the penetration rate is and how much that understanding and that financial literacy has really affected our target population here, however you’re also very overly reliant on a single company’s technology, so while it’s a great place to start we’re excited to diversify into other markets where there are multiple mobile money operators and also better bank switches. ZF Smartphones are still emerging in sub-Saharan Africa, lots of people don’t have access to them. Is that a barrier to your business? ER No, I mean that’s exactly what our business does, we kind of bridge that gap in that we not only convert that client into local currency but we deliver it into non-smartphones as mobile money instantly. But we also offer the opportunity for people who do have smartphones and do have data access to purchase bitcoin, and of course if you’re interested in purchasing bitcoin you most likely know how to get a bitcoin wallet and have already learned a little bit about it. So, we provide kind of the whole spectrum and if you want to receive bitcoin as a payment from abroad you don’t need to come through us but when you want to cash that out into local currency that’s when you’d use our platform. So we’re really offering a service, both for those without smartphones and data access and more advanced consumers. MA Elizabeth Rossiello, speaking to Zoe Flood. Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have yet to take off but it feels like if this will happen anywhere it’ll be somewhere in Africa, where innovative solutions to finance have been around for years and where cellphones are the most popular form of computer. So putting the two together like M-Pesa and now BitPesa seems like a no-brainer. Alex Hern again.
AH Bitcoin works very well on a mobile phone. It’s perfectly possible to use bitcoin without ever touching a desktop bitcoin client. One of the downsides is the way mobile clients work for bitcoin, there is always someone with a backend doing a heavy lifting, and that means that there’s the risk that in the future those companies would start charging for their services. So whereas bitcoin on the desktop you can say will always remain fully decentralised – you will always be in charge of how your money travels through this network – you can’t quite say the same for mobile. So it may be a dead-end but we are also talking 20, 30 years’ time, we’re not talking in six months, they will put paywalls up. MA Toby Shapshak. TS Bitcoin’s advantages are how fluid it is to transact. There’s a fluidity and an ease of use built in to bitcoin that doesn’t exist in legacy financial markets. The problem, however, is going to be that it’s too complicated for people to understand, and of course it’s hard enough doing transactions in your own currency while pegging them against the dollar. You need to remember that a lot of countries do a lot of dollar-based transactions because of the certainty of hard currency and that its exchange rate doesn’t fluctuate much. So there are people having to do transactions in dollars and in their local currency and then of course they’d have to work out what the exchange rate to bitcoin is and bitcoin as we’ve seen has been highly volatile. People are just not going to use it because of its volatility. MA And Toby has one final warning to those looking to develop digital businesses in Africa. TS The thing to remember is that buying a smartphone is only part of the cost. The next biggest factor is having to pay for the cellular data and data in general in Africa, it’s very expensive through the cellular networks and they tend to be very punitive out of bundle rates, so whenever people’s data bundles run out they are oppressively charged a significant amount of money. So there’s a lot of fear of bill shock. MA But if places like South Africa and Kenya can get mobile infrastructure right, the rewards could be significant. JO The interface between what is seen as a local mobile telephony with an application for the developing world setting and that of a more, should I say, developed world setting on the use of bitcoin is now really on the table. It’s possible now to talk about mobile telephony in the developing world setting, and link it to virtual currencies and talk about the way forward, both in improving the efficiency of transactions, but also looking at regulation.

2015-03-09T13:00:57Z,global-development,Global development,Legal barriers prevent women's empowerment in more than 170 countries | Clár Ní Chonghaile,"Twenty years after the historic Beijing conference on women’s empowerment, more than 170 countries still have legal barriers in place preventing women from experiencing the same rights, protections and liberties as men and boys, according to a new report on trends in gender equality around the world. The World Policy Analysis Center at UCLA’s Fielding school of Public Health also found that more than 150 countries lacked protections needed to ensure women’s full participation in the economy, with only 64 countries constitutionally guaranteeing protection against discrimination at work or equal pay for equal work.
The report contains a series of policy briefs that examined trends and legislation in 197 countries and signatories to the Beijing platform for action, which envisioned gender equality in all dimensions of life. The briefs were released at the start of the UN Commission on the Status of Women in New York. “Despite the health, economic and ethical motivations for achieving gender equality, women and girls continue to have access to fewer opportunities than men and boys around the world. Closing the gender gap remains one of our greatest challenges,” the report said. “Too many girls still face early marriage or barriers to post-primary education. Too many women lack the economic resources that could lift them from poverty, protect them from violence, and safeguard their own and their children’s health ... These persistent inequalities greatly compromise the potential of girls, boys, women, and men everywhere,” it added. Most constitutions guarantee measures to ensure girls’ right to primary education and to protect women’s political rights, including the right to vote, right of association and right to hold legislative office. But protections lag in areas of economic and social rights, such as health, work, and marriage. There has been some progress: Over the past 20 years, more than 95% of the 56 new national constitutions legally guarantee women’s general equality. Australia is among 32 countries whose constitutions do not explicitly guarantee gender equality, while the US has a general guarantee of equality, but not specifically for gender. Eleven constitutions still allow customary or religious law to supersede constitutional protections of gender equality. Dr Jody Heymann, founding director of the World Policy Analysis Center and dean of the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, said constitutions were “a crucial toolkit”, which allowed people to claim their rights. “That’s why they are so powerful. What they don’t do is magically, like a wand, change everything on the ground instantly the minute they are passed. They are a ... powerful tool, but they are a tool,” she said. Gaps remain between rights guaranteed in constitutions and implementation. In Kenya, for example, the 2010 constitution states that no more than two-thirds of members of any public body should be of the same gender. In 2013, to abide by that clause, women were given one-third of cabinet posts, but there are still only 68 women in the national assembly, 19% of the total 350. “We are supposed to enact a rule by August to ensure we have the one-third gender quota but we still can’t work out how we will get the proportions (of women MPs),” said Esther Murugi Mathenge, a former minister and sitting MP, who was in London last week. “It is causing shivers because every man is asking, ‘Am I going to be asked to forfeit my seat?’ Who will forfeit their seat? No one. So you can see the battle we have,” she said. The World Policy Analysis Center said only 21% of constitutions grant the right to equal pay for equal work, while just 19% protect women from discrimination at work.
“While constitutional prohibitions on gender discrimination in employment have significantly increased over time, constitutional guarantees of equal pay for equal work are only slightly more common today than before Beijing,” the report found. Linked to this issue is maternity and paternity leave, Heymann said. Paid maternity leave is guaranteed in 188 countries but not in the US. Heymann said the argument that a constitutional guarantee was not necessary, as most companies provided paid maternity leave anyway, simply was not true. “Less than one in five women get paid maternity leave from their companies in the US,” she said, noting that the number referred to women in the formal economy. “The reality is that without the legal protection, women in the US don’t get anywhere near that fundamental right to maternity leave that dramatically changes their ability to succeed in the workplace, have an equal income in the long run ... as well as equal participation at home,” she said. “The US can and should introduce paid parental leave ... The data clearly shows that the US can afford it.” Another area where progress was needed, Heymann said, was paid leave for fathers. “We’ve had this big blind spot, as a global community, for the need for paid paternity leave. While there are only nine countries that don’t have paid maternity leave, there are 101 that don’t have paid paternity leave. That means that the law reinforces the stereotype that women are going to be the caregivers,” she said. The new studies, which include a series of maps documenting different aspects of women’s rights, aim to provide clear, transparent data for citizens so they can see how their countries fare in relation to others. “Before we did these maps, for many of the areas, you had to read 20,000 pages of legislation in multiple languages. That’s inaccessible,” Heymann said. As world leaders prepare to finalise targets to drive development priorities for the next 15 years, there are mounting calls for more reliable data to shape the global debate on the sustainable development goals. “We need to know where we stand, not only on outcomes but on the levers that will successfully achieve better outcomes,” said Heymann.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/09/legal-barriers-women-equal-rights-opportunities,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/09/legal-barriers-women-equal-rights-opportunities
2015-03-09T09:00:08Z,global-development,Global development,International Women's Day: Time to fund women's role in the cause of peace | Simone Filippini,"In 2000 the United Nations security council passed resolution 1325 which vowed to ensure that women and gender equality were placed at the forefront of international, regional and local peace-building and security policies. But 15 years later resolution 1325 is handicapped by woeful underfunding and women remain largely on the periphery at a time when enlisting their talents in the cause of peace and to combat extremism has never been so badly needed. Every day we hear about radicalisation and its devastating impact: families losing their sons or daughters to Isis in Syria or Iraq; the massacre in a school in Pakistan; Boko Haram’s kidnapping of more than 200 girls in Nigeria; and al-Shabaab’s attack on a mall in Nairobi. The international community’s response is to eliminate violent extremism with military might, while at home governments spend billions on security measures. Those responses are deemed to be necessary, but do we really think we can wipe out extremism and violence by applying extreme violence? Shouldn’t we focus more prominently on tackling the causes of radicalisation? If we don’t give people a perspective on human security, justice, schooling, health services, skills, and a basic income, there will always be a next generation of extremists. To create these perspectives in hotbeds of extremism such as Syria, Libya, Nigeria, and Afghanistan, thousands of local peace campaigners, community leaders and human rights activists, including many women, are risking their lives. But women are working at a considerable disadvantage and as long as we, the international community, do not give our full political and financial support to their peace-building and state-building efforts, we will only see more violence in the future, however large the military response. By failing to take women and girls on board in issues of peace and security, the world loses a lot of its potential power to counter violent extremism. Resolution 1325 gave us the political framework to get women on board and to change the perception of women from victims to decision-makers in conflict resolution processes. Yet 15 years later, donor countries invest billions in military security to counter violent extremism, but fail to allocate the resources to implement 1325. This lack of political will to generate adequate funding deprives the world of a most effective response to radicalisation.
Take the Afghan Women’s Network (AWN), a network of more than a hundred women’s organisations and 5,000 courageous individuals. They work tirelessly in perilous conditions to push for the implementation of resolution 1325 and also take part in rebuilding the country. They fought and survived Taliban rule. They risked their lives by casting a vote in the 2014 presidential elections. They refused to go back to square one. And their struggle continues. Afghan women remain shamefully under-represented in government. More than a decade after Taliban rule, “rights that should be handed to us are not recognised. We still have to go to the streets to take them”, says Samira Hamidi, board member of AWN. In 2000 the world promised to support women who dismantle the culture of violence and promote gender equality in the direst of situations. We broke that promise. Only 46 out of 193 UN member states have developed national plans on resolution 1325. None of these plans have yet received adequate funding. And as Hassina Safi, AWN director, puts it: “If our pocket is empty, we cannot do anything. If we have little money, are planned and strategised, we can really trouble shoot a lot of problems.” The costs of inaction are high. Women are active agents of change in their communities and societies. Preventing them from using their full economic, peace-building and state-building potential in their countries is a threat to global security. So how can we pressure governments to put their money where their mouths are? The framework of security council resolutions is clearly not enough. What we need now are sustainable and effective funding mechanisms to back their implementation.
Building on the mandate of resolution 1325, UN Women, Cordaid and the Global Network of Women Peacebuilders (GNWP) led the formation of a discussion group. At the first meeting in June 2014, the members embraced the idea of establishing a five-year mechanism to address the shortfalls in quality funding, titled a global acceleration instrument (GAI) on women, peace and security. But the GAI envisaged by the group, which also includes donor governments and post-conflict UN member states, would be more than a financial mechanism. It would also act to empower women in the forefront of the struggle for gender equality and human rights in areas of armed conflict. Several member states have been very active in supporting the GAI, in particular Japan and Sierra Leone, which both have government representatives on the committee preparing the detailed proposal for the GAI. Sierra Leone is also championing collaboration with local NGOs, and Japan has demonstrated its commitment to support the initiative. UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon underlined that “adequate financing [of resolution 1325] remains a pervasive challenge”. Capitalising on the momentum of the 15th anniversary of 1325, Cordaid, GNWP and UN Women aim to launch the GAI in October 2015. At the 59th session Commission on the Status of Women from 9-20 March, we will call on leaders and policy makers all over the world to follow the example of Sierra Leone and Japan. After 15 years of promises, it’s time to act and to pay. Without women and their leadership in peace and security issues, a peaceful future barely stands a chance.

2015-03-09T07:00:06Z,global-development,Global development,Activists blast 'bland' UN declaration as step backwards for women's rights | Liz Ford,"Women’s rights activists have expressed alarm at the proposed wording of a UN declaration that they say could portend a major step backwards for women’s rights. The text of the declaration, due to be published on 9 March at the start of the annual Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), has been branded bland and unambitious. This year’s CSW will mark the 20th anniversary of the landmark fourth women’s world conference in Beijing in 1995. The conference’s platform for action, signed by 189 governments, identified 12 critical areas to empower women, such as greater involvement in decision-making and in conflict resolution, improving the rights of girls and ending violence. At the time, the agreement was seen as far-reaching and a blueprint for achieving women’s empowerment. The two-week CSW, held in New York, will review progress made in implementing the Beijing recommendations over the past two decades. But last week, the Women’s Rights Caucus, which monitors discussions at the CSW, said it was concerned that the language in the declaration was being watered down by certain UN states. The caucus called on organisations to add their signatures to a statement demanding the declaration be strengthened. “At a time when urgent action is needed to fully realise gender equality, the human rights and empowerment of women and girls, we need renewed commitment, a heightened level of ambition, real resources, and accountability,” said the statement. “This political declaration, instead, represents a bland reaffirmation of existing commitments that fails to match the level of ambition in the Beijing declaration and platform for action and in fact threatens a major step backward.” It added: “Governments cannot pick and choose when to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of women and should not do so in this declaration.” By Thursday, more than 770 organisations had signed the caucus statement. It is understood that Russia, the Holy See (which has a seat on the UN as a non-member permanent observer state), Indonesia, Nicaragua and the Africa group of countries have tried to limit references in the text to human rights and to remove mention of the role feminist groups play in advancing gender equality. These states argue that human rights was just one chapter of the Beijing platform for action, rather than an overarching theme. Caribbean countries are also understood to have failed to step up to support women’s rights. Turkey, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Japan, Canada, Philippines, Chile, El Salvador, Australia and the EU are believed to be among those that have repeatedly challenged any removal of references to human rights. The Holy See is also thought to have wanted mention of a standalone gender equality target proposed in the sustainable development goals removed from the declaration. Any specific reference to women’s rights activists is expected to be lost. The pushback on women’s existing rights from these states is not unusual in UN political statements, or are their attempts to block any progressive moves forward. A record 8,600 civil society activists have signed up to attend this year’s CSW, which, as well as reflecting on the Beijing agreement, will discuss its relevance to the proposed SDGs, which are due to be implemented next year.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/09/un-declaration-step-backwards-for-womens-rights-csw,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/09/un-declaration-step-backwards-for-womens-rights-csw
2015-03-08T11:00:03Z,global-development,Global development,International Women's Day: Number of female lawmakers doubles in 20 years,"The percentage of female lawmakers has nearly doubled over the past two decades, but the hefty impact of quotas that require a minimum amount of women MPs may soon wear off, forcing new gender equality strategies to be introduced, the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) has said. Electoral quotas, which require countries to appoint a minimum number of female lawmakers, have been rolled out in more than 120 countries, according to the IPU. These quotes are “central” to the strides the world has made in closing the political gender gap, it said. The global average of women in parliament has increased from 11.3% in 1995 to 22.1% in 2015, according to the IPU. But progress in raising the number of female lawmakers has slowed in recent years, said the IPU’s secretary general, Martin Chungong.
But the organisation said “a significant brake on progress in 2014 could be an indicator that the fast-track impact of quotas has reached its peak and other measures investing in women’s political empowerment are needed to complement quotas”. “After the optimism and belief in 2013 that gender parity in parliament was within reach in a generation, the lack of significant progress in 2014 is a major blow,” said Chungong. The IPU is a 126-year-old organisation that coordinates dialogue between parliamentarians from around the world, with the aim of promoting human rights and democracy. Rwanda came top of the most recent rankings with 63.8% female lawmakers, while 13 countries registered 40% or more women in the lower or single houses of parliament. Along with Rwanda, Andorra and Bolivia have made the most progress since 1995 in improving women’s political reputation, the IPU said.
Only three countries – Finland, the Seychelles and Sweden – ranked among the top 10 countries for female MPs in both 1995 and 2015. Four countries from sub-Saharan Africa – Rwanda, Seychelles, Senegal and South Africa – ranked in this year’s top 10 for women lawmakers. The Americas region made the biggest strides in promoting political gender equality during the reporting period, raising the percentage of female lawmakers from 12.7% in 1995 to 26.4% in 2015.
Chungong said the data is “a timely reminder that progress is not a given” and added: “Political action and will must remain a constant if we are to successfully tackle the gender deficit in politics. There is no room for complacency. “Although 2014 didn’t deliver on the expectations of 2013, the last 20 years have made it clear that women are now partners at the political table. The challenge now is in making sure women become equal partners in how democracy is delivered.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2015/mar/08/international-womens-day-number-of-female-lawmakers-doubles-in-20-years,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/datablog/2015/mar/08/international-womens-day-number-of-female-lawmakers-doubles-in-20-years
2015-03-08T08:52:22Z,global-development,Global development,International Women's Day: The fight for better maternal health care in Uganda | Jackie Tumuheirwe,"Childbirth deaths around the world are down by half in recent years – and by building strong demand from citizens in countries like mine where women are most at risk, I have seen how we can bring the death rates down still further, and rapidly. I live in the rural area of Kabale in south-west Uganda. I am a mother and work in the local radio station, Voice of Kigezi. A year ago, I became one of six volunteer citizen reporters with the White Ribbon Alliance, which is holding our government accountable for its promises to women’s health. We did a three-day training course in using cameras to track and report on progress – or lack of it – and also raising awareness in our communities about women’s rights to maternal health services. In 2011, the government of Uganda promised us that by 2015, comprehensive emergency obstetric care – which can save women’s lives through caesarean sections and blood transfusions – would be available in half of all our top-tier health centres, which are close to where most women live. That would mean an end to pregnant women walking long distances to receive healthcare, often in the late stages of labour and sometimes giving birth and dying by the side of the road. So often we see babies with their umbilical cord tied with a torn strip of a mother’s kanga. I was pregnant at the time. My task was to check on the gaps between what has been promised by our government – and the reality. There are many wide gaps. Citizens in my area had already gathered evidence through a White Ribbon Alliance Uganda checklist and survey. We found that not one of the health centres in my district even had a doctor. We found that many women were dying terrible deaths that could have been prevented, and even more newborns were dying for lack of basic care and simple resuscitation.
We began to mobilise our community, and thousands of people demanded faster progress through petitions, meeting with our MPs and reports to the media. Our district health officer took action. He invited doctors to come to the area and tell us about anything that would deter them from living and working in Kabale. The young doctors reported back about the difficulties they would face, including poor salaries, lack of electricity and of decent accommodation. In one health centre, they found electricity was off because the bills had not been paid and midwives were trying to do caesarean sections by the light of their mobile phones. One small house built to accommodate a doctor was already home to half a dozen other health staff, and where would they live if a doctor arrived? The district health officer made a major effort to overcome these problems, and to encourage new medical staff to stay in post. Now, for the first time, we have seen six doctors working in my district, available to save many lives. However, during all of this good news, I went into labour and I lost my own baby in childbirth. If this had happened before I had started citizen reporting, I would have shrugged my shoulders like most women in this situation do and said: “It is God’s will.” But because I had done this training, I realised that the hospital was negligent and my baby’s death could have been avoided. I understand that nothing will bring back my baby, but I know I have a right to demand better services for myself and my fellow women in the future, and so I have filed a case against the hospital. I am determined to hold those responsible to account. We will not meet the millennium development goal for maternal health in Uganda, but we are making progress, and we are holding citizens’ hearings in a number of areas across the next few weeks to have a dialogue with our leaders and work together for better health for women and newborns. We must also make sure that accountability is built into the next set of goals, the sustainable development goals. People like me can and must speak out about the poor state of maternal health in our country. I have also written a song about my experience which I hope will be broadcast on the radio to alert other families of their rights. Justice must be done.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/08/international-womens-day-fight-better-maternal-health-care-uganda,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/08/international-womens-day-fight-better-maternal-health-care-uganda
2015-03-07T01:00:01Z,global-development,Global development,International Women's Day: Many sisters still doing it for themselves despite rhetoric on gender | Clár Ní Chonghaile,"Under a twinkling chandelier in a gilded room at the Irish embassy in London, Binti Ali Kiza walked slowly to the podium. She looked nervous and cold, despite the blanket over her shoulders and the woollen cap on her head, but her voice was firm as she said: “This is the voice of a grassroots woman.” The Kenyan activist had flown from her home on the humid Indian Ocean coast to take part in a Women in Power event organised by UN Women and VSO to celebrate International Women’s Day. As world leaders debate what to include in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that will define the global agenda for the next 15 years, there is much talk about the need for gender parity. There is much talk about giving women like Kiza a voice in global decision-making. But if talk is cheap, then the actual support given to women’s groups, like Kiza’s Sauti Ya Wanawake (the Voice of Women), seems cheaper still.
Kiza has been an activist for 15 years, working with local communities to encourage women to fight for their rights and helping victims of gender-based violence. “We have faced many challenges,” she told the ambassadors, NGO heads and young volunteers in London. “Those who don’t accept what I am doing say I am a home-breaker, I don’t respect our culture, or ‘Who are you to speak to a man?’ “I have to stay in my office all day and there is no furniture or fans. I have been left with no money to feed my family ... When women have nowhere to go they stay in my house,” she said. Tracking humanitarian funding for gender equality and women’s rights programmes is difficult – the markers that exist only capture some of the data. Campaigners say this information gap hinders the development of efficient policies, exacerbates coordination problems, and sidelines women’s groups. Jessica Cruse, a 25-year-old volunteer with the International Citizen Service who worked with VSO on a sexual and reproductive health project in Zambia, has seen this lack of funding firsthand. “There were times when ... the local organisation just ran out of funding,” she said, noting that local directors often paid for activities out of their own pockets. Cruse said a lack of trust, sparked by reports of corruption, sometimes scared donors off. “All organisations are painted with the same brush, but grassroots organisations have the expertise and the local knowledge. Yet nobody is investing in them monetarily ... it’s a true shame and it’s counterproductive,” she said. This anecdotal evidence is mirrored in more empirical studies. Emily Esplen, lead policy analyst on gender equality and women’s rights at the OECD’s Development Co-operation Directorate, conducted a study on funding to gender equality in fragile contexts and found only 1% of gender equality-focused aid to fragile states in 2012-13 was channelled to women’s groups. “There is not enough support, financial or other, for women’s organisations that are often doing fantastic stuff at the grassroots level with very little support ,” she said.
Angela Salt, the director of VSO in the UK, said women often used funds more effectively and had different priorities from men. “Women are often the ones who have to go and get the water. They are going to think differently about how close the well is. Women are often the ones that do healthcare and childcare, so when it comes to setting the district budget or regional budget, they are going to prioritise the funding of healthcare more, perhaps, than their male counterparts,” she said. Nicky McIntyre, executive director of international women’s fund Mama Cash, said growing awareness of the importance of investing in women and girls was positive. “But we are really clear that it hasn’t translated into funding, at least for the organisations we are supporting,” she said. Mama Cash provides grants to around 100 groups led by women, girls and trans people, using funds raised from individuals, corporations, foundations and governments. In a 2013 report, the Association for Women’s Rights in Development (AWID) put the total funding for a sample of 740 women’s organisations at just $106m (£70.4m), a fraction of the budgets of the largest international NGOs. In a separate study, AWID found that from 2005-2020, $14.6bn (£9.7bn) had been pledged by the corporate sector and other new actors for investing in women and girls. However of the 170 initiatives mapped, only 27% engaged women’s organisations as partners, and only 9% directly funded them. Most of the money went to larger international NGOs, that might subcontract to smaller groups but mainly to implement their own priorities, McIntyre said. “This signals a lost opportunity to connect with, and benefit from, the history, diverse experiences, and insights of women’s organisations that have been doing related work around the world for decades. At the same time, there is a parallel trend of increasing mistrust in the NGO sector,” the report said. McIntyre said women’s groups also lost out because of an inherent bias against women handling large sums of money or because these organisations were not on the radar of big international donors or NGOs. “Because smaller women’s groups have smaller budgets, and a limited capacity, they are not going to be able to access these larger funds, they will continue to be bypassed,” she said. “Unless we address that barrier ... we are going to keep hearing about these big pots of money but they are not reaching these groups. They are stopping with international NGOs,” she said. McIntyre said that there were some positive initiatives such as the Dutch government’s Funding Leadership and Opportunities for Women (FLOW) fund, which has a budget of €80m (£57m) for 2012-2015 for women’s organisations in the global south. “I do see a growing cadre coming to the table, a growing buy-in and a greater willingness to do more core support, more flexible support, and that is getting traction,” McIntyre said. While rhetoric clearly does not translate directly into dollars, VSO’s Salt said a standalone goal on gender equality and women’s rights must be included in the SDGs because the new targets would dictate “emphasis, importance and funding”. “It’s absolutely key that we try to get gender equality and women’s rights separately and appropriately treated,” she said. “There is a fragile consensus on it now, but it certainly is fragile and that’s why we and other organisations are making sure we don’t lose a day between now and September to press the world as a global community to understand ... the need for gender equality.” Kiza just wants to continue her work, which, as a mother of two young men and a teenage daughter, starts very much in the home. She takes her sons – aged 25 and 18 – to her meetings so that they can see what she has to say. “I want support so that I can reach out to the grassroots women in the villages,” she said. “If we do not support women, gender-based violence can’t be finished. It is like a circle of violence. It’s going round and round and round. But if we educate the women and train them, it can be reduced.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/07/international-womens-day-grassroots-womens-groups-going-it-alone-despite-rhetoric-on-gender,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/07/international-womens-day-grassroots-womens-groups-going-it-alone-despite-rhetoric-on-gender
2015-03-06T17:11:44Z,global-development,Global development,"‘If I am alive, I must have an education’: the refugee girl who crossed a border to go to school","When she ran for her life, Grace took her schoolbooks with her. It was December 2013, in the town of Bor in South Sudan, and Grace, 17, knew that she had to go. She ran fast, with hundreds of others including her 14-year-old sister, Anna, and their father, down to the river. Crossing it was their only means of escape from the anti-government rebels who were attacking their home. Small children were running too, clutching their parents’ hands, slipping in the dark, in desperate flight from the slaughter unfolding around them. “You see someone killed in front of you, and then someone is killed behind you, and you and the others are still running,” Grace recalls, in a new film about refugee children in conflict zones, Kids in Camps, by the director Jezza Neumann. “People just run into the water … most of the children who don’t know how to swim just drowned because the river was very long. It can take 30 minutes, and if you don’t know how to swim you will not be able to cross. What you were thinking is: ‘Are you going to be alive, or are you going to be dead?’” Once she had reached the relative safety of the Minkaman camp for internally displaced persons (IDPs) on the west bank of the Nile, the problems Grace confronted were rather different. Instead of trying to run away, she was now on a search of her own: for an education. The nearby village, around which the camp has grown up, has a primary school for 300 pupils. With the sudden influx of fleeing families, its roll has swelled to more than 1,000. It is overcrowded and under-resourced, but Anna attends its classes and tells other children in the camp that they should, too. But there is no secondary school for Grace. “It was so hard in the camp, just to wait and wait, hoping for changes and that there would be a high school,” she tells me down a crackling phone line from Kenya, where she now lives. “People in charge in the camp kept saying there might be a school, so I stayed there for eight months. And then it was September and there was no school. So it was a waste of my time.”
Nor does there appear to be any hope of an education for the two other South Sudanese children Neumann met while filming in a transit camp just across the border in Uganda. John and Scovia, both 14, are being “resettled” rather than accommodated long-term in a camp, according to the Ugandan government’s policy on refugees. Loaded on to trucks, driven for miles and then dumped on the side of the road in the middle of the bush, their families are given washing-up bowls, pots and pans and a machete with which to clear the head-high scrub. The prospect of settling here is ridiculously removed from the reality of these traumatised families’ previous lives. These cases are all symptomatic of a broader issue. Without the chance of a decent education, these children know their future is slipping away. Their concerns are echoed by humanitarian NGOs: how to educate children displaced in emergencies is a problem that has never been more urgent. And yet the paltry sums that international donor governments are prepared to stump up to educate children who have been forced from their homes are starkly shaming: according to figures from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs [pdf download], just 1% of all humanitarian donor money went to education in 2014.
In the Ugandan transit camp, there’s no school, and no plan for a school. The children are not impressed: what emerges most strongly from Neumann’s film is their burning desire for an education. Likewise, months after she snatched them to take with her as she fled, Grace still cradles her schoolbooks, knowing that while international aid agencies will help her with clothes, food and shelter, her precious textbooks would never be replaced. It is perhaps not surprising that aid agencies’ priorities tend towards steps that can produce more immediate, measurable results. And the more people there are in need of help, the smaller the share of aid resources available for education. Two million people in South Sudan have died and four million have been forced to flee since the world’s youngest country gained independence in 2011. Worldwide, half of the 57 million children out of school live in conflict-affected areas. And the number of children being displaced from their home region is increasing. Figures published by the UN last June showed that there are now 51.2 million forcibly displaced people across the globe – six million up on the year before, and the first time since the second world war that this figure has exceeded 50 million. Half of all refugees are children – and once you’re a refugee, you’re likely to stay a refugee for a very long time. According to the UN High Commission for Refugees report last year, on average, a refugee spends 17 years of his or her life in exile. For a child, that’s their entire primary and secondary education gone. The long-term ramifications are huge. Not being able to access education is an individual disaster for every affected child. But for fragile states struggling to establish enough stability and security to enable traumatised populations to return home and start to rebuild, millions of people going without education becomes a national catastrophe.
The vast exodus of Syrian children fleeing the conflict in their country during the past four years has highlighted the education crisis experienced by many millions of displaced children elsewhere, as well as highlighting the shocking inadequacy of the international community’s response. “A lot of people think children can be out of school for a year and easily catch up,” says Claire Mason, who advises on education in emergencies for Save the Children. “Maybe in a developed nation with a strong education system that’s true, but for a child in a fragile country, it’s definitely not.” Education in emergencies, she says, must be given far higher priority that it has been to date: “The international humanitarian response focuses on food, water, shelter and medical aid. But when we’re talking about children growing up in the most marginalised communities in the world, it’s vital to realise that education is also lifesaving.” At the charity War Child, chief executive Rob Williams points out that the UN’s regular appeals for food aid receive an average of 80% of the sum being asked. Medical aid gets funded at a rate of around 58%. When there’s an appeal for education, the UN receives only 40%. This, he says, is “obviously nowhere near enough”.
Even where there’s a solid plan for providing children fleeing terrible violence with at least some degree of education, the funding lags behind the need. In Lebanon, which has absorbed almost 400,000 Syrian children into its towns and villages, the government has committed to run its schools on a “double-shift” system: local children for one half of the day, Syrian children for the other. Plainly, this total overhaul of a country’s national education system cannot happen for free – but only $100m of the $263m that’s needed to make it happen has been pledged by countries under far less pressure from the Syria crisis than Lebanon. “We all know that humanitarian money prioritises food, water and shelter,” says Williams. “But food and water and shelter are easy. You can deliver it on a truck and put a donor logo on it. But you can’t stick your logo on a child’s forehead and say: ‘This child’s education is a result of my funding.’” Worse still, the proportion of humanitarian aid dedicated to education is shrinking. There is clearly, says Williams, “something wrong with the humanitarian dollar”. Long-term development money – different from emergency humanitarian funding – doesn’t fund education in emergencies either, because donor governments like to fund projects they see as sustainable. When they look at refugee camps, the immediate thought is: “temporary”. “You need a third kind of money that’s not humanitarian or development,” says Williams. “A global fund for education in insecure and fragile states is a really attractive idea.”
In the run-up to the Oslo education summit in July, Gordon Brown, the UN special envoy on education, is calling on governments to pledge money for something similar: he wants specific donor funding to ensure that agencies can do detailed preparedness planning so that they can swiftly move to offer high-quality education to children displaced by conflict and emergencies. “Every time there is a crisis the UN has to plead, hat in hand, to fund education, which everyone now knows is a key part of the solution,” he says. “Half of the out-of-school children in the world are in fragile and conflict situations, and it is not acceptable for the international community to ignore this or assume it’s too difficult to sort. It is not too difficult.” And if it’s not done, the risks, Brown says, are obvious. Research on Sierra Leone published in the American Journal of Political Science shows that children who had no education were nine times more likely to join rebel groups, and five times more likely to join government militia, compared to those who’d completed primary school and embarked on secondary.
“Out-of-school children are always at greater risk of violence, trafficking, recruitment into fighting, prostitution and other life-threatening, often criminal, activities,” Brown says. “Crucially, providing education in emergencies sustains progress. It is wholly unacceptable that children forced to flee their homes and schools because of conflict are then denied a future. A short-term crisis should not result in a complete loss of learning and opportunity for any child.” At the International Rescue Committee in New York, Jennifer Sklar, senior technical adviser for education, expands on his point. “One of the most compelling reasons for providing quality education in refugee camps is that often recruitment to armed forces isn’t even forced, it’s voluntary,” she says. “In Chad or Ethiopia, for example, sometimes traumatised parents who’ve lost everything, and even children, welcome the prospect of joining up – they see their best hope of a future as fighting.”
Faced with such a scenario of despair, she says, good-quality education, offered early on, when children are initially displaced, “is the only way to offer families an alternative vision for how they might rebuild their lives”. Williams has just returned from Jordan’s Zata’ari refugee camp, where 46,775 children aged 0-17 now live. He sounds frustrated and angry at what he found: “The biggest scandal regarding education right now is what’s happening in that camp, which has a very stable population. People are getting 100% of their food and water needs, but only half the children are enrolled in primary school,” he says. “Less than that number are turning up because they’re running classes of 90. So here’s a situation where it’s not dangerous, and not fluid, and yet education isn’t being sorted out.” Why not? Williams laughs. “Well, it’s money, isn’t it? The money’s not been forthcoming for education. I have the same conversation with the camp manager at roughly eight-month intervals and they keep saying, ‘Yes, there’s a problem, yes, we have plans to build more schools.’ But it’s not happening. And if they really, really thought it was worthwhile, they’d find a way.”
Grace is a young woman who will somehow find a way. Realising there was no hope of continuing her education as an IDP at the Minkaman camp, extraordinarily for a young girl in a conflict-riven area, she travelled alone to Kenya to see if any school there would take her on. One school said it would, but it was private, and Grace was told she’d have to pay. She had to make the perilous trip back to South Sudan to ask her father for the money. Attacked and robbed in the bus she was traveling on, Grace finally made her way back to Kenya. Now she’s attending school. She doesn’t know how she’ll find the money to pay for next term, but she is determined that, somehow, she will. “To educate a girl is to educate a nation,” she says to Neumann, her face serious, her tone intense. “The more I am educated the more I will be able to do for my family and my community. I must have an education, unless I am dead. But if I am alive, I must have an education.” Neumann, who has filmed in some of the most difficult and dangerous places in the world, had just finished editing Kids in Camps when we met to discuss the issues raised by the children whose lives he’s followed. “When I looked around the camps and saw so many children out of school I often wondered what the world had lost,” he says. “What bright minds and thoughts are now left without the chance to thrive? Who knows what these kids could achieve with a proper education? Maybe among all those children was the next person to discover a cure or invent a brilliant new device. When I see the opportunities that lie before my own kids, I can’t help but think about the huge loss of what might have been.” There’s a World Humanitarian Summit in 2016 – an opportunity to ask exactly what the current system for addressing international emergencies is intended to achieve. “It has to be about more than just feeding people,” says Williams at War Child. “It needs to be about preserving the human potential of the populations that have been displaced.” “My country is now in a very low place,” says Grace on the phone from her headmistress’s office. “If I can finish my school and six years for my degree to be a medical doctor, then I know I must go back to help people there. People must struggle for an education or we will not be able to go back to South Sudan to help it rebuild.” Kids in Camps is on BBC1 on Tuesday 10 March at 10.45pm.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/06/if-i-am-alive-i-need-education-war-zones-need-school,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/06/if-i-am-alive-i-need-education-war-zones-need-school
2015-03-06T16:17:06Z,global-development,Global development,"Kiir and Machar should be barred from South Sudan's caretaker government, says African Union","Neither leader of South Sudan’s warring factions should serve in a caretaker government because of their responsibility for “organised massacres and large-scale violence”, according to a leaked African Union (AU) report that emerged as the latest round of talks on stopping the country’s 14-month civil war ended without agreement. The draft report blames South Sudan’s president, Salva Kiir, and his former vice-president, Riek Machar, for much of the bloodshed that split the country along ethnic lines, pitting Kiir’s Dinkas against Machar’s Nuers. It says Nuers in the capital, Juba, were “ethnically cleansed” at the outbreak of the fighting, and recommends that Kiir, Machar and other ministers in power before the cabinet’s dissolution in July 2013 “be barred from participation in the transitional executive”. Seven ceasefires have failed in South Sudan, which erupted in violence in December 2013 after Kiir accused Machar of plotting a coup. Talks brokered in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (Igad) have stalled several times. The controversial report on human rights abuses, which has been shelved for two months, was leaked to Reuters on 5 March. It holds Kiir and Machar responsible for the country’s descent into civil war and for “the organised massacres and the large-scale violence that followed”. It suggests that the AU work with the UN to appoint a three-person panel charged with overseeing a five-year transition plan. The report also proposes that South Sudan’s oil revenues be placed in a holding account managed by the African Development Bank and recommends establishing an AU-commanded peacekeeping force comprised of troops “without prior involvement or direct interest in South Sudan”.
The document is also fiercely critical of the US, Britain and Norway, which it accuses of “[ushering] in an unaccountable political class” by backing the 2005 peace deal that paved the way for South Sudan’s independence from Sudan six years later. That deal, it says, established “a politically unchallenged armed power in South Sudan” that acted with impunity and legitimised “rule of the gun”. Neither the AU nor the UK’s foreign office responded to requests for comment. The report raises further questions about the credibility of the peace talks, which many had expected to pave the way for a transitional government led by Kiir, with Machar again serving as his deputy. On 6 March Kiir and Machar missed Igad’s deadline for reaching a final peace deal that would have included a transitional unity government, despite a UN security council resolution establishing a sanctions regime threatening to blacklist anyone undermining security or interfering with the peace process. The US-drafted measures, however, stop short of worldwide travel bans, asset freezes or an arms embargo. No date has been set for further peace talks. The Ethiopian prime minister and Igad chairman, Hailemariam Desalegn, said failure to reach an agreement to end “a senseless war” was prolonging the suffering of the South Sudanese people and was “unacceptable, both morally and politically”. Hailemariam said the peace process had to be “reinvigorated and reformed”, adding: “In the coming days, I will consult with my colleagues, the Igad leaders, partners and friends in the region, on the continent, and beyond to agree a common plan of action.” The AU has come under fire from rights groups for failing to publish the report. Casie Copeland, South Sudan researcher for the International Crisis Group, said: “The AU should take leadership in the field of transitional justice or cede the field to others willing to take action to move these necessary processes forward.” Daniel Bekele, Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said: “The people and partners of South Sudan have been waiting for the AU report to help bring justice for the grave crimes of the past year. By shelving the report, the AU has left the people of South Sudan in the lurch.” Tens of thousands are thought to have died in the fighting, which has displaced 1.5 million people internally and forced another 480,000 into neighbouring countries. Although famine was averted last year, the Famine Early Warning System Network warned this week that 3.5 million people in South Sudan will require emergency humanitarian assistance by June. Despite the warring sides agreeing to a ceasefire on 1 February, reports of sporadic fighting between government and rebel forces have emerged as recently as 18 February, when skirmishes were reported around Bentiu, Renk and Melut. Igad has been blasted for failing to properly monitor these clashes, as both sides scramble to capture more territory between each round of peace talks.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/06/kiir-machar-caretaker-government-african-union-civil-war,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/06/kiir-machar-caretaker-government-african-union-civil-war
2015-03-06T13:04:39Z,global-development,Global development,Ethiopian farmer drops case alleging UK aid money paid for evictions | Sam Jones,"An Ethiopian farmer who claims UK aid money was used to bankroll forced evictions in his home country has dropped his legal action against the British government after it stopped funding a controversial development project because of increasing concerns over civil and political rights in Ethiopia. The farmer, known as Mr O, had alleged that British aid contributions to Ethiopia’s promotion of basic services (PBS) programme – a $4.9bn (£3.2bn) project run by the World Bank and designed to boost education, health and water services – were being used by the Ethiopian government to help fund its villagisation programme. Ethiopia’s commune development programme (CDP), which aims to move 1.5 million rural families from their land to new “model” villages across the country, has been beset by allegations of forced evictions, rapes, beatings and disappearances. Mr O, an ethnic Anuak, claims he was violently evicted from his farm in the Gambella region in 2011. He says he was beaten and that he witnessed rapes and assaults as government soldiers cleared people off their land. Last week, Britain’s Department for International Development (DfID) announced that it had ended its PBS contributions because of Ethiopia’s “growing success”, adding such projects were also regularly reviewed to assess recipient countries’ “commitment to partnership principles”. Until this year, it had contributed £745m of UK taxpayer money to the programme. On 4 March, lawyers for Mr O told the high court in London their client had decided to drop his judicial review of DfID’s actions as he had only ever wanted to see an end to the UK’s funding of the PBS programme. Rosa Curling, a member of the Leigh Day Human Rights team representing Mr O, told the Guardian he had got everything he had hoped to achieve from his litigation. “His challenge was to the way in which DfID was assessing human rights issues when deciding whether it should continue to provide UK aid or not,” she said. “We said given DfID had made a decision to continue to provide aid to PBS in 2013 despite the major allegations of human rights abuses, it was clear that there was not a proper system in place or the system in place wasn’t being properly followed by DfID.” Curling said Mr O, who now lives in a refugee camp in Kenya, had never sought compensation from the British government. “He has only ever wanted to make sure the financial support for the programme which has had such a devastating effect on his family – villagisation – was withdrawn,” she added. “His claim was never about compensation; it’s always been a challenge about DfID funding and making sure UK aid is not used for a harmful purpose.” In a statement read in court, DfID was more explicit about why the secretary of state, Justine Greening, had made the decision to end Britain’s PBS funding in January. “This was as a result of ongoing concerns related to civil and political rights at the level of the overall partnership in Ethiopia, and in particular recent trends on civil and political rights in relation to freedom of expression and electoral competition, and continued concerns about the accountability of the security services,” said the statement. “In light of these concerns about Ethiopia’s record on civil and political rights, and the trend of that record, it was decided to review the way in which UK aid was provided to Ethiopia.” As a result, the statement said, DfID had chosen to support programmes involving “a lesser degree of responsibility and authority of the government of Ethiopia than the PBS”. However, DfID was adamant the decision to end its PBS funding had nothing to do with Mr O’s legal action, saying: “[It] was not linked to any development relating to the CDP or any allegations of violations of human rights in that context.” The department said it welcomed Mr O’s withdrawal of the action, adding the court had found not “fault or flaw” in the processes underpinning its aid decisions. “It is absolutely right this fruitless legal case, which has dragged on for over two years at the taxpayers’ expense, has now ended,” said a DfID spokesman. “The UK government has always been firmly committed to upholding human rights across the world and this decision vindicates the thorough processes we have in place to monitor and plan our spending.” On 4 March the World Bank admitted it had no idea how many people had been turfed off their land or lost their jobs as a result of its projects in developing countries. The World Bank president, Jim Yong Kim, told reporters: “We must and will do better.” His pledge came days after the World Bank’s executive board had met to discuss a damning internal report on the PBS programme and the management response. In a statement released on 27 February, the bank said that although its inspection panel had concluded that the seizing of land and use of violence and intimidation were not consequences of PBS, it had determined that the programme “did not fully assess and mitigate the risks arising from the government’s implementation of CDP, particularly in the delivery of agricultural services to the Anuaks”. Noting that one of the institution’s core principles was to do no harm to the poor, Kim added: “In this case, while the inspection panel found no violations, it did point out areas where we could have done more to help the Anuak people. We draw important lessons from this case to better anticipate ways to protect the poor and be more effective in fighting poverty.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/06/ethiopian-farmer-drops-case-dfid-alleging-aid-money-helped-fund-evictions,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/06/ethiopian-farmer-drops-case-dfid-alleging-aid-money-helped-fund-evictions
2015-03-06T11:34:56Z,global-development,Global development,International Women's Day: we have made great strides but there's a long way to go | Michele Binci,"As we approach International Women’s Day – now in its 25th year – there’s a lot to celebrate: women’s rights have risen up the political agenda over the last two decades (helped in part by MDG3), many countries have made progress towards eliminating gender disparity in primary education and we are also seeing the introduction of initiatives to ensure representation of women within senior political and corporate spheres. But there’s still a long way to go. Despite the increasing recognition that gender equality is crucial to a nation’s social and economic development – as emphasised by the latest UN Women campaign – the myriad links and feedback loops between gender parity and development still need to be fully explored. In particular, what does a fluctuating economy mean for women, their empowerment and welfare? And how does – or should – this affect economic policy decisions? This is particularly important as the world moves towards defining the sustainable development goals and wider post-2015 development agenda. While the proposed inclusion of a standalone gender goal is undoubtedly a cause for celebration, the more important task will actually be ensuring its integration across all of the other SDGs. The latest UN Women world survey report highlighted how women and girls are disproportionately affected by social, economic and environmental shocks – a finding backed by Plan and the Overseas Development Institute in their 2013 report. More recently, my own research in Kenya looked at the extent and direction of crisis-induced changes in vulnerability in the turbulent years between 2007 and 2009 when the country faced what could be called a quadruple crisis: a political crisis, an oil and food crisis, a long-lasting drought and the global financial crisis. Using a model to distinguish between different types of employment (self-employed, permanent employment, unpaid work), along with notes from in-depth household interviews, I tried to untangle the different drivers that motivated women to choose particular occupations at different points in time.
The results are startlingly clear: women are disproportionately and negatively impacted by economic shocks. They are forced to engage in undesirable jobs – including ‘informal’ jobs in the sex industry – to make up for the loss of income caused by the economic downturn. This is on top of normal household tasks, of which women tend to bear the brunt. The literature on the subject stresses the existence of a pervasive “stickiness” when it comes to substituting male and female labour for a range of domestic activities and this certainly seems to be the case in Kenya. The outcomes were the same regardless of the level of empowerment experienced by women. Applying an empowerment indicator (based on attitudes towards domestic violence) revealed that while, before the crisis, relatively more empowered women were able to avoid the most undesirable jobs, during times of shock they found themselves obliged to carry out any available income-generating activity as part of their household’s coping strategies. Disparity between women and men characterises most spheres of society in Kenya, and, arguably, most other countries. But the fact that these imbalances are emphasised during times of economic instability has a number of important implications for policy-makers. To date, most policy responses to the global economic crisis have focused on financial-sector recovery and boosting jobs without accounting for unbalanced impacts on welfare at the household and community level. If we are to ensure that interventions are sustainable, policies aimed at stimulating economic recovery must be tailored to be gender-specific and account for women’s vulnerabilities. There are encouraging signs – at Oxford Policy Management we’re currently evaluating the financial sector deepening initiatives that form part of DFID’s multi-year Poorest States Inclusive Growth Programme (PSIG) in India. The programme is piloting a range of activities aimed at supporting financial inclusion by empowering women to access finance sources that could help cushion against shocks and stresses. It’s key that gender-based initiatives are seamlessly integrated into central policy-making processes. As Melissa Leach from the Institute of Development Studies notes, gender equality and sustainability can actually help reinforce each other given the right conditions. However, when simply added on as an after-thought or singled out as flagship policies, gender-based initiatives are less likely to have a positive and sustained impact. We need to ensure that the ‘invisible’ effects of the economic crisis are not just made visible, but are brought into the mainstream of the development debate.

2015-03-06T00:01:03Z,global-development,Global development,"Eastern DRC still at mercy of armed groups and corrupt officials, Oxfam says | Clár Ní Chonghaile","Fourteen months after the rebel M23 group was defeated in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, civilians are still being exploited by soldiers, armed groups and corrupt officials, Oxfam said. In a new report, Secure Insecurity, based on trips to 16 villages in North and South Kivu provinces in August and September in 2014, the charity said women and young men were particularly vulnerable in an area where state power is weak. “The research reveals how little progress has been made towards building legitimate and credible state authority in many parts of eastern DRC, a disturbing conclusion,” said the report. “The restoration of the state ... is fragmented and piecemeal. While in some areas the state has been partly or fully ‘restored’, in other areas it is entirely absent; in some areas the state may even be sharing its role as authority with armed groups.” Oxfam said that state presence often equated to extortion, with civilians forced to pay bribes to obtain basic services. Armed groups were wont to recruit among youths with few prospects, while women lacked access to state justice services and were undermined by traditional practices. Residents said security forces and armed groups claimed illegal taxes at markets, while police demanded bribes even to investigate alleged abuses. “No one asks officials for help if you are beaten by the army, or by someone else. There’s no point, they don’t even want to hear about it. That’s why we turn to God for help,” said a religious leader in North Kivu, quoted in the report. A woman in Uvira, in South Kivu, said: “Today, the bodies of two people were found ... just a few metres from my home. We don’t know where to turn, we just want some fresh air. We want peace.” Oxfam said building the authority of the state was an enormous challenge and would require a long-term commitment from the DRC and international partners and donors. It urged the DRC and neighbouring states to work harder on reforming the security sector, consolidating state authority and boosting economic development as agreed in the 2013 Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework .
“Setbacks will be inevitable. Yet, if the people of eastern DRC are to feel the benefits of ‘peace’, it is vital to get stabilisation right, after the failed stabilisation strategies of the past,” it said. José Barahona, Oxfam’s country director for DRC, said the world could not just “tick the box” on eastern Congo after the defeat of M23. “Part of it is a lack of money. Some of the people who are trying to do their work in eastern Congo don’t get paid, or get paid very badly or get paid three or four months late ... The Congolese state needs support to do this. It can’t do it alone ... We need a stronger presence of the state and a better quality of that presence of the state,” he said. “It’s very disappointing because if you go to east Congo, it’s a very fertile area. Some people say it’s heaven on earth. There is rain, fertile areas, it has minerals, it is very good for production of food. It has a huge potential,” Barahona said. M23 rebels surrendered in November 2013 after an offensive by Congolese soldiers backed by thousands of UN fighters. But several other armed groups remain active, and the government in the capital Kinshasa has struggled to extend its reach. Low-level conflict is still fuelled by land disputes, cyclical violence between ethnic groups and the continued presence of armed groups. Communities still live in fear of sexual violence, kidnappings and killings, Oxfam said. Some residents said police charged $5 to report a crime and an extra $10 for an investigation. One official was reported to have said, “If you used to pay the armed groups, why can you not give to the government?” There were some examples of good practice: in one village in South Kivu, residents said officials tried to solve problems with the community by holding meetings in the local leader’s office. But such positive examples were few, and some state officials said there were places they did not dare to go because of insecurity. Oxfam called on the government to pay state officials, including soldiers, train them and monitor their performances, and to support the implementation of a quota system for women to be appointed state officials. Barahona said the situation of women was particularly bleak. One woman tried to report a rape but was told that justice did not extend to women; a husband went to report the rape of his wife and was himself arrested as the perpetrator; and a 20-year-old woman was forced, after community mediation, to marry a man who had raped her as a minor. “[Women] don’t have access to justice, and traditional justice is applied to them in a very negative way,” Barahona said. “Congo has very good laws in favour of women but you have to have the justice system in place and available for women to go to, and that is still lacking.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/06/eastern-drc-oxfam-report-armed-groups-corrupt-officials-congo,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/06/eastern-drc-oxfam-report-armed-groups-corrupt-officials-congo
2015-03-05T16:59:39Z,global-development,Global development,UK aid watchdog right to criticise DfID over law and justice operations,"The rule of law is critical to development. When there is rule of law, people and their assets are safe, and more importantly, they can earn a living, save, send their children to school: they can invest in their futures. Mohammed Bouazizi who set himself – and the Middle East – alight, was driven to self-immolation because the police and municipal authorities who should have been protecting him were harassing him and driving him ever deeper into destitution. He was trying to send his siblings to school and university – a firm act of faith in the future. It is against this backdrop that the Independent Commission for Aid Impact’s (Icai) report, which criticises the Department for International Development’s (DfID) work on rule of law, is published. In a climate of austerity, DfID’s commitment to rigorous examination of its performance is important. Performance is in turn related to having a strong evidence base that suggests how to focus scarce aid resources for maxim impact. The Icai report rightly criticises DfID for funding rule of law programmes without a strong evidence base. However, as the report acknowledges, rule of law programming is difficult because the laws in question are often ferociously contested. This in turn is because it is the law that records, reflects and reproduces the rules of national “games of thrones”. The rules govern who has power, who can get it and who wields the tools of force and coercion – the police, the military and the intelligence “assets”. And the stakes are high – as the character Cersei Lannister notes “when you play the game of thrones you win or you die”. For the most part, aid agencies do not operate as if they are working in environments where power and money is at stake, and so they have provided very little support to the rule of law. Support to the rule of law – where it does exist – has had two objectives. On one hand it has focused on recreating the forms of familiar justice systems – without any attention to the specific and historic struggles over power and resources that have created the norms of settled justice systems. Unsurprisingly, Icai’s report notes that this failure to understand the political nature of law has resulted in very little change to legal systems. Secondly, justice programming has been focused on strengthening the police, and countering terrorist agencies’ force and coercion in countries that pose a threat to the national security of western countries, in the (often vain) hope that these countries will manage their own security and reduce the threat to the west. Recent events in Iraq and Syria suggest in fact that strengthening rule of law in this way fails even its own narrow test and does not reduce the threat to western interests. Icai’s report notes also the failure of work building more accessible justice systems. By contrast DfID’s own focus on poverty and vulnerability – and specifically its recent focus on tackling violence against women – has achieved better results. In particular, as Icai’s report notes, it is working to prevent and reduce violence against women. Small-scale community justice programmes enjoy more success and there have been some good results with community policing. In Nigeria, for example, confidence in the police in Adeje increased significantly from 47% to 63%. This growing evidence of how to involve vulnerable people in a way that increases their confidence – and stake – in law, order and peace is critical, not only in reducing poverty, but also in wider stabilisation objectives. Rule of law and justice programmes supported abroad by the UK stand at a critical juncture. They have not yet been as successful as they should be – but the rigour of the Icai review has thrown up some important successes with the most disenfranchised and poorest groups. These are also successes that matter for future foreign policy, because they are the kind of successes that could play a key role in building a new social contract between people and their states – and consequently generating stability and encouraging the investment in the future that reduces poverty, delivers development and reduces global instability. As the Icai report notes, the notable success in approaches that tackle violence against women has followed a political and senior management emphasis on tackling violence against women. Wider success across the rule of law portfolio will similarly depend on senior management support. • Sheelagh Stewart is an independent rule of law, security and development expert.

2015-03-05T13:44:33Z,global-development,Global development,Liberia almost clear of Ebola after last patient is discharged from care,"Liberia released its last Ebola patient on Thursday, a 58-year-old English teacher who described herself as “one of the happiest persons on Earth today”. The discharging of Beatrice Yardolo – who had spent 15 days in a Chinese-run Ebola treatment centre in the Paynesville district of the Liberian capital, Monrovia – brings the west African country a step closer to declaring itself clear of Ebola. Liberia’s deputy health minister, Tolbert Nyenswah, said there were no other confirmed cases of Ebola in the country. Yardolo’s release means Liberia can now begin the 42-day waiting period, at the end of which it could be judged Ebola-free according to World Health Organisation (WHO) protocols and standards. The WHO confirmed on Wednesday that Liberia had gone a full week without reporting any new cases of the disease. Since the outbreak began in December 2013, 23,969 people in nine countries have been infected with the virus, and 9,807 of them have died, according to the latest figures. Six months ago, Liberia – which has recorded 9,249 cases of Ebola, including 4,117 deaths – was reporting 300 new cases a week. At the height of the epidemic in a country where the health infrastructure had been ravaged by two back-to-back civil wars, overflowing health clinics had to turn away people, often to die on the streets. But a huge national and international response helped stem the spread. Of 45 samples tested nationwide last week, none were positive, the WHO said, adding that it was the first time there had been no new confirmed cases since 26 May 2014. The outlook was less positive in the other countries affected by the outbreak, Guinea and Sierra Leone, which jointly reported 132 new confirmed cases last week. Sierra Leone, which counts the most cases in total at 11,466, including 3,546 deaths, registered 81 new confirmed cases last week, up from 65 the week before. Transmission in the country “remains widespread”, the WHO warned, pointing out that new cases had emerged in eight different districts across the country, with rising numbers in Freetown, the Western Rural district and in the northern district of Bombali. The outbreak in Bombali was reportedly linked to a cluster of cases in the Aberdeen fishing community in Freetown, and the WHO said efforts were under way to track more than 2,000 contacts associated with that cluster. The 51 new confirmed cases registered in Guinea last week also marked a significant increase on the 35 fresh cases reported during the previous seven-day period. Guinea, which in total has had 3,219 Ebola cases and 2,129 deaths, also had a marked hike in new cases in the capital Conakry and in nearby Forécariah, the WHO said. Massive efforts and funds have been poured into the fight to rid the three west African countries of the Ebola scourge, and a major aim has been to ensure that all those infected are isolated and cared for in treatment centres. Ensuring safe burials of the highly contagious bodies has also been a priority. But Sierra Leone and Guinea continued to see high numbers of deaths from Ebola in their communities, “suggesting that the need for early isolation and treatment is not yet understood, accepted or acted upon”, the WHO warned. More than half of the 32 confirmed Ebola deaths in Guinea last week happened in the community, rather than treatment units, while 16% did in Sierra Leone. Unsafe burials also continue to be a problem in the two countries, with 16 registered last week alone. Although the epidemic appears to be drawing to a close, there are fears that the true number of victims could be substantially greater than official estimates. “Even though statistics show that over 9,000 people died of Ebola, our volunteers on the ground were called on to bury 14,000, which means that many more died from Ebola,” Mohammed El-hadj Assy, the the secretary general of the Red Cross, told a conference on the Ebola crisis in Brussels on Tuesday. Many of those attending the conference echoed calls for a Marshall plan to help the affected countries recover from Ebola – and pleaded for the international community to honour its existing pledges. Despite a massive aid effort, the UN operation against the disease is still facing a $900m shortfall. Less than half of the $5.1bn pledged to counter the epidemic has so far been disbursed.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/05/liberia-almost-clear-of-ebola-after-last-patient-is-discharged-from-care,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/05/liberia-almost-clear-of-ebola-after-last-patient-is-discharged-from-care
2015-03-05T10:18:33Z,global-development,Global development,'Heroic' giant rats sniff out landmines in Tanzania | Sam Jones,"The pre-dawn silence at the foot of the Uluguru mountains is disturbed only by the cries of drowsy birds, the whisper of boots through grass and an intermittent clicking sound that is irresistible to 60 pairs of tiny, almost translucent, ears. When the sun finally rises over the blue peaks to flood the fields below, it illuminates one of the more unlikely scenes of human-animal cooperation. Watched over by men and women clutching bananas and the small clickers used to train puppies, dozens of African giant pouched rats shuttle across taped-off alleyways trying to catch the lingering scent of TNT from some of the 1,500 deactivated landmines that have been sown in the red earth. Most scamper back and forth with an apparent mix of delight and concentration, as if they know that each time they find a mine and communicate their discovery with a fit of scratching, they will be rewarded with a click and a mouthful of fruit. One or two, perhaps still sleepy – or irked at being yanked from their warm wood shavings, dropped into cages and put in the back of the “ratbus” for another day’s drills – look less enthusiastic, dawdling in their harnesses along the rope line held between two trainers. But by the end of their nine-month bootcamp, almost all the rats being schooled by the Belgian NGO Apopo in the southern highlands of Tanzania will have acquired the necessary skills to navigate minefields in Africa and beyond. Once operational, they will sniff out mines, which are then checked and cleared by their human colleagues.
Though their forebears have already helped to reclaim millions of square metres of land in Angola and Mozambique - the latter of which is expected to be declared mine-free soon – this cadre of rats could find themselves deployed to Cambodia, where Apopo is working to clear up the explosive legacy of three decades of conflict. The idea of using rats to sniff out mines came to Apopo’s founder, Bart Weetjens, 20 years ago as he read an article about gerbils being taught to recognise the scent of explosives. Weetjens, who as a boy bred hamsters, rats, mice and gerbils, began to wonder which rodent would best serve those whose limbs and livelihoods are threatened by landmines. “I placed myself in the situation of subsistence farmers in Africa, those populations affected by the problem, and looked at the resources these people have at hand to develop a tool that would empower them to address this life-threatening problem more independently from expensive imported know-how and technologies,” he says. Scuttle forward the African giant pouched rat, Cricetomys gambianus. Not only are the animals intelligent and blessed with a sense of smell to rival that of dogs, they live for up to eight years and are – at an average weight of about a kilo – too light to set off pressure-activated anti-personnel mines.
What’s more, they are easy to find. The rats, which are native to most of sub-Saharan Africa, are so ubiquitous that they are either seen as a pest – because of the damage they do to crops – or as food. The only downside is that they are nocturnal and very susceptible to sunburn, meaning that their delicate ears and tails need to be slathered with sunblock to protect them against skin cancer as they work under the tropical sun. Despite the £4,500 ($6,900) cost of training each animal, they are far cheaper and quicker than their human rivals: Apopo says its rats can each search 200 square metres of land in just 20 minutes; people using metal detectors would take five days to search the same area. In Mozambique – which was heavily mined during the independence struggle and the country’s subsequent 15-year civil war – Apopo’s rats, handlers, manual demining teams and armoured vehicles have so far found and destroyed more than 13,000 landmines, reclaiming more than 11 million square metres (1,100 hectares) of land. Today, as training manager, Abdullah Mchomvu carries a clipboard and keeps a beady eye on the handlers as they drill rats named after footballers, a 1980s action star (Dolph), a mythical beast (Dragon) and, less glamorously, someone called Ron.
Twelve years ago, he was among the first Apopo staff to take their rookie rats into the minefields of Mozambique’s Gaza province. “On the first day, I was totally afraid,” he says. “There were a lot of skeletons in army uniforms and I was worried that if the rats scratched too hard, they might set off the mines.” However, the rats quickly proved their worth: every spot over which they stopped and signalled later disclosed a hidden device. “Everything they found was a mine, so that reduced my fear,” he says. “Now I have no problem going into a minefield. If the rats go into an area and don’t find anything, I’m fine to go in there.” Trust in the rats is vital, according to Tim Edwards, Apopo’s head of training and behavioural research. In the rare event that one of the animals repeatedly proves itself unable to master the techniques of mine detection, it is withdrawn from training but kept on as a playmate for its more successful peers. “We do have a range of what people might call personalities in the rats: some are a bit more active and are really eager to go and run really fast when they get on the ground,” he says. “Usually, any extreme behaviour – either too quick or too slow, or too social or not social enough – can make them a little bit too difficult to train. We see quite a bit of variance, but ideally we have a nice balance between a rat that’s easy to handle but is also active and aggressive enough to go out there and find the mines.” To keep the gene pool strong and clear, rats are bred from high-performing male mine rats and wild females. But even that blend is no guarantee of detection perfection. “At each stage, there is a test and the rat must pass the test after a certain number of tries, otherwise it’s deemed unsuitable,” says Edwards. “Some rats do fail and we’re doing dangerous work and we don’t want to put rats into the field that can’t do it.” Apopo’s rats are not all engaged in detecting explosives. While the mine trainees are on their way back to headquarters, their medical colleague Wilbard is hard at work in the laboratory, sniffing samples of human sputum to see if he can pick up the familiar bouquet of tuberculosis.
The samples, which come from hospitals and clinics in Dar es Salaam and Morogoro, are heat-treated to kill the pathogens before being handled by staff and put before the rats. Although the sputum has already been checked once by conventional lab tests, the rats often find missed cases of TB. If two rats identify TB in the sample, it is taken for re-examination in the lab. Clinics and hospitals then contact the patient to begin treatment and prevent further contagion. Apopo says its rats have so far identified more than 7,000 tuberculosis patients who were missed by human technicians, potentially halting more than 24,000 further infections and increasing detection rates by more than 45%. Once again, the rodents have the edge on their human counterparts when it comes to speed: TB-detection rats such as Wilbard can screen 100 samples in 20 minutes; while the same task would take a lab technician four days. Georgies Mgode, a microbiologist who works as Apopo’s Tanzanian tuberculosis programme manager, says the rats have already done much to halt the spread of the disease, which killed 1.5 million people around the world in 2013. “If you consider the number of patients who have been cured of TB because of the rat technology, the impact is huge,” he says. “A person who suffers from TB loses a lot: they can’t work; they’re stigmatised.” With sufficient support from policymakers, the general public and private partners, he adds, huge progress could be made in reducing the burden of TB in Africa and improving people’s economic prospects. Apopo, which received an award of £200,000 ($305,000) last year from the People’s Postcode Lottery, believes the rats have even more to offer than mine detection and TB screening. It is not inconceivable that the rodents could one day be seen strolling on leashes through airports, sniffing at suitcases, or working in hospitals. “We do have a lot of interest from other people in the medical industry and also from the security sector, who would like to be able to check for contraband and other dangerous items in cargo,” says Edwards. “Currently, there’s a lot of interest in sniffing for cancer. We’ve also been contacted about hypoglycemia and some other medical applications. There’s so much potential; it’s just a matter of finding the time and the resources to investigate it.” For now, Weetjens sees the animals as miniature, but potent, agents of development. By diagnosing TB and helping to get farmers and communities back on to land long denied them, he says, the rats are playing an important part in social transformation and local empowerment. He laughs off the common misconception that Apopo clears minefields by sending in legions of kamikaze rats who sacrifice themselves, pointing out that it fits, all too neatly, with centuries of anti-rat propaganda. “For many people it’s a logical jump,” he says. “It clearly shows what the prevailing opinion about rats is: since the Middle Ages, they have generally been seen as vermin and transmitters of plague – for which, by the way, they were not responsible. It was the fleas on the rats – and people – that transmitted the plague, not the rats.” In fact, he adds, rats have always had a symbiotic relationship with humanity. “In a way, we should be grateful to them for cleaning up our mess or at least take some responsibility for their profusion: they eat the garbage we produce.” Although giant pouched rats are still seen by many in Tanzania and elsewhere as little more than candidates for either the panga knife or the pan, Mchomvu also feels their efforts are long overdue some recognition. He has worked alongside them to dispose of far worse than rubbish. “In Mozambique, people fought, they laid mines and then they shook hands and went away,” he says. “But they left all those mines behind and they killed farmers. Now our rats are clearing the land and helping people use it again. To me, they are just heroes.” • This article was amended on 5 March 2015 to correct the figure for the People’s Postcode Lottery award to £200,000 rather than £175,000.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/05/heroic-giant-rats-sniff-out-landmines-in-tanzania,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/05/heroic-giant-rats-sniff-out-landmines-in-tanzania
2015-03-05T00:01:19Z,global-development,Global development,UK aid watchdog slams DfID over naive security and justice initiatives | Sam Jones,"Britain’s efforts to promote security and justice in developing countries are being stymied by overambitious targets, a lack of focus and a “naive” tendency to repeat unsuccessful initiatives, the UK’s aid watchdog has warned. In its latest report, the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (Icai) acknowledges that the government’s commitment to spending a third of UK aid in fragile states inevitably means the Department for International Development (DfID) is working in increasingly difficult circumstances. But it says that is precisely why DfID needs to be far more realistic, rigorous and holistic in its approach. After reviewing work in 10 countries, Icai issued the department with an amber-red rating – its second worst – for its work on security and justice. The rating means the programme “performs relatively poorly overall against Icai’s criteria for effectiveness and value for money”. Between 2013 and 2014, the department spent £95m on security and justice assistance from a total aid expenditure of £10.1bn.
“We believe that security and justice assistance is a necessary and important part of the UK aid portfolio and that its significance will continue to grow in the future,” argues the report. “The UK cannot credibly work in situations of conflict and fragility without also working on conflict and fragility.” Icai identifies Libya – where DfID was “repeatedly asked to increase its level of ambition and expenditure to match the UK government’s commitment to supporting the country’s transition” – as an example of what not to do. Even though the budget for the department’s security and justice programme was eventually increased to £62.5m, making it the largest ever such initiative, it was never likely to achieve its aims. “In the end, the programme was significantly scaled back and realigned in the face of deteriorating security conditions,” says the report. “In our view, the lessons from the case clearly point to the conclusion that the most convincing designs are relatively modest in their objectives and focus on finding solutions to specific problems, rather than those achieving across-the-board improvements in security and justice institutions.” Diana Good, Icai lead commissioner, said it was “frankly naive and overambitious” to expect top-down initiatives to reform institutions in fragile states “where there are vested interests, where the system looks after the wealthy and the powerful, where there are huge barriers for the poor and … where there’s a reluctance to achieve political reform”. The report expresses concerns that DfID advisers feel pressured into promising undeliverable results, and accuses the department of relying on a series of common assumptions. Among them are the beliefs that building capacity in central security and justice institutions leads to improvements in their services and levels of public trust; that training police officers leads to improved standards and behaviour; and that successful pilot projects will always be replicated at the national level. The report questions the wisdom of trying to overhaul the Sudanese national police in 2008, saying it was “never realistic” to expect the Sudanese government to support the decentralisation of its security services as it faced conflict in Darfur and an independence referendum in the south. In Nigeria, says the report, police reforms were based on the assumption that the authorities would be willing to roll out successful initiatives across the country despite “a 10-year history of police reforms that had proved to be largely ineffective for want of political support”. It also saw more general evidence of failure to look beyond policing and engage with prosecutors, the judiciary, the courts and the legal profession.
Icai found that DfID’s procurement of contractors was causing a range of problems, from long delays to rigid or unrealistic programme designs, adding: “We saw instances of high quality delivery by non-governmental organisations (NGOs), who may offer greater local knowledge and legitimacy than contractors but often find it difficult to compete in procurement processes.” However, the report acknowledges DfID’s “promising” results in addressing some of the security and justice needs of women and girls, adding: “[It] does … have a good base of programming on community justice and for women and girls, on which it can build.” It calls on the department to come up with a “more focused and realistic” strategy that heeds specific challenges and local contexts, and recommends it identify and fill “the key evidence gaps” in its security and justice portfolio. The report concludes: “Many of the standard activities in DfID’s security and justice programmes are not making enough of a difference to the lives of the poor. Some of their objectives appear unrealistic, given the instruments available.” DfID said it was working to build stable and legitimate states by tackling human rights abuses, reducing conflict and stamping out corruption. “Security and justice are the most challenging sectors we work in and DfID focuses on countries with the biggest potential for improvement,” said a spokeswoman. “We have made good progress particularly in helping women and girls gain access to justice, but where concerns about human rights and instability become too high, we have no hesitation in shutting programmes down.” Mary Creagh, Labour’s shadow development secretary, said: “Security and justice is essential - particularly in fragile and post-conflict states - but this report criticises the lack of financial and political sustainability of the government’s work in this area.” She said Icai’s findings revealed that ministers had no strategy and that NGOs with local knowledge to deliver programmes were being shut out in favour of private contractors. Creagh added: “A Labour government would tackle these challenges through long-term partnerships with developing countries.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/05/uk-aid-watchdog-slams-dfid-over-naive-security-and-justice-initiatives,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/05/uk-aid-watchdog-slams-dfid-over-naive-security-and-justice-initiatives
2015-03-04T13:01:26Z,global-development,Global development,Sustainable development goals must fulfil Beijing's vision for women | Keiko Nowacka,"NGOs, governments and international agencies will congregate in New York next week to commemorate 20 years since the fourth world conference on women in Beijing and its Platform for Action during the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW). The Beijing agenda remains as visionary and transformative in 2015 as it was in 1995. Yet, as the draft political declaration due to be launched at CSW on 9 March states, only “slow or patchy progress” has been made. Why this is, in spite of the universal consensus on the importance of gender equality for development, warrants special attention, particularly in a year dominated by questions about the sustainable development goals (SDGs) that will be decided at the UN general assembly in September. The fourth world conference on women was a historic event that reunited advocates and governments of 189 countries to create a global gender agenda for the 21st century, building on earlier world conferences at Nairobi (1985), Copenhagen (1980) and Mexico City (1975). The plenary speech by then US first lady, Hillary Clinton, firmly stating that “women’s rights are human rights”, encapsulated the ambitious spirit that pervaded the Beijing Platform for Action’s 12 critical areas. From poverty and education to health and the environment, the Beijing Platform set governments, civil society and the development community targets that aimed to remove “all the obstacles to women’s active participation in all spheres of public and private life” to bring about a “transformed partnership based on equality between women and men”. Given the ambitious agenda, the 2015 mixed report card is a timely reminder of the development community’s unfulfilled commitments.
An assessment of the past 20 years shows that coordinated and targeted actions by governments, civil society and the development community can significantly reduce gender inequalities. Today, the number of female MPs in the world’s parliaments has doubled (9,908 in 2015, up from 4,512 in 1997); more girls are enrolled in secondary school (more than 60%, up from 50% in 1995); and there has been a 45% reduction in maternal mortality rates since 1990. These gains are, however, offset by the gender inequalities that persist on so many critical fronts. One in three women report experiences of domestic violence, gender wage gaps hover stubbornly around 20% worldwide, and issues of sexual and reproductive health and rights remain hotly disputed. Around the world, women spend on average three times more time on unpaid care work than men; and every day 39,000 girls are married below the minimum legal age. Data from the OECD Development Centre indicates there are an estimated 90 million “missing women” due to preferences for boys which result in female infanticide, sex-selective abortions and unequal access to health and nutrition in infancy. This year offers a strategic moment to breathe new life into the gender agenda. The synergy between the review of the Beijing Platform and the debates around the targets of goal 5 on gender equality and women’s empowerment of the SDGs opens an unprecedented opportunity to ensure that the promises of 1995 can deliver transformative change for women and girls. One of the innovative strengths of the Beijing Platform was its recognition of the role of discriminatory laws, beliefs and practices in driving gender inequalities, such as early marriage, violence and unpaid care. These feature strongly throughout the 12 critical areas recommended for action. This early recognition has been backed by data from the OECD’s Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) that provides evidence of how discrimination in laws, attitudes and practices reduces women’s ability to take advantage of empowerment opportunities and break cycles of poverty. The proposed SDG targets on gender address some of these issues.
By taking up this social-norm agenda, the SDGs can continue the work and commitments that started at Beijing in 1995. Beijing offers the development community many solutions for ensuring that the SDGs respond to the rights and needs of women and girls. Five key lessons came out of the Beijing Platform. Firstly, tackling discriminatory social norms must be at the core of the development response: the SDGs provide renewed impetus for countries to tackle the systemic and structural causes of gender inequalities. Implementation of Target 5.1 should take up Beijing’s call to address discriminatory social norms, attitudes and stereotypes, as well as discriminatory laws. Secondly, the Platform highlighted the need to forge a universal agenda for change. Both Beijing and the SDGs recognise that gender inequality persists irrespective of levels of income or development. This has implications for national implementation and accountability to the SDG targets by governments and civil society in OECD as well as non-OECD economies. Investment in data is also vital. The SDGs offer a critical impetus to revive Beijing commitments to address key data gaps by strengthening national capacities to systematically collect and analyse gender statistics. The Beijing Platform’s recommendations targeted the unequal power dynamics between women and men that prevent women from equally accessing resources, information and technology and restrict both sexes to restrictive gender roles. Building this into the implementation framework of the SDGs is critical to guarantee that growth and development are inclusive, gender-responsive and empowering for all. The Beijing Platform’s mixed record reflects unfulfilled promises on gender equality, in particular in respect to financing and implementation. The SDGs and other international commitments must live up to the promises made to women and girls around the world through concrete and targeted policies and investments in gender equality.

2015-03-04T09:00:01Z,global-development,Global development,Congo presidential adviser hopes to shed country's ‘rape capital of the world’ tag | Clár Ni Chonghaile,"When Jeanine Mabunda took on the role as the Democratic Republic of Congo’s top official in charge of the fight against sexual violence in July 2014, she worried that she had accepted “a suicide mission”. But the former minister resolved to change the widespread perception that rape was endemic in the country and that the state was doing nothing to prosecute those responsible. Speaking after a trip to the UK, she said she was determined to change the narrative, first, by working with the military – often accused of being among the most egregious culprits – to encourage it to pursue rape cases through the courts. “Here was a country depicted as lazy, complacent, indifferent to rape. All Congolese men were caricatured as being potential rapists … and the perception outside Congo was that there was a high level of impunity,” said Mabunda, who has served as a minister and an adviser to Congo’s central bank governor. She began her professional career with Citibank Congo and is a member of Randgold Resources board of directors. She wanted to test the system to see if there was genuine institutional support for the job she had been given – President Joseph Kabila’s personal representative in charge of the fight against sexual violence and child recruitment into armed groups. It was a gamble but she felt she could not be alone in wanting to create a better image for her country, in which conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives in the past two decades, especially in the resource-rich eastern region where myriad armed groups sporadically clash or prey on civilians. Mabunda met high-ranking military leaders, the defence minister, ordinary soldiers, the chief of police and police officers. With the defeat of the M23 rebel group in late-2013 by UN forces and the army, she felt there was a window of opportunity. “I told them, ‘Now, we are going on a new mission, one of peace, and I ask you to help me and to say that we are going to succeed together’ … They opened the garrison doors to me, they opened the records,” said Mabunda. She found that the army had already been prosecuting rape cases among its forces, but had not publicised these efforts, partly because of an institutional instinct for secrecy but also out of a sense of shame from operating in what one UN official dubbed “the rape capital of the world”. Mabunda said they could work together for change, telling them: “We are going to challenge them, not by arguing but just by systematically doing your work when you hear about a rape case, getting evidence and applying the law.” This drive was backed by the defence minister and the justice minister, she said, and slowly things began to change. “It was like a challenge because it told the nation, ‘We do not accept this tag of capital of rape’,” she said.
When Mabunda was appointed, senior UN officials said the move marked “a new dawn” and showed how the government was taking “greater ownership”. But despite Mabunda’s optimism, the DRC remains volatile, and abuses by armed forces seem to extend beyond sexual violence and conflict zones. Peace in the east is still fragile while political tensions are rising in the capital, Kinshasa, with recent protests against proposed changes to the electoral law, which many Congolese believed would allow Kabila, who took office in 2001, to stay in power beyond his mandated two-term limit. Elections are due in 2016. Human Rights Watch (HRW) has accused the government of using “unlawful and excessive force” against the protestors, saying 36 people, including around 20 who were shot by the armed forces, were killed. In a report issued ahead of a high-profile London summit on sexual violence in conflict in 2014, HRW said new mechanisms were needed to bring rapists to justice in the country, and that sexual violence would not end until those responsible were prosecuted. Mabunda said addressing rape committed by government soldiers was only part of the problem – she cited statistics showing that army personnel accounted for more than a third of rapes. “But soldiers are public servants and they should be exemplary,” she said. “They should be a subject of trust and confidence, especially when you are going back to peace.”
During her visit to London, Mabunda met with NGOs, MPs and officials from the Department for International Development, as well as the special envoy of the African Union for women, peace and security, Bineta Diop. Mabunda’s aim was not to drum up funds but to see whether the international community, starting with the UK, was serious about listening to the DRC. One of her government’s concerns, she said, was the lack of coordination among donors. “As a country, we should be able to be a little bit more demanding about how our partners direct their aid,” she said. “If we are not good in tackling the issue of sexual violence, it means also that you are not good because you have been here for 10 years and nothing has changed.” She said the DRC wanted to see more concrete results. “I prefer to set up a call centre [for victims of sexual violence] … instead of seeing people doing studies and studies … and all the money going into this and into the operating cost of the structure,” she said. Mabunda said outside observers often focused on the negative aspects of Congolese life while ignoring strong economic growth, and a growing consumer market. “It’s not a paradise, but there has been a strong focus on changing the social, economic and development policy,” she said. “Congo is not just about war and rape and misery. Congo also has a track record in terms of economic results.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/04/congo-presidential-adviser-hopes-shed-rape-capital-tag,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/04/congo-presidential-adviser-hopes-shed-rape-capital-tag

They have been identified in the first national survey of orphans, which was conducted by the British charity Street Child. It says the future for these children is dire. Many are living in fear without the support and security of parents, but the charity says there is light at the end of the tunnel “if the international aid community works together”. The charity found that some children, rejected by their friends because of the stigma of Ebola, have tried to take their own lives, while girls are being forced into commercial sex work to earn money for food their parents would have previously provided. Its case studies expose the vulnerability of those left behind without an adult for support. One 17-year-old girl from Kailahun lost both parents and her 14-year-old brother, leaving her in charge of her twin brother and 11-year-old sister. During the 21-day quarantine period, one of the soldiers guarding the quarantined zone broke into her home and attempted to rape her. “It is very striking that such a vulnerable child-headed family, living not in a rural location, but in the second town of Sierra Leone, have received no external assistance – it shows the limit of the Ebola response to date,” said Street Child, which recently came to her aid. Another girl, identified as Mariatu, lost her father to Ebola. She now joins her mother and eight younger siblings working in a quarry to feed themselves. She is also pregnant, and the father of her child is no longer around.
The charity also came across the case of 28 children from the three wives of a pharmacist in Makeni who contracted Ebola and died. He was the sole breadwinner, and on further investigation was found to be supporting 52 people in his community. The agency also found grandmothers suddenly left with children to support after their own children died. The average age of orphans was nine, with 17% looked after by a caregiver who is supporting five or more orphans. Alhaji Moijueh KaiKai, Sierra Leone’s minister for welfare, gender and children’s affairs, said: “It is clear that none have suffered more than those who lost parents and vital caregivers, those they really relied on, to this virus.” Tom Dannatt, Street Child’s chief executive, said the scale of the disaster was unprecedented since the civil war. He said it was understandable that the international focus was on beating the disease, but now that an end was in sight, “Ebola orphans should be amongst the first in line for help”. The charity sent hundreds of social workers across the country to urban and rural communities to establish the true extent of the orphan problem. Dannatt said that in September 2014 Street Child set a target of helping 1,000 orphans, but says it is now providing humanitarian and psychosocial support to almost 11,000. Apart from day-to-day survival, one of the biggest challenges ahead for orphans is education. Schools are scheduled to reopen on 30 March and although many are desperate to get an education, some will be unable to afford to do so in their new roles as heads of their households. Port Loko, a rural district just north of Freetown, has been identified as the epicentre of the orphan crisis. With almost 3,500 orphans registered, it has almost as many cases as the three next largest districts combined.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/04/ebola-leaves-12000-orphans-sierra-leone,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/04/ebola-leaves-12000-orphans-sierra-leone
2015-03-03T18:33:23Z,global-development,Global development,End in sight for Ebola outbreak but ‘lost decade’ looms for west Africa | Arthur Neslen,"Regional and world leaders have called on the international community to scale up their efforts to rebuild the nations devastated by Ebola amid fears the death toll from the outbreak could be even higher than previously thought. Although the epidemic, which has ravaged Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, appears to be drawing to a close, the secretary general of the Red Cross warned that the true number of victims could be substantially greater than official estimates. “Even though statistics show that over 9,000 people died of Ebola, our volunteers on the ground were called on to bury 14,000, which means that many more died from Ebola,” Mohammed El-hadj Assy told a conference on the Ebola crisis in Brussels on Tuesday. Despite a massive aid effort, the UN operation against the disease is still facing a $900m shortfall. Less than half of the $5.1bn pledged to counter the epidemic has so far been disbursed. The Liberian president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, said that recovery from the epidemic would require “significant resources, perhaps even a Marshall plan”, adding that “additional resources” would be needed from the European commission, the IMF, World Bank and African Development Bank. The original suggestion for an African Marshall plan had come from the World Bank but “we would like to conceptualise it a bit more”, Johnson Sirleaf said. Primary healthcare systems might be one initial beneficiary. New Ebola cases in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone are now falling – from around 600 a week to fewer than 100, according to the UK international development secretary, Justine Greening. “I think the end is in sight,” she said on the fringes of the meeting. “But the big challenge is getting down to zero. We have to make sure that complacency doesn’t set in.” The former British foreign secretary and CEO of International Rescue Committee, David Miliband, said: “There’s a real danger of a lost decade if the lessons locally and internationally are not learned. We already have a lost year of schooling, of economic growth, and of lost confidence so we must not be rose-tinted about the challenge over the next decade.”
Despite a clear trend of declining Ebola cases, a 15 April deadline for eradicating the disease set by regional leaders is considered optimistic by many in the development community. “It is not easy to aim at the zero target,” Alpha Condé, the Guinean president, told the conference. “We will all have to scale up our efforts – and we will need all the help we can get.” Economic losses from the disease have also been enormous. The World Bank estimates foregone GDP growth in the previously dynamic economies of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone at $1.6bn this year because of the disease. The wider regional costs could be as high as $6bn. In Liberia, where only one new Ebola case was reported in the last week, thousands of children began returning to school. But more than half of those schools have no water supply. And while 57% have a toilet, it is shared by an average of 100 children. Fears about a recurrence of the disease, which is spread by contact with bodily fluids, have had to be balanced against the need to return to some sort of normality. Ebola has a 50% mortality rate and symptoms that range from vomiting and diarrhoea to internal and external bleeding. Its human cost on west Africa has been incalculable. At the height of the outbreak, Liberian burial rites, which typically involve cleaning and touching the bodies of the dead, were replaced by the mass cremations of up to a hundred bodies at a time, alienating local people and traumatising survivors. Eventually a “safe and dignified” burial process evolved, using disinfectant kits, personal protective equipment, sterilised body bags and the post-burial sanitisation of deceased persons’ homes.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/03/ebola-death-toll-west-africa-could-be-much-higher-than-initial-estimates,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/03/ebola-death-toll-west-africa-could-be-much-higher-than-initial-estimates

2015-03-03T14:43:38Z,global-development,Global development,Save the Children head apologises for upset over award to Tony Blair,"Save the Children has apologised to those who were upset by its decision to give Tony Blair a “global legacy award” last year, saying the prize was bestowed solely for the former British prime minister’s work on Africa and was not intended as a celebration of his “wider legacy”. On Tuesday Justin Forsyth, CEO of Save the Children UK and a former aide to Blair, admitted the move had damaged the international charity. The prize, which was given to Blair by the US arm of Save the Children (STC) last November, drew immediate criticism from inside and outside the organisation. An internal letter, signed by more than 500 staff members, said the award was not only “morally reprehensible, but also endangers our credibility globally”, and called for it to be withdrawn. An online petition urging the award to be revoked – citing Blair’s role in the 2003 Iraq war and “damning allegations relating to his role as Middle East envoy and businesses dealings with autocratic rulers and others in the region” – has attracted nearly 125,000 signatures. Forsyth told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that STC recognised the anger the award had caused, but stopped short of issuing a full apology. “I know that many of our supporters and volunteers were very upset – and several of our staff, too – and I’m very sorry for that,” he said. “But this was an award given by our sister organisation in the United States. It’s a very different political context there, and they’ve had hardly any complaints there. And yes, it was a global legacy award; it was called that. But actually it was an award very, very specifically for Tony Blair’s efforts on Africa at two G8 summits in Birmingham and Gleneagles, not his wider legacy.” He added: “If it had been for his wider legacy, I think it would have been wrong. But it was for something quite specific that helped Africa and children. And I’m sorry it’s upset so many people.” Forsyth said the outcry had been a “a really unnecessary distraction” from STC’s work with those affected by the Syrian conflict and the Ebola crisis. In a letter sent to employees last year, Jasmine Whitbread, the chief executive of Save the Children International, said the episode had “touched a nerve close to our sense of identity”, adding: “We are all frustrated and disappointed at the situation we are in.” While Forsyth conceded that the affair had “in part” affected the charity’s standing with staff and volunteers, he said STC was doing more to help children than ever before. “We’ve doubled our impact for children; our income is up, we’ve recruited 100,000 supporters,” he said. “I think people do accept that we occasionally make mistakes, but we’re an organisation that’s very focused on saving children’s lives in the toughest parts of the world and that’s what we’re about, that’s why I lead this organisation and that’s what I believe in.” Speaking as he accepted the award in November 2014, Blair said: “From the beginning of humankind there has been brutality, conflict, intrigue, the destructive obsession with a narrow self-interest. But throughout all human history, never has been extinguished that relentless, unquenchable desire to do good. To act not only in self-interest and sometimes even to act in defiance of it.” A spokeswoman for Tony Blair’s office said it had no comment to make on a “three-month-old story” and nothing to add to a statement released in November, in which it accused the Guardian of “conveniently” disregarding the facts supporting the award. “The award was in recognition of Tony Blair’s work in leading G8 nations at Gleneagles in 2005 to pledge to double aid to Africa and provide 100% debt relief to eligible countries, as well as his ongoing work in partnership with African governments through his Foundation, the Africa Governance Initiative (AGI),” said the statement. “It is extraordinary that while ignoring the body of work undertaken by Tony Blair, the AGI and the people they work alongside in African governments, the views of President Koroma [of Sierra Leone] and President Sirleaf [of Liberia], who after all are the very people who have first-hand experience of their efforts, the article also sought to traduce the reputation of Save the Children, and was neither balanced nor fair.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/03/save-the-children-head-apologises-for-upset-over-award-to-tony-blair,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/03/save-the-children-head-apologises-for-upset-over-award-to-tony-blair
2015-03-03T13:00:05Z,global-development,Global development,Ugandan farmers take on palm oil giants over land grab claims,"Before the bulldozers came, Magdalena Nakamya harvested coffee, cassava, avocado and jackfruit on her three-hectare (seven-acre) plot on Kalangala, an island in Lake Victoria. But on a July morning in 2011, Nakamya, 64, awoke to find yellow machines churning up her land and razing the crops she had grown in a bid to make way for palm oil plantations. “No one came to talk to me before they destroyed my crops,” says Nakamya. “I heard that some people were given money, but I didn’t receive anything.” Oil Palm Uganda Limited (Opul) was launched in 2002, following an agreement signed between the government and Bidco Uganda, a food producer, with the aim of increasing palm oil production in the country. In 2011, Opul acquired land leases from a Ugandan businessman, Amos Ssempa, with the aim of expanding its plantations. About 7,500 hectares (18,500 acres) of oil palm have been planted since 2002 (pdf). Opul describes the project as part of an initiative to increase vegetable oil production in the country.
Francis Ssemogerere, 55, tended 3.6 hectares of land for 30 years until he was evicted in the same year as Nakamya. No compensation was paid to him either. “They took all of [my land]. They promised to come back and pay me but they never came back,” Ssemogerere says. Uganda’s constitution requires authorities to obtain a court order to evict people from their land, and compensation must also be paid. Nakayama and Ssemogerere are from a community of more than 100 people in Kalangala who claim they were evicted from their land illegally. The palm oil project is supported by the UN’s International Fund for Agricultural Development (Ifad). Bidco and global palm oil giant Wilmar International are major investors. In 2004, the World Bank withdrew from the project amid concern that it was not complying with the bank’s forestry policies (pdf). Anne van Schaik, accountable finance campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe, said: “Wilmar and its subsidiaries, backed by European money, are forcing communities from their land in Uganda.” On 19 February, a group of farmers filed a lawsuit against Bidco Uganda and Amos Ssempa, who leased the land to Opul. A spokeswoman for Wilmar said: “No one had been evicted for the Opul project. Where it was not possible for the occupants to leave the land in question, the specific area was set aside and no oil palm development took place. We believe we have developed one of the best oil palm plantations in Africa in Kalangala and the local people have benefited tremendously from the project.” Bidco Uganda general manager Suvrajit Ghosh denied knowledge of the case. Ssempa says “due processes were followed and farmers were compensated”. He says: “They [the farmers] signed that they received the money.” Ann Turinayo, communication and knowledge management officer for Ifad Uganda, says: “Ifad is not involved in any land acquisition. What we do is that we give highly subsidised finance to government which benefits small farmers in Kalangala. “We [Ifad] support people who are growing oil palms on their own land. There are more than 1,600 farmers in Kalangala, who are growing oil palms at a commercial basis on their own land, and these are the people we support.” While some of the farmers agreed to be compensated, they say the money they have received is insufficient for the value of the land they have lost and the food that has been destroyed. Some farmers claim they were coerced into signing for the money. Desire Nsamba Kiggundu, 43, one of the affected farmers, says seven of his 12 acres were taken yet he was given only 250,000 Uganda shillings ($86.30) in compensation. “I was told, ‘If you don’t sign for this money, do you have lawyers to argue in court?’” Kiggundu said. Emmanuel Kyambazi, 41, experienced something similar. He says he was forced to sign for 100,000 shillings ($34.50) in compensation for his 10 acres of land. David Balironda, the Kalangala district production officer, said he saw people being compensated. Asked why he had not objected to the fact that the compensation did not match the value of people’s land and food, he said: “It was their agreement with the landlord. These people were squatters on someone’s land. They agreed on the amount of money.” He added: “I blame the NGOs; it is them amplifying people to rise up and demand for land even when they were compensated.”
Opul says it has so far recruited 1,200 local workers, including university graduates. It says the palm oil production will bring benefits for the area. “The project aspires to provide the people of Kalangala district with a great opportunity to immensely improve their quality of life. We have, for example, started construction and maintenance of roads, set up a clinic and housing for our employees.” Frank Muramuzi, director of the National Association of Professional Environmentalists (Nape)/Friends of the Earth Uganda, said: “Wilmar and the other palm oil companies are aware of the fact that communities have been displaced but have to date not been able to resolve the problems. “This project was sold to the residents of Kalangala with promises of employment and a brighter future. But they were not fairly compensated for the loss of their livelihoods, and now without access to land face a daily struggle to get by.” Friends of the Earth Uganda argue that the project has had a devastating effect on the environment. “A large proportion of the palm oil plantations are in areas previously covered by natural forest. An estimated 3,600 hectares of forest have been destroyed to make way for the palm oil plantations, including 100 hectares of the protected Gala forest reserve in Bugala, Kalangala,” it said in a 2012 report (pdf). Samuel Lowe, a land campaigner at Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said: “This case clearly shows that we cannot expect companies and financiers to regulate themselves. We need binding regulations in Europe so financiers can no longer provide their services to companies engaged in land grabbing. Land disputes in Uganda are not unusual and, as the government dishes out land to foreign investors, it is the local farmers who are usually the victims. In 2011, a report by Oxfam said at least 20,000 farmers had been evicted from a government-owned forest in Mubende and Kiboga districts in central Uganda to make way for a British forestry company, New Forests Company (NFC).",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/03/ugandan-farmers-take-on-palm-oil-giants-over-land-grab-claims,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/03/ugandan-farmers-take-on-palm-oil-giants-over-land-grab-claims
2015-03-03T10:57:32Z,global-development,Global development,Sierra Leone's young community leaders are best weapon against Ebola,"It’s almost a year since I first heard reports of mysterious infections and deaths from Kailahun, a district on Sierra Leone’s eastern border with Guinea and Liberia. Back in those first weeks, as we realised we were dealing with Ebola – an unknown challenge for Sierra Leone – the message heard in those isolated, scared and sceptical communities was that “Ebola is real”. Unfortunately, that message took another couple of months to get through to the international community, with well-known consequences. So, as those same leaders and institutions gather in Brussels on Tuesday to agree on how to finish the job and foster a recovery, it’s up to Sierra Leoneans and other west Africans to call on them not to make the same mistakes again. The international community’s initial focus on a purely medical response – and a megaphone broadcast of the over-simplistic message that “Ebola is real” – was a failure, and a major reason for the rapid spread of the disease at the early-to-middle stages of the epidemic. Even in the last couple of months, the media that influence those institutions continue to focus only on developments that involve westerners, whether they are setbacks for the safety of the foreign health workers who make up a fraction of those in our hospitals, or celebrations of vaccines that won’t be deployed until the end of this year, at the earliest. It is as if the plight of my country rises and falls only in line with the strengths and weaknesses of the international response. Get out of your SUV and talk to the people whom you can only reach by travelling four hours off the main road by foot, canoe and motorbike, and they will tell you something different. They will tell you that what has started to turn the tide is Sierra Leoneans mobilising as communities to stem the flood of new infections. My organisation, the youth-led agency Restless Development, texted our network of leaders at the start of the crisis in June to ask for volunteers to fight Ebola. Within a day, 350 had replied that they would risk everything to go on bikes out to the most remote communities. Young people armed not with syringes or stretchers but with information, training, and the trust and legitimacy that only someone from your own community can offer. In less than two months, 200,000 of the most isolated people had been reached through this personal contact. Since then, the UK aid-funded Social Mobilisation Action Consortium with our partners Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Focus 1000 and Goal, has reached more than 2 million people through this community-led approach. That speed and scale of response has led to results : increasing medical referrals, reducing unsafe burial practices, and tackling stigma and myths. When Pujehun became the first district to be declared “Ebola-free” in January, the local district chief specifically praised local youth and the “decentralisation of everybody fighting [Ebola] in their community”. This shouldn’t come as a surprise, because we have been through a different kind of “fight” – the young people who had been both victimised and blamed for the civil war were the first to band together and implement the post-conflict recovery.
Young people like Francis Koroma, who was abducted to be a child soldier at the age of 11, managed to escape and eventually go to university, only for Ebola to devastate his community last year. Unlike most of his family, Francis recovered from Ebola, and now leads community mobilisation as a survivor – an example for communities as other survivors return. A nationwide network was available to us because we were in and of the community. This meant we could mobilise hundreds, and then thousands of people to lead the response as the international community geared up for action. Sierra Leoneans have been through an unimaginable year of tragedy, but we’re proud of how we fought back against Ebola, and I know that this was because of the courage and leadership of people across the country. We led the response, and the international community needs to recognise that our community-led and people-driven approach is the 21st-century way of doing humanitarian work, and not something to be swept aside when there is a crisis. I want to get back to my day job of working with young Sierra Leoneans to lead change in their communities, create businesses, prevent teenage pregnancies, hold their government to account and much more. But first we will lead the effort to finish the job. Despite having our fourth Ebola-free district last week, there are still problem areas, and no one is safe until we get to zero new infections. Then, the world needs to work with us to be the leaders of our own economic and social recovery – as we have proved we can be.

2015-03-03T00:01:01Z,global-development,Global development,Ebola epidemic is 'wake-up call' for investment in universal healthcare,"Up to 30 countries are vulnerable to an Ebola-style epidemic, unless the world sits up and helps get urgent investment into universal healthcare, a report (pdf) has found. Improving the health systems in the three Ebola-hit African nations would have helped to prevent the epidemic and cost a third of the relief effort, says Save the Children in a new investigation of the epidemic that has claimed more than 9,500 lives. It found that £2.8bn had been spent on aid, compared with the £1bn it would have cost to improve basic healthcare in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. It warned that Ebola was among the “high-profile threats that alarm the world”, not least because of the panic the virus sowed around the globe, but that countries, some poorer than the western African nations, suffer “a daily burden of death and disease” caused by lack of basic health facilities. “A robust health system could have stopped Ebola in its tracks,” said the charity’s chief executive, Justin Forsyth. “Without trained health workers and a functioning health system in place, it’s more likely that an epidemic could spread across international borders with catastrophic effects,” he added. “Ebola … is a wake-up call that the world can no longer allow any country to continue with dangerously inadequate health services,” said Peter Piot, the director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in a foreword to the report. In its new report, A Wake Up Call: lessons from Ebola for the world’s health systems, Save the Children found that Liberia and Sierra Leone had made important progress in their health systems before Ebola hit. The report’s analysis of health services in 75 countries shows that there are 28 countries with weaker health defences than Liberia. Its Health Access Index places Somalia at the bottom, Chad second to last and Nigeria, with the largest economy in Africa, third from the bottom with an “incredibly high level on inequality in access to health services”. The variables the charity took into account include the number of health workers per 10,000 population, per capita government expenditure on healthcare, skilled attendance at childbirth, national mortality rate and the gap between the richest and the poorest. It warns that with two new zoonotic diseases, which pass from animal to human, emerging every year, the risk of future multi-country outbreaks of infectious diseases is dangerously high for the global population. The Ebola epidemic, which has caused more than 9,500 deaths so far, has highlighted the poor state of health infrastructure in the three countries. Many large referral hospitals had no electricity and running water or have been made unsafe by fires and floods. Laboratories were few in number and lack of capacity to test blood helped the spread of the virus, it reports. Save the Children also cited poor logistics in medical supplies. In September, for instance, 60,000 pairs of gloves were found stored in a central warehouse in Liberia while none were available in the health centres the warehouse supplied.
“While it appears the disease may finally be coming under control, we must learn the lessons from the crisis as a matter of urgency,” says the report. A major part of the solution is taxation, a challenge in countries run on cash economies and with poor records of tax collection. It calls for domestic tax in these countries to equate to 20% of GDP and to allocate 15% of annual budgets to health systems. Even then, simple per capita expenditure does not alone provide the solution, the report says. It cites Sierra Leone as a country with one of the worst health indicators in the world, with total health spending per capita of $96 per head. This includes an individual’s “out of pocket” expenses for treatments and diagnoses such as X-rays and medicine. By contrast, Rwanda, it notes, has much better health outcomes and coverage but spends less at $66 (£42.70) per head. Rwanda is just one of just six African countries that allocates more than 15% of its budget to health. It also has a national health insurance system, subsidies for the poorest who turn to hospital for basic diagnostics and greater co-ordination in the aid community. Even in Rwanda, which was ranked relatively comfortably at 21 out of the 75 countries it assessed, a key problem is shortage of health workers, training and retention of staff. When Ebola struck, Liberia had only 51 doctors for the entire country – one for every 71,000 people compared to the UK, which has one for every 366 people. Sierra Leone has just over 100 doctors. Save the Children also identified “leakages, corruption and fraud” as another factor weighing against the improvement of healthcare in poorer countries with much as 40% of health spending “wasted through inefficiencies”, which include corruption but also through the use of over-expensive drugs and the insufficient use of generic medicines, an inappropriate mix of health workers and unnecessary hospital admissions. Cutting “wastage” by just 10% could raise $15bn. Who controls the purse strings also makes a significant difference. “Crucially, it is the structuring of this funding, where it sits, who controls it and how it is spent, that makes the difference,” it says. The experience in South Africa, India and Tanzania shows that transfers from central to devolved governments or targeted support can mitigate against inequalities, the report says. World leaders will gather in Brussels on Tuesday for a finance conference on the next steps in the fight against Ebola.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/03/ebola-epidemic-is-wake-up-call-for-investment-in-universal-healthcare,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/03/ebola-epidemic-is-wake-up-call-for-investment-in-universal-healthcare
2015-03-02T13:58:23Z,global-development,Global development,Namibia's president wins $5m African leadership prize,"Namibia’s president, Hifikepunye Pohamba, has won the $5m (£3.2m) African leadership prize awarded by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation for boosting governance, media freedom and human rights in the southern African country. Pohamba, 79, was a founding member of Namibia’s ruling party, South West Africa People’s Organisation (Swapo), and was held as a political prisoner during South Africa’s colonial rule over the country. He was whipped in public for advocating for an independent Namibia. Pohamba’s win is the first time the prize has been awarded since 2011, when it was given to Cape Verde’s former president Pedro Verona Pires. The honour is the world’s most valuable individual prize, gifting the winner $5m over 10 years and $200,000 a year for life. “President Pohamba’s focus in forging national cohesion and reconciliation at a key stage of Namibia’s consolidation of democracy and social and economic development impressed the ‎prize committee,” said Salim Ahmed Salim, Tanzania’s former prime minister and chairman of the prize committee, which announced the winner at a ceremony in Nairobi, Kenya.
Pohamba was elected in 2004 and reelected in 2009. He is the first acting president to win the prize, but he has said he will hand power to prime minister Hage Geingob, who won November’s presidential election, later this month. Salim said: “During the decade of Hifikepunye Pohamba’s presidency, Namibia’s reputation has been cemented as a well-governed, stable and inclusive democracy with strong media freedom and respect for human rights.” Pohamba was praised for overseeing strong economic growth with gross domestic product per capita rising from $3,297 in 2004 to $5,693 in 2013, according to the World Bank. Under Pohamba’s leadership, Swapo has been applauded for making strides in gender equality, with 25 of 72 parliamentary seats filled by women. The party has also been commended for improving national health services and increasing Namibia’s life expectancy from 55 in 2004 to 64 in 2012. The Mo Ibrahim Foundation, which publishes an annual assessment of governance in every African country known as the Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG), credited Pohamba with Namibia’s standing at sixth-best in the continent.
The index ranks African countries according to their progress in promoting legal systems, protecting human rights and engendering economic and human development. Since the prize was founded in 2007, just four winners have been named. These include Botswana’s former president, Festus Gontebanye Mogae, who won in 2008, and Mozambique’s former president Joaquim Alberto Chissano, who was awarded the prize in 2007. Nelson Mandela was given an honorary prize in 2007. Mo Ibrahim, who made his $1.1bn fortune in the telecoms sector, spoke highly of Pires’ modesty and commitment to Cape Verde’s development. “When he lost the election, he called a taxi because he has no car. And he went to live with his mother because he has no apartment. Look at him and you see a very modest man. I’ve been to his house and I know how they live.” Ibrahim said Pohamba “introduced democracy” to Namibia, and he praised him for his strong economic leadership. “He [Pohamba] took this country, which has no resources, out of the low-income country list.” “He has served his country since its independence and his leadership has renewed his people’s trust in democracy. His legacy is that of strengthened institutions through the various initiatives introduced during his tenure in office. He is a role model for the continent.” • This article was amended on 2 March 2015 to clarify that in the quote below, Ibrahim was referring to the former Cape Verde president Pedro Verona Pires, not Pohamba: “When he lost the election, he called a taxi because he has no car. And he went to live with his mother because he has no apartment. Look at him and you see a very modest man.

2015-03-02T07:00:07Z,global-development,Global development,Young Afghans strive for education and better lives after years of turmoil | Sune Engel Rasmussen,"About 3,000 young Afghans filed out of Kabul University one morning after sitting their public university entrance exam. They emerged in two separate rows: girls to the right, boys to the left. After picking up her mobile phone from the battered minivan used to store items banned from the examination room, Nooria, 19 – who, like many Afghans, goes by one name – explained why young people in the country are gravitating toward higher education. “First of all, it is hard for poor people to find a job without education. Secondly, the people of Afghanistan have been in war for a long time. They want to move forward,” she said. In Afghanistan, the path to education and a secure economic future is narrow. The number of young people striving for a coveted spot in one of the country’s universities is rising, but the number of jobs to support them on the other side is not. The last round of this year’s public university entry exam, known as the kankur, has just taken place. For the first time in a decade, the ministry of higher education was not able to expand capacity to match the growing number of applicants. About 280,000 high school graduates sat the test, vying for one of the 55,000 places available. While children of wealthy parents can opt for one of the 40,000 seats in the country’s private universities, which often have lower academic thresholds, public universities are the only option for poorer families such as Nooria’s. “If I fail the kankur, I will probably sit at home, but many boys will choose crime,” she said. As the desire for higher education has spread, the kankur has become more than a contest between the brightest minds: gaining entrance to university is also a matter of money and muscle. The night before the exam, Mohammad Hassan, 20, saw an email chain from an unnamed sender offering answers to all the exam questions for 5,000 afghanis (£56). He said he had done well on the test without cheating, but perhaps not as well as those who did. “If there is still a place for me, I will get in,” he said with a laugh. The competition is further rigged by some of the people who are expected to safeguard it. Obaid Ali, a researcher with the Afghanistan Analysts Network in Kabul, said the most serious challenge to a fair kankur process is interference from power brokers in the provinces. “Provincial council members and parliamentarians try to influence the kankur process,” said Anwar Shams, director of the governmental kankur preparation committee. This year, Shams said, local politicians in Ghazni and Paktika provinces attacked invigilators. In Khost, an MP sent death threats to a supervisor, pressing him to award certain students a high score. The kankur consists of 160 multiple-choice questions, granting a total of 332 points. Before the test, students choose their desired five fields of study. If their test results aren’t high enough, they are not admitted to university. Most students choose fields such as law, economy and political science, but that is not necessarily where the jobs are. Only 4% of employed Afghans work in public administration, according to a 2012 report from the International Labour Organisation. Meanwhile, very few universities offer degrees related to agriculture, even though it occupies almost 60% of the population, and is in dire need of development. “There’s a real gap between the skills provided within the university, and the real market,” said Hervé Nicolle, director of Samuel Hall, a research company, and an expert on labour and youth issues in Afghanistan. Without a degree, however, the future is even bleaker. Roughly 400,000 Afghans enter the workforce every year, many of them uneducated. While international agencies teach vocational skills, their programmes are often tailored to international rather than local employers, explained Nicolle. “You teach people English and computer skills so they can get jobs with NGOs or USAid, rather than preparing them for the actual economic and labour market,” he said. Unskilled workers should be aiming for jobs in agribusiness, the service industry or the construction sector, Nicolle added. “However, with the withdrawal of international troops and reduction of aid, these sectors are contracting.” The number of kankur examinees has risen fourfold since 2007. In the same period, the number of female university students has increased by 40%. About a quarter of the students at Kabul University are women. Zahra, 20, emerging from another throng exiting the university, hoped that she would soon be one of them. The first woman in her family to aspire to university, she had put down the faculty of humanities as her top choice. “We want to educate ourselves,” she said. “We want to choose our own future.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/02/afghanistan-education-university-places-kankur-exam,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/mar/02/afghanistan-education-university-places-kankur-exam

Since she began her Campaign for Female Education (Camfed) in 1993, she has supported 3 million children in five countries to stay in school and will support another million over the next five years. “Changemakers don’t come from the elites, from the rich,” she says, but from the poor. Which is why she invests in them. And she says that poverty isn’t something that just happens to people who are not like us. At a time when headlines are full of stories of schools being burned down in Pakistan and Afghanistan, closed down over swaths of Nigeria and targeted by extremists in Indonesia, Cotton is seeing success, as things come full circle. She is seeing how many of those children are now in turn supporting the education of the next generation – and that really thrills her.
Last year she picked up the Wise prize at an education summit in Qatar and was recognised by OECD for best practice in development innovation. The model, she says, is to create sustainability in part through Cama – a 25,000-member pan-African network of Camfed graduates who are now rural businesswomen, and economically-independent role models. Almost 5,000 have become teachers.
Cotton says: “We only recruit inside Africa for our staff. We don’t send in outsiders to tell them what to do. And accountability is first and foremost to the child, not the donor. We aren’t swinging with every fashion, every shift in donor or government interests. You can’t raise the aspirations of a child and then leave them hanging, poverty can’t be solved by a project. Its solved by a relationship, collaboration, not coming in and making a new structure and putting our name over it and moving on.” Born in Cardiff to parents from mining communities in Aberdare, Cotton won a scholarship to a private girls’ school where teachers promptly began the process of anglicising and gentrifying the young Welsh girl as effectively as they could. She says: “It was different times, with antiquated methods, but it was a sharp lesson in feeling like an outsider, of loneliness.” The exclusion she felt drew her towards her first job, a teacher at a challenging state comprensive in south London. In 1991, on a trip to Zimbabwe, she ended up among the Tonga and Kore Kore people, who had been displaced by the colonial-era Kariba dam in the late 1950s and whose lives have been utterly devastated as a result. It resonated. Cotton says: “They had unwittingly colluded with their own downfall. They were promised everything – schools, clinics, homes – and of course they got nothing, less than nothing. The more I learned the more I saw parallels between what had happened in Wales with the miners, the powerlessness, the fact that the only thing you have is your labour and the only thing you can withdraw is your labour and if you do that for too long then you won’t survive. Even with enormous community cohesion, it isn’t possible to win. It was a metaphor for the poor everywhere.
“In Zimbabwe what struck me was that I felt I hadn’t understood colonisation in all its magnitude. The more I learned the angrier I got.” But when Cotton returned to the UK and started looking at what was being done to help, her sense of injustice only grew. She says: “I was patronised by the aid agencies. I was told ‘Oh, those people are just telling you what they think you want to hear’.
“The prevailing view was that girls weren’t going to school because of family resistance. But when I was in poor and traditional villages people were talking about making clear economic decisions. It wasn’t about culture. Boys in the wider world had the best levels of paid work so it made sense to invest in a boy to go to school. It was a socioeconomic issue. There is this sense that the poor are not like ‘us’. They are this amorphous mass of people who are not individuals but a collection of people who have things done to them by people who know better. “I hear ‘but why do poor people make such bad decisions’. But actually their decision-making can be far more complex than that of the better-off in many ways. They’re not financially illiterate, they’re constantly weighing up choices based on the reality of poverty. Somehow the international development community has resisted accepting this.” “There’s a history of NGOs going into areas and saying ‘let’s do this’. Poverty diminishes confidence, so if someone offers you a grain store, even if you really need a plough, you take what is offered to you.”
Cotton insists Camfed supports without imposing. “That’s why things like Madonna’s school didn’t work,” she says. “You can’t just go in and throw up a school and expect it all to work.” Cotton is no household name, but she is a much-decorated speaker on the international stage, her speech as the present laureate of the Wise prize for education was televised internationally. She has gained supporters with her unassuming style, and easy smile, combined with a schoolteacher firmness and keen sense of injustice. Sarah Brown is a fan, as is Cherie Blair, and the Queen awarded her an OBE. But no daughter of Welsh mining stock is over-impressed with power. “Power lies with white middle-class men,” she says. “There are other elites of course but that is the one with the most power. That gene pool is not of its nature excellent. “We have a world with considerable problems and we are casting aside so many. We cannot ignore this lot of people and expect to make global progress. “All countries have poor people. Yet it’s a very rare country which understands the indignities of poverty, while education systems maintain the status quo. The children of the elite go to the best schools and get the best jobs, not because they are the best. We’re not taking advantage of the intellectual power on this planet, whether in Malawi or Britain. We are casting so much of it aside.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/28/ann-cotton-educating-millions-within-africa-by-inspiring-sustainable-change,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/28/ann-cotton-educating-millions-within-africa-by-inspiring-sustainable-change
2015-02-27T18:02:21Z,global-development,Global development,British support for Ethiopia scheme withdrawn amid abuse allegations,"The UK has ended its financial support for a controversial development project alleged to have helped the Ethiopian government fund a brutal resettlement programme. Hundreds of people have been forced from their land as a result of the scheme, while there have also been reports of torture, rape and beatings. Until last month, Britain’s Department for International Development (DfID) was the primary funder of the promotion of basic services (PBS) programme, a $4.9bn (£3.2bn) project run by the World Bank and designed to boost education, health and water services in Ethiopia. On Thursday, DfID said it had ended its PBS contributions because of Ethiopia’s “growing success”, adding that financial decisions of this nature were routinely made after considering a recipient country’s “commitment to partnership principles”. It has been alleged that programme funds have been used to bankroll the Ethiopian government’s push to move 1.5 million rural families from their land to new “model” villages across the country. Opponents of the commune development programme (CDP) say it has been characterised by violence. One Ethiopian farmer is taking legal action against the British government, claiming UK money has funded abuses against Anuak peoplein the Gambella region. The man, an Anuak known as Mr O, says he was beaten and witnessed rapes and assaults as government soldiers cleared people off their land. DfID has always insisted it does not fund Ethiopia’s commune development programme. A scathing draft report from the World Bank’s internal watchdog recently concluded that inadequate oversight, bad audit practices, and a failure to follow the bank’s own rules had allowed operational links to form between the PBS programme and the Ethiopian government’s resettlement scheme. Although the bank’s inspection panel found that funds could have been diverted to implement villagisation, it did not look into whether the resettlement programme had involved human rights abuses, claiming such questions were outside its remit. DfID, which has contributed nearly £745m of UK taxpayer money to the PBS programme, said the decision to withdraw financial support was prompted in part by Ethiopia’s “impressive progress” towards the millennium development goals. “The UK will now evolve its approach by transitioning support towards economic development to help generate jobs, income and growth that will enable self-sufficiency and ultimately end poverty,” it said. “This will go alongside additional funding for specific health, education and water programmes – where impressive results are already being delivered – resourced by ending support for the promotion of basic Services programme.” A DfID spokesman said the move had nothing to do with Mr O’s ongoing legal action or the World Bank’s internal report, but added: “Changes to programmes are based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, country context, progress to date and commitment to partnership principles.” The department said its overall financial commitment to Ethiopia, one of the largest recipients of UK aid, would remain unchanged, with almost £256m due to be spent between 2015 and 2016. The Ethiopian government said DfID’s decision was not a matter of concern. “They have been discussing it with pertinent government bodies,” said the communications minister, Redwan Hussien. “What they said is that the aid that they’re giving will not be refused or stopped, it will be reorganised.” The World Bank’s executive board met on Thursday to discuss the internal report on the PBS programme and the management response. In a statement released on Friday, the bank said that although its inspection panel had concluded that the seizing of land and use of violence and intimidation were not consequences of PBS, it had determined that the programme “did not fully assess and mitigate the risks arising from the government’s implementation of CDP, particularly in the delivery of agricultural services to the Anuaks”. The World Bank Group president, Jim Yong Kim, said that one of the institution’s core principles was to do no harm to the poor, adding: “In this case, while the inspection panel found no violations, it did point out areas where we could have done more to help the Anuak people. We draw important lessons from this case to better anticipate ways to protect the poor and be more effective in fighting poverty.” Opponents of the villagisation process have been vocal in their criticisms of the bank’s role. Jessica Evans, senior international financial institutions researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the inspection panel’s report showed the bank had “largely ignored human rights risks evident in its projects in Ethiopia” and highlighted “the perils of unaccountable budget support” in the country.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/27/british-support-for-ethiopia-scheme-withdrawn-amid-abuse-allegations,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/27/british-support-for-ethiopia-scheme-withdrawn-amid-abuse-allegations
2015-02-27T07:00:02Z,global-development,Global development,The best books on Burma: start your reading here,"The Glass Palace by Amitav Ghosh From the British invasion of Mandalay in 1885, this lively novel of love, loss and longing sweeps across more than 100 years of history in Burma, India and Malaya. Rajkumar Raha, an 11-year-old penniless orphan, is witness to the British attack. As he mingles with looters in the royal palace, he spies – and is instantly smitten by – 10-year-old Dolly, a maid, who accompanies the Burmese monarchs into exile in India. Years later, having made his fortune in teak, Raha goes in search of Dolly. The fast-moving story links three families through three generations as they are buffeted by the region’s political turmoil and social upheaval. It’s storytelling on a grand scale – through empire, two world wars, independence struggles and Burma’s military regime – but Ghosh doesn’t neglect to make his characters both interesting and believable. He also serves up more than a sumptuous family saga. By giving voice to the Burmese and Indians who are witness to the waxing and waning of empire, he offers an intelligent, thought-provoking and ultimately damning portrait of British colonialism. Ghosh’s meticulously researched book took five years to write, with the seed of the story planted by tales of his own family’s history. The Lizard Cage by Karen Connelly Connelly’s gritty novel about a political prisoner is a paean to the human spirit and a savage indictment of Burma’s military regime. Teza, a student activist and popular protest singer, is in solitary confinement in a prison complex known as “The Cage”. Arrested during the pro-democracy protests in 1988, which were brutally suppressed, he has served seven years of a 20-year term. Under the harsh prison regime, Teza suffers constant hunger – using lizards to supplement his diet – and vicious beatings. He depends on his Buddhist faith and memories of bygone days to endure the hardship. Senior jailer Chit Naing, troubled by his conscience, is sympathetic to Teza’s plight, but junior jailer “Handsome” is sadistic and violent. Also in the Cage is Little Brother, an orphaned boy raised in the prison, who survives by killing rats and selling them to the hungry prisoners. He becomes Teza’s server, delivering his prison meals. When the chief warden tries to frame Teza – to increase his sentence – the novel turns thriller as both prisoner and boy face grave danger. Connelly pulls no punches on the horrors of prison life, but offers the tentative bond formed between Teza and Little Brother as some small hope in this powerful tale. Canadian poet and writer Connelly has visited Burma often and lived for two years among Burmese exiles on the Thailand-Burma border. The River of Lost Footsteps by Thant Myint-U Thant weaves some of his own family history into this comprehensive chronicle of Burma’s past. It harks back to Burma’s foundations, but comes into its own with the British assault and occupation in 1885 – a watershed year that ushers in the modern age. The monarchy is abolished, old certainties disappear, and society is “aggressively transformed”. Wounded national pride is dealt a further blow, says Thant, when Britain rules the country as an appendage of India. Burma emerges at independence in 1948 devastated by the second world war, with some of its top leaders assassinated in the previous year, and heralding the outbreak of the world’s longest-running civil war – hardly a promising start. Thant relates how the fledgling democracy is dogged by turbulent politics, foreign incursions and insurgencies. General Ne Win’s coup in 1962 brings the shutters down on the outside world, and Burma descends into decades of dictatorship. Despite huge protests in 1988 and the emergence of the generals’ nemesis, Aung San Suu Kyi, the military remains in charge today. “We fail to consider history at our peril,” says Thant in this subtle and engaging portrait of the country, which is mandatory reading for anyone who wants to understand modern-day Burma. Historian Thant was born in the US to Burmese parents. His grandfather U Thant was the UN secretary general for 10 years, until 1971. • Check out the other countries in our World Library series: Nigeria, Colombia,Vietnam, Egypt, Brazil, Kenya, Indonesia, Libya, Mexico, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Philippines, Iran, Peru, Somalia, China, Afghanistan, Haiti,Sudan, Thailand, Argentina and Algeria",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/27/best-books-burma-world-library,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/27/best-books-burma-world-library
2015-02-26T07:00:00Z,global-development,Global development,Vulnerable families bear the brunt of Norway's crackdown on asylum seekers | Sune Engel Rasmussen,"In autumn last year, life was finally improving for Nadereh Hashemi. After spending all her adult years on the run from her family in Afghanistan – she lived in Iran for 10 years before making an arduous escape to Europe – Nadereh and her husband, Ahmad, finally found something resembling a stable life in Europe. At a centre for asylum seekers in Norway, outside the village of Røn, she and Ahmad were poor, but they had security, food and housing. Their two oldest children, Meisam and Mohammad, went to school, and their youngest, Zahra, spoke Norwegian almost like a native. Nadereh was receiving medication for depression. After four years and two months in Norway, the family was just four months short of qualifying for a residence permit on humanitarian grounds under the rules for asylum seekers. But on 7 November, Norway’s immigration appeals board (UNE) rejected their request for asylum. At 5am the next morning, a dozen police officers banged on the family’s door at Lundeskogen asylum centre. As they were escorted to a car that would take them to a holding facility at Oslo airport, four-year-old Zahra shouted: “I am not Afghan, I am Norwegian.” The next evening, the family was on a plane to Kabul. “It was a very dark day,” said Ahmad. “A very bad day.” Under a policy introduced by the centre-right coalition government that came to power in late 2013, Norway now deport families with children. Last year, according to Norwegian police, the country forcibly deported 649 children, 84 of them to Afghanistan. The deportations have met staunch resistance from civil society advocates, who accuse the government of violating international rights conventions. Recently, the Afghan government also put its foot down. On 10 February, Afghan authorities at Kabul airport refused entry to a woman who had been deported from Norway with two children, citing the woman’s poor health and the absence of a male family member. The woman’s husband had escaped before Norwegian police could deport him. It was not the first time the Afghan government had balked at the harsher Norwegian policies. In November, the Afghan foreign ministry sent a letter to the Norwegian embassy in Kabul, threatening to refuse to accept returning families if deportation rates did not drop. “The problem arises when so many are deported against their will, particularly when so many of them are women and children,” Ghulam Murtaza Rasooli, legal director at the Afghan ministry of refugees and repatriation, told the Norwegian daily Bergens Tidende in January. The letter was sent six days before the Hashemi family was deported. However, the deportations have continued. Jøran Kallmyr, of the anti-immigration Progress party and state secretary for the Norwegian justice minister, said: “It is not very unusual for countries who receive deported people to complain.” The Guardian has followed the Hashemi family for two months, as they attempt to settle into their new life in Afghanistan, a country none of the children had seen before setting foot there in November. On their arrival, the government offered the family a temporary place at a guesthouse for returnees. Residents there warned Ahmad that returning families face danger as they are often rumoured to have made a lot of money abroad. “I was afraid that my children would be kidnapped,” Ahmad said. Instead, the family, who are Hazaras, settled in Kabul’s predominantly Shia neighbourhood of Chendawol, where an imam let them stay in a small room at the back of a mosque. In late January, they moved a block away, to a smaller room. It had mouldy walls and a gas burner was the sole source of heat for the night, when temperatures in the winter drop well below zero.
While Ahmad searches for work in the day, Nadereh and the children spend their time in the room, afraid to venture outside. “This is hell. This is not a country. People die here every day,” said Meisam, 11. “I don’t want to see my father or mother die, or lose my brother or sister.” In a corner of the room, a small backpack belonging to six-year-old Mohammad is packed and ready to be taken back to school. Between blankets on the floor, Zahra, aged four, fiddles with a teddy bearing a Turkish Airlines logo. When talking to each other, the children speak in Norwegian. The parents have not yet had the heart to tell Mohammad and Zahra that they have left Norway for good. “We tell them that the plane is broken and just needs to be fixed,” said Nadereh. “They tell other children they meet in the mosque that they are going to take them to Norway, to show them their room.” Since arriving in Kabul, Mohammad has suffered from ear pains, and a stomach ache that makes it difficult for him to keep food down. His siblings regularly cough and seem lethargic. In Afghanistan, medication is notoriously unreliable, and a financial burden. According to Norway’s justice ministry, the Oslo government gives $10-20,000 (£6,455-12,910) to families who return to Afghanistan voluntarily, but only about $500 a person when they are returned by force. With both parents currently unable to provide for the children, that money is only enough to eke out a basic life. Ahmad occasionally finds work as a daily labourer on construction sites, for which he gets paid 350 afghani (£4). The monthly rent on their room is 2,000 afghani. Richard Danziger, the chief of mission for the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) in Kabul, says that while any country has the right to deport or reject asylum seekers, deporting families to Afghanistan requires “very careful consideration” at present: “Economic and educational opportunities are limited and decent housing is scarce. Equally, the security situation has seen some deterioration over the last few weeks and we are in the middle of a harsh winter.” Kallmyr, however, said that if Norway were to give asylum to families because they were poor and not in need of political protection, “there would be millions of potential asylum seekers that we would then be obligated to give asylum”. He added that a life in Kabul was better for children than being confined to an asylum centre in Norway. “We have a lot of children living in asylum centres, and that’s not a very good condition for children to live in,” he said. The Hashemi family did claim asylum on protection grounds. But the persecution they claim to face is personal, not political. It was not possible to verify their claims, but what the couple told the Guardian is consistent with documents from Norwegian asylum authorities.
The heart of Nadereh and Ahmad’s story is, apparently, a tale of forbidden love. They grew up in Wardak, a conflict-ridden province west of Kabul. Nadereh came from a violent home with a father who, when she was nine, promised her to an older cousin. But before they could marry, Nadereh, at the age of 17, ran off to Iran with her neighbour, Ahmad. Nadereh’s father was an elder in their village, and her daughter’s escape was seen as a great shame for the family. Her brothers vowed to track down Ahmad and kill him. Eight years after Nadereh and Ahmad had settled in Tehran, people in the community one day warned them that a couple of men had been asking about them. “I don’t know how they found us,” said Nadereh, who was then pregnant with Zahra. They fled to Norway, where they applied for asylum in September 2010, four months before Zahra was born. In Norway, the stricter immigration policies have triggered a major political dispute, mostly about refugee children with long-term ties to Norway. In 2014, 79 children who had lived in the country for four years or more were deported. The majority were sent to Afghanistan and Nigeria, the governments of which recently agreed to open up for returning refugees. According to Norwegian law, the welfare of the child, including his or her connection to Norway, has to be a central factor in determining asylum cases. But Ketil Krohn Venås, a lawyer who represented the Hashemi family, said that in several cases, including that of Nadereh and Ahmad, the children’s wellbeing has been outweighed by attempts to regulate migration. Deportations surged dramatically from September to November, possibly in an attempt to reach the government’s stated goal of returning 7,100 rejected asylum seekers in 2014. According to Norwegian police, a total of 7,259 people were deported in 2014, including 438 to Afghanistan. The government’s goal for 2015 is to forcibly return 7,800 people. Kallmyr said the increase was merely making up for the neglect of previous governments. “We can’t have a system where children are used by their parents to get permission to stay in Norway,” he said. This week, Venås will bring Nadereh and her family’s case to court in Oslo, asking for their asylum claim to be reconsidered. He will claim that the Norwegian government has violated the UN convention on the rights of the child and the European convention on human rights. “The children are Norwegian, they can’t live like this,” Venås said.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/26/norway-crackdown-asylum-seekers-afganistan-immigration,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/26/norway-crackdown-asylum-seekers-afganistan-immigration
2015-02-26T00:01:03Z,global-development,Global development,"Failing global war on drugs disastrous for low-income farmers, claims study","Wealthy countries are exacerbating poverty by pressurising governments to enforce prohibitionist drug policies that exploit farmers and waste billions of pounds a year on failed law enforcement programmes, a health group has warned. The global war on drugs is wreaking environmental damage, hurting health systems and setting back women’s rights in drug-producing countries such as Afghanistan, Colombia and Guinea-Bissau, according to Casualties of War (pdf), a report published on Thursday by the UK-based advocacy group Health Poverty Action (HPA). Policies designed to disrupt the production of narcotics like cocaine and heroin are denying low-income farmers access to basic services and isolating them from transport links, making it harder for them to switch to growing legal crops, the report said. “Having an international system of prohibition allows richer countries to pressure poorer countries into setting up more restrictive drug laws of their own, including militarising prohibition and drug law enforcement,” said the report’s author, Catherine Martin, a policy adviser at HPA. The study warned that using the military to enforce drug prohibition has often created power vacuums and weakened democratic institutions. Afghanistan’s crackdown on opium and heroin traffickers, for instance, has destabilised the central government, leaving it “stuck in a losing war against drug cartels”, said the report. Failed drug policies are also diverting public resources away from spending on health and education, according to the study: “Dealing with the violence, environmental destruction, and health impacts caused by the war on drugs costs poor countries much more and diverts both resources and attention away from essential services.” Colombia, one of the world’s biggest cocaine producers, continues to spend $35.7bn (£23bn) a year on failed policies directly related to the global war on drugs, according to HPA’s estimates. These costs are associated with ecological degradation and internal displacement as well as spending on defence and security, the group said. Historically, the US has led the charge in pressuring poorer countries to crack down on drug trafficking and enforce prohibitionist policies, Martin said. But now countries like Russia and Japan are advocating harsh punishments, including the death penalty, for drug traffickers and producers. “Many of those people involved at lower levels of the drug trade do so out of economic necessity but this is rarely taken into account when they are caught up in the criminal justice system,” said Ann Fordham, executive director of the International Drug Policy Consortium. HPA estimates that the world spends at least $100bn on enforcing anti-drug policies, almost as much as the annual global aid spend of $130bn. “Poorer countries feel they have to throw everything they have into drug law enforcement to avoid souring relations with richer countries,” Martin said. But development groups have not spoken out against the ill-effects that drug policies are having on campaigns to reduce poverty and improve the livelihoods of the world’s poorest. “There’s really no region that is untouched by this, which is why it’s such a crucial issue for development organisations,” Martin said. Aid donors have failed to draw a connection between drug and development policies, according to HPA. The UK’s criminalisation of khat, a mild stimulant popular in the horn of Africa, has wreaked havoc on African economies, undermining development programmes being carried out in the region, said the organisation. “There are a lot of countries that are trying out new drug policies, and in a lot of places they’re finding a lot of success in getting more people into treatment and reducing crime. But it’s the wealthier nations who have the freedom to [move away from prohibitionist drug laws]. No one is going to penalise the US for the fact that several states have legalised marijuana,” added Martin. The UN general assembly on the world drug problem is due to hold a summit on global drug policy in 2016. Martin said: “Ideally I think we would see a revision of UN conventions to take the pressure off national governments, give them a lot more leeway to design their national policies, open up at least the possibility of legalisation of some drugs in some areas.” Fordham added: “Governments need to reassess the approach and move away from repressive measures that further exacerbate marginalisation and vulnerability and invest their resources in policies that are based in principles of public health, human rights, development and human security.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/26/global-war-drugs-havoc-farmers-environment-womens-rights-health-poverty-action,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/26/global-war-drugs-havoc-farmers-environment-womens-rights-health-poverty-action
2015-02-25T12:59:47Z,global-development,Global development,Africa urged to protect its communities by taking control of its land,"When a group of Emirati royals approached the Tanzanian government requesting the allocation of a 1,500 sq km wildlife corridor to hunt game, officials agreed even though the plan would mean ousting 40,000 Maasais from their ancestral land. In Kenya last month, police lobbed tear gas at school children protesting the “grabbing” of their playground, triggering a national outcry that forced authorities to abandon plans to sell the plot to a private developer.
Africa is seen by foreign interests as the last great frontier for investment in large-scale, land-based agriculture and tourism ventures. But the appetite for acquisition is pushing vulnerable communities off their land, with authorities often taking the side of investors over local people. A UN-backed group known as the Land Policy Initiative (LPI) is lobbying governments to implement guiding principles that were adopted by African heads of state in November. The guidelines, which are backed by the UN Economic Commission for Africa, the African Development Bank and the African Union (AU), encourage authorities to follow certain steps before entering into agreements with investors seeking the allocation of large swathes of land. The steps include rigorous consultation with local communities before deals are signed, the formulation of harmonised land policy frameworks across Africa, and adequate compensation for individuals and communities that stand to lose their land. The policy document calls for greater transparency in handling these deals. Governments are required to disclose the identities of all parties involved before approving allocations, including identifying the owners of the investment firms, financial intermediaries and backers. The AU has an exceedingly poor record of implementing its own resolutions, but Joan Kagwanja, head of the LPI, says the new policy will be different. The LPI will work with regional government associations and other players to drive through the changes. “Land is obviously a critical resource and the most important factor of production in a continent where the vast majority of people rely on subsistence agriculture,” she said at an event last week in Djibouti, where the LPI was lobbying the 11 countries in the Horn of Africa to embrace the policy framework. “If properly implemented, this set of principles can equip African countries to manage land in a transparent and sustainable manner that takes into account the needs of all parties and protects the rights of vulnerable groups, including women.”
There has been a boom in major land investments in Africa over the past two decades, with the continent accounting for 45% of all deals concluded worldwide, according to the UN. About 60% of the world’s arable land is in Africa, where foreign investors are increasingly uprooting communities from land they have lived on for centuries. Nor do the consequences stop there. The promotion of biofuels as an alternative source of clean energy, for instance, has led Ghana and other countries to put vast tracts of prime agricultural land under cultivation for biofuel feedstock, but the failure of many such ventures has left land unsuitable for farming. “If there is harmony in the approach taken by authorities across the continent you can avoid a race to the bottom where investors go from country to country looking for the deal that yields maximum advantage to them without regard to the interests of the community,” said Janet Edeme, head of the AU’s rural economy and agriculture division. The guiding principles build on a declaration adopted by the AU in 2009 on a broad framework of land tenure management policies that should be adopted by African governments.
Among the key provisions are the decentralisation of land administration systems, making them more accessible to communities who often lack the financial clout to agitate for their rights in courts typically located in distant urban centres. States are also asked to respect the rights of women, who are often at a position of great disadvantage in accessing land despite being the key players in the agricultural sector. “Member states should ensure that women and girls’ equal tenure rights and access to land, fisheries and forests are clearly protected in national laws independent of individuals’ civil and marital status,” the policy document demands. Civil society representatives have cautiously welcomed the drive to harmonise African land policy but say the key test will be implementation. “The initiative is laudable and it is a good thing that, for the first time, there has been a continent-wide agreement on a land sector policy framework with endorsement by heads of state,” said Ibrahim Mwathane, head of the Land Development and Governance Institute, a Nairobi-based policy research centre. “But these decisions can only make a difference in people’s lives if implemented at the local level and the LPI should take advantage of the fact governments voluntarily signed on to these principles and work with the private sector, civil society and research institutions to press governments to implement the rules they have signed on to.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/25/africa-urged-to-protect-its-communities-by-taking-control-of-its-land,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/25/africa-urged-to-protect-its-communities-by-taking-control-of-its-land

Similar language emerged from the UN’s peacekeeping chief, who accused both the government and rebels of “a serious failure of leadership that remains focused on its pursuit for power rather than care of its people”. The US measure, which was submitted to the UN security council on Tuesday, came a day after the latest round of negotiations to end South Sudan’s 14-month civil war began in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. Seven ceasefires have failed to take hold in South Sudan, which erupted into violence in December 2013 after President Salva Kiir accused his vice-president, Riek Machar, of plotting a coup. Tens of thousands are thought to have died in the fighting, which has displaced 1.5 million people internally and forced another 480,000 into neighbouring countries. Although famine was averted last year, the UN estimates 3.9 million people will face food insecurity in South Sudan in 2015, with 2.5 million becoming severely food insecure. The draft resolution raises the possibility of an arms embargo on the world’s youngest country – a measure strongly backed by European countries despite concerns that the ban would penalise Kiir’s forces more than Machar’s rebels. “The political leaders have repeatedly failed to put their narrow political and economic agendas aside in order to find political solutions that could bring a measure of stability,” a US official told AFP. “In light of that, our goal is to work with our partners to move forward with a sanctions resolution that will lay the groundwork for imposing costs on those who continue to fail to work toward a solution.” Asked why the resolution did not explicitly call for an arms embargo, a US official told Reuters the idea was to take an “incremental approach”, gradually increasing pressure on the warring factions. Earlier this month, Valerie Amos, the UN under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, backed calls for an arms embargo. “Anything that takes weapons off the streets, out of countries and out of communities will help us because ultimately for us it’s about bringing peace,” she told the Guardian. “If there are no weapons, it’s harder for people to fight, peace will come sooner and we can get more aid to the people who so desperately need it.” Despite the latest US moves, however, the UN’s peacekeeping chief, Hervé Ladsous, told the security council “the likelihood that either side could soften its stance remains low”. He said the peace talks had been marred by “a serious failure of leadership that remains focused on its pursuit for power rather than care of its people”, adding: “There is now an urgent need to reinforce the mediation efforts, as well as to impose consequences on the parties if they fail to show willingness to compromise, and continue engaging in a conflict that will result in further loss of innocent lives.” Regional negotiators have now set a deadline of 5 March for Kiir and Machar to reach a final peace deal that includes a transitional unity government. A second deadline of 1 April has been set to launch preparations for the transition, which should be completed no later than 9 July. US officials described the two deadlines as milestones and said the security council would decide at those times whether to move forward and impose sanctions, once the resolution is adopted. A vote on the US-drafted resolution at the security council could take place next week, diplomats said. The draft resolution threatens sanctions against those involved in recruiting child soldiers, as well as those who block deliveries of humanitarian aid and leaders who fail to advance peace negotiations. It provides for a panel of experts to be established along with a sanctions committee that would report to the security council on the situation in South Sudan. Although the US announced plans in November to present a sanctions resolution, the measure ran into resistance over the arms embargo provision and shifting positions from African governments in the region. More than two dozen armed forces – including government soldiers and allied militia backed by Ugandan soldiers on one side, and a range of rebel factions on the other – have been battling since December 2013. Fighting has raged this month in the northern Upper Nile state, with the government warning that rebel forces were splintering, making any negotiations increasingly complicated. Last week, the UN children’s agency, Unicef, said that at least 89 boys – some as young as 13 – had been kidnapped by gunmen as they were preparing to sit school exams in the town of Wau Shilluk in the north of the country. Both sides have been accused of using child soldiers. Unicef estimates that at least 12,000 children have been recruited. South Sudan, which won independence from Sudan in July 2011, is also facing a worsening health crisis. On Tuesday, the World Health Organisation (WHO) appealed for $90m (£580m) of additional funding to provide vital health services to about 3.35 million people in South Sudan. The WHO said the disruption caused by months of fighting had weakened health systems and led to recurrent outbreaks of communicable diseases. It also noted that more than 80% of services are now being provided by international organisations.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/25/south-sudan-sanctions-loom-us-draft-resolution-un-security-council,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/25/south-sudan-sanctions-loom-us-draft-resolution-un-security-council
2015-02-24T10:00:04Z,global-development,Global development,Climate finance: the focus must be on quality not quantity,"The offer by rich countries to provide “climate finance” to poorer countries to help them adapt to climate change and reduce their own emissions was a key part of the hard-negotiated, ill-fated climate summit in Copenhagen in 2009 and was confirmed in Cancún a year later. The promise was that such finance would be “new and additional”, but there was no agreement as to what that meant. Even more confusing, initially the offer was drafted as a pledge of public money (similar to development aid), but the word “public” was subsequently removed, leaving the door open for private finance to reach the $100bn (£64bn) annual commitment (from 2020). Observers of international negotiations will find this a perfect example of deliberate ambiguity, sufficient to keep struggling negotiations on course. Everyone could eventually sign up to this pledge. The intended recipients of the cash were satisfied with the spirit of what was on offer, while the rich country negotiators held to its letter, knowing that in reality they weren’t signing up to anything at all. The concept of additionality has inspired a mini research industry, but little clarity. In the end, the only sensible interpretation of the concept is that it means additional to development aid that is already being offered, ie that countries would not reduce aid in order to meet climate finance commitments. In fact, thought, climate finance fits the OECD’s criteria for aid and it is almost always counted as such. It is not additional to anything – even less so if we remember that the pledge to reach 0.7% of GDP in aid donations has been met by only a handful of countries. To be fair, in an era of austerity, the idea that donor countries will ramp up ODA according to their 0.7% commitments and spend additional amounts on climate finance is optimistic to say the least. Those countries that have reached the 0.7% target, like the UK, are hardly going to turn to their electorates now and ask for more, however urgent the need. That is why the loophole provided by the deletion of the word “public” is now so important. Despite insistence by prominent academic authorities and developing countries that the money should not only be public but mostly in grant form (to avoid further burdening poor countries with debt), this is not being taken seriously by donors. But logic is on the side of the developing countries. No one doubts the importance of incentivising and directing private finance to support climate compatibility – the problem is counting it. The best estimates suggest that new and additional private finance for mitigation and adaptation is already up to four times higher than the $100bn 2020. This cannot be what the negotiators had in mind in Copenhagen. Some argue that we should count the private finance that public finance has “leveraged”, but this is proving chimerical. This issue is one that could undermine the trust of developing countries in the climate negotiations, and indeed in finance negotiations more broadly.
Two things are needed to avoid a climate finance car crash. First, governments need to address this issue as soon as possible. If it is discussed openly in the earlier part of this year, perhaps as part of the financing for development discussions just getting underway, we might be in a position to come up with positive solutions come the UN climate summit in Paris in December. If we leave it until then, however, the acrimony that might ensue has the potential to derail the talks. Second, the world should focus less on the overall amount of climate finance and more on what makes it special – quality not just quantity. Unlike aid, which is considered a charitable donation, climate finance emerges from a quasi-legal contract between countries (hard to hold to account, yes, but as binding as you can get at the UN) and that has implications for how it is spent. Instead of the high-handed donor management we are used to seeing in the aid world, climate finance should be governed by multilateral organisations that represent recipients as much as donors. That is why countries like India eschew the offer of aid (a gift, offered with heavy conditionality) but are willing to accept the idea of climate finance (a right, over which they have more control). The promise of “new and additional” climate finance at Copenhagen and Cancun was something of a sham. But it is not too late to make it right if we stop trying to chase the wild goose of additionality, and focus on making it a new way to do development finance.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/24/climate-finance-the-focus-must-be-on-quality-not-quantity,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/24/climate-finance-the-focus-must-be-on-quality-not-quantity
2015-02-24T07:00:00Z,global-development,Global development,Turkish outcry at murder of young woman has been a long time coming,"The outrage prompted by Özgecan Aslan’s murder gave way to a rare conversation about sexual violence and what it means to be a woman in Turkey. It has been a long time coming. Tragically, Aslan had been prepared for the horror she faced, carrying pepper spray. Perhaps that is why her death hit so close to home for so many women in Turkey, most of whom have harassment stories of their own. Thousands of women took to social media using the hashtag #sendeanlat (tell your story) to share their experiences. As editors of the online women’s magazine 5Harfliler, we know that first-hand accounts of sexual harassment are among the most shared topics on our website. From sexual harassment or violence on the street – or on a bus, at work or at home – to the feckless and hostile justice system faced by women who want to report crimes, women in Turkey increasingly feel the urge to speak up, be heard by each other, and say: “Something is very wrong”. In recent years, kadın cinayetleri, or killing of women, has been an everyday topic in the news. This is due to the efforts of feminist organisations who insist that women killed by their husbands, ex-husbands, boyfriends, brothers, fathers or neighbours are victims of systematic violence. Bianet, an independent news agency, has been monitoring incidents of male violence against women reported in Turkey’s national and local media since 2009. Women’s groups have organised demonstrations to push the government to establish an action plan against femicide. A digital monument keeps account of the women murdered since 2012. There is still no official record kept for kadın cinayetleri by the ministry of justice or the directory of security affairs, but most people in Turkey recognise that every day women are murdered by men.Yeşilçam, the Turkish film industry, which had its heyday from the 1950s to the 70s, helped to normalise violence against women. It perpetuated a deep-seated rape culture that television has done little to change since its emergence as a cultural force in the 1980s. In the past decade, there has been a proliferation of pop songs portraying violence as an innate part of romantic love, degrading women and caricaturising feminism. Media reports of violence are sensationalised, with detailed reports of rape accounts obtained from the police, photos of women curled up in shame, and commentary on what a victim wore, their alcohol intake, sexual activity or marital status. Aslan’s murder was different, however. She was not a victim of domestic violence, murdered as a “result” of a heated fight, or by a lover who “lost his temper” – all typical justifications used by the media. Aslan’s killer was a stranger who allegedly tried to rape her. That made it difficult to view her as anything other than innocent.
Mainstream media was quick to capitalise on the widespread anger at the murder, publishing countless stories. But there were no photo galleries of the victim and no sly suggestions as to why she might also have been at fault for what happened to her. More people than usual, both men and women, have been expressing their outrage at the way the media exploits crimes against women and feeds rape culture. Members of the public and government officials have called for the death penalty to be brought back. The justice system is inadequate and deeply flawed. For years, this has discouraged women from reporting crimes or standing up for their rights. However, in the past few years there have been more stories of women responding violently towards attacks by men. Last month, Istanbul Feminist Collective started keeping a record of the cases of women who injured or killed their attackers. Since Aslan’s death, an unprecedented number of women have advocated carrying knives to defend themselves. Most recently, a Kurdish group named Arin Mirxan Women’s Defence Task Force in Diyarbakir issued a warning against violent men and declared their right to violence as self-defence. Social media feeds have been filled with women’s stories of standing up to harassers and expressing a desire to be armed. But while there is more awareness of violence against women, state-sponsored conservatism is on the rise. In a speech last week, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan scolded feminists who disagreed with his statement that men have a religious obligation to act as custodians of women and must protect them. He did not appreciate the reminder that women are in no one’s custody and are entitled to personal safety and legal protection, just like any citizen of Turkey. An urgent change is required in the legal system, as well as in media coverage and the mindset of politicians and society at large. Women are well aware of this need, and what Aslan’s murder has demonstrated clearly is that they are no longer hesitant to express their views. Let’s hope it translates into positive action.

2015-02-23T17:54:44Z,global-development,Global development,Why are foodies turning their backs on Fairtrade?,"At Workshop Coffee in Clerkenwell, London, discerning customers savour the tangerine acidity of their £4 Colombian coffees. It looks like caffeine heaven, but head of production Richard Shannon says there are those who think something is missing. “Some people are adamant that if it doesn’t have a Fairtrade logo then we must be holding the farmer down and standing on his neck whilst we steal his coffee.” Workshop is one of a number of high-end food companies that says it is committed to fair trade, but doesn’t have the certificate to prove it. With the Fairtrade logo now appearing even on mainstream brands such as Starbucks coffees and four-finger Kit Kats, this absence is becoming more and more conspicuous, especially during Fairtrade fortnight, which starts this week. But for a variety of reasons, many speciality providers, which invariably boast about their impeccable sourcing policies, are choosing not to sign up to the Fairtrade labelling scheme.
This is bad news for Fairtrade, which saw UK sales of products carrying its logo fall for the first time ever last year, by 4%. This has largely been attributed to growing discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl carrying far fewer Fairtrade lines than declining supermarkets like Sainsbury’s and the Co-op. But it seems Fairtrade is being squeezed at the top as well as the bottom of the market, by high-end companies like Workshop who believe the Fairtrade model doesn’t suit them. The most common complaint is that Fairtrade doesn’t reward quality. “Fairtrade coffee is futures coffee,” Shannon explains. “The prices were arranged last year for the coffees that are being grown this year.” This is no good to speciality roasters, who need to see the quality of each crop before deciding how much, if any, to buy. But even if going Fairtrade meant no loss of quality, many suppliers believe their trade is already fairer than Fairtrade. Take the price paid. Last year, Workshop Coffee paid on average £6.50 per kilo, nearly twice as much as the Fairtrade price. (“For us the main thing is quality,” says Shannon, “and we’re prepared to pay for quality.”) Similarly, in Denmark, high-end chocolatier Mikkel Friis-Holm reports paying 10 to 20 times the Fairtrade price for cocoa. And, as they point out, Fairtrade doesn’t provide farmers with any greater guarantee of future income, since it sets a minimum price but not a minimum size of order. Growers for the speciality market, meanwhile, are increasingly able to call the shots. As the premium coffee market expands, says Shannon, producers get more power to choose who they sell to and for how much. “We’ve had coffees that we’d almost printed the bag labels for, and then all of a sudden we get told: sorry that coffee’s not going to you any more.” The growth of the market also creates opportunities for more producers to benefit. “Each year new farmers jump on board,” he says, as they see their neighbours being highly rewarded for focusing on quality. Many of the uncertified also believe there is more dignity for the farmers outside of the Fairtrade scheme. The renowned Breton chef Olivier Roellinger, whose restaurant Les Maisons de Bricourt earned three Michelin stars before he famously gave them back, sells his own range of fairly traded spices. But he doesn’t describe them as such “because I respect my producer. It’s a noble path to be a merchant, to have a good life and make a sustainable business.” Roellinger wants to treat his developing world suppliers like any other, paying a fair price when they have quality produce to sell and trusting them to manage the ups and downs of fat and lean years.
“When you get to the bottom of it, [the Fairtrade scheme] is kind of neo-imperialistic,” he says. “It’s something we impose on them.” He’s thinking particularly of the pressure for producers to form groups, usually co-operatives, in order to join. “Can you imagine what British farmers would say if their American customers came to them and said: well, I’m only going to trade with you guys if you get together and I can buy from all of you at the same time?” The uncertified also have doubts about the effectiveness of Fairtrade in securing a good deal for workers. The system can guarantee prices for producers and a premium for social projects, but it can’t ensure that those who receive these payments spread the benefits. Many Fairtrade co-operatives employ people who are not members, and research last year suggested that “wages are typically lower, and on the whole conditions worse, for workers in areas with Fairtrade organisations than for those in other areas”. One of the worst misuses of the Fairtrade dividend was in a tea co-operative, where “the modern toilets funded with the premium were exclusively for the use of senior co-op managers”. This is where many outside the certification system think they have the edge. By engaging in direct trade and visiting individual suppliers, they can have full confidence in those they buy from. Harriet Lamb, CEO of Fairtrade International, is sceptical. “In nearly 15 years, I have yet to meet a company who didn’t tell me that they were at least as good as Fairtrade, and usually better.” So while the organisation’s third-party audits “are absolutely not the only answer, the question remains: how else are you and I to know or judge what a company or a producer says?” As for the quality of Fairtrade produce, she insists: “There is no reason why companies cannot buy the best and highest qualities as Fairtrade. Indeed, there are lists and lists of Fairtrade certified producers who are award-winners. And if a company knows of a group producing at a particular high quality, they can always support them to become Fairtrade certified.” Yet rather than being threatened by the outsiders, Lamb is encouraged. It’s a good challenge to think how we can recognise those dedicated companies and continue to do what has always been at the heart of Fairtrade – make that direct link between producer and consumer that can drive wider change.” Fairtrade’s success might be one reason why many are now looking beyond its certificated products. As the ethical consumer market matures, Workshop’s more scrupulous customers are less likely to ask: “Is it Fairtrade?” and more likely to enquire “Is it fairly traded?” It’s a question we should all get into the habit of asking, knowing that pointing to the now familiar Fairtrade logo is only one way of answering “yes”.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/23/foodies-fairtrade-sales-quality-ingredients-terms,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/23/foodies-fairtrade-sales-quality-ingredients-terms
2015-02-23T09:00:00Z,global-development,Global development,Aid donors say Ebola-hit countries must direct effort to rebuild their economies,"Leaders of the three west African countries worst affected by Ebola will meet donors and partners in March to discuss how to regenerate their economies. The outbreak of the disease in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, combined with a fall in commodity prices, has interrupted a period of growth in economies worn down by decades of war and corroded by corruption. The countries will present recovery plans at a summit in Brussels, which will bring together representatives from the UN, the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and NGOs. Oxfam has already called for a multi-million-dollar Marshall plan to rebuild the economies of the three countries, a reference to the US aid programme introduced to speed Europe’s recovery after the second world war. To that end, the organisation wants an international pledging conference. Sierra Leone and Liberia were among the fastest growing economies in Africa before Ebola, with growth rates of 20% and about 8% respectively in 2013. Growth for 2013 in Guinea was approximately 2.5%. But these countries are also among the poorest in the world; their citizens have not shared in the wealth generated by abundant minerals during the noughties commodities boom. Apart from the human cost of Ebola – more than 9,100 deaths and nearly 23,000 cases, mostly in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea – the economic damage has been immense The World Bank estimates that nearly 180,000 people in Sierra Leone have lost their jobs. In Liberia, half of the heads of households are out of work as a result of the outbreak. Women were among the hardest hit in Liberia as they account for more workers in the non-agricultural self-employed sectors. One message coming from traditional donors is that the recovery must be owned and managed by the governments of the three countries. Donors can and should provide money but must not dictate the process. Nick Thompson, the chief executive of Tony Blair Africa Governance Initiative (AGI), said economic recovery plans must build government systems, stability and resilience. “Listening to the governments is a really good starting point … because there are choices in this as to what you choose to prioritise, be it health system strengthening or road-building. These have to be made in-country, otherwise you don’t get accountability,” Thompson said. Paul Valentin, international director for Christian Aid, said there was deep concern in Sierra Leone that the recovery process would be dictated from outside. “We need to work with local capacity, we need to empower the Sierra Leonean government to do the right thing, because if it is seen as an imposition from outside, the sustainability of whatever is put in place is going to be in jeopardy from day one,” he said. But there are fears that persistent corruption could derail any recovery. In her state of the nation address in January, Liberia’s President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf described corruption as a “vampire of development and the obstruction of progress” and asked lawmakers to fight “this devil that destroys our principles and our pride; that makes us slaves to vested interests”. There is evidence that the struggle against Ebola in Sierra Leone may have been hampered by misuse of government funds. A report by Sierra Leone’s auditor general, released on 13 February, found that the country failed to account fully for nearly a third of the $20m (£130m) it received to fight Ebola during a six-month period last year.
The report examined how 84bn leones (£12.5m), which came from tax revenues and donations from domestic institutions and individuals, was spent. It found that for more than 14bn leones of that sum there were no documents to show how the money was used. Another 11bn leones did not have adequate receipts or invoices. The auditor also found anomalies in procurement processes and in the payment of incentives to healthcare workers. Sierra Leone’s government promised a full investigation into the auditor’s findings, pledging that anyone who misused funds would be prosecuted. It has also had to pledge to remove thousands of “ghost workers” from its list of Ebola staff. Such stories will concern those who worry that any economic rescue plan risks pouring money into an opaque and porous system, with little accountability. In its corruption perceptions index, Transparency International rates Guinea 145th out of 175 countries. Liberia is in 94th place while Sierra Leone is at 119. However, Thompson said that the sense of pride Liberians took in how they handled Ebola – by changing behaviours and raising awareness – could promote a greater degree of official accountability. “It’s easy to look at the crisis … in a sort of traditional, paternalistic development mindset. I don’t think that’s the full story. It was the countries themselves, helping themselves. That means the sense of accountability has risen up and that creates a challenge for governments, but that’s good,” he said. Nonetheless, there is a clear need to develop local capacity so that governments can root out endemic corruption. “Alongside aid, you do need an investment in local leadership, the systems that sit underneath them, and the capability of the people that run them,” Thompson said. “I don’t think supporting governments’ priorities is a something-for-nothing agenda. The development partners can and should be clear what’s expected in regard to corruption but should get behind government priorities to support accountability and should get behind supporting government systems.” The IMF has already provided debt relief of about $100m to the three countries and new concessional loans amounting to roughly $160m, although some debt campaigners argue this will simply increase the debt burden for these countries. Britain has said CDC, the investment arm of its aid programme, and Standard Chartered will make up to $50m in short-term loans available to businesses in Sierra Leone. “Business and private enterprise are crucial to help Sierra Leone recover the rapid growth rates it was experiencing only a year ago,” said Justine Greening, the UK development secretary, in early February. Sierra Leone has reserves of iron ore, and these have helped to drive its double-digit growth rates of recent years. Liberia exports rubber and also has iron ore, coffee and cocoa, while Guinea has huge reserves of the aluminium ore bauxite and deposits of gold. However, prices for some of these commodities have fallen in recent months. In late January, Amadu Koroma, Sierra Leone’s deputy representative to the UN, told member states that Ebola had exerted a huge impact on mining, construction and trade, and that tourism dropped 30% in the first six months of the epidemic. “The sooner we end the stigmatisation of our countries, the better for us,” he said. Investors too have become wary. If they come back, campaigners say it cannot be business as usual. “There is going to be a huge call on ensuring that those who do business in Sierra Leone pay their fair share of taxes so that Sierra Leone stands a chance of rebuilding its systems,” said Valentin. “Given the natural riches of Sierra Leone, the minerals, the diamonds, that should be possible. That will require mining companies not to negotiate tax-exempt investment for 20 or 30 years. That will require them, from day one, to pay their fair share towards the Sierra Leone government, which will then have to be accountable for the money.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/23/ebola-aid-donors-economic-rebuilding-sierra-leone-liberia-guinea,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/23/ebola-aid-donors-economic-rebuilding-sierra-leone-liberia-guinea
2015-02-23T07:00:09Z,global-development,Global development,The voice of South Sudan's women must be heard to give peace a chance,"I recently travelled to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the summit of the African Union to talk about peace with South Sudanese women from both sides of the conflict. In the face of pain and mistrust, I witnessed the power of these women to heal and reconcile. I felt the air shift with the momentum of female peacemakers empowered to unite their country and end war. How remarkable that these women can embrace peace, while civil war engulfs their country and peace talks fail. A rush of familiarity energised me. It was more than 12 years ago that I came together with my sisters in Liberia to promote peace in our country. Weary of watching our leaders fail to negotiate an end to the civil war, we took peace into our own hands. We mobilised a sea of women clad in white, demanding reconciliation and an end to war. We put religion, ethnicity, and politics aside for peace. Our mass movement pushed warring factions in Liberia to sign a peace agreement in 2003.
In South Sudan, as in Liberia, women are bringing communities together. Women are using their experiences as survivors of conflict to support their neighbours and families. They are leading inter-community dialogues to promote healing and trust. Across the country, women are working at grassroots level, where the grievances of war are most raw, to turn the tide of suspicion and build trust and peace. The women of South Sudan need the support of their leaders and the international community to maintain this momentum. Since civil war erupted in December 2013, the situation for the people of South Sudan – particularly the women – continues to spiral out of control. More than 1.9 million people are displaced, and famine threatens those who have survived. After a visit to Bentiu, South Sudan,last year, Zainab Bangura, the UN special representative on sexual violence in conflict, said the nature of sexual violence in South Sudan is the worst she has seen in almost 30 years. Since its launch, the African Union-backed commission of inquiry investigating South Sudan has documented widespread human rights abuses – including rape. However, last month, human rights defenders around the world were appalled to learn that the African Union would not release the commission’s report, which was expected to provide damning evidence of these crimes. Courageous South Sudanese survivors, witnesses, and human rights defenders spoke to the commission of inquiry in the hope that the report would fracture the culture of impunity suffocating their country. Some argue the report may compromise fragile peace negotiations, but what of the consequences of shelving justice – emboldening future perpetrators with our unwillingness to tell the truth about what is happening in South Sudan? What of the consequences of silencing survivors who are bravely speaking out? The voices of South Sudanese women are also largely silenced at peace talks. Since negotiations began in January 2014, men from warring factions have dominated the peace table in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. They have failed to bring peace to their people. Government and rebel leaders repeatedly stall negotiations and, in turn, peace. With each new round of negotiations, women’s voices remain starkly under-represented at the table.
Women make a measurable difference in the quality of peace negotiations. When women are at the peace table, they talk about more than politics and power. Women raise key economic and social issues including education, health and justice. When women are present, peace agreements are 64% less likely to fail. Just last spring, women played a leading role in a peace agreement in the Philippines that ended a 45-year civil war. Imagine how the peace table would come together, and stay together, surrounded by South Sudan’s women. Imagine how the culture of impunity for serious crimes, including widespread sexual violence, would be shattered if our leaders had the courage to hold perpetrators accountable for their crimes and create much needed space for survivors’ voices in peace building efforts. We must insist that the voices of South Sudan’s women are given equal space at the peace table. We must ensure their perspectives promoting peace and reconciliation are incorporated into a legitimate, sustainable peace agreement. We must urge the African Union to stand for justice and accountability in South Sudan by immediately releasing the commission of inquiry’s report. More than a year after conflict broke out in South Sudan, the country is still at risk of famine and renewed war. Let us make 2015 the year South Sudanese and international leaders welcomed women to peace negotiations and declined to silence their calls for justice; the year a lasting peace was established in our world’s newest country.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/23/south-sudan-women-peace-talks-leymah-gbowee,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/23/south-sudan-women-peace-talks-leymah-gbowee
2015-02-23T00:01:00Z,global-development,Global development,Fairtrade sales fall for first time in foundation's 20-year existence,"Sales of Fairtrade goods have fallen for the first time since the ethical trading scheme was founded 20 years ago as cash-strapped consumers tighten their belts. The slide of almost 4%, after years of double-digit growth, reflects wider troubles in the grocery market as shoppers put less in their baskets and turn to cheaper chains such as Aldi and Lidl in a bid to save money. While the discount supermarket chains do stock some Fairtrade goods, these make up a much smaller proportion of their sales than in some of the more mainstream supermarkets. The retail sales value of products overseen by Fairtrade, which aims to protect farmers in developing countries by promising them a minimum price and a premium to invest in community projects, fell by 3.7% last year to £1.67bn. Michael Gidney, chief executive of the Fairtrade foundation, said: “Our main concern now is that increasingly aggressive competitive behaviour in the grocery sector could undermine the volumes farmers and workers are able to sell on Fairtrade terms. This will result in real losses to hardworking families and communities in some of the poorest countries in the world.” Aldi and Lidl now control more than 10% of the grocery market, according to data from Nielsen, as they continue to enjoy double-digit sales growth while their bigger supermarket rivals shrink. Analysts said Fairtrade was likely to have been hit as overall sales have fallen at Sainsbury’s and The Co-op. Both are important outlets for the ethical brand having recently switched their own-label bananas, coffee, tea and chocolate to Fairtrade products. Marks & Spencer, one of the major backers of Fairtrade cotton when it was first launched, has also cut back its use in favour of less expensive, easier-to-manage ethical systems such as the Better Cotton Initiative. Fairtrade tea and sugar sales have also been affected by a drop in all sales of both British staples. Sales of sugar fell by 5% and cotton by 38% while the amount of Fairtrade tea and cocoa, both major products for the ethical brand, fell by 1% and 2% respectively. As the price of ordinary sugar has been falling dramatically, the Fairtrade alternative looks much more expensive in comparison. Bryan Roberts, of the retail analysis firm Kantar Retail, said: “Some of this is a story about certain food categories. Sales of tea are in decline and there are a lot of anti-sugar messages out there. People are replacing it with alternatives like Stevia. Fairtrade is also a bit of a luxury for people and they are feeling hesitant about buying into that at the moment.” He suggested that drops in the prices of food commodities meant that Fairtrade had become relatively more expensive as it protected the price paid to farmers. Many retailers choose not to pass those higher costs on to shoppers – but that makes their Fairtrade goods less profitable and so they are less inclined to give them prominence in stores. Fairtrade is also facing rising competition from rival ethical labelling systems, such as the Rainforest Alliance. The foundation – which begins its annual fortnight of promotional events on Monday – is responding with new partnerships which change the way it works with brands and retailers. Last week it announced a partnership in which only the cocoa in British and Irish Mars bars will be certified by Fairtade. In the past every aspect of a chocolate bar, such as sugar or vanilla, would have to be Fairtrade in order to work with the foundation. In another bid to extend its influence, Fairtrade is also working with Waitrose to oversee the supermarket’s own ethical trading scheme. It will also ramp up campaigning action. Sales of Fairtrade bananas and coffee both rose last year as the foundation launched major campaigns in their support.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/23/fairtrade-sales-fall-first-time-20-year-existence,https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/feb/23/fairtrade-sales-fall-first-time-20-year-existence
2015-02-21T20:51:31Z,global-development,Global development,"Children in war zones being failed by Britain, say MPs in scathing report","The UK is failing to meet its “moral and political obligations” to tens of millions of children caught up in conflict zones and has not developed even a basic strategy to help youngsters affected by war, a parliamentary report reveals. So lamentable is the government’s approach to the issue that MPs and peers warn that Britain’s international standing with regard to humanitarian work is at stake. The scathing report, to be published on Monday by the all-party parliamentary group on protecting children in armed conflict, concludes that an urgent review of the government’s response to children affected by armed conflict is required to amend its “one-size-fits-all approach to aid and development.” It also found that the Department for International Development (DfID) does not place a specific priority on children’s welfare and that it “lacks a tangible, or indeed any kind of, strategy” when it comes to a child protection policy within its humanitarian operations. About 230 million children live in countries affected by armed conflicts, with 20 million children – approximately four times the population of Scotland – displaced because of ongoing disputes. In the last decade, according to the report, more than two million children have died as a result of conflict and three times that number have been permanently disabled or seriously injured. “In the past two decades, an estimated 90% of those killed in conflicts around the world have been civilians, and 80% of those have been women and children,” says the report. Parliamentarians, along with humanitarian campaigners, are also concerned that there is not a single dedicated government official with the expertise and the mandate to drive the UK’s response to children affected by conflicts. In addition, the report says that not one of the team of experts established through the high-profile Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative led by the Foreign Office have received pre-deployment training in the area of child protection. The initiative was unveiled to great fanfare by former foreign secretary William Hague and film star Angelina Jolie last May and earlier this month a centre to support the scheme was opened in London. The report also notes that these failings have occurred despite the UK’s focus on conflict, and its status as one of the world’s largest humanitarian contributors and a permanent member of the UN security council. “To remain a sector leader in humanitarian aid and development, it is imperative that the UK government respond to the one of the greatest and most neglected needs of our time,” the report concludes. It adds: “The cost of inaction by the UK government in regards to children affected by conflict is high, both morally and financially.” The report also calls for the introduction of a specific budget to the problem and for a minister within DfID to be handed responsibility for the issue of children affected by armed conflict. Rob Williams, chief executive of the charity War Child – which helped prepare the report – said it was quite shocking that no one on DfID’s humanitarian team was a child protection specialist. “The more we see that modern civil conflicts produce huge numbers of children who are displaced, and situations that don’t get resolved for years, the more important it becomes that, as well as doing food and water, you actually make sure you’re protecting these kids from the vulnerabilities around them – like increased rates of rape, and recruitment into the armed conflict.” Williams added: “There is not sufficient funding going to child protection and child education: they [the government] don’t have the skills in child protection and they don’t have a minister whose job it is to think about these issues”, despite the fact that half of all people affected by conflict are children. “By not spending money on child protection and education they undermine everything else they do.”
The charity points to the Central African Republic, where DfID is about to reduce UK humanitarian aid by more than 50% in comparison to the commitment that it made in November 2014, despite the fact that needs have risen sharply. Last year in the Central African Republic more than 430 children were killed or maimed – three times as many as in 2013. The situation there has deteriorated to the point where the United Nations has declared a Level 3 crisis, its highest level of emergency. The three other countries at Level 3 status are Syria, South Sudan and Iraq. The MPs says that the violence in all four countries – as well as the aftermath of last year’s war in Gaza – highlights the need for DfID to re-evaluate its approach to children in conflict. It adds that around 28 million children are not receiving an education due to armed conflict, and predicts a shortfall of 3.3 million primary school teachers and 5.1 million lower secondary school teachers by 2030. Mary Creagh, Labour’s shadow development secretary, said the report was further proof of the government’s failure to address the humanitarian and development consequences of conflict. “This report focuses on children affected by conflict, and criticises deficiencies in planning, short-term funding cycles and a media- and target-driven culture which means the UK responds too slowly,” she said. “A Labour government would seek to protect children by ensuring education provision and tackling sexual violence in fragile and conflict-affected states.” A government spokesman said: “We prioritise children in conflict zones precisely because they are among the most vulnerable.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/21/children-war-zones-failed-britain-report,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/21/children-war-zones-failed-britain-report

2015-02-20T15:47:24Z,global-development,Global development,Fairtrade Foundation signs deal with Waitrose,"The Fairtrade Foundation has signed a deal with Waitrose under which it will endorse and advise on the supermarket’s own ethical food sourcing programme. The partnership is a potentially risky new step for the foundation which until now has only allowed its label to be used on goods certified under its own rigorous processes governing ethical standards. Producers allowed to use the label guarantee to pay farmers a minimum price and a premium for local community projects such as building schools or installing wells. The partnership with the supermarket will start with producers in Ghana, Kenya and South Africa. The Waitrose Foundation, a charitable arm of the supermarket, already puts a share of profits towards educational, social and healthcare projects called for by communities in those countries where it sources fruit and flowers. Unlike Fairtrade, however, it does not guarantee a minimum price. Fairtrade will help design and evaluate projects under the Waitrose Foundation scheme and its involvement will be flagged beside relevant items in stores – but in a different way to fully certified Fairtrade goods. Michael Gidney, chief executive of the Fairtrade Foundation, said: “The objective of the new partnership is to work together to increase the social and economic impact of our respective supply networks, recognising the vital role that business now plays within the international development agenda.” The scheme is likely to be controversial, as it risks associating the Fairtrade mark, which is highly trusted by shoppers, with goods that are not independently assessed for ethical standards and do not come with a guaranteed price for producers. Fred Burt, at the Interbrand consultancy, said the move was a “smart and natural extension” for Fairtrade but it was important that it clearly differentiated products within the Waitrose Foundation scheme from fully certified Fairtrade goods. “If Fairtrade can have the same impact on company behaviour as they have had on consumer ethics then that has to be a good thing. However this comes with risk. The Fairtrade Foundation relinquish some of the control that made them successful in the first place, because they will not have direct control on the individual product-related decisions that their endorsed partners will be making,” he said. Cheryl McGechie, public engagement director of Fairtrade, said: “It will be a communications challenge for us to make sure that we don’t confuse consumers.” But Fairtrade is hoping the tie-in with Waitrose will be a model for a new way of bringing its ethical principles to bear on a wider range of products that do not easily fit its current system. McGechie said Fairtrade wanted to work with other retailers on similar partnerships but would only do so on projects that protected Fairtrade’s core values: giving farmers a say in how community projects were developed and increasing their cut of the price paid by consumers for their goods. “We want to extend the influence of Fairtrade. It has been around for 20 years and made huge ground in influencing sales of chocolate, bananas and coffee but it is still a minority of trade,” she said. “There are so many other supply chains that have little trade with Fairtrade and it would be a lost opportunity not to find other business models that enable us to change that.” Mark Price, managing director of Waitrose, said: “By combining Fairtrade’s expertise in this area with our retail operation, we believe we will be able to deliver greater benefits to the producers and suppliers with whom we both work and together demonstrate the future of fair trading.” The deal with Waitrose comes after Fairtrade launched another new type of partnership with Mars this week. From the autumn, all the cocoa for British and Irish Mars Bars will be sourced from Fairtrade farmers. Until now, the Fairtrade mark could only be used on chocolate bars which source all possible ingredients, such as sugar, vanilla and cocoa, from farms certified under the ethical scheme. The Mars Bars will be part of Fairtrade’s new Cocoa Sourcing Programme which will have its own separate label.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/20/fairtrade-foundation-waitrose-supermarket-ethical-food,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/20/fairtrade-foundation-waitrose-supermarket-ethical-food
2015-02-20T12:52:23Z,global-development,Global development,Trials using Ebola survivors' blood for treatment to start in Sierra Leone,"Clinical trials using the blood of Ebola survivors in treatment are to be extended to Sierra Leone. Discussions have been held about transferring blood plasma already banked in the Liberian capital Monrovia to Sierra Leone, where between 60 and 80 people a week are being infected. Technicians at Sierra Leone’s National Safe Blood Transfusion Service were trained in Liberia on the apheresis plasma extraction machines at the end of January. Two new apheresis machines are being shipped to the national blood bank in Sierra Leone for the study, said Simona Zipursky, a World Health Organisation (WHO) representative in Freetown. “My principal concern is we have a short window. The longer we wait the harder it will be to get cases,” she added. The first clinical trial using the blood plasma of survivors for convalescent serum therapy (CST) – in which antibodies from people who have recovered from Ebola are used to help others fight the disease – started in Liberia in December. A second trial started last week in Guinea in a facility run by Médecins Sans Frontières. ClinicalRM, the US medical research organisation running the trial, had hoped to treat 70 patients in a controlled trial in Monrovia. However, with fewer than five cases a week, this will be difficult to achieve as some patients are ineligible or refuse blood donation. Professor Sahr Gevao, a haematologist in Sierra Leone who will be the lead clinician, said he hoped to get the trials underway by the end of February. The trial comes three months after a group of Sierra Leonean medics tried to initiate CST trials after receiving a donation of nine apheresis machines from Fresenius Kabi, a US firm. “Unfortunately, due to various circumstances beyond our control, that vision was not realised,” said the Sierra Leone Action Group. It said it would consider working with others in the field “once a transparent cooperative framework is established by the relevant government agencies”.
While efforts to start a blood plasma trial continued, Sierra Leone, with the backing of the WHO, started a simpler “whole blood” trial on patients in the 34 Military hospital in Freetown run by Colonel Dr Foday Sahr. To date, more than 60 survivors have donated blood and about 40 patients have received transfusions. Anecdotal evidence suggests success. For Gevao it is critical to establish once and for all whether the blood plasma of survivors can save lives. “We have to design the trial very carefully so we can answer the question, does it work?” he said. “That is what matters.” The trial in Liberia is being funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and partners including Safe Blood for Africa and Blood Centers of America. During the 1995 Ebola outbreak in Kikwit in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, blood collected from recovered patients was administered to eight infected people, of whom seven recovered. However, because the study there did not include a control group, no firm conclusions could be reached. In America and Europe, the blood of survivors, including that of the British nurse William Pooley, was banked as long ago as September. Questions have been asked as to why the trials have not happened sooner in Sierra Leone, with some blaming lack of training or machines and others pointing to the timescale in getting complex clinical trials approved. William Fischer, assistant professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina and one of the lead clinicians in the Liberia trial, said the scale of the humanitarian emergency meant, initially, that saving lives took precedence over research. One of the first specialists sent by the WHO to Guéckédou in Guinea, where the outbreak started, he has been to all three countries. “If you asked me what I cared about in the initial outbreak, care or research, I’d say care because it was more important to end the epidemic than to set up a clinical trial,” he said. Even if research was an imperative, the manpower was not there, Fischer added. “The filovirus community is a very small community, there aren’t many of us. The people who do research are also the people who are doing the caring.” Fischer said the health professionals who have donned their Ebola suits day after day, month after month, have been wonderful and should be the focus of efforts to protect their countries against further outbreaks. “If we, in America or Europe, had 20,000 cases, we too would be overwhelmed and clinical care would be the primary focus,” he said. “It is time to become proactive, rather than reactive.” “I don’t believe it was random that this outbreak happened,” he continued, pointing out that there have been Ebola outbreaks since 1976 and all have been contained except this one. That, he is convinced, is because decent, basic general healthcare is not available in the region. This article was amended on 23 February 2015 to change the name of the US firm mentioned in the ninth paragraph. We had originally referred to Fresenius. This has now been changed.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/20/ebola-survivors-blood-plasma-antibodies-trial-sierra-leone,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/20/ebola-survivors-blood-plasma-antibodies-trial-sierra-leone
2015-02-20T07:00:04Z,global-development,Global development,Somalis face stark choice after US banks shut down cash transfer operators,"The decision by the California-based Merchants Bank to close the accounts of Somali money transfer operators is likely to force many law-abiding Somalis living in the US to choose between three uncomfortable options. They can stop sending money to their relatives living in the Horn of Africa. They can try to find alternative legal channels, but as a result are likely to be charged much higher transfer rates, reducing the amount of money their relatives receive. Or they can use unregulated and illegal ways to send money. Given that the money remitted to Somalia and other parts of the Horn of Africa is used for basic expenses – food, healthcare, education and emergencies – senders are unlikely to stop trying to send remittances to their relatives. The money is needed, and the idea of leaving loved ones without access to these essential resources is unthinkable. Dire predictions of “piles of bodies” resulting from the account closures are unlikely to materialise. Some may find alternative, if more expensive, means of sending money legally, for instance through Western Union. But this will not be an option for people sending money to smaller towns and rural areas in Somalia and other parts of the Horn, where Western Union and smaller companies that still send remittances do not have a presence. Instead, it is reasonable to expect that a large proportion of the $200m that Oxfam estimates is sent from the US to Somalia each year will be forced underground. People will send money the way they did before Somali money transfer companies were formed: in cash, stashed in bags and pockets, or in other ways that will be impossible to track. This presents a problem for Somalis who have no desire to flout the law, but want to ensure that their relatives are able to get by. As the amounts sent through informal means grow, the issue is likely to bring wider problems, creating opportunities for terrorism financiers, money launderers, drug traffickers and others interested in unregulated channels to move money without being detected. The situation is ironic, given that banks on both sides of the Atlantic have justified closing the accounts of money transfer operators on the basis that they fear people using them will engage in illegal activities. So far there is scant evidence to suggest that the accounts have been used in this way; the few convictions that have involved funds going to Somalia’s al-Shabaab terrorist group have come to light precisely because of the “know your customer” information collected by cash transfer operators. Now this method of information gathering will be closed down along with the accounts. Earlier this month, the Redsea Cultural Foundation in Hargeisa, Somaliland, hosted politicians, non-governmental organisations, money transfer operators and representatives from local universities for a discussion about the likely impact of the account closures on recipient families and communities. The mood among the assembly was sombre, but few expected that the main impact of the closures – which come a year after similar steps were taken in the UK – would be a humanitarian crisis. People will find a way to send money to their relatives, they said. But they will be unnecessarily criminalised for doing so. The minister of national planning and coordination, Saad Ali Shire, said that an important issue overlooked in the discussion of impacts was the right of the sender. “People have a right of access to financial institutions,” he argued, adding that blocking this access was questionable on legal grounds and should be challenged. Those present also expressed concern that, irrespective of the immediate crisis, the volume of remittances to Somali families is likely to diminish in the longer term as diaspora members’ direct ties to family members in Somalia become more tenuous. Research on global diasporas suggests that second-generation migrants are often less likely to send remittances to individual family members who they do not know as well as their parents do. They may be willing to make contributions to community or national development efforts instead. Ultimately, the attendees agreed that there is a need for investment to take the place of remittances, but that this will take time and remittances are needed in the interim. What struck me most about the discussion in Hargeisa was the willingness of those gathered to see themselves as part of a potential solution to the remittance crisis. Responsibility for increasing the trust of banks, preventing the flow of funding for terrorism (which, one man noted, Somalis would suffer from more than anyone else), and reducing reliance on remittances, they said, must be shared by Somali governments and lawmakers, the nascent national bank system, money transfer operators, the private sector and remittance recipients. In a report released this week, Oxfam, African Development Solutions and the Global Center on Cooperative Security are calling for political intervention in countries where cash transfer accounts are being closed (the UK, US, and Australia). The organisations want national governments to providing assurances to banks that will encourage them to restore their links to Somali money transfer operators. This is essential. At the same time, these governments should engage more with Somali partners to help minimise the risk of remittances being forced into illegal networks and people being criminalised for nothing more than helping their families at home.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/20/somalia-remittance-money-transfer-operators-american-banking-regulations-terrorism,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/20/somalia-remittance-money-transfer-operators-american-banking-regulations-terrorism

2015-02-19T12:00:06Z,global-development,Global development,The fertile roots of Rwanda's green revolution | Agnes Kalibata and Amit Roy,"Less than a decade ago, most Rwandans experienced hunger three months of the year. Now, most of the country is food secure, in part because farmers can access yield-enhancing fertilisers and profitable markets to sell their produce.
In 2006, Rwandan farmers did not have the tools needed to boost food production. As a small landlocked country in central Africa, most fertiliser companies would not even consider exporting their product to the nation beyond a small quantity for tea and coffee estates. While more than 80% of Rwandans were farmers, only a small fraction were able to access fertilisers. Recognising the need to produce more food, we worked across time zones on a strategy enticing the private sector to bring fertilisers and seeds into the country. The centrepiece became the Rwandan government’s flagship crop intensification programme – reducing seed and fertiliser costs for farmers and increasing access to productivity-enriching supplies. These interventions helped shelter Rwanda from the effects of the 2008 world food crisis by keeping food prices and availability stable.
We travelled across the outskirts of Kigali after the first year of the programme and saw first-hand how local farmers doubled the amount of food produced. Many even tripled their yields. The farmers said their neighbourhood shops were now stocked with fertiliser and improved seeds. This policy environment became the driving force behind a new era of agriculture for Rwanda. According to 2012 government statistics (pdf), fertiliser use more than doubled, from 18% in 2005-06 to 38% in 2010-11. Farmers now had excess produce to sell. “In 2005-06, households sold around 18% of their agricultural output on average; by 2010-11 the average proportion of output sold had risen to 25%,” said the survey. And perhaps more staggering, per capita GDP grew by 62% from $333 to $540. In some countries, such increases do not always benefit poor people. Yet in Rwanda, the poverty rate decreased from 57% to 45%. The nation’s per capita GDP now stands at $730. According to the World Bank, 45% of poverty reduction can be attributed directly to agriculture. Today, Rwandans are focusing not only on growing more food, but more nutritious food. As a result of a partnership between HarvestPlus and the government, a third of the nation’s households are producing healthier crops using improved bean seeds fortified with micronutrients. But improved seeds are not enough. Fertilisers containing micronutrients are also necessary. Recent field trials show that productivity increases by 40% when fertiliser nutrients match soil characteristics. In Rwanda, micronutrient trials are doubling maize yields and sky-rocketing potato production.
Rwanda’s agricultural revolution can serve as a model for other nations to unlock policy and market constraints. Fertiliser initiatives that open markets, strengthen nutrition and spur partnerships will empower farmers towards improved livelihoods. The first steps to building farmers’ access to fertiliser and other technologies are an enabling policy environment and strong leadership. Rwanda’s significant strides in economic growth would not have been possible without the revitalised input markets brought about by the 2006 Africa fertiliser summit and resulting Abuja declaration on fertiliser for an African green revolution. This momentum began when African heads of states endorsed the 2003 Maputo declaration on agriculture and food security (pdf). The Abuja declaration declared fertiliser “a strategic commodity without borders” and listed concrete actions to improve its access for smallholders. The Maputo declaration committed governments to spend at least 10% of their budget on agriculture, allowing new policies to be financed. Today, both declarations are the markers that African Union member countries use to measure progress towards food security.
For these policies to have ground-level impact, farmers must access timely market opportunities to prevent post-harvest losses. Public-private partnerships are generating greater market participation and boosting agribusiness. The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa and its partners, including the International Fertiliser Development Centre, are investing in better links among governments, the private sector and smallholder organisations, and encouraging governments to develop private-sector friendly policies. The African Green Revolution Forum brings all players together to address industry opportunities and challenges. In his Nobel lecture the late Norman Borlaug said fertilisers fuelled the green revolution in Asia of the 1960s. As the world population increases to a predicted 9.6 billion (pdf) in the next 35 years, farmers must grow 60% (pdf) more food on the same amount of land, with food demand increasing by 178% in sub-Saharan Africa. Rwandan farmers have demonstrated that dramatic yield increases are possible, and there has been similar growth in several sub-Saharan countries. There is no doubt that effective fertiliser policies, innovative technologies and market-building partnerships can power a green revolution in Africa. The question is no longer how but when. And it will take all of us working together to make it happen. • Dr Agnes Kalibata served as Rwanda’s minister of agriculture and animal resources from 2008-14.

2015-02-19T11:00:11Z,global-development,Global development,Kenya's small-scale farmers borrow seeds to grow potential | Mark Anderson,"Dozens of schoolchildren sprint through the lush hills of Webuye, a small farming town in western Kenya, scurrying home for lunch past a sign adorned with children’s drawings that reads “Discipline precedes excellence”.
“I want my kids to be educated. My daughter dreams of being a surgeon; I want her to get her degree so she can realise her dream,” says Alice Nekoye Waneloba, 49, taking a break from slashing weeds in the midday sun to prepare a meal in her living room, where she is surrounded by photographs of her 10 children. Sending children to university is a top priority for millions of Kenya’s subsistence farmers, but for decades they have been held back by slow economic development, which experts attribute to poor farming techniques, a lack of fertiliser and low-quality seeds. Apart from running a handful of temporary programmes, such as providing mosquito nets and fertiliser subsidies, the Kenyan government has not prioritised policies aimed at spurring rural development.
“I don’t feel the government has helped me. I want them to provide electricity and water to this area, but they have not done that,” says Elam Kangaya, a 43-year-old father of five. His feelings are echoed by Jarius Wekesa, 42, who lives in neighbouring Miendo. “The government has not helped me. They should provide loans so I can buy more land - that would increase my profits,” he says. “I want my kids to take up any career they want. If they want to be doctors, traders, police officers, they can choose whichever career they want.” In Miendo, a group of women gathered beneath a mango tree are discussing their loan repayments with a representative from One Acre Fund (OAF), a Kenya-based NGO partly funded by the Gates Foundation that provides fertiliser, seeds and solar lights to about 200,000 farmers in Burundi, Kenya, Tanzaniaand Rwanda. The organisation, which also has trials in Ethiopia and Malawi, employs 823 local staff in Kenya who check in with farmers every week and collect loan repayments. Those enrolled in OAF are split into groups of about a dozen; when one farmer cannot repay a loan, others in the group have to pick up the slack or face being cut off. The meeting’s host, Topista Musombi, 40, says she borrowed 4,100 shillings (£30) from the organisation, which she used to buy fertiliser and an oil barrel of seeds. This has helped boost her farm’s output from about 270kg of maize last year to 810kg in this year’s harvest, she says. Musombi also bought solar lights, which reduced her electricity bill and came in useful during the sporadic power outages.
“We have found that lending to farmers is most effective when we lend seed and fertiliser instead of cash. Providing assets to farmers ensures that the loan is utilised for the intended purpose, and overcomes the challenge of limited access to seed and fertiliser close to the homes of our clients,” says Stephanie Hanson, OAF’s senior vice-president of policy and partnerships. The organisation aims to serve 1 million farmers by 2020, which would more than triple its current customer base. “It’s absurdly simple to improve agricultural productivity,” says Andrew Youn, OAF’s co-founder, explaining that offering loans in conjunction with seeds and fertiliser has allowed many farmers enrolled in the programme to produce more food. One key factor behind sub-Saharan Africa’s poor agricultural output is a lack of fertiliser. African farmers apply merely 13kg of fertiliser per arable hectare, which Youn says is “insane”. Asian farmers use an average of 312kg of fertiliser per hectare and Europeans 148kg.
Sarah Wafula, 42, says that before she joined OAF, she harvested 400kg of maize from her half acre of land. Now, with new farming techniques and the right seeds, she has doubled her output to 800kg, she says. By 2050, the world’s population is projected to reach 9.1 billion. Feeding this many people would mean increasing food production by 70% from 2007 levels, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). “Production in developing countries would need to almost double,” according to the FAO. While boosting the agricultural output of small-scale farmers could be a crucial tool in solving the impending food crisis, creating new sources of wealth is also a top priority, says Jakob Skoet, an economist at the FAO’s Agricultural Development Economics division. “Income generation is just as important as the food supply – I think that’s very important to bring out in the overall discussion of the future of food security,” he says. “These farmers can increase their income and they can increase their food production through farming, however it is just as important to ensure that they have other opportunities for income generation, so that they can afford to purchase food.”
As well as providing seeds and fertiliser, OAF sells solar lights to farmers, reducing their dependence on Kenya’s sporadic power services, and livestock, which can help farmers afford large one-off purchases like medical treatment. The group is considering offering loans for school fees. “We see ourselves as a sort of Amazon.com for farmers. We’re looking for any set of impact-producing products that we can provide,” says Kiette Tucker, the deputy director of OAF Kenya. As Kangaya poses for photos with his motorcycle, which he purchased with new farming revenues, he says: “If my children are educated, they will be the ones to bring electricity here.” This article has been amended to clarify the countries in which One Acre Fund works, make clear that the organisation is based in Kenya rather than the US, and correct the number of farmers served by the fund from 300,000 to 200,000, and the quantity of maize harvested by Sarah Wafula.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/19/kenya-farmers-seeds-finance-fertiliser-food-income-mdgs,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/19/kenya-farmers-seeds-finance-fertiliser-food-income-mdgs
2015-02-19T10:00:09Z,global-development,Global development,Battle to feed the world pits small farmers against big agriculture | Mark Anderson,"Dotted along the narrow path that skirts the edge of Beatrice Alvitsa’s house in Shimanyiro, a green Kenyan valley near the border with Uganda, are dozens of millet plants, each protected by a carefully assembled fence made of sticks. “These keep the chickens and other animals out,” she says, bending down to mend a break in one of the fences.
Having received training in farming techniques and secured regular access to quality seeds and fertiliser, Alvitsa now produces enough food on her acre and a half of land to feed her family. She pays school fees for her seven children by selling surplus food and saves money in a mobile bank account. As the world prepares to transition from the millennium development goals (MDGs) to the sustainable development goals – which aim to end poverty and hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable development – some experts say farmers like Alvitsa exemplify the path to meeting these targets.
Smallholder farmers provide up to 80% of Asia and sub-Saharan Africa’s food, where the vast majority of the world’s poor people live, according to the International Fund for Agricultural Development (pdf). The most recent hunger statistics (pdf) suggest that 14% of the world do not have sufficient access to food, making it unlikely that the MDG to bring hunger rates down to 12.5% by the end of this year will be met. In its 2014 progress report, the UN said immediate action was needed to reduce hunger, lamenting that progress had slowed since 2005. At a time when the world’s population is soaring – the UN has projected it could reach 9.6 billion by 2050 – a debate has emerged about how best to support farmers between advocates of large-scale agricultural projects and those who prefer more targeted, small-scale efforts. Global food production must double by 2050 to feed the world, the World Food Programme says. “The most important way to create long-term food security is to recognise and include food sovereignty in national, regional and international policies that influence food systems,” says Nyoni Ndabezinhle, press officer at Via Campesina, an advocacy group for small-scale farmers. “We need our national governments to carry out comprehensive agrarian reforms, giving land to the peasants.” In order to thrive, farmers in the developing world need access to seed, fertiliser, microcredit and microinsurance, as well as rights to land and union representation, according to Sir Gordon Conway, director of Agriculture for Impact. “You need links to markets through warehousing in particular. You need fair, efficient and transparent markets and you need value chains where entrepreneurs can become engaged, and you need links into local and regional markets in Africa and international markets; you need the right kind of investment.” Others say commercial agricultural schemes like the G8’s New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition initiative will complement gains made on local levels, linking smallholders with international markets. The New Alliance says it will lift 50 million people out of poverty by 2022. The African Development Bank (AfDB), which contributes funding to the New Alliance, says large-scale agricultural investment will help to scale up development gains made over the past 25 years. “Foreign private investment in Africa’s agricultural sector has significant potential to complement public resources,” says Chiji Ojukwu, director of the AfDB’s agriculture and agro-industry department. “Large-scale investment in African agriculture and agribusiness, whether foreign, domestic, private, government-backed, or a combination of these, could pay a vital role in providing urgently needed financing, technology and markets, thereby assisting to ensure food security, contributing to poverty reduction and propelling agriculture-driven growth, with significant implications for achieving more inclusive growth.” New Alliance projects, which require governments to change laws and policies to favour businesses, have been rolled out in 10 sub-Saharan countries. Critics have expressed alarm at the lack of effective monitoring and accountability mechanisms, and have condemned the scheme as a new wave of colonialism.
Nearly 35m hectares (82m acres) of land in 66 countries has been leased by foreign investors to produce food crops since 2006, according to Grain, an environmental watchdog. Large-scale agricultural production will benefit private-sector firms rather than poor people, Grain says, noting that financial companies and sovereign wealth funds are responsible for about a third of the deals. The World Bank estimates that as much as 200m hectares of land in the developing world has been leased to agricultural investors over the past 10 years. “Large-scale commercial agriculture can indeed play a significant role in feeding the world’s poorest, but food availability alone will not translate to reduced poverty, hunger and undernutrition,” says Shenggen Fan, director general of the International Food Policy Research Institute. Food security is not simply about producing enough to feed every person, says Jomo Kwame Sundaram, assistant director general of the Food and Agriculture Organisation’s department of economic and social development. Ensuring adequate supply comes down to four key factors: food availability, access, stability and utilisation, he says. “The question of access is probably the most fundamental of the four dimensions of food security. We talk about the availability of food, the stability of food supplies and then access.”
The developing world is home to more than 900 million obese adults, nearly 30% more than the 557 million chronically overweight adults in wealthy countries, according to the Overseas Development Institute. Writing in the Guardian, Hilal Elver, the UN’s special rapporteur on the right to food, says: “Transnational corporations can be part of the problem, tending to undermine the livelihood of locals, displacing them from their home and land, interfering with their access to natural resources, and causing environmental destruction.” “The task is huge, but the tools are there. The challenge is mainly a matter of fashioning political will strong enough to overcome entrenched interests in maintaining food insecurity.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/19/feed-the-world-small-farmers-big-agriculture-mdgs,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/19/feed-the-world-small-farmers-big-agriculture-mdgs
2015-02-19T09:00:08Z,global-development,Global development,Why are there still so many hungry people in the world? | Hilal Elver,"The greatest challenge for the sustainable development goals (SDGs) is to eradicate poverty and hunger while maintaining sustainable food security for all in a crowded and dramatically unequal world. Although the world has succeeded in reducing poverty in accordance with the millennium development goal (MDG) targets, food security and adequate nutrition have not been achieved.The MDGs failed to treat food as a human right. Experience shows us that neither markets nor governments protect access to sufficient and nutritious food for everyone. Only accountability by those who produce food and regulate society can hope to achieve this protection, and this means that access to food needs to be treated as a human right, and not just as a policy goal or an outcome of a productive economy. Several constitutions and courts in Latin America have recently moved in this direction by making the right to food a legally enforceable right, but the international system, including the UN, still lags behind. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), almost 1 billion people suffer from chronic hunger and almost 2 billion are under- or overnourished.
Children are the most visible victims of nutritional deficiencies. Approximately 5 million children die each year because of poor nutrition. Access to adequate food during the first 1,000 days of life is vitally important for healthy future generations. Even a temporary lack of food during that crucial time has a negative effect on physical and intellectual development. I was shocked when told that in Haiti, even before the devastating earthquake that ruined the country, that small mud balls were being sold in the market to ease children’s hunger pangs. Of the world’s hungry people, 98% live in developing countries. The root causes of food insecurity and malnutrition are poverty and inequity rather than shortages. FAO statistics confirm that the world produces enough food to feed the 7 billion people living today, and even the estimated 9-10 billion population in 2050. Global agriculture produces 17% more calories per person today than 30 years ago, despite a 70% increase in population. Despite this, for the 2 billion people making less than $2 a day – many of whom live in rural areas where resource-poor farmers cultivate small plots of land – most can’t afford to buy food. It is the economic system that is responsible for this prevalence of poverty and hunger. Recently, climate change has been added to the list of causes. Smallholder farmers tell us that this is a lifestyle for them, not a business. When they have had to leave their land for financial reasons, they have never emotionally recovered. I have heard these stories in many places; not only in poor developing countries. It is a global phenomenon. If the international community is serious about eliminating hunger, a shift is needed from a development model based on charity and aid to one based on human rights, reinforced by accountability mechanisms. Marginalised, disempowered and excluded groups previously locked out of development planning must have a place, including minorities, migrants, and poor, disabled, older and indigenous people. Non-discrimination and equality must underpin the entire SDG framework. The role of women in development and food security is pivotal. Highlighting women’s rights in all other targets of the SDGs should be a priority. Of those suffering chronic hunger, 60% are women. This is especially ironic as women do most of the agricultural work in developing countries. Much of the work women do is unpaid and invisible, despite its indispensable role in feeding children and elderly people. Upholding women’s financial, educational and legal rights would be the best use of funds dedicated to eradicating hunger, poverty and child undernourishment.
Food security is dependent on the sustainability of food supply. A major effort is needed to avoid practices that exacerbate the negative impacts of food production and consumption on climate, water and ecosystems. The SDGs should make a healthy environment an internationally guaranteed human right. The SDGs should encourage governments to work towards policy coherence: agricultural policies should be compatible with environmental sustainability and trade rules consistent with food security. This will not be easy to implement. It will require allowing national food markets in developing countries to compete successfully against cheap imported food. It means altering international trade rules to prevent interference with domestic policies in developing countries designed to eradicate hunger and poverty. Placing human rights at the heart of the SDGs presupposes both a strong accountability framework and the will to enforce this. Transnational corporations can be part of the problem, tending to undermine the livelihood of locals, displacing them from their home and land, interfering with their access to natural resources, and causing environmental destruction. Responsibility for human rights violations must extend to the private sector. International law has traditionally been reluctant to do this. It is encouraging to note that some modest steps have been taken recently to encourage corporate responsibility, including the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and Maastricht Principles for Extraterritorial Obligations (pdf). The SDGs could incorporate these documents in their policy guidelines, or adopt their own version. The new goals should not be allowed to operate as easily ignored principles, but need to be given teeth. We can eradicate poverty, maintain food security and ensure the right to adequate and nutritious food for all. These fundamental aims were long ago set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and repeated in the International Covenant of the Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The task is huge, but the tools are there. The challenge is mainly a matter of fashioning political will strong enough to overcome entrenched interests in maintaining food insecurity. • Hilal Elver is the UN special rapporteur on the right to food",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/19/why-hungry-people-food-poverty-hunger-economics-mdgs,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/19/why-hungry-people-food-poverty-hunger-economics-mdgs
2015-02-19T07:00:06Z,global-development,Global development,Millennium development goal 1: 15 achievements on poverty and hunger,"The MDG1 poverty target has been met. The world has reduced the percentage of the population living in extreme poverty (less than $1.25 a day) from 47% in 1990 to 22% in 2014. The absolute number of people living in extreme poverty has declined from 1.92 billion in 1990 to 1.01 billion in 2010. China has brought down the percentage of its population living below the poverty line from 60.2% in 1990 to 11.8% in 2009. 74 countries halved their poverty rates, making this target the most met among the goals. 10 of the 74 countries that have met MDG1 have less than 2% of people living below $1.25 a day. About 173 million fewer people worldwide suffered from chronic hunger in 2011–13 than in 1990–92. Between 1992 and 2004, undernourishment among under three-year-olds fell from 18.7% to 11.3%. People employed in “vulnerable work” (typically jobs with very low wages, no job security and poor labour standards) decreased by 2.8% between 2008 and 2013 Global food consumption has increased. The average number of calories consumed per person, per day has risen from 2,655 in 1984 to 2,940 in 2015. Cereal production grew from 1.7bn metric tonnes in 1990 to 2.8bn in 2013. India and China lifted 232 million people out of poverty between 2008 and 2011. East Asia’s poverty rate fell from nearly 60% to less than 20% between 1990 and 2013. Stunting in under-fives has decreased globally from 40% to 25% since 1990. Financing schemes in Bangladesh and Nigeria are credited with nearly doubling agricultural outputs and farmers’ incomes. All these gains have been made while global population has continued to rise, from 5.28 billion people in 1990 to 7.1 billion people in 2013. What would you add to this list?

2015-02-19T05:00:03Z,global-development,Global development,What is the millennium development goal on poverty and hunger all about? | Mark Anderson,"What is MDG1? In 2000, world leaders set out to halve 1990 extreme poverty and hunger rates by the end of 2015. This means that the percentage of impoverished people – defined by the World Bank as those living on less than $1.25 (£0.83) a day – must fall to 25% by the end of this year, while the proportion of people without adequate food security must be reduced to 12.5%.
Another target under MDG1 is to achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all the working-age population, including women and young people. Will the goal be met? The target to reduce extreme poverty by half was reached by 2010, when the global poverty rate dropped to 22%, making it one of the first targets across all the goals to be met. However, stark regional differences mean that while east and south-east Asia have met the target, sub-Saharan Africa is unlikely to do so. It’s uncertain if hunger will be halved by the end of this year. There are 805 million chronically undernourished people, down by more than 100 million in the past decade, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation. In its most recent progress report (pdf), the UN said 14% of the world doesn’t have adequate access to food. The UN has complained that progress towards the target has slowed since 2005, cautioning that immediate additional action is needed to meet the goal.
As for employment, the global economic crisis had a huge impact on labour markets, making the task of reducing the number of low-quality jobs even more difficult. This target is unlikely to be met. Women are still more likely to be working in low-quality jobs than men. How are hunger and poverty measured? Extreme poverty is measured by three indicators: the percentage of the population that lives on less than $1.25 a day; the number of people who live beneath the minimum income level deemed necessary to meet basic needs; and the share of national food consumption by the poorest 20% of the population. Poverty was first defined by the UN as anyone who earns less than $1 a day. This was revised to $1.25 a day to reflect rising commodity prices. The poverty line – a measure of the amount of money needed per day to survive – is dismissed by some as a poor way to calculate poverty. Critics say millions live very close to either side of the line, with not much difference in what they can afford.
More broadly, the MDGs have been criticised for targeting a reduction in the proportion of people living in poverty, rather than the absolute number. Thomas Pogge, a professor in development studies at Yale University, said this could “paint far too rosy a picture of the evolution of extreme poverty” (pdf). Hunger is measured by the country average of how many calories each person has access to every day, as well as the prevalence of underweight children younger than five. How accurate is the data? Gaps in data gathering have cast doubts on the credibility of the UN’s figures in eradicating hunger and poverty, some experts say. They claim that more than 40 developing countries lack sufficient data to track performance in these areas. The global rate masks uneven regional progress in reducing hunger and poverty, critics say. For example, China’s successful poverty reduction strategy accounts for most of the world’s gains over the past 25 years. East Asia’s poverty rate tumbled from 80% in 1980 to 20% in 2005. But, “the world doesn’t have another China”, says Lawrence Haddad, a senior fellow at the Institute of Development Studies.
By contrast, sub-Saharan Africa’s rate hovered around 50% over the same period. “The rate of poverty reduction has been much slower in low-income countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa where the absolute number of poor has continued to increase,” according to the World Food Programme. Which issues weren’t adequately addressed in MDG1? Food waste, land rights, soil quality, obesity, access to nutritious food, overreliance on certain crops, genetic modification, price volatility, disaster preparedness, monitoring progress. How do the MDG1 targets translate into the SDGs? The sustainable development goals (SDGs), which come into effect in 2016, include a target to end poverty everywhere, and one to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. There is a standalone target to promote sustainable economic growth, which includes full and productive employment, and decent work for all.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/19/millennium-development-goal-one-poverty-hunger,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/19/millennium-development-goal-one-poverty-hunger

The victim, who has not been named, is understood to have worked for the Carter Center, the NGO set up by the former US president Jimmy Carter. A spokesman for the South Sudanese government said the man appeared to have been deliberately targeted as he returned to his compound in Juba. “It has been confirmed that a British staff member in the Carter Center was killed, a crime we condemn in the strongest terms possible,” Ateny Wek Ateny told the AFP news agency. “He was driving in his car, and when he arrived at his gate he got out of the car, then while walking he was shot.” Ateny added that police had “rounded up some people to get some clues”. A spokeswoman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed that a British national had been killed, adding the FCO was providing consular assistance to the victim’s family. The Carter Center, which is based on Atlanta, Georgia, has yet to comment on the reports. Civil war erupted in South Sudan – the world’s youngest country – in December 2013 when the president, Salva Kiir, accused his vice-president, Riek Machar, of plotting a coup. Tens of thousands are thought to have died in the fighting, which has displaced 1.5 million people internally and forced another 480,000 into neighbouring countries. Although a much-feared famine was averted last year, the UN estimates 3.9 million people will face food insecurity in South Sudan in 2015, with 2.5 million becoming “severely” food insecure. The dire humanitarian situation has brought many international NGOs to Juba and the rest of the country, as efforts continue to mitigate the effects of the war. It is not the first time aid workers have been targeted. In August last year, six South Sudanese humanitarian workers were murdered in what appeared to be ethnically motivated attacks. Toby Lanzer, the UN humanitarian coordinator in South Sudan, described those murders as the “most serious incident to affect the aid community at any time since South Sudan’s independence” in July 2011.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/18/british-aid-worker-killed-south-sudan-carter-center,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/18/british-aid-worker-killed-south-sudan-carter-center
2015-02-18T11:59:24Z,global-development,Global development,"Thailand failing to tackle fishing industry slavery, says rights group","Thailand has made wholly inadequate progress in its efforts to eliminate human trafficking in its multi-billion dollar fishing industry, and has failed to combat both endemic corruption and the involvement of state officials in trafficking despite repeated promises to do so, a rights group claims. Trafficking victims are still vulnerable to abuse and attack in Thai government shelters, while government inspections of fishing vessels consistently fail to identify abuse or perpetrators of abuse, the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) says in a briefing paper, Broken Promises (pdf). These failures, among a litany of others, prove that the government’s efforts over the past year have failed to meet even the most minimum of standards for eradicating slavery, the group says. Thailand was downgraded in June to the lowest level in the US State Department’s Trafficking in Persons report, ranking it alongside Iran, North Korea and Saudi Arabia in its treatment of workers and the way it protects them from abuse. The downgrade came after a Guardian report into the Thai fishing industry found that slaves forced to work on Thai fishing boats for no pay were integral to processing prawns sold in the US, UK and elsewhere in the EU by industry giants including Tesco, Walmart, Carrefour and Costco. But the military-backed government claims to have made significant progress in its attempts to combat human trafficking over the past year. Last month, deputy foreign minister Don Pramudwinai detailed extensive new measures – GPS-monitoring systems on fleets, million-dollar fines for illegal fishing and anti-corruption officers to improve investigations – as proof that the nation was cracking down on slavery. The EJF paper, however, highlights alarming reports of slavery over the past year, among them the October rescue by Indonesian authorities of 35 Thai nationals from Thai fishing fleets, and the January sale of a father and son on to a Thai trawler by Thai police officers. The lack of regulation or prosecution of illegal labour brokers, enforcement of existing laws, or even provision of adequate protection and support to trafficking victims – many of whom have alleged assault, threats at gunpoint and physical beatings at government shelters – are clear indicators that Thailand should remain on the State Department’s lowest ranking this year, said EJF’s executive director, Steve Trent. “Nothing that we have seen or heard in the last year indicates that Thailand has taken meaningful action to address the root causes of trafficking and abuse,” said Trent. “After four years on the tier 2 watchlist and one year on tier 3, the Royal Thai government is still failing to take the action needed to prevent trafficking and human rights abuses in the fishing industry.” Although Thailand began inspections at sea last year, video footage shows interviews of fishermen taking place in front of their boat captains or gangmasters – the very men who are often responsible for trafficking workers – while local media reports indicate that officials often fail to determine the work conditions, wages or trafficking status of those being questioned. This is due in part to inadequate screening processes, EJF claims, but also to the lack of official vessels at sea, budget restrictions on fuel, and maritime border issues. Other rights groups, among them Human Rights Watch, have said that nothing less than a complete overhaul of Thailand’s fishing industry would suffice to address the “systematic and pervasive use of trafficked men” on its fishing boats. “Only a few of the most open and forward-looking companies and industry associations are moving to address the challenges of labour exploitation quickly enough, and they too are held back by the government bureaucracy, corruption and entrenched broker-reliant migrant recruitment, registration and regularisation systems,” migrant rights activist Andy Hall said. “Too many companies, as well as purchasing giants overseas, continue to seek to hide these challenges through ineffective audits whilst passing almost all of the burdens and costs of these challenges on to workers or subcontractors.” Thailand has pointed to its registration of 1.6 million migrant workers – 70,000 of whom EJF claims work directly in the fishing industry – as proof that it is combating trafficking. But with the Thai fishing industry facing a labour shortage of roughly 50,000 men, recruitment on to fishing boats remains, by and large, an informal process taken on by illegal brokers who work directly with Thai boat captains. Little has been done to address that shortage, rights groups claim, and a recent government proposal to fill that gap with prison inmates was met with both local and international derision. Activists working in trafficking hotspots in Thailand recently told the Guardian that while the government had ramped up patrols in ports and on docked fishing vessels, the real problem was still the thousands of trafficked men stuck out at sea. “From what I can see, trafficking is still in full force,” one activist charged with helping vulnerable seafarers in southern Thailand told the Guardian. “A Burmese slave recently escaped from a [fishing] boat and said there were many others like him still out at sea – Burmese, Cambodian, all sorts – so to me it looks like the measures aren’t working.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/18/thailand-failing-tackle-fishing-industry-slavery,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/18/thailand-failing-tackle-fishing-industry-slavery
2015-02-18T11:15:38Z,global-development,Global development,EU resumes aid to Zimbabwe as relations with Robert Mugabe thaw,"The EU has offered a €234m (£174m) olive branch to Zimbabwe, with insiders privately acknowledging that 12 years of sanctions on President Robert Mugabe’s regime have failed. The aid is intended for development projects decided jointly with the government and, if certain conditions are met in the next few years, could lead to a resumption of direct budget support. The pledge is likely to be seen as conceding the last laugh to Mugabe, long regarded as a pariah in the west but seemingly on the verge of coming back from the cold. Just days before his 91st birthday, the man accused of orchestrating ethnic massacres, political violence and vote-rigging appears more powerful than ever and was recently elected chairman of the African Union (AU).
The sanctions were imposed after elections in 2002 that observers said were rigged in Mugabe’s favour. But critics say that, far from bringing down the world’s oldest leader, they strengthened him with a propaganda weapon that allowed him to blame all Zimbabwe’s economic ills on western imperialists seeking regime change. Donors have been quick to point out that they continued to provide aid through multilateral agencies and NGOs, bypassing the treasury. The EU also gradually eased restrictive measures on various individuals and companies, although it still has an asset freeze and a travel ban on Mugabe and his wife, Grace, as well as an arms embargo. This week’s announcement was ostensibly a reward for Zimbabwe’s adoption of a progressive new constitution and an attempt to encourage further change. But it also marked the latest step towards normalising relations and working with Mugabe rather than against him. “After 12 years of sanctions, we have realised it is not going to work,” one western source said. “We do not have enough leverage to induce reform. Let’s try another way by engaging with the government in a more positive way rather than standing on the sidelines.” The money will go towards boosting production in agriculture and improving health services as well as assisting with governance and institution-building over the next six years. While the projects will be jointly discussed by the EU and government, they will still be implemented by agencies such as the UN Development Programme and World Bank. But if Zimbabwe meets conditions relating to good governance and the rule of law, it could eventually receive direct budget support. Philippe van Damme, the EU ambassador to Zimbabwe, said during a signing ceremony that the agreement opened a new chapter in Europe’s relationship with the country. But comparing it to the ups and downs of a marriage, he cautioned: “Does this mean that everything is suddenly sorted out and that we are entering a new honeymoon? No; we have cleared some obstacles in our partnership and, as in any partnership, new problems may emerge, old problems may reappear, but what I can promise today is that I will continue applying, with all the conviction inspired by a happy marriage, the method of an open and frank dialogue, where necessary seasoned with a sound layer of humour, to overcome those problems.” Mugabe’s Zanu-PF party has long demanded the complete removal of EU sanctions, branding them illegal. Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa said the aid marked a significant step but that the sanctions on Mugabe and his wife would continue to sour relations. “Zimbabwe Incorporated has a chief executive officer and as long as the chief executive remains under sanctions our relations remain poisoned and unproductive,” he added. Chinamasa used the opportunity to appeal for direct foreign investment from EU countries. “Zimbabwe is open for business. I would therefore want to extend my invitation to European investors to come and invest in Zimbabwe.” Mugabe, who has been in power for 34 years, continues to inch towards redemption. This month the EU said he may be authorised to travel to Europe under specific circumstances in his capacity as AU chair. Last year, the EU invited him to attend an EU-Africa summit in Brussels, but he turned it down when his wife was denied a visa to travel with him. Analysts said this week’s EU donation marks a significant repositioning. Piers Pigou, southern Africa project director for the International Crisis Group, commented: “In some respects this represents a shift in the EU from an emphasis on stick to an emphasis on carrot. It’s intended to foster reform but it’s not clear exactly what reforms we’re talking about. “The money is coming at an important time, a moment of extreme political and economic instability in Zimbabwe. The EU has decided it couldn’t allow the situation to deteriorate any further.” Asked if the move represents a personal triumph for the president, Pigou replied: “If Mr Mugabe and his fellow travellers want to consider this a success and victory, the question has to be asked, at what cost? It seems to have cost him little personally but it’s had a devastating cost for the people of Zimbabwe, many of whom remain outside the country’s borders.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/18/eu-aid-zimbabwe-relations-robert-mugabe-thaw,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/18/eu-aid-zimbabwe-relations-robert-mugabe-thaw
2015-02-18T00:01:10Z,global-development,Global development,Female domestic workers emerge from the shadows to fight abusive employers | Ai-jen Poo,"When I first started working with domestic workers in New York City in 1998, many women I encountered were Filipina who had first worked in Hong Kong, then come to the US with their employers. They described Hong Kong as the “city of modern slavery”, but also as home to a vibrant movement of domestic workers organising for their rights and dignity. It was a striking duality. The recent case involving Indonesian domestic worker Erwiana Sulystyaningsih – whose former employer was found guilty on 10 February of a series of charges against her – reflects both realities. The abuses she suffered – beaten, starved, sleep deprived – sound like brutality from another era. And yet, Hong Kong domestic worker advocates say this type of violence is rising. There are two key elements to Sulystyaningsih’s abuse. First, her migrant worker recruitment agency knew of these abuses and forced her to stay in the workplace. She reported severe abuse within the first month of working with this employer and the agency told her that she must remain to pay off her recruitment fee – 15,000 HK dollars (about $1,900), which is approximately five months’ salary. The agencies, to ensure workers pay back the fees, retain their passports and documents. A previous domestic worker for the same employer had also asked the agency to intervene on abuses, including when the employer threatened to throw her out of a high-rise window. In Hong Kong, agencies are limited to a 10% recruitment fee, but many countries including Indonesia do not have restrictions, and workers end up in an indentured servitude-like relationship. Second, in Hong Kong, there are many restrictions placed on migrant domestic workers, which render them particularly vulnerable to extreme abuse. Migrant domestic workers are required to live with their employers. In fact, the same day that Sulystyaningsih’s verdict was announced, four migrant domestic workers were detained in an immigration raid for not living with their employers. Live-in workers are more likely to face abuse, including rape and physical violence. Just last week another abuse case involving a migrant domestic worker was filed in the Hong Kong courts and included an alleged rape by one of the family members. Fish Ip, a Hong Kong-based domestic worker advocate, noted an increase in Hong Kong migrant domestic labour, which she attributes to the increased need for care of elderly people. In many nations care of older people is among the fastest growing occupations as advances in healthcare allow longer lifespans. She believes that the laws are inadequate, (not to mention outdated), and render migrant domestic workers extremely vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. “Hong Kong only requires employers to pay a minimum salary of 15,000 HK dollars to hire a migrant domestic worker,” she notes. “That is a very low bar and has not changed for many years.” In February 2014, Sulystyaningsih’s employers attempted to deport her to Indonesia in the middle of the night. After crossing security, she was helped by a fellow worker who saw that she was too injured to walk, and posted on Facebook about the abuses. The Indonesian Migrant Domestic Workers Union saw the post and moved into action. She received medical attention and legal support, which allowed her to stay in the country seeking justice. The union’s leaders stayed with her during her hospitalisation, and helped document her story. They also helped garner public support that could lead to change for other domestic workers. While the verdict in Sulystyaningsih’s case went in her favour, she still suffers from headaches and hearing loss from the abuse. She is one of an estimated 100 million domestic workers globally who are vulnerable, victims of a culture that devalues and dehumanises domestic work. But she is also part of a growing movement in Hong Kong and across the globe, for safety, dignity and opportunity for this critical workforce – one that promises to bring this work of supporting and caring for families out of the shadows and into the full light of our economy. The relatively new International Labour Organisation global convention on domestic work, finalised in 2011, is a step forward, but does not go far enough. We must ensure that this convention is globally ratified and enforced, that the Hong Kong government, along with governments around the world, increases protections for the workforce, and that organisations like the Indonesian Migrant Domestic Workers Union and the International Domestic Workers Federation continue to grow in strength and impact. And ultimately, each of us as individuals must take responsibility for changing the cultural norms and practices that have allowed for domestic worker abuse to persist for so long. • Ai-jen Poo is director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance and co-director of the Caring Across Generations campaign",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/18/women-domestic-workers-fight-abusive-employers-hong-kong,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/18/women-domestic-workers-fight-abusive-employers-hong-kong

2015-02-17T11:26:06Z,global-development,Global development,Information war leaves Ukrainians trapped and searching for truth | Daniel Bruce,"The freshly minted ceasefire in Ukraine, implemented at midnight on Saturday, offers a hopeful but fragile resolution to the hostilities in the region. In the early days of the ceasefire, more than 900,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) will begin to determine whether it is safe to return home. They also need to understand what might, or might not, be left of “home”. To make such decisions, they will need to rely on myriad sources of information – from word of mouth to social media, from TV to the internet. However, the context in which IDPs obtain their information in a post-conflict setting is always complex. For IDPs in Ukraine, who are living in the midst of a sophisticated and prolonged information war, the situation is even more precarious. Print and radio are largely a thing of the past. Today, around 80% of people in Ukraine get their news from television. In the east, where the IDPs are concentrated, TV is dominated by two warring media factions: Russian television, with its glossy and attractive production values, and Ukrainian channels that are largely owned by national oligarchs with their own political and economic agendas. In such a context, trust in the media is at best low. In the aftermath of any conflict, timely, accurate and neutral information about entitlements, rights, legal assistance, eligibility criteria and available aid are vital in enabling IDPs to make informed decisions. This information is essential to providing a degree of autonomy and self-respect for a traumatised population, many of whom fled their homes, leaving even their winter clothing behind. IDPs need reliable sources of information to help them understand why the future may be different to today; after months of fighting, why and whom should they believe that it is safe to go home? As the rapid response report issued on Tuesday by Internews indicates, access to basic humanitarian information in eastern Ukraine has been extremely limited. This constrained information environment has added to the misery of the those who have been displaced, many of whom have now exhausted their financial resources in paying for essentials. Largely scattered throughout the region adjoining the conflict zone, the IDP population is confused, mistrustful and vulnerable to rising tensions with their host populations. Many turn to their mobile phones for information – most have internet access. Although they know there is information on Facebook, the social network is still unfamiliar terrain for most. Out of 45 million people living in Ukraine, only 2 million are on Facebook. The dominant social media platform is the Russian offering, Vkontakte. Joining and navigating Facebook for the first time in the midst of an emergency is proving a significant challenge for many IDPs. It is worth reminding ourselves that it was only a year ago that the Ukrainian oligarch Victor Yanakovich left in the wake of the uprising on the Maidan in Kiev. The reforms that have been put in motion since then are real, but fragile. The ongoing information war is not only a threat to eventual resettlement of IDPs, but to Ukraine’s critical transition to a truely democratic state. This transition relies on the same remedy that will help the IDP populations: the existence of strong, sustainable and trusted media. In Ukraine, the independent media sector is small, but growing. Internet news channels have emerged, such as Hromadske.tv, which was first on the ground at the Maidan. Today, Hromadske.tv is one of the lone voices reporting from the east from the point of view of people on the ground. Its work has offered a credible, moderate view on the situation, free of propaganda. Another powerful example comes from the work of the investigative reporting programme, Slidstvo.info, which offers well-researched exposés on corruption throughout Ukraine, in government and private industry. Whether or not the ceasefire holds, Ukraine’s displaced people face a raft of difficult decisions about where to go and what to do. Supporting the ability of credible independent media outlets to provide the local population with reliable news is one of the best ways to enable the Ukrainian media to build the trust they need to support the reforms that have been set in motion. • Daniel Bruce is CEO for Internews in Europe.

2015-02-17T09:00:03Z,global-development,Global development,What will it take to stop Isis using rape as a weapon of war? | Yifat Susskind,"Noor (not her real name), a 14-year-old girl from a small village in northern Iraq, was sold 15 times, passed from one Islamic State (Isis) fighter to the next. Each time, she was raped. Noor managed to escape and made her way, mostly on foot, to a refugee camp. There, she met Yanar Mohammed, an Iraqi women’s rights activist, who told me Noor’s story. “The worst moments,” Noor said, “were when one man would sell me to another. And I would have to hear them debating what my life was worth.” I heard many more stories like Noor’s at a recent gathering of Iraqi and Syrian women’s rights activists in Istanbul. Some of the women had never met before, but they shared a common purpose: to end the scourge of rape unleashed on them by civil war and the ascent of Isis. But how to do that? No soldier in a war will hold on to a weapon that does not work. So what will it take to disarm rape as a weapon of war? A glimmer of an answer shone through the women’s harrowing stories. Activists from Syria and Iraq spoke of a subtle but critical shift in their communities to end the stigma surrounding sexual violence. As recounted by the women in Istanbul, Isis has used rape to exert control and spread terror through communities. It has imposed draconian limits on women’s freedoms to work, speak or be seen in public, policing these controls through violence. Isis has abducted women and girls, sometimes by the busload, and sold them into sexual slavery. Ordeals like Noor’s are neither random nor rare. Rape is useful for Isis: it traumatises individuals and undermines their sense of autonomy, control and safety. It triggers mass displacement when word reaches people. But the most destructive power of rape as a weapon of war lies in the deep-rooted stigma attached to it. Survivors are ostracised, even blamed for the attacks. Families fear being tarnished by the stigma and banish wives, mothers and daughters. In the worst cases, people adhere to distorted notions of “honour” and kill rape survivors. In short, rape tears at the fabric that binds families and communities. But something different is starting to happen in some of the Isis-controlled zones of Iraq and Syria. There, the sheer number of women who have suffered sexual violence seems to be creating a potential tipping point. The women I met, both Syrian and Iraqi, reported that with rape occurring on such a huge scale, some families are choosing not to reject their mothers and daughters returning from captivity by Isis. As Mohammed said: “It’s harder to blame a woman for having been raped when it’s happening to so many.”
We saw this change in Rwanda, where rape was a systematic weapon of genocide. Afterwards, the critical mass of survivors triggered a new national conversation on sexual violence, on the morality of ostracising survivors and on women’s human rights more broadly. A similar shift may be possible now. If Iraqi and Syrian women’s rights advocates can uproot the community response that stigmatises and isolates rape survivors, the utility of rape as a weapon of war is diminished. It will not work to unravel communities. The strategic opening could be transformational for women and for warfare – but only if women from within affected communities can act now, while deeply rooted social norms around rape are in flux. Grassroots activists in Iraq and Syria are already mobilised, reaching out to survivors and their families with aid and counselling. Some have set up emergency escape routes to activist-run shelters. Many regularly visit refugee camps, not only to bring relief supplies but to listen to women’s stories carefully and without judgment. One woman whom Mohammed met in a refugee camp said that the first time she was raped, she asked herself whether she would survive to tell anyone about it. Speaking to Mohammed gave her hope, she said. Activists like Mohammed have begun to change the conversation; in Istanbul, they referred to alliances forged with other activists and local officials, including prominent men. One Iraqi activist spoke of a local authority figure who has become an ally. At great personal risk, he condemned honour killing at a gathering of tribal heads. His brave act of solidarity opened a community dialogue in support of women’s rights. All these are vital interventions, modelling a way for communities to stand by survivors and begin to render rape obsolete as a weapon of war. As Mohammed said: “We want Noor’s community to see her not as a ruined, raped girl, but as a prisoner of war who was strong enough to survive weeks of torture and brave enough to escape.” • Yifat Susskind is executive director of Madre, an international women’s human rights organisation",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/17/disarm-isis-rape-weapon-war,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/17/disarm-isis-rape-weapon-war
2015-02-17T07:00:01Z,global-development,Global development,Who's going to cough up the cash to meet global poverty targets? | Alex Evans,"In July, Addis Ababa will host a crucial summit on financing for development. If September’s summit on sustainable development goals (SDGs) in New York is when governments will decide what they want to achieve on poverty and sustainability by 2030, Addis is where they must set out how they will do so. There’s much to do, with a bewildering array of potential issues on the table – aid, trade, tax, the private sector, climate, sustainability and technology transfer are all possible focus areas – and too little clarity on what success would look like on each. Politicians are not yet feeling pressure to make serious offers. Yet, if Addis disappoints, the fallout could be extensive. Prospects for achieving the SDGs – such as ending poverty by 2030 – would dim significantly. Frustration among developing countries could feed in to the September summit and the December climate summit, threatening a cascading failure that could damage prospects for international cooperation on defining global issues for a decade. How can we avoid this scenario and ensure that Addis is a landmark? First, there needs to be a clearer narrative on what the summit is for, that focuses on three or four core areas. At least one of these needs to be about political impact, with a big story that leads the next day’s news agenda. In practice, this probably has to be about aid – even though it now accounts for only around a 10th of development finance. Timetables for countries to give 0.7% of national income to aid are unlikely to work, given past promises: in 2005, 16 countries pledged to meet 0.7% by 2015, but only five have delivered. A pledge to give at least half of all aid to least developed countries, on the other hand, may cut more ice – but the politics look tough. Other contenders could include a major push on addressing the “financing gap” faced by many middle-income countries, through scaling up official financing other than aid. And a strong focus on financing highly effective cash transfer schemes in lower income countries would go a long way towards ending poverty. The Addis outcome could also help key “work in progress” agendas with longer term development impact. One area where there’s plenty of buzz is the contribution the private sector can make – for instance, through scaling up foreign direct investment (the single biggest source of development finance), new public-private partnerships, or in key sectors like infrastructure. Less clear, though, is exactly how Addis may contribute. Instead, a better candidate may be international tax cooperation – the most important thing that rich countries can do to help developing countries mobilise their own resources. One step would be to spend more aid on developing countries’ tax administration efforts – an area with breathtaking rates of return. Faster progress on recovery of stolen assets from abroad is another priority for many developing countries, as is access to the automatic exchange of tax information that G8 and G20 countries have already agreed among themselves. Above all, Addis could help close tax loopholes that allow multinational companies to report profits in tax havens – rather than where their workforces, assets or sales are. Country by country reporting requirements would be one important step; a unitary tax system would be even better. Addis could put emerging issues on the development map by including these in the outcome document – even if the time is not yet ripe for agreeing concrete actions. It could put down a marker on the need to do more to tackle inequality, echoing the SDGs’ emphasis on the issue. Or, it could flag up the potential wins that would result from fair shares for developing countries in any future global emissions budget. Most of all, Addis needs more agenda-setters to help its Norwegian and Guyanan co-facilitators, and Ethiopian hosts, to champion its potential. UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon and World Bank president Jim Yong Kim could both do more. Germany and Turkey, hosts of this year’s G7 and G20 summits, could be key players too. Addis needs more voices to make the moral case for why countries need to raise their game. Civil society has a crucial role here. And it may be that Pope Francis emerges as a leader, given his commitment to justice – and the fact that a papal encyclical on climate and development is expected soon. Perhaps most of all, the summit will depend on commitments from finance ministers to attend (as IMF head Christine Lagarde has already done). They, far more than development ministers, have the power to unlock real progress.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/17/global-poverty-targets-sustainable-development-goals-financing,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/17/global-poverty-targets-sustainable-development-goals-financing

The millennium development goals (MDGs) expire in September and a new action plan will be adopted at the UN general assembly. The sustainable development goals (SDGs) are more ambitious and cover a wider range of issues, including a greater focus on climate change, human rights, migration and employment.
But with greater scope comes a more complex agreement – the MDGs comprise eight goals and 18 targets, while the draft SDGs contain 17 goals and 169 targets (although the number of targets is expected to be tightened and reduced).

2015-02-16T12:19:13Z,global-development,Global development,"Central African Republic elections must go ahead, says UN","Timing is tight and insecurity is a major challenge but it will be possible to hold elections in Central African Republic (CAR), where religious violence has killed thousands of people, if peacekeepers deploy rapidly and funds are made available, a UN official has said.
Abdoulaye Mar Dieye, head of the Africa bureau at the UN Development Programme (UNDP), said parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for July and August were vital to restart development and offer traumatised people hope for the future. “If you look at it technically, it might be tight,” said Mar Dieye, after a five-day visit to CAR, where more than half the population of 4.6 million need humanitarian aid, 440,000 are displaced and almost half a million have fled to neighbouring countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. “We have to have these elections because you cannot have a protracted transition. It could defeat the peace process … I think, technically, we can do it,” he said, adding that about 60% of the required funding has been made available, and that voter registration will start soon. “We have to keep the target of August and then do our utmost to have all the conditions realised … Everybody wants these elections to be held … They just want to get out of this transition.” Since March 2013, when mainly Muslim Séléka rebels seized control of the majority Christian country, thousands of people have died in religious fighting, and about a million people have been displaced from their homes. The Séléka withdrew to the north-east last year, after international pressure and violence by mainly Christian anti-balaka militias. Catherine Samba-Panza took over as interim president in January 2014 and pledged to restore peace, but the security situation remains volatile. Last week, peacekeepers killed at least seven rebels in clashes north-east of the capital, Bangui. UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon has asked the security council for 1,030 more peacekeepers, comprising 750 troops and 280 police, to strengthen the peacekeeping operation, known as Minusca, to almost 13,000 uniformed personnel.
Mar Dieye said the extra troops were needed – and soon – but that it would be possible to hold elections with the current troop numbers in the country. He said: “Wherever there is security you can trigger not only the return of the civil servants but the return of development and economic activities. My recommendation to Minusca was speed up your deployment because without your deployment – without sending the signal that security is there – you cannot reactivate economic development and you cannot secure the elections.” He said the UNDP is investing in rebuilding the national army and police force. “It’s a big challenge because some parts of the northern and eastern regions cannot be reached because you still have the ex-Séléka there with low security but Minusca is deploying massively … slowly but massively, and where we have security, I’m sure we can have the elections.” The UNDP is also helping civil servants to return to their offices all over the country, to help restore the authority of the state. “I was just in Bossangoa in the north-west, and I saw the civil servants coming with joy. One of them told me something very strong: ‘Look, I’m not only coming because this is a call from my nation, a call from the government. I am coming because this is a call from my own conscience. I want to [re]build my country’,” said Mar Dieye, adding that people were hopeful despite the trauma they had experienced. During his visit, Mar Dieye said widespread poverty, inequality, exclusion and a weak state had combined to create the crisis. In November, a UN panel of experts said sales of gold and diamonds were being used to finance the conflict. CAR also has deposits of uranium.
“When I talk to people, they say: ‘Our vision is to make development inclusive here. We don’t want to have exclusion as we had in the past. Some segments of the society were excluded, some regions were excluded and that is why we had the fire in CAR’,” he said. A national gathering on reconciliation is due to be held in Bangui in March, and nationwide talks are taking place in preparation. Mar Dieye said the talks were a kind of collective therapy that help to ease tensions. Describing the humanitarian needs as huge, he said donors, including central African bodies like the Economic Community of Central African States, must do more, citing the example of west African support for Guinea-Bissau’s elections last year. “CAR belongs to everybody and the business of CAR is the business of the region. If this country is to go down the drain, the entire region will go down the drain … If the crisis of Boko Haram, for instance, has a junction with the crisis in CAR, it will be a fire for the entire region,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/16/central-african-republic-elections-united-nations,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/16/central-african-republic-elections-united-nations

As a result of violence in CAR, his family are scattered in Chad, Cameroon and Niger
I grew up in Bocaranga, in northern Central African Republic. Until recently, there were no problems between Christians and Muslims. Christians invited us to their Christmas and new year celebrations and they came to celebrate with us during Ramadan. There were no barriers and we lived peacefully together. We went to school together and we had fun and played football. There were couples that were mixed too. Like lots of my relatives, I became a shopkeeper after my final school exams – my family had several shops in Bocaranga. But in 2008, famine struck and MSF opened a therapeutic feeding centre. That’s how I came to be hired as an assistant logistician by MSF. My work involved supporting field programmes in Bria, Paoua and Carnot. I then went to Burkina Faso to work on malnutrition prevention and refugee programmes. That’s where I was when the rebel group Séléka seized power in Bangui in March 2013. When I returned to CAR two weeks later, the atmosphere had changed. I couldn’t get to Bocaranga because of the insecurity, so I stayed in Bangui providing support to the MSF coordination team, who every now and again sent me to Bria to carry out exploratory missions and open programmes. The country was sinking fast and abuse against all communities was rife. The Christian community bore the brunt, but we Muslims suffered too. I was held up on my way out of the MSF office and my motorbike, ID papers, phone and money were stolen. My family in Bocaranga were held at ransom twice. There was growing mistrust and it just wasn’t like before. On 5 December 2013, anti-balaka Christian militias attacked Bangui. There was shooting everywhere and the streets were deserted. I was frightened and I didn’t leave my home for several days. I lived in a Christian neighbourhood, Benz-Vi, where everyone knew I was a Muslim. I tried to set my mind at rest. I said to myself, “I’m a humanitarian worker, my neighbours will take that into consideration, because it’s obvious I have nothing to do with the crisis that’s been plaguing our country for months.”
But the anti-balaka militias gradually took over more and more of Bangui’s districts. Muslims were hunted down and murdered solely for their religion and, when the Muslims in Benz-Vi started to be targeted, I realised I had to get away. MSF offered me an assignment in Niger. When the airport in Bangui reopened, I left. Several weeks later, my little brother, who I’d been living with in Bangui, was attacked in Benz-Vi. He was lynched and left for dead in the street. The French soldiers who found him took him to Bangui community hospital, where MSF was working. They managed to revive him. Some time later, I was able to get him out of CAR and send him to Cameroon. I thought that our problems were over because, until then, the violence against Muslims was confined to Bangui. But in January, it spread to the rest of the country and finally Bocaranga, where my family lived. When the Séléka withdrew from the town, Christian militias attacked and the Muslims fled for their lives in a state of total panic. Some of my family managed to get to Chad and the rest to Cameroon. Our shops, homes and businesses were looted. We have nothing left. There’s not one single Muslim left in Bocaranga. My family is scattered between three different countries. My sisters are in a refugee camp in Chad, and my brothers and their families are in a town in the north of Cameroon, where they are staying with distant relatives. I took my two children and four of my brothers to Niger to keep them safe. I’ve just finished my assignment in Niger and I’m hesitating between several options for the next one. It’s really difficult to work for MSF and support, from afar, about 30 people living in three different places. My first priority was to get them to a safe place, but it’s much trickier now we’re thinking about the longer term.
Before they were forced to leave, my family were really dynamic and enterprising; now, they find themselves with nothing to do. It’s very, very hard on them. Returning to CAR is impossible right now. My family are in places where they don’t know anyone, they don’t know how the people there live. One day they’ll get their lives back but, for now, they have no other choice than to wait. I’m worried that this situation is going to last. They’re saying to themselves, “Here we are, we’ll live here for the time being.” But when they start picturing themselves going home, when peace returns, they realise they’ve got nothing left – that their homes have been ransacked and there’s no money to start their businesses up again. Should we just forget about going home and make a life for ourselves somewhere else? We’re Central Africans, whether people like it or not. In our heads, we’re Central Africans – that’s where we were born, where we grew up and made our lives. Being thought of as foreign simply because we’re Muslims is absolutely awful.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/16/central-african-republic-muslim-christian-militias,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/16/central-african-republic-muslim-christian-militias
2015-02-16T07:00:00Z,global-development,Global development,Social media without grassroots action not enough for a winning campaign,"Social media has become an essential tool for activists wishing to reach as many people as possible, but have other forms of campaigning been overlooked in the process? We asked students whether social media was indeed a campaigner’s best friend, or whether greater focus on grassroots activism was required. Below are five of our favourite responses.
Don’t underestimate face-to-face campaigning Campaigners increasingly embrace online tools to get their messages across. Blogging sites, online personal or group profiles, and cyberspace are used to spread awareness about a campaign, interact with and motivate supporters to follow the campaign, and coordinate events. Tweets and likes make it easy for the campaigners to track their followers’ interaction and engagement, while flexibility in social networking gives a behind-the-scenes view of the campaign and consequently a sense of accessibility. But campaigns also involve a degree of mobilisation and a deeper level of participation that requires relational ties of some kind (as well as individual agency and ability). Thus, campaigning demands an element of fellowship – solidarity and companionship that characterise a more personal form of contact. For me, one of the best strategies is meeting and pressurising decision-makers to commit to change; it adds a more relational perspective to the campaign and ensures devotion to the cause. Voula Kyprianou, University of Sheffield, UK Campaigners can’t afford to ignore social media Social media has changed the way we campaign. It is the ultimate equaliser – giving people the chance to have their voices heard on the same stage as the world’s most powerful leaders. In the past decade we’ve seen online campaigning help bring down dictators, hold big business to account, elect presidents and encourage a whole new generation of young people to get involved in issues that matter. Of course, this is not to say that social media does not have its downsides, and the same tools that can be used for good can also be used to bully and oppress. But for campaigners to ignore this new platform would be equivalent to ignoring the rise of print media so many years ago. This is simply the way we communicate today, and I believe it’s still possible to maintain “grassroots” elements of campaigning in this new world. Campaigning on the streets is important, but there really is no comparison to the amount of people activists can reach online. So yes, social media is still a campaigner’s best friend. Annabelle Smith, University of Melbourne, Australia Social media campaigns still require a spark The encompassing force of globalisation is facilitating a movement towards an online world, characterised by the rapid sharing of social media information, which has the power to transcend traditional boundaries. However, is it possible to create significant change from an online platform? How can politicians be appropriately engaged? These are questions that cloud the effectiveness of such far-reaching campaigning. Undoubtedly, social media can be used as an effective tool for advocating change, but quality grassroots campaigning should be used as a catalyst for mobilising the vast quantity of “keyboard warriors”. Take the poignant UN speech by Emma Watson regarding gender equality, which inspired 19m hits for he4she.org in the four days following. Social media requires a spark to become effective; lazy keyboard warriors need a real-life catalyst to inspire their virtual campaign. A further prominent example is the public self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi in Tunisia, which created a wave of revolutionary unrest throughout the Arab world in 2011, mobilising 2 million Egyptians in occupying Tahrir Square [and] overthrowing Mubarak’s government. It began with Bouazizi and was spread thanks to the sharing of a multitude of accessible information, photos, videos and locations of imminent protests. Clearly, social media can be employed as a significant tool for empowerment and liberation, yet the online world is a gullible and impatient one; mistakes will doubtless be made. Nonetheless, social media represents the future of campaigning, so long as the sparks that mobilise the clicktivists continue. James Laycock, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands A successful campaign relies on online and offline action As a means of communication, advertisement, and expression, social media has become the norm. Many young people, in the developed and developing world alike, often have an arguably unhealthy attachment to their mobile device, as opportunities to socialise, research, and express oneself to the world through written word, recorded video, and carefully cropped pictures are a mere swipe of the finger away. Therefore, social media is pivotal to a grassroots campaign in regard to organisation, promotion, recruitment, policy and strategy briefing, and indoctrination of specific goals and beliefs. Without the use of a variety of user friendly and informative social media applications, a grassroots movement has little chance of making significant strides towards achieving its desired change. However, although this is an increasingly technological age, where some young people would consider it unfathomable to go without their smartphone, social media campaigns must also coincide with more old-fashioned techniques of campaigning such as going door to door, handing out information pamphlets in public places, campus demonstrations, and conducting town hall meetings. There simply is no substitute for direct human contact if one truly wishes to convey a message that is supposed to be convincing, inspiring, and motivating. Social media contributes substantially to spreading awareness and coordinating logistical movement, but face-to-face interaction is irreplaceable. Also, many older people do not use social media and it would be foolish to attempt to form a grassroots campaign without utilising every possible method of making the campaign stronger. Patrick Rulong, University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada Supporters should add their money, not just clicks to campaigns Social media has enabled organisations to crowdfund projects, organise Occupy events, support or boycott organisations, offer unbiased coverage of events and hold public officers accountable for their actions. It has enabled public sharing of views without fear of victimisation or rejection. However, people have replaced picketing with likes or retweets, leading to the rise of slacktivism. This is also known as armchair activism. This gives a false sense of fulfilment of moral obligations by encouraging people to provide their minimum support. Social media support does not always equate to tangible contributions. Campaigners may get a million retweets about a particular cause but only a small fraction of people actually give monetary contributions or show up. In light of this, Unicef Sweden recently launched the campaign Likes don’t save lives, which addresses the issue of slacktivism by emphasising the need to give donations in monetary value and not in social media currency in order to have a greater impact. We may argue that we need to embrace technology, but can we imagine if Dr [Martin Luther] King lived in our age of social media and decided only to blog about his American dream and thereafter shared links on various platforms? There is a need to differentiate between the social media enthusiasts and campaigners. Activism leads to action. Show your support by donating your resources. Go beyond clicking share.

2015-02-14T09:00:01Z,global-development,Global development,"Governments too slow to scrap laws biased against women, report says","In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, women must obey their husbands. In Cuba, girls can be married at 14, while boys have to be 16. In Japan, women are required to wait six months after a divorce before they can remarry, while men are not under such obligation. In Russia, women are not allowed to work in jobs considered too physical. And in Malta, the law allows a man to escape prosecution for abducting a woman if he later marries her. Twenty years after a landmark global agreement on gender equality that included a call for governments to repeal discriminatory laws, many remain on the statute books and more have been passed, according to a report by the advocacy group Equality Now. Using a sample of more than 40 countries, the organisation has conducted five-yearly reviews of progress against the commitment, which was made in 1995 at the fourth world conference on women, held in Beijing. The specific article states that governments must “revoke any remaining laws that discriminate on the basis of sex”.
In its report, Words and Deeds - holding governments accountable in the Beijing review process, published on Saturday, Equality Now said more than half the discriminatory laws related to marital, personal and economic status, and violence against women – all of which it had highlighted in previous years – had been repealed, or partially repealed. However, it said many remained in force and that new discriminatory laws had been passed since its last review in 2010. The latter include a law in Burundi stating that men are the head of the family, while in Indonesia a man can now have more than one wife. Despite amendments to the law in India in 2013, a man who rapes his wife will not face prosecution if she is over 15. “The global trend is there has been some progress, which is good, but it is often two steps forward, one back,” said Jacqui Hunt, London director of Equality Now. “We’ve seen new laws, and governments not taking the opportunity, when reviewing laws, to change them. We have seen some progress, but there’s still a long way to go.” Among the countries that have taken positive steps over the past five years are: Argentina, which has removed the possibility of a perpetrator of sexual abuse making a settlement with the victim to escape prosecution; Bolivia, which now allows women to work at night; and Iraq, which now allows women to obtain a passport without their husband’s permission. Last year, the president of Mozambique rejected proposed changes to the country’s penal code that would have undermined women’s rights, and ran counter to the country’s constitution. These included a provision that would have allowed rapists to escape punishment if they married the victim. At the African Union summit this month, Tunisia signed the Maputo Protocol (pdf), a 2003 charter to guarantee women’s rights across Africa. The majority of states have signed, but not all have ratified. Botswana and Egypt have yet to sign. Meanwhile, this week, Malawi passed a marriage, divorce and family relations bill, which raised the age of marriage from 15 to 18. Malawi was one of the 10 countries identified by the UN with the highest rates of child marriage in the world. The UN recommends a minimum age for marriage of 18. These changes have often been the result of strong campaigning by women’s rights activists. In Mozambique, organisations drew up a petition highlighting which of the changes went against the constitution and the international agreements upholding women’s rights signed and ratified by the government. “There is no doubt this was an example of advocacy,” said Terezinha da Silva from Women and Law in Southern Africa, who was involved in last year’s campaign. “In colonial times, women were under men, the head of the family who decided about everything,” she said. “There have been many good changes in the past. But what we are fighting, many times, is in the name of culture and tradition.” She added that while progress had been made in increasing the number of female leaders in various sectors, particularly the police force, much more needed to be done to get women into decision-making roles, and girls and young women into education.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/14/governments-too-slow-to-scrap-laws-biased-against-women-report-says,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/14/governments-too-slow-to-scrap-laws-biased-against-women-report-says
2015-02-13T16:59:47Z,global-development,Global development,Money from Malawi ‘Cashgate’ scandal allegedly funded electoral campaigns,"Malawi’s “Cashgate corruption scandal” may have cost the public 24bn kwacha (£35m) – almost double the official estimate – with some of the money siphoned off for politicians’ election campaigns, according to a British-funded audit, it was reported on Friday. An investigation by the auditor Baker Tilly indicates that payments were made to 202 individuals by government departments, in particular the police and army, according to the South Africa-based Mail & Guardian newspaper. “The proceeds of Cashgate may have been used to support electoral campaigns, though it is not possible to confirm the source of the funding,” the auditor found. The affair continues to cast a long shadow over Malawi, one of the world’s poorest countries and currently dealing with the aftermath of its worst floods for half a century. It prompted Britain and other donors to freeze aid while dozens of civil servants, businessmen and politicians were put on trial. Last year the government estimated that Cashgate had cost it about 13bn kwacha. The Mail & Guardian said it obtained a leaked copy of the auditor’s report, which examines 48 companies allegedly involved in the scandal. According to the newspaper, the report suggested that the companies were in league with officials of commercial banks. “It shows that the scam was based on over-invoicing, double payments and payments for items that were not supplied or for which there was no supporting documentation. A total of 32 cheques worth 1.3bn kwacha were paid to 18 companies without supporting evidence, 3.8bn kwacha flowed from inflated procurement prices, and the sum of 1.9bn kwacha related to payments for which there was no evidence of goods or services being provided. “Eight businesses were identified as opening new bank accounts or reopening dormant accounts and within three months depositing at least one cheque, with no supporting records or evidence of supply available.” The auditor discovered evidence suggesting that fraudulent cheques were written out in big batches between April and September 2013. Paul Mphwiyo, budget director in the finance ministry, was shot and seriously wounded in September 2013 as he was about to expose a corruption ring. Malawi held elections in May 2014. Nine individuals who received government money, either directly or through close relatives, without providing goods or services, were registered by the Malawi Electoral Commission as election candidates, the South African newspaper noted. Among them were four linked to then president Joyce Banda’s People’s Party (PP), who pocketed about 8bn kwacha between them. The alleged principal beneficiaries included the PP’s former recruitment director, Oswald Lutepo, whose companies accounted for 4.4bn kwacha of the total. Lutepo was sacked by Banda after the scandal came to light; he ran as an independent candidate, but lost. Banda, also defeated at the polls, has always maintained her innocence. The Mail & Guardian added: “The findings are particularly damaging to the accountant general’s office, where six officials, whom the report names, are singled out as having signed the 104 Cashgate cheques. Three of them approved 65% of the payments. “The auditors say they could find no documentary evidence ‘which would help determine the legitimacy of these transactions’, and ask why civil servants who signed multiple cheques to the same businesses over a short period failed to raise the red flag. “The report finds that the six officials breached their fiduciary duty under treasury instructions, and calls for legal and disciplinary steps to be taken against them. They were briefly arrested last year and released on bail, but there appears to have been little further development in the case.” Baker Tilly said on Friday that they could not comment.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/13/malawi-cashgate-scandal-money-funded-electoral-campaigns,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/13/malawi-cashgate-scandal-money-funded-electoral-campaigns
2015-02-13T13:39:29Z,global-development,Global development,Julia Gillard: the world must target quality education for all children,"The world must commit to quality education for millions of children, while maintaining the drive for universal access to primary schools, according to Julia Gillard, the former Australian prime minister. Gillard, the chair of the board of directors of the Global Partnership for Education (GPE), hoped the sustainable development goals (SDGs), a set of global targets that will be finalised later this year, would contain clear objectives and receive solid funding to turn promises into reality. “Fifteen years ago we promised the children of the world that they would get to go to primary school. We are still 58 million kids short of that promise and around 250 million are getting some education but not achieving the most basic literacy and numeracy,” Gillard said before giving a speech in Brussels as part of the Kapuscinski development lectures. “Target-setting is good, delivery is better and this year, having learned from the millennium development goals [MDGs], I hope our targets are ambitious and clear and then we give people the means to achieve them.” The 17 draft SDGs, due to be finalised by the UN in September, include specific targets to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. Gillard said the emphasis on quality primary education had to go hand-in-hand with the drive for universal access. “We can’t forget about access and just go, ‘Job done’ when we know there are 58 million children who aren’t getting access to primary school and 30 million of them are in sub-Saharan Africa … but there is no point at the end of the day having kids sitting in something called a school if they are not learning,” Gillard said. Teacher training and professional development, curriculum and assessment practices, instructional materials, books, and the appropriate use of information technology would help tackle what she called a “learning quality crisis”. Measurement and assessment were also key. Since 2002, GPE has allocated $4.3bn (£279.5m) to developing country partners and programmes. It now works with 60 countries, bringing together donors, governments, teachers, civil society, the private sector and multilateral organisations.
For developing country partners to access funds from the GPE, they must pledge an increase in their domestic education budgets. “We recommend that people make their way to 20% of their domestic budget being expended on education … obviously, not everybody can get to 20% in one big leap. It’s getting to 20% over time,” Gillard said. According to GPE data, developing country partners spent an average of 4.77% of gross domestic product on education in 2012, though there were significant variations: Burundi spent 5.8% and Rwanda 4.2%, but Pakistan’s outlay was only 2.2%. At a replenishment conference last June to raise more funds for GPE, donors pledged $2.1bn while developing countries approved pledges of $26bn over four years in increased education expenditure. Gillard said GPE had also introduced a results-based funding model with “potentially 30% of the funding at risk depending on performance”. The first grants under this new model are being negotiated. “We’re in the early days but clearly it won’t be one-size-fits-all. The benchmarks of success for different nations will vary but, for many nations, that 30% of funding will be associated with benchmarks that are about quality and improving the quality of learning,” she said. GPE works with supervising bodies, such as the World Bank or Britain’s Department for International Development, to monitor action on education plans and measure performance in partner countries. Gillard arrived in Brussels from Kigali, Rwanda where she attended a meeting of the sub-Saharan Africa regional education conference, held in preparation for the World Education Forum in the Republic of Korea in May. In her speech, Gillard noted that education’s share in global humanitarian funding had declined, from 2.4% in 2011 to 1.4% in 2012. Aid to education had fallen by almost 10% since 2010 compared with a 1.3% decline in overall development assistance worldwide. “The sharp decline in global aid to education must be reversed. We must push for the political will to reprioritise education aid,” she said. The need to refocus on quality and inclusiveness should also be a priority in developed countries, Gillard said. The phrase “to have the last child learning” – commonly heard in development circles – should be used by all countries, she said. “Looking at my own experience in Australia … the truth is there are many indigenous Australian children, many children from refugee backgrounds who don’t speak English at home, who are at risk of being left behind in their education unless we make truly strong efforts to ensure they get a quality education. “That same drive for inclusiveness – for making sure that education is for the girls as well as the boys, for the rural children as well as the city children, for the children with disabilities, for the children who might be from particular ethnic minority groups – that drive should be in every nation around the world.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/13/julia-gillard-quality-education-for-all-children-sustainable-development-goals,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/13/julia-gillard-quality-education-for-all-children-sustainable-development-goals
2015-02-13T13:05:30Z,global-development,Global development,A UK tax avoidance bill could save developing countries billions | Nuria Molina,"This week, tax avoidance has once again hit the front pages following the revelations that HSBC helped clients avoid tax through its Swiss banking arm. Tax avoidance is an issue that is not going to go away and, according to our own polling, the public is angry. More than four out of five adults believe tax dodging by corporates is morally wrong. But what should politicians and governments be doing when it comes to preventing tax avoidance in developing countries? One priority will be to introduce concerted international action to close loopholes in the international tax system, and July’s UN conference on financing for development in Addis Ababa provides a unique opportunity to do this. Before they meet in the Ethiopian capital, however, the largest world economies must put their own houses in order by introducing reforms to ensure that the world’s poorer countries are able to raise their fair share of corporate tax. Over the past few years, tax has gone from a niche issue worked on by a few technical experts to the top of the development agenda. Before the G8 last year, David Cameron made it clear tax reform was one of the top priorities for the summit, saying: “We want to use the G8 to drive a more serious debate on tax evasion and tax avoidance. This is an issue whose time has come. All of this in developed and developing countries alike comes down to a simple issue of fairness.” Just last month, a study of illicit financial flows by the African Union estimated that $50bn (£32.5bn) a year is flowing out of the continent unreported and untaxed. The panel’s chairman, Thabo Mbeki, said that “large commercial corporations are by far the biggest culprits of illicit outflows”. In 2008, Christian Aid estimated that developing countries, including lower- and middle-income countries, could be losing out on as much as $160bn a year in potential tax revenue. This was one and a half times the combined overseas aid budget of the whole rich world at the time, and there’s no reason to think the problem has got smaller since then. While this gives us some sense of the global picture, little work has been done to estimate the extent to which UK corporations are responsible for these losses. HMRC and the Treasury have produced no estimates for the profits shifted out of poorer countries by UK companies, or the extent of tax dodging by UK multinationals in the global south. Yet this is a crucial issue. UK tax laws can deter tax avoidance by UK multinationals working in poor countries. For example, our controlled foreign companies or anti-tax haven rules could deter UK companies from using tax havens; instead, it was effectively watered down in 2012. UK regulation could tackle the opacity of the UK’s largest companies, giving governments in developing countr ies a new tool to identify and tackle abuse of their tax systems. But greater transparency has the potential to yield positive effects well beyond helping poor countries; it can help our own exchequer and also help create a level playing field for all UK companies, multinational or not. According to research by ActionAid, alleged tax dodging by the UK-listed drinks company SABMiller (owner of Grolsch and Peroni) may have cost governments in Africa and India “as much as £20m per year”. We estimated that, by siphoning profits into tax havens, the company may have reduced its African corporation tax bill by a fifth. This research tallies with the International Monetary Fund’s estimates of the scale of corporate tax avoidance in developing countries, which they believe “now quite routinely run into tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.” More than 150 of the 350 largest listed companies in the UK say they have direct investments or sales in developing countries. We are not alleging that all of these companies are avoiding tax. But if the the amount by this group of companies, as a whole, were on the same scale as that alleged in the case of SABMiller, then the total loss to developing countries could be as much as £3bn each year. This is more than half of the estimated $8.8bn required to achieve universal primary education. ActionAid has joined with other development agencies including Oxfam and Christian Aid, as well as domestic organisations like the National Union of Students, in urging political parties to introduce a tax dodging bill. A well crafted bill including the measures we propose could recover £3.6bn a year for the UK; if it was effective in tackling tax dodging by UK multinationals, developing countries could benefit by as much as £3bn a year. The UK has been at the forefront of the global call to crack down on tax dodging. Now we need to practise what we preach, so that when the UK leaders go to Addis in July they can ask the world to follow suit and do whatever it takes to fix the global scourge of tax dodging. • Nuria Molina is director of policy, advocacy and campaigns at ActionAid UK",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/13/uk-tax-avoidance-bill-save-developing-countries-billions,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/13/uk-tax-avoidance-bill-save-developing-countries-billions
2015-02-13T11:16:48Z,global-development,Global development,Ebola spending: will lack of a positive legacy turn dollars to dolour?,"While it is still too early to call time on the Ebola outbreak, a sense that the worst may have passed is tentatively taking root in west Africa, alongside an acute realisation of the need to ensure a positive long-term legacy for battered healthcare systems. The international community might have taken too long to react initially but the arrival of hundreds of soldiers and volunteer health workers, backed up by millions of dollars from donors, stopped the crisis from becoming even worse. A dire forecast of a possible 10,000 cases a week, for example, was never realised. Now the challenge is to stamp out the disease – the incidence of new cases had fallen at the beginning of the year, but that decline has stalled in the past few weeks – while simultaneously rebuilding health systems so decrepit that they contributed to the rapid spread of Ebola across Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia last year. Aid workers and health officials say that without a sustainable, long-lasting donor commitment to health systems, there will be little or no positive legacy from the millions of dollars already spent. Tom Dannatt, the founder of UK charity Street Child, said donors risked lagging behind events in the recovery as they had done during the emergency response. “The flat-footedness of the entire [aid] structure has been dramatically exposed by almost every stage of this crisis,” Dannatt said. “As to the investment made in the past six months, it doesn’t have any longevity beyond Ebola. “The ETCs (Ebola treatment centres) and holdingcentres and all the rest are viewed with ambiguity by locals because they are almost all temporary structures … When this outbreak is over, they will be folded down, burnt down or knocked down. “I don’t understand why we invested so much in a hardware-based response when it seemed quite obvious that the key things were behavioural, and attitudinal and educational … That has basically been proven because, by the time all these clinics became operational, they weren’t needed”. Dannatt is not alone in his analysis. Claudia Evers, the emergency Ebola coordinator in Guinea for Médecins Sans Frontières, told Reuters that the aid group had made a mistake by focusing on the need for more treatment beds early in the epidemic instead of dedicating greater resources to raising awareness of the disease.
More than 9,100 people, mainly in west Africa and including 488 health workers, have died from Ebola. Up to 10,000 children have lost one or both parents, and the World Bank estimates the outbreak will cost the three countries – among the poorest in the world – $1.6bn (£1m) in forgone economic growth this year. There are other, less quantifiable losses: the number of people who died because they were afraid to go to hospital for non-Ebola related illnesses; the number of children who will die from preventable illnesses exacerbated by poverty caused when Ebola closed local markets; the number of farmers who have been unable to plant their crops, and now do not have any money to send their children to school. There are also psychological scars. Some people now see hospitals as cursed places. Some children do not want to go back to school because their classrooms were used as Ebola treatment units. “Many people in Sierra Leone … will not go to a hospital because that has become synonymous with dying,” said Paul Valentin, international director for Christian Aid. “People are really afraid, women are no longer going for prenatal visits. “A lot of other health problems are surfacing … there is still a fear of using the very limited health system that was there.” So far, donors have naturally focused on the immediate emergency rather than on the systemic failings of health systems in the three countries. “It’s too early to say there’s been a positive legacy [from the international response],” said Professor John Ashton, president of the UK-based Faculty of Public Health. “History teaches us that when these immediate emergencies are over, everybody disappears and the money dries up … Somehow we have to keep the pressure on.” Dozens of Ebola treatment units have been built, but many were only finished late last year, when the disease was already claiming fewer victims. Some of these units are now being closed – and some were only ever going to be temporary – while some are running at reduced capacity. Médecins Sans Frontières has cut the number of beds at its Elwa 3 Ebola treatment centre in Monrovia from 200 to 60, with the number expected to fall to 30 this month. It has started a clinic for survivors offering them psychosocial support and primary health care. Britain and the US have been particularly active in building clinics in Sierra Leone and Liberia, where they have historical ties.
The US has built 15 treatment units – 10 through its defence department and five through international partners – as part of a strategy to provide isolation and treatment capacity in every county in Liberia. On Tuesday, the White House said President Barack Obama was set to bring back nearly all the 1,300 troops deployed in west Africa by 30 April. At the height of the epidemic, about 2,800 US military personnel were deployed to fight Ebola ; roughly 100 would remain to help, the administration said. Britain’s Department for International Development (DfID) said: “Britain’s help means that Sierra Leone now has enough beds for Ebola patients; enough labs to test for the virus quickly; enough trained burial teams to ensure bodies are buried safely and with dignity; and a command structure that has made the response more efficient and more effective.” A DfID spokesman added: “It is clear this strategy is working. There are signs that the infection rate is falling across Sierra Leone. This is cause for cautious optimism, but we cannot afford to be complacent.” Britain is working with the government of Sierra Leone and the World Health Organisation (WHO) to determine what should happen to the treatment and isolation beds once they are no longer needed. In a report issued by the House of Commons public accounts committee on Wednesday, British MPs said the lack of health infrastructure in Sierra Leone inhibited a quicker response to the crisis. It noted that, at the outset of the outbreak, there were only 120 doctors in the country and one virologist, who died at an early stage. The report said: “The lack of health infrastructure not only hampered the response to the Ebola outbreak, but has probably led to an increase in fatalities as a result of other health problems as the system was overwhelmed.”In its conclusions the committee recommended that DfID “should prioritise investment in local health infrastructure of developing countries in receipt of UK Aid so that there is a better capability to respond quickly to emerging public health emergencies.”
The presidents of Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia will meet other governments, multilateral agencies and NGOs in Brussels on 3 March to present plans to rebuild their devastated economies, including healthcare systems. According to Abdulai Bayraytay, a government spokesman, Sierra Leone hopes to set up its own centre for disease control to help stem any future outbreaks of Ebola or other diseases. “One point that has been established by the WHO is that the governments in west Africa, including Sierra Leone, that were hardest hit by the virus were not adequately prepared because we lacked infrastructure,” he said. Tom Frieden, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that if the Ebola epidemic did not convince the world that investing in public health was crucial, nothing would. “Strengthening public health is not a vague thing, it is very specific,” he was quoted as saying in the Global Ebola Response’s outlook for 2015. “Do you have a laboratory network? Do you have an emergency operating centre that can mobilise quickly? These are core, straightforward public health functions that weren’t in place before and they are why we have an epidemic.” Ashton said maintaining the momentum in the absence of a clear global threat from Ebola might be challenging. “We need to keep the pressure on the politicians. Politicians are notoriously short-term and this is a medium, five-year, 10-year, 15-year agenda of building infrastructure. We need political leadership that’s visionary and value-based.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/13/ebola-spending-positive-healthcare-legacy-west-africa,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/13/ebola-spending-positive-healthcare-legacy-west-africa
2015-02-13T07:00:08Z,global-development,Global development,Africa close to wiping out wild polio after six months free of disease,"Africa has gone six months without any new cases of wild polio for the first time, experts say, raising hopes that the disease could be wiped out on the continent sooner than expected. Wednesday marked half a year since the last polio case in Somalia. Nigeria achieved the same landmark on 24 January, though it has suffered some cases of vaccine-derived polio, a rare mutation from the oral polio vaccine in areas of poor sanitation. “This is incredible progress,” said the Global Health Strategies, a New York-based health consultancy. “This is the first time ever that Africa has gone a full six months without a single case of wild polio virus. Combined with the recent successes in Nigeria, today’s milestone is a strong sign that Africa may soon be polio-free.” Polio, a highly contagious viral disease that causes lifelong paralysis or even death, has been the target of massive education and child vaccination campaigns in several countries. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s annual letter for 2015 predicts: “We can get polio out of Africa this year and out of every country in the world in the next several years.” Polio remains endemic in three countries: Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan. In Nigeria, case numbers fell by 92% between 2013 and 2014. Dr Oyewale Tomori, president of the Nigerian Academy of Science, said on Thursday: “We’re excited but very cautious. My country should not celebrate prematurely. Global regulations say that to be declared free of polio you must have three years with no new cases. Six months is just a step along the way.”
He attributed Nigeria’s improvement to greater engagement with communities, including traditional leaders and local councillors. “Instead of being top heavy, it was at the grassroots.” There has also been increased accountability for officials and families. “If you’re told to go and vaccinate your children and don’t do it, something will happen to you.” Additionally, said Tomori, technology such as mobile phones has made it much easier for the emergency operations centre to trace people at any particular time. Similar approaches helped Nigeria smother an Ebola outbreak swiftly last year, but Tomori expressed frustration that the polio campaign lost focus due to the distraction of elections in 2007 and 2011, and warned there could be a repeat when polls are held next month. “We’ve done some good work but we’ve been close before and polio has bounced back. If the government says, ‘We have already eradicated polio,’ then people think there is no need to vaccinate children.” He added: “If you want to eradicate polio in Nigeria, you have to eradicate an attitude to work. Some people are not doing their work with integrity. It’s changing now because of sanctions: people are getting punished.” Yet Tomori remains optimistic about whether a polio-free Africa can happen. “I believe so. If only we’d done what should be done, it shouldn’t have lasted this long.” There are other reasons to be cautious, including Ebola’s impact on healthcare systems in west Africa and Islamist militancy in Nigeria and Somalia, making some areas insecure and hard to reach. Somalia suffered its first outbreak of polio in six years in May 2013, starting with a two-year-old girl in Mogadishu and sparking a nationwide vaccination campaign by the Somali authorities supported by the World Health Organisation and Unicef, the UN children’s agency. There were 194 cases in 2013, most of them children, but this was slashed to just five cases in 2014, all in the north-east region of Puntland. The last case was reported there on 11 August 2014. Steven Lauwerier, Unicef’s representative in Somalia, said: “It is excellent news that Somalia has seen six months without a single polio case and credit must be given to all those involved in the huge vaccination effort. However, we must not let down our guard. Polio remains a serious threat in Somalia, particularly to the children, and we must continue our intensive vaccination campaigns.” The positive news from Africa stands in contrast to last May’s declaration of a public health emergency by the World Health Organisation as polio returned to countries that had been free of it. Pakistan has registered seven cases of wild polio so far in 2015.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/13/africa-wild-polio-somalia-nigeria-six-months-free-of-disease,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/13/africa-wild-polio-somalia-nigeria-six-months-free-of-disease
2015-02-12T16:58:41Z,global-development,Global development,How Nepal is trying to solve its blood brick problem,"Business is booming in Nepal’s brick industry. “Demand is increasing because building is increasing,” says Mahendra Chitrakar, president of the Federation of Nepal Brick Industries. “Each and every man wants to come to Kathmandu and build a house here.” Construction was ranked as the third largest economic sector in Nepal in 2006. High demand for building materials is in turn creating a huge demand for cheap bricks, often with little consideration for the human or environmental consequences. Due to the seasonal nature of the job and the tough and demanding working conditions, brick kiln workers often come from marginalised and poor communities and have few employment alternatives. Many brick kiln owners ensure a steady supply of cheap labour through a system of loans and debt, which ties workers to the kiln for months or years. Brought to the kilns by middlemen, workers are offered the financial incentive of an advance to get them through the monsoon months. In return, they must turn up for work at the start of the next brickmaking season, which runs from November to May, in order to pay back the loan. Workers are paid so little that many find they are unable to pay back their debt before the end of the season, leaving them no choice but to take out another advance for the following year. Others find that, if they want to stop work, they are threatened with high interest on their loans or rent for the land where they live and work. No monthly salaries are paid; instead, workers are remunerated at the end of the season, which means they also risk losing their pay if they want to leave. The upshot is an industry ripe for exploitation. Experts estimate that up to 28,000 children are working in brick kilns across Nepal, of whom half are under 14, with tens of thousands of adult labourers potentially trapped in conditions amounting to forced or bonded labour across the country. Bonded labour in domestic brick production in Nepal and across the Indian subcontinent is well documented yet, within the industry, there remains a reluctance to acknowledge that a problem exists. Mahendra Chitrakar, the president of the Federation of Nepal Brick Industries, denies any suggestion that the industry is abusive. “I don’t think there is bonded labour. I’ve never found any,” he says. Political will to change the status quo is also lacking, according to Andrew Brady, campaigns manager for BloodBricks, a coalition of unions and local and international NGOs campaigning against labour abuses in the brick sector. “If national governments were upholding the law and ensuring that kiln workers were getting a monthly minimum wage salary, then nobody would need to work in a business that was exploit[at]ive. At the moment workers are trapped in debt and being paid so badly because they are largely from communities which can be ignored.’ But could change be on the way? There are already better alternatives to the traditional brick kilns emerging, with an increasing number of larger factories producing bricks made from heavy machinery rather than by hand. As they are permanently based in one place, the owners tend to employ local workers who are paid a regular monthly salary, so cutting out the issue of advance payments. These factories are also starting to pay workers a reduced salary during the monsoon season, when they are closed. Although the price of the bricks is slightly higher, vulnerability to child or bonded labour is significantly reduced. The Brick Clean Group has also launched in Nepal. Part of the Global Fairness Initiative (GFI), the programme aims to incentivise brick factory owners to improve working conditions. The group is encouraging factories to sign up to minimum standards for pay and working conditions that include an end to child, bonded and forced labour, the provision of toilets and drinking water, and a requirement to pay at least the minimum wage. “We want to create standards for the industry to follow,” says Homraj Acharya, Nepal’s country director for GFI. “If [the factories] meet the criteria then there should be benefits. They can become torchbearers for change in the industry.” Acharya argues that businesses which try to change their working practices should be supported by the government. “If the government wants change, it needs to reward businesses that are trying to change themselves,” he says. “If [it] can give incentives to these companies, more people will try to make these kind of bricks. It’s all about rewarding responsibility.” International donors and businesses undertaking construction work in countries where exploitation is rife in the brick industry must also start taking responsibility, believes Brady: “The international community still hides behind the veil of supply chains, but it would be very easy to ensure that there was a national mechanism set up to monitor working conditions in the kilns. It’s about having the will to do it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/12/how-nepal-is-trying-to-solve-its-blood-brick-problem,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/12/how-nepal-is-trying-to-solve-its-blood-brick-problem
2015-02-12T07:00:11Z,global-development,Global development,Yemen facing 'forgotten crisis' as humanitarian disaster looms,"As Yemen teeters towards political collapse and foreign embassies close their doors and evacuate staff, aid agencies are warning that more than half the country’s nearly 26 million people risk a humanitarian disaster. Describing Yemen’s humanitarian situation as a “forgotten crisis”, Grant Pritchard, head of advocacy for Oxfam in the capital Sana’a, said that international donors, including wealthy Middle Eastern nations, needed to step up to the plate and provide funds for the nearly 16 million people, or 61% of the population, in need of assistance. Last month, Shia rebels from the Houthi movement, who had been besieging the capital for months, moved against the president, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, capturing his presidential office and confining him to his private residence. Hadi and his government subsequently resigned. Last week, the rebels announced that they had taken over and dissolved parliament, plunging the country deeper into turmoil and threatening to turn the crisis into a full-blown sectarian conflict, pitting the Iran-backed Houthi Shia against Sunni tribesmen and secessionists in the south. On Wednesday, the US, Britain and France said they were closing their embassies and urged their citizens to leave the country. Tens of thousands of Yemenis also took to the streets to protest the Houthi takeover as fears grew of a civil war. Yemen, the poorest country in the Arab world, has long been a focal point of instability in a volatile region. Bordering Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, it is home to one of the most powerful branches of al-Qaida, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, which claimed responsibility for the January attack on France’s Charlie Hebdo newspaper.
The political uncertainty in Sana’a has deepened the humanitarian crisis, which is so profound that one in every three people needing help in the Middle East is Yemeni. It is not clear how the embassy closures will affect humanitarian operations in the medium term, although Oxfam and Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) said on Wednesday it would continue operations while monitoring the situation. “This is actually a very critical time … The 16 million people who are already struggling are going to struggle even more, and that number will presumably grow as others find themselves falling into the poverty trap,” Pritchard said. “We are trying to warn the international community that this is possibly going to happen … We would hope that a number of wealthier regional players would step up to the plate and help,” Pritchard said. Just over 10 million people in Yemen need food assistance, including 840,000 acutely malnourished children, while about 13 million have no access to safe water and sanitation, and more than 8 million lack adequate healthcare. Oxfam, which provides water, cash grants and sanitation facilities, said in January that a “humanitarian crisis of extreme proportions” could unfold if instability continued, warning that unless the crisis was addressed it would be almost impossible to stop it becoming deadly. “Despite the challenges, we continue to deliver desperately needed aid to Yemenis in some of the poorest areas outside the capital,” said Grace Ommer, Oxfam’s country director. “But if the international community continues to stand by and watch while Yemen risks going from a fragile to a failed state, we will find it even harder to maintain this lifesaving support.” The head of mission for MSF in Yemen, Marie-Elisabeth Ingres, said before the embassy closures were announced: “There is a difficulty for many people to access healthcare, particularly when there are clashes, but also because many people live in extremely remote areas where there is no health provision for many miles. Not only does conflict cause more casualties; it also hinders access to care for patients not directly affected by the fighting.” MSF has been supporting public and private hospitals in Sana’a and has donated dressings, antibiotics and anaesthetics. It has also set up a Yemen emergency pool to respond quickly to urgent situations in Sana’a and the governorates.
“There is definitely a need for health facilities to be prepared for mass casualty situations and so we are working with a number of health facilities in various governorates … So far, we have conducted training on mass casualties, stabilisation and first aid in Sana’a, Aden and Al-Baydha governorates. But it’s not always easy to hold these trainings in their intended locations due to insecurity,” Ingres said. “We also need to be in contact with all sides, to be sure they understand our principles of neutrality and impartiality. We try to be transparent and explain to all sides that we treat people regardless of their background or affiliation.” The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) said last week that political tensions have created an increasingly uncertain environment, but humanitarian operations were so far largely unaffected. It said the 16 million people in need of assistance represented an 8% increase since 2014. UN partners are seeking $748.1m this year. Last year, the UN’s response plan for Yemen was only 57% funded, according to the UN’s Financial Tracking Service. “The majority of targeted people live in areas where chronic underdevelopment and endemic poverty have potentially life-threatening consequences, leaving people in need of emergency assistance and protection support,” Ocha said, adding that children were among the worst affected by the violence. “Unicef estimates that 200,000 children were affected by attacks on schools, as well as by the occupation or closure of school facilities in 2014. In December alone, 50,000 children in Al Bayda, Al Jawf and Sa’ada needed assistance to get back to school,” Ocha said. Despite its dire humanitarian situation, Yemen remains an important destination for migrants from Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Iraq and Syria, among others. Ocha said more than 91,000 people, or 40% more than in 2013, arrived in Yemen from the Horn of Africa last year, with most travelling via Puntland and the Gulf of Aden.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/12/yemen-facing-forgotten-crisis-as-humanitarian-disaster-looms,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/12/yemen-facing-forgotten-crisis-as-humanitarian-disaster-looms
2015-02-12T00:01:02Z,global-development,Global development,"Aid billions yet to make a difference in fragile states, UK watchdog says","The UK is spending billions of pounds on aid to fragile states but the programme has been ramped up too quickly, without proper scrutiny, and is not yet making a real difference, a government watchdog has warned. “The programme performs relatively poorly overall … for effectiveness and value for money. Significant improvements should be made,” a report (pdf) by the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (Icai) said. Icai rated DfID’s work in fragile states as amber-red, which is the watchdog’s second-lowest rating. DfID has committed to spending 30% of its budget in fragile states, splashing out£3.4bn on state-building, health and education in 28 countries that have been affected by conflict and humanitarian disasters, including Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia, from 2014-15. This is a £1.8bn increase since 2012. But DfID’s efforts need “coherent guidance” and are plagued by poor coordination between different DfID projects in the same country, according to Icai. “We’ve seen some red [warning signs] in terms of the readiness of the offices of DfID to prepare for the scale of funding that has suddenly come through their doors and the skills they need to oversee that funding effectively,” said Mark Foster, a commissioner at Icai and author of the report. “There’s often a tendency to define a strategy with a large amount of money to it and then go and try and find out how you’re actually going to spend that money. One of our major recommendations here is to think about the art of the possible – bring that realism into your budgeting and planning process and then spend against those realistic plans.” The department must also reduce its reliance on outside agencies, Icai said – DfID channelled half of the £165m it budgeted for Congo into the UN and the World Bank. Icai said: “Our primary concern is that the portfolio of programmes and interventions in each DfID priority state, fuelled by the very substantial increase in funding, is not yet on a clear trajectory to make a real difference to fragile and conflict states, even if individual programmes are delivering basic services on the ground.” DfID’s projects in fragile states lack a strong presence on the ground and are let down by staff who don’t have language skills or cultural awareness, according to the report. In DfID’s project to reform Congo’s police force, “the original design of the programme revealed limited understanding of how police institutions operate in a French/Belgian model; and a key term – accountability – had no direct French translation and meant little to Congolese stakeholders,” the report said. Graham Ward, Icai’s chief commissioner, said: “Transformative impact in fragile states will take a generation to achieve and is dependent upon development of in-country state capacity. This was insufficiently recognised at the start of scaling-up, where increased funding was directly linked to assumed greater impact.” DfID has previously been warned that its strategy in fragile states will take time to bear fruit, as renewed fighting and corruption can reverse development gains. Mary Creagh, Labour’s shadow development secretary, said there was a need to prioritise support for people in fragile states, but criticised what she called a “target-driven culture in DfID”, saying it “failed to focus on the long term processes of peacebuilding and nation-building”. A DfID spokesman said: “Icai recognises that despite the challenges of working in the most dangerous places in the world, we are now acknowledged as a global leader in this field. The UK set ambitious targets in 2010 and we are now seeing results. From supporting female provincial councillors in Afghanistan to training government officials in districts liberated from al-Shabaab in Somalia, our work in fragile states is improving millions of lives and creating a safer world.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/12/aid-billions-fragile-states-icai-dfid,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/12/aid-billions-fragile-states-icai-dfid
2015-02-11T16:00:10Z,global-development,Global development,'True hell' of mass rape in Darfur revealed in report on Sudan,"Over 36 terrifying hours in October, 221 women and girls in Tabit town in North Darfur were raped by Sudanese army forces in their homes, in the streets and in front of their loved ones during a mass rape that could constitute crimes against humanity, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Wednesday. In a 48-page report, HRW revealed the stories of those who were attacked as scores of soldiers went from house to house, beating and whipping men, raping women and girls, and looting and destroying property. “Immediately after they [the soldiers] entered the room, they said: ‘You killed our man. We are going to show you true hell,’” said one woman, who was attacked with her three daughters, two of whom were under the age of 11. “Then they started beating us. They raped my three daughters and me. Some of them were holding the girl down while another one was raping her. They did it one by one.” HRW said the UN and African Union (AU) should take urgent steps to protect civilians in Tabit. Allegations of a mass rape began to emerge from the town just days after the attack, which began on 30 October, but verification had proven difficult. Sudan’s President, Omar al-Bashir, who has been indicted by the international court for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, has imposed tight controls on media, civil society and NGOs, especially in Darfur where fighting between rebels and government forces has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced more than 2 million people since 2003. In the report, HRW said it had documented 27 incidents of rape, often by multiple perpetrators, and obtained credible information about an additional 194 cases. Two army defectors told the watchdog that officers had ordered them to rape women. During November and December, HRW spoke to more than 50 inhabitants and former residents of Tabit by telephone. It also interviewed local human rights monitors, government officials, and staff of the AU-UN mission in Darfur (Unamid), a peacekeeping force established in 2007. Witnesses said the army carried out three distinct operations from 30 October to 1 November. Soldiers looted property, arrested men, beat residents, and raped women and girls. The mass rape could amount to crimes against humanity, HRW said – the rape was on a large scale, and could thus be considered widespread, and it was carried out in multiple locations at the same time, indicating it was systematic. One woman said soldiers beat her and dragged her from her house. When she returned, she found they had raped three of her daughters, all under 15. The soldiers “beat the young children and they raped my older daughters … They put clothes in [my daughters’] mouths so that you could not hear the screaming,” she said. Tasnim, who is in her 40s and whose name has been changed to protect her identity, hid as soldiers entered her compound. She saw her uncle being beaten with a whip and chased out. Then she heard women screaming. She later learned that three women had been raped and a member of her family abducted by the soldiers and raped. “The deliberate attack on Tabit and the mass rape of the town’s women and girls is a new low in the catalogue of atrocities in Darfur,” said Daniel Bekele, HRW’s Africa director. “The Sudanese government should stop the denials and immediately give peacekeepers and international investigators access to Tabit.” Radio Dabanga, a Netherlands-based station, carried the first reports of mass rape on 2 November. Six days later, peacekeepers from Unamid were granted brief access to Tabit, but security forces prevented them from carrying out a credible investigation, HRW said.
Most of the 7,000 people who live in the town belong to the Fur ethnic group, and the town has previously been controlled by rebel forces. However, HRW said it had found no evidence that rebel fighters were in or near Tabit at the time of the attacks. Witnesses said some of the soldiers who carried out the attacks were stationed at a base on the outskirts of Tabit. Two soldiers, who later defected to a rebel group, said other soldiers came from El Fasher – the capital of North Darfur, and Khartoum. Those who tried to speak out about the assaults told HRW they had been beaten and tortured. One man, who was overheard talking to a relative about the attack, was taken to a military intelligence prison. “They said if I talked about Tabit again that I was going to be finished … They kicked me, tied me and hanged me up. They beat me with whips and electric wires,” he told HRW. Another resident said people had been “living in an open prison” since the assault. Darfur was once the focus of international condemnation of the government’s role in alleged abuses by its militia, including the notorious Janjaweed. But the focus has shifted to other conflicts, although the abuses continue: HRW said government attacks on civilians rose last year. In January, UN experts said more than 3,000 villages had been burned in Darfur in 2014, while the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says almost 500,000 people were displaced by attacks last year, and another 70,000 in the first three weeks of this year. HRW says sexual violence has been a prominent feature of attacks carried out by the Rapid Support Force, a new security force under the command of Sudanese national intelligence and security services. “The Tabit atrocities demonstrate the continuing and urgent need for a professional and independent force that can help protect civilian populations in Darfur from attack,” HRW said. “It also underscores the reality that the current Unamid force has been hamstrung in its performance and in the implementation of its core mandate.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/11/mass-rape-darfur-sudan-human-rights-watch,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/11/mass-rape-darfur-sudan-human-rights-watch
2015-02-11T09:44:49Z,global-development,Global development,David Harewood: Kenya's eternal summer drove home climate impact,"A trip to northern Kenya six years ago convinced David Harewood of the realities of climate change. “I can remember going to a village one day and walking through a field full of dead cattle, which had basically just starved,” says the actor.
“I walked for about five minutes through all these dead cattle. One of the guys there said, ‘It’s almost like a stock exchange crash. We don’t just use the cows for milk and meat. We trade cattle and if we don’t have any cattle, we don’t have any money.’” The Homeland star – who travelled to Kenya in his role as a Cafod ambassador – still remembers the heat and the lack of rain in Maralal. But it was the sight of the carcasses of cows and goats that made the deepest impression. “It was a startling wake-up call for me,” he says. “It wasn’t just an economic catastrophe, it was a very visual reminder of how climate change is affecting people.” This year, Harewood has teamed up with fellow celebrities Stephen Fry, Alison Steadman, Deborah Meaden, Dermot O’Leary, Meera Syal, Raymond Blanc, Jarvis Cocker and Emilia Fox to support a Valentine’s Day campaign launched by the Climate Coalition.
The coalition, which is made up of more than 100 UK organisations campaigning for action on climate change, is behind a new film in which the stars recite Shakespeare’s sonnet 18, “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?” In addition to the film, the Climate Coalition is asking people to show their love for the planet on Valentine’s Day by sharing the video, wearing homemade green hearts and talking about what they would miss most if climate change is not tackled. Harewood’s own fear is that rising temperatures may mean his children never have the chance to enjoy Barbados, where his parents were born. “I got married in Barbados a couple of years ago,” he says. “I took my mum there and one day, when we were walking, she said to me, ‘It never used to be this hot. It’s unbearable’. You couldn’t leave the house at midday. One of the things I would miss is if my kids never have the opportunity to go to Barbados and walk outside. “I hope my kids can experience the seasons and a climate that’s sustainable. The idea that things are going to be so very different for them is slightly scary.”

2015-02-11T05:00:03Z,global-development,Global development,Teenage girls in Burma learn to speak up for themselves and their rights | Fiona MacGregor,"Dau Naw, a 12-year-old girl wearing a wide smile, lopsided bunches of hair and a slightly grubby floral dress, sits in a circle on the bamboo floor with a dozen adolescent girls. She has a nature so animated that she frequently reduces the rest of the group to helpless giggles. But her humour doesn’t detract from the disturbing nature of the stories she and the other girls share: of the violence and bloodshed during the war in Kachin state that has forced them to flee their homes. As they sit on the meeting room floor of the camp for internally displaced people on the outskirts of the Kachin capital, Myitkyina, they talk about their fears of rape and sexual assault, the risk of trafficking, parental beatings and the daily chores demanded of them as girls that keep them from education and leisure. What is remarkable is that these girls are sharing their stories at all. Dau Naw is one of the 2,000 young people from across Burma who have joined a programme run by Girl Determined aimed at encouraging leadership skills and self-confidence in one of the country’s most marginalised groups of society: teenage girls. In traditional Burmese culture – where men are considered superior to women and young people are bound to defer to their elders – adolescent girls are widely expected to keep their thoughts, feelings and opinions to themselves. As a result, abuses go unreported and many girls remain ignorant of their human rights or potential. The Girl Determined programme involves girls gathering for weekly meetings over eight months. Activities, led by local trained facilitators, include planting and nurturing a seed, decorating and keeping a journal, and sport. They also cover issues such as decision-making, self-confidence, girls’ rights and planning for the future. “Before this, we never talked to the other girls in the camp because they came from different villages and we were too shy, but now, wherever we go, we have friends who know us so we don’t feel so scared,” Dau Naw explains. Like many of the others in her group, she arrived in the camp shortly after a 17-year ceasefire in the long-running civil war between the Burmese military and the armed ethnic group the Kachin Independence Army broke down in June 2011. The subsequent violence has forced about 100,000 to leave their homes. Dau Naw recalls nights hiding on a boat as the Burmese army blocked escape from her village. She eventually left with only her flip-flops and a change of clothes.
“It was so crowded on the boat, so crowded, but since we were running away from the war we had to bear it,” she says. In the camps, the girls say they often feel afraid. Women’s organisations such as the Women’s League of Burma have documented numerous cases of rape in ethnic communities by members of the armed forces, and the girls in the camps find themselves confined in close quarters with strangers. Alcohol abuse is common among men, and the girls are often frightened to go out at night. Ting Win, 14, lives in the camp with her mother and brother, but both are frequently away looking for work, and she is often alone at night. Sitting on a mat she’s made from empty coffee packets she cries as she describes the bombings that forced her to leave her village, and the worries of life in the camp. “Some men take advantage of the girls,” she says. “There are many cases like that in the past year. Some are just left pregnant and some are forced to get married.” But she says Girl Determined has taught her to speak up. “Even when people come and say bad things to me, I can handle it. I understand other people’s feelings. Last time we had the lesson [on gender-based violence], we learned that we need to inform the elders if we face such an incident.” She and the others in her group are two-thirds of the way through the programme, which also provides lessons about puberty. “Now we understand about menstruation and how to calculate our menstrual period,” one girl says. In a country where it is generally taboo for women to wash their underwear or skirts in the same washtub as men’s clothes because anything concerned with the female genitals is considered unclean, she and the other girls’ confidence in discussing such matters is unusual. But the programme aims not just at helping the girls deal with the difficult circumstances they face now but to inspire a generation of female leaders. “In the beginning I couldn’t do anything, or share in front of other people, but now, because our facilitator told us to share and to talk, I have become able to speak up,” 13-year-old Htusan Ra says. Although Burma is undergoing political, economic and social change, and despite Aung San Suu Kyi’s high profile, the country has a low number of women in positions of power. A study by the Asian Foundation last year found that fewer than 6% of representatives in parliament were women, by far the lowest among Asean member states, and at regional level there were almost no women in leadership roles.In 2013, as part of the International Day of the Girl Child, more than 800 girls from Girl Determined circles around the country gathered in Rangoon for a conference to create a statement on the rights of teenage girls in Burma. A delegation of girls presented the statement to the social welfare department, and although the government gave no official response, the statement and conference were covered by local press and television broadcasters.
According to Brooke Zobrist, the founder of Girl Determined, the girls’ efforts are having an important effect. “Several sections of the statement have been picked up by the network of women’s organisations that is working directly with the government on the strategy for the national advancement of women,” she says. Had the girls not created and presented the statement, “it seems likely that they would not include protection and potentially national investment in girls as a part of the national strategy,” she says. In the camps in Kachin, the girls are planning their own strategies. Ting Win, 14, might still be scared when she sleeps alone in her shelter at night, but she has also been dreaming up some powerful ambitions. “I want to be a high-ranking leader. I’m maybe thinking of becoming the president. So, I call myself President Ting Win in my heart.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/11/teenage-girls-burma-girl-determined,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/11/teenage-girls-burma-girl-determined
2015-02-10T11:33:29Z,global-development,Global development,Malawi floods devastation far worse than first thought,"Nearly a quarter of a million people, more than originally thought, have been affected by the devastating floods that ripped through Malawi a month ago, and with rains still falling, many of the 230,000 who were forced to flee their homes have been unable to return and rebuild their lives, the UN said. The UN children’s agency, Unicef, said new figures from the UN and the government of Malawi showed the number of people displaced stood at 230,000, compared with an original estimate of 174,000. About 64,000 hectares (158,147 acres) of land were damaged, it added. The scale of the disaster has wreaked havoc on the densely populated country, where most people survive from subsistence farming. Crops of maize have been destroyed, villages obliterated, homes swept away and livestock killed. In mid-January, President Peter Mutharika declared half the country a disaster zone and estimated it would cost 23.9bn kwacha ($51m) to repair the damage. Unicef said 276 people had been killed or were missing, while 645 people had been injured. “With these new numbers, and while prioritising additional severely affected districts, we need to take stock of our response to ensure all children and families have access to emergency services and supplies,” said Mahimbo Mdoe, Unicef’s representative in Malawi. “We are carefully monitoring how displaced children are faring, as we know, after one month in crowded camps, disease outbreaks and increased malnutrition can occur,” he said. About 47% of Malawi’s children are already stunted, which is caused by undernutrition, so they are particularly vulnerable. Unicef has launched a $9.3m appeal to cover its emergency response for three months. The agency is concerned about possible outbreaks of cholera, dysentery and malaria as well as the risk of malnutrition. About 56,000 women and children have received healthcare in the camps, and at Unicef-supported government clinics. A total of 287 children have been admitted for treatment for severe malnutrition. “Unicef is working closely with the government and NGO partners to install enough water and sanitation facilities to keep waterborne diseases at bay, critical for the survival of young children,” said Mdoe. “One month in, we are on target, but with these new numbers we need to look at scaling up services again to cover these additional prioritised districts. We already have a $3.8m funding gap, and that’s likely to increase as we move into recovery phase,” Mdoe added. With support from Britain’s Department for International Development (DfID), the EU and USAid, Unicef is working to provide sanitation and clean water, as many water sources have been contaminated. Many of those forced from their homes have taken refuge in schools, disrupting education for around 350,000 pupils. Unicef is providing tents so that the schools can set up temporary learning spaces while still offering accommodation to families at night. Last week, the UN’s food agency said it was scaling up its food distribution in Malawi, adding that more resources were urgently required to fill a funding gap. The World Food Programme is delivering maize, beans, vegetable oil and super cereal, a flour fortified with vitamins and minerals. It has also provided 28 tonnes of high-energy biscuits to people in the hard-hit and remote Chikwawa and Nsanje districts. It requires about $19m for its operations in Malawi. By the end of January, the agency had been able to reach nearly 210,000 people with more than 1,500 tonnes of food assistance in eight districts. At the UN, member states were urged not to allow other global humanitarian crises to prevent them from supporting a full recovery in Malawi. “While we may not be able to prevent disasters from taking place, we can do much more to mitigate their impact on people and economies,” Denis Antoine, vice-president of the general assembly, told members last week. Northern and central regions of neighbouring Mozambique have also been hit by flooding that has affected around 160,000 people and entire communities. Unicef said the flooding had cut off roads, disrupted power supply and destroyed bridges, houses and schools. The Indian Ocean island of Madagascar has also been affected. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) said in an update last week that Madagascar had received double its average rainfall since early January. This, coupled with the effects of tropical storm Chedza on 16 January, had left 74 people dead and displaced 20,000 people. Ocha said that pre-positioned relief supplies were almost exhausted, and this was a concern as there were reports of drought in the south of the island. The peak of the cyclone season is expected in February and March.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/10/malawi-floods-devastation-far-worse-than-first-thought,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/10/malawi-floods-devastation-far-worse-than-first-thought
2015-02-10T07:19:53Z,global-development,Global development,Migrants building UAE cultural hub 'risk abuse if they complain',"Migrant workers building a multibillion-pound cultural hub in the United Arab Emirates, which includes new Guggenheim and Louvre museums, are subject to destitution, summary arrest and deportation if they complain about their squalid and unsafe conditions, an investigation by Human Rights Watch (HRW) has found. Its new report on Saadiyat Island in Abu Dhabi found that some workers were subjected to conditions amounting to forced labour, having had their passports confiscated and been so poorly paid they struggled to pay off recruitment fees which were supposed to have been banned. Attempts to raise concerns about the workers’ mistreatment led to their wages being withheld, arbitrary police intimidation and their forcible removal from the country.
Although it acknowledged some progress had been made, the report, published on Tuesday, disputes claims by the UAE authorities and western organisations involved in the cultural hub – which includes New York University (NYU) and the British Museum – that effective measures have been put in place to safeguard workers’ rights. Researchers found that legal reforms to allow workers to change employers without their consent and to revoke the licences of agents who charge workers recruitment fees were not enforced, and that workers were unable to file grievances or were threatened into staying silent. Interviews with more than 100 workers in 2013 and 2014 revealed endemic abuse of workers’ rights consistent with HRW reports in 2012 and 2009, and investigations by the Observer and campaign group Gulf Labour. Contractors failed to pay wages for months at a time, did not renew work permits and residence visas, and refused to pay the end-of-service benefits to which workers were entitled, leaving them destitute. All of those interviewed said employers had withheld their passports and had failed to reimburse the recruitment fees they were forced to pay to secure their jobs. The report comes as the UN investigates the abuse of migrant workers in the UAE. The investigation by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) comes after a complaint brought by the International Trade Union Confederation, which highlighted poor conditions on Saadiyat. HRW suggests that the UAE is complicit with the exploitation of workers on Saadiyat. Fifteen former workers on the NYU and Louvre construction sites, who were deported in 2013 and 2014 following strikes over low pay, said the contractors who employed them acted “in concert with the authorities, who arbitrarily detained and deported scores of workers”. Two former workers on the NYU site said police officers had slapped their faces during interrogations in a bid to force them to name strike leaders. A worker at the Saadiyat accommodation village, where all the migrant workers building the flagship museums are supposed to live, said about 500 men living there had been deported or had their work visas cancelled after one of the strikes. One worker on the Louvre site said he was owed more than £1,250 ($1,900) in unpaid wages and end-of-service benefits, dating back to 2005. Neither he nor a colleague in a similar situation had filed a complaint after being threatened by their employer. A group of 12 Louvre site workers had filed a complaint for unpaid wages against the same contractor in a Dubai court in February, but the case had been adjourned twice and remained unresolved. Meanwhile, three Bangladeshi workers on the NYU site said they were on a basic salary of £125 per month – half the amount they had been promised – but they could not leave the country as they were still paying off the debts they had accrued to gain their employment, including £1,690 in recruitment fees. Many workers were found to be living in slum-like accommodation. In Abu Dhabi city centre, a researcher found 27 men crammed into two small rooms, including 11 who worked as painters at the NYU campus. Fifteen men lived in one room and 12 in the other. Video footage shows insects crawling around the kitchen, exposed electrical wires wrapped around a showerhead, and a hole punched in the fire escape door, which was locked. The report calls on the UAE to pass legislation that expressly criminalises passport confiscation and stops striking workers being deported. It also urges the western institutions involved in the project to ensure that safeguards to protect workers are enforced, as well as to compensate mistreated workers. Nicholas McGeehan, HRW Gulf researcher, said hundreds, if not thousands, of workers had been scammed into accruing debts they cannot repay and those who protested were “deported like cattle back home, some of them without their shoes”. He added that those who remain in the UAE were now “working under the menace of penalty – in the knowledge that if they withdraw their labour, they could be beaten up by special police in balaclavas. Why haven’t the French government or New York University condemned that?” The UAE government has not responded to the report. Two HRW researchers were blacklisted last year and told they could never return to the country while another was barred from re-entering. Abu Dhabi’s Tourism Development and Investment Company (TDIC), which oversees the construction of Guggenheim and Louvre museums, and the Zayed National Museum, to which the British Museum is a cultural adviser, said the findings did not “truly reflect the reality on the ground”. The Guggenheim said in a statement that it was encouraged by TDIC’s “continued commitment to advancing enforceable, measurable protections for workers’ rights” on Saadiyat. It acknowledged that there remained room for improvement, but added that representatives from Guggenheim who had visited Saadiyat had “observed firsthand its elevated standards and TDIC’s attention to continued improvement”. The most recent audit of Saadiyat Island by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which was appointed by TDIC to monitor workers’ welfare, found that the company had not consistently enforced its labour policies. According to the audit, TDIC imposed financial penalties against only three of the six contractors who were found to be in breach of its employment policies in 2014. However, the audit noted that TDIC has also pledged to introduce a fairer employment code this year and has already made some improvements to workers’ conditions, including door-to-door laundry services and new kitchen facilities at the Saadiyat accommodation village.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/10/migrants-united-arab-emirates-human-rights-watch,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/10/migrants-united-arab-emirates-human-rights-watch
2015-02-10T07:00:04Z,global-development,Global development,Uganda crippled by medical brain drain,"At the paediatric and childcare department of Uganda’s Mulago national referral hospital, a memo advertises vacancies for nurses in a private clinic. Two points are highlighted: attractive salary and accommodation. Another memo from the hospital management apologises for the delay of January salaries for medical staff. Delayed or insufficient salaries are not new in Uganda’s public hospitals. Medical workers in rural areas wait for as long as three months without pay. Accommodation or transport costs are a rarity. Private clinics and health centres in other countries capitalise on this to poach physicians and specialists from public hospitals. Yet in a bizarre twist, the Ugandan government is actively encouraging doctors and nurses from its own hospitals to work abroad. Last year, the Foreign Ministry advertised opportunities for 263 health workers to go to Trinidad and Tobago. According to the advertisement, Uganda wants to “further accelerate the existing excellent bilateral relations” with the Caribbean country. At least 400 health workers, including senior specialists from government hospitals, applied to leave. The Institute of Public Policy Research Uganda (IPPR-U), a local thinktank, has gone to the high court to stop the export of health workers and compel the government to encourage them to stay. Justinian Kateera, IPPR-U’s executive director, said: “While the government is bent on exporting health workers, thousands of Ugandans are dying daily. Sixteen women die daily giving birth, but the government can’t see that as problematic. “This [Ugandan case] is going to set precedents on the continent. We want governments to know that it is their responsibility to retain key professionals,” Kateera said. A ruling is expected on 2 March. Defeat for the government could mean it would have to drop its collaboration with Trinidad. But a government win could open the door for more medics to leave Uganda. Sarah Opendi, state minister of health for primary care, said the government was aware of the inadequate number of health workers and admitted that it was finding it hard to retain senior medical staff: “It is unfortunate that someone has gone to court. The truth is that we don’t have the means to fill the gaps [in our health system]. We don’t have enough resources.” The medical brain drain is not restricted to Uganda – the problem is common across sub-Saharan Africa: a 2011 study found, for example, that 77% of physicians trained in Liberia were working in the US. The consequences in Uganda are clear: the doctor to patient ratio (pdf) was estimated at 1:24,725 in 2013, with a nurse to patient ratio of 1:11,000. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends one physician per 1,000 people. Trinidad, with 1.3 million people, has a doctor to patient ratio 12 times better than Uganda, with 35 million people. WHO ranks Trinidad’s health system at 68 and Uganda’s at 149.
Each year, about 320 medical students graduate from Ugandan universities, more than in any other east African state. In the public health system, a doctor can expect to earn on average 700,000 shillings ($245) a month, compared with Sh3.8m earned by a civil servant and Sh2.4m by an accountant. In Kampala, the cost of living is not cheap. Rent for three-bedroom house in a good neighbourhood costs about Sh450,000 a month. A fairly cheap kindergarten charges Sh750,000 per pupil per term (three months). All this is before electricity, water, transport and food costs are included. It is perhaps little wonder that after completing their studies, most students relocate to Rwanda, Kenya, South Africa and the global north, where they are paid much more. Among the medical professionals who are understood to want to leave Uganda for Trinidad are 20 of the 28 registered radiologists in the country, and four of the six urologists. About 180 midwives also want to go. Robert Ssentongo, a senior plastic surgeon at Mulago hospital, paints a grim picture of how the brain drain has constrained Uganda’s healthcare system. “Three-quarters of the people I graduated with 20 years ago are not in Uganda. They are all working in western countries. Health workers are not taken seriously here, let them go.” The departures and consequent lack of staff are not the only issue crippling Uganda’s hospitals. Low pay and lack of incentives are increasingly forcing those staff who stay to supplement their income outside the public system: it is estimated that on any given day, 37% of public-sector health workers skip work to earn money elsewhere, mostly moonlighting as consultants in private hospitals. And the situation will worsen if nothing is done to stem the flow of departures, Kateera says. “We are not against health workers. We want better [conditions] for them. The government must deal with the broader policy question. Deal with brain drain. Incentivise health workers to stay in their country.” The government has allocated 8% of the budget to health this financial year, below the 15% recommended by the Abuja declaration in 2000. Anaesthetist Dr Fred Musana, who has applied to leave, said: “It is not illegal for government to post health workers out of the country. It has done it before.“I have worked in Rwanda and Zimbabwe. I think it is actually beneficial for the country. There are a lot of things we share as medical professionals and we can’t do that if we remain cocooned here in Uganda. I call it very simplistic when someone says taking workers to a foreign country is [a] brain drain.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/10/uganda-crippled-medical-brain-drain-doctors,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/10/uganda-crippled-medical-brain-drain-doctors
2015-02-09T13:55:27Z,global-development,Global development,David Beckham is Unicef's lucky No 7 with new fund to protect children,"David Beckham has launched a funding initiative in collaboration with Unicef that he hopes will raise millions to protect children around the world. The former captain of the England football team, a goodwill ambassador for the UN children’s agency since 2005, aims to harness his global celebrity and personal influence to secure support for seven development schemes in seven countries. Named after the shirt number that he wore with distinction for Manchester United, 7: the David Beckham Unicef fund reflects Beckham’s desire to step up his commitment to an organisation he has served since his support was first sought by Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general, a decade ago. “I’ve always felt I could do more, but retiring [in May 2013] has freed up a little bit more time for me,” said Beckham, announcing the launch of the 10-year project in London on Monday morning. “This is a way of being a part of Unicef for the longer term and helping children around the world. I’ve seen over the past 10 years that there’s certain situations I can go into, certain countries I’ve visited where I’ve actually been able to speak to the prime minister or the king because they’re football fans or support Manchester United or Real Madrid. “My career has led me to exactly this point. The hard work that I’ve done on the [football] field has led me into a situation where I can help Unicef, and help children around the world, because it opens doors.” The fund will support work in seven countries where Unicef has identified an urgent need for money to protect the lives and welfare of vulnerable children. The projects include a child protection scheme in El Salvador, which has the world’s highest homicide rate for children, a nutrition programme in Papua New Guinea, where almost half of under fives are malnourished, and an Aids and HIV scheme in Swaziland. The Beckham-Unicef collaboration will also focus on maternal health and infant mortality in Djibouti; education programmes in Bangladesh, where the emphasis will be on providing teachers and textbooks; and water, sanitation and hygiene initiatives in Burkina Faso, where one in five child deaths are caused by diarrhoea. A social inclusion programme in Serbia, where funding will support marginalised children, is the seventh area of focus. “The idea was to select seven countries that really need the funds and are also fighting against some of the biggest dangers that children face today,” said Paloma Escudero, Unicef’s communications director. “David has chosen to speak about areas that sometimes men, sometimes governments, are not very attentive to.” By way of example, Beckham cited a 2009 visit to an HIV and Aids clinic in South Africa which, previously, men had been reluctant to enter. “I can change a young boy’s mentality, change a man’s perspective, on how he treats women … fortunately, they listen to me because they love football.” A Unicef spokeswoman confirmed that Beckham has made a personal financial commitment to the fund, but said the organisation was unable to reveal the figure. From raising awareness about child mortality in Sierra Leone to supporting HIV and Aids initiatives in South Africa, Beckham has fulfilled a wide remit for Unicef. Twice a visitor to the Philippines, where he spent time with street children in 2011 before returning in the aftermath of typhoon Haiyan, he also championed the organisation’s response to the east Africa famine and lobbied David Cameron for action on child malnutrition in the prelude to the London Olympics. Reflecting on these experiences, Beckham underlined his determination to maintain a strong element of personal involvement. “Being on the ground is the really important part of this,” he added, “whether it’s putting a smile on a child’s face or giving a bit of positivity.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/09/david-beckham-unicef-fund-protect-children,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/09/david-beckham-unicef-fund-protect-children
2015-02-09T11:36:46Z,global-development,Global development,Peru's maca boom could fall flat if China starts growing its own | Dan Collyns,"The high plain stretches as far as the eye can see and the glint of sun on water in the distance marks Lake Junin. This highland lagoon, which gives this region its name, marks the place of origin for maca; a small, pungent root whose famed aphrodisiac quality has driven demand beyond the wildest expectations of the local farmers who have been growing it for generations. It was on the shores of Lake Junin at more than 4,000 metres above sea level, historians say, that the Pumpush people domesticated maca more than 3,000 years ago. But only in the past few decades has it earned a worldwide reputation as an energy-giving root that can also be used for osteoporosis, hormone imbalance, menopause symptoms, prostate cancer and fertility. Last year, Chinese demand turned the maca market upside down. Chinese buyers arrived in Peru’s central Andes to buy maca in its raw form, paying well above the going rate, in cash. Under Peruvian law, it is illegal to export unprocessed maca, but the authorities say truckloads were smuggled out of the country through Bolivia or the northern seaport of Paita. The price of raw maca has increased 10-fold over the past year, selling at up to $25 (£16) per kg. The coveted black variety, famed for its potency, can fetch more than $120 per kg, a 25-fold rise. Only too pleased to sell maca at these inflated prices, farmers have broken supply contracts with existing clients, mostly health-food shops in the US, Japan and South Korea. Pilar Condor, a 24-year-old farmer whose family have been growing maca for generations, tells the Guardian she had made more than $130,000 from last year’s harvest, a fortune on these windswept hillsides where she is building a new house. “Now, we maca producers don’t have contracts with any companies. With these prices, the producers benefit most,” she says. “Before, it was the middlemen and the companies who profited and we were left at the bottom.” “As far as we’re concerned, the Chinese are welcome,” Condor adds. “For us, it means a better quality of life, there’s work for everyone and more income for every household.”
But just as the boom looks to continue this year, Junin’s agricultural agency worries a bust may soon follow. Maca seeds have been smuggled into China, against Peruvian law, it says. “The state needs to protect the seeds and the raw material so it can’t be easily taken abroad,” says Jorge Tejeda, an agronomist working for the agency, which estimates that up to 2,000 tonnes of maca may have been smuggled out last year. “But the state is weak. As a consequence, it will be our producers and their families who will suffer in the future. Sometimes we Latin American developing nations allow this to happen. We don’t protect what’s ours.” Andres Valladolid, president of Peru’s National Commission Against Biopiracy, said it had proof that China is growing maca in Yunnan province. “Clearly, there’s biopiracy; we know this when a product is being sown outside the country of origin and there’s no access contract with anyone.” Peru is still trying to resolve its first recorded case of biopiracy – what Valladolid calls an “emblematic case”, in which US-based PureWorld Botanicals received a US patent for extract of maca compounds, dubbed MacaPure, in 2001. Peru continues to contest the patent. There were about 250 international patent applications for maca last year, more than half of them Chinese, around 20 of which are being investigated for biopiracy, Valladolid says. Peru is focusing particularly on protecting the “genetic material” of its indigenous products, he adds, successfully contesting several Chinese patents related to maca, a product unique to Peru. Official figures show Peru’s maca exports increased steadily from around $5m to $14m between 2009 and 2013; figures for 2014 have yet to be made available. Data from Peru’s agriculture ministry shows nearly 44,000 tonnes of maca were harvested in 2014, though figures may have been higher due to smuggling. Production for 2015 is expected to be higher still. “We don’t oppose the investigation and use of maca, but they must respect Peru’s rights as its place of origin,” Valladolid says. He says China should seek to legitimise its use of maca and reach a “benefit-sharing” agreement with Peru. Last year, Peru was one of more than 50 countries to ratify the Nagoya Protocol, which stipulates states’ sovereign rights over their natural resources, and stresses that the benefits arising from their use should be shared with the country providing the resources. China and the US did not adopt the protocol. Chinese demand has quadrupled the amount of land sown with maca and there are concerns that the soil could be depleted as the root rapidly uses up nutrients. Junin saw an increase from around 4,000 hectares (almost 10,000 acres) harvested in 2014 to up to 20,000 hectares sown at the end of last year for harvesting in mid-2015, Tejeda estimates. “The Chinese market demand is immense. That’s why the Chinese have come here to buy practically all they can,” Valladolid says. “It’s broken the normal trade dynamic. There will be problems of overproduction and scarcity. We don’t know where it will end.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/09/peru-maca-indigenous-root-china-biopiracy,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/09/peru-maca-indigenous-root-china-biopiracy
2015-02-09T07:00:11Z,global-development,Global development,Yaoundé's last waiting room: caring for the terminally ill in Cameroon | Marta Arias and Juanjo Pérez,"As the sun rises over Yaoundé, the medical round begins in the Pavillon St Raphael unit. Accompanied by a group of nurses, a doctor visits each of the facility’s six rooms. All are at full capacity. Before the round, the group convenes next to a poster bearing the words of Dame Cicely Saunders, the founder of the palliative care movement: “We all matter until the last minute of our lives.” This is the first and only dedicated hospital unit in Cameroon to care for terminally ill patients. Last April, when the unit opened at St Martin de Porres hospital in the Mvog Betsi neighbourhood of Yaoundé, there were only three or four patients. People didn’t seem to understand why someone would go to a hospital to die. One of the first jobs of the staff was to explain the importance of offering this kind of care. “We worked a lot to increase the awareness of palliative care among the general population,” explains Christian Tsotie, a veteran nurse who now works at the unit. “We organised conferences, we trained medical staff.” Cristina Anolín, the Dominican hospital’s medical director, said: “There was a time in the hospital where we started to receive several cancer patients rejected from other health centres in the city because, since they were terminal cases, they were seen just as timeless bed occupants. But, of course, we couldn’t say no to them, so we started to think about creating a space like this.” The unit feels cosy. Its six bedrooms, containing a total of 10 beds, are arranged around two living rooms decorated with plastic flowers and bright, colourful curtains. Such details transform a humdrum waiting room into something closer to a home. On the living-room table lies a palliative care pocket guide. A permanent fixture, everything is explained in it, from the basic principles of palliative care to its origin and evolution. Symptom control and ethical questions are also addressed. Maria picks up the guide from time to time to read aloud while she checks on her husband, Joseph, who slowly falls asleep in one of the bedrooms.
As evenings draw in, relatives lay out mattresses on the floor, supplied by the hospital, in preparation for another sleepless, watchful night. Angele takes a mattress and lays it on the floor in the living room. She watches a Mexican soap opera alongside her daughter, Anne Sophie. It’s the first time that day that Anne Sophie has left her bed. She watches the TV while eating a meal of rice and chicken. She has a tumour in her eye that is too advanced to be treated. She is only 32. Relatives say the availability of mattresses is one of the main advantages of St Raphael’s. “In the Central hospital, for example, relatives are forced to sleep outdoors under hordes of mosquitoes, so it is quite usual that visitors end up being patients themselves,” says Dominique, son of one of the patients. In the next room is Roufine, a Spanish teacher. Until last September, when illness left her bed-bound, she worked in a city high school. “When they brought me here I wasn’t able to breathe by myself and I thought I was going to die,” she says. “But look at me now. I’m no longer in pain and it’s been three weeks already.” Previously at another hospital, she was transferred to St Raphael’s on her brother’s advice. “I also love that, in here, the person comes first and then is the money,” Roufine says. The sentiment is common among patients. However, what they most appreciate is also the biggest headache for the administration. The palliative care unit has become a financial black hole. Costs are considerably cheaper at the unit. Hospitalisation rates at St Martin’s are set at about CFA 3,000 (£3.44) a day, while costs at Central hospital are roughly CFA 5,000, for example. At some hospitals there is an expectation that extra, unofficial treatment costs will creep into a patient’s bill, but not at St Martin’s. Palliative patients in the St Raphael unit pay about CFA 4,000 a day, including the costs of medicines. It’s been 20 days since Christine arrived. “I have a huge ball that puts pressure on me in the stomach, and it hurts a lot,” she says. After several operations, there is nothing left to be done. It was while in hospital for one of the operations that someone told her about St Raphael’s.
When a room becomes available in a regular hospital ward, it can be a cause for celebration, as a patient has been healed. An empty room here is synonymous with sad glances. Christine’s room is empty today. An old sheet lies carefully over the mattress, and next to the bed there’s a broken suitcase with her clothes. “When I was leaving yesterday night I had a sort of feeling,” nurse Tsotie says. “We are able to see patients’ evolution daily and hers had sped up lately, but you never get used to this kind of situation.” Tsotie’s habitual warm smile is notably absent as she talks about the erstwhile occupant of room number six. Less than a week later, there’s another occupant in the room. Life goes on.

2015-02-08T15:33:59Z,global-development,Global development,UK pledges £100m extra for Syrian refugees,"The UK has pledged a further £100m to help support Syrian refugees who have been forced from their country by almost four years of fighting. The package – intended to assist refugees and the communities hosting them in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq - was announced by the international development secretary, Justine Greening, as she visited Jordan with the Prince of Wales on Sunday.
It brings the total committed by the UK to the Syrian crisis to £800m – Britain’s largest ever response to a humanitarian emergency. As well as aiming to ease the burdens shouldered by Syria’s neighbours, the extra money will be used to provide food, medical care and relief items to some of the 3.8 million Syrians who have fled their homeland. Greening, who visited a Unicef youth centre, a World Food Programme supermarket and a school in Za’atari village, said the money was proof of the UK’s commitment to helping Syrian refugees and those looking after them. “The £100m will go towards directly supporting refugees but also to continuing our support for the so-called host communities that have been really badly affected by the crisis,” she said. “Some towns and villages have literally doubled in population so we’ve done a lot of work with governments both in Jordan and Lebanon to help the host communities cope with this influx of refugees that they’ve had to deal with.” Greening said her visit was also intended to underline Britain’s solidarity with Jordan following the “appalling” murder of Lieut Muadh al-Kasasbeh, the Jordanian pilot who was burned alive by his Islamic State captors . While in Jordan, she also announced a £4.7m programme with Care International to help more than 35,000 Syrian refugees in Jordan. The international community has been criticised for leaving Syria’s neighbours to take responsibility for the refugees. Last year, Amnesty International described the world’s response as “pitiful” and earlier this week, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants called on the EU to deliver a proper resettlement programme. François Crépeau said the union could not expect the refuges to live in Lebanon and Turkey indefinitely, adding: “If nothing else is available to them, they will take their chances with smugglers in order to provide a future for themselves and their children, as many of us would do in similar circumstances.” The UK has so far taken in 90 Syrian refugees under its vulnerable persons relocation scheme Greening defended the government’s record on the crisis, arguing that the immediate humanitarian response had to be the prime focus. “If you look at the numbers of asylum cases that we’ve accepted and also the numbers of refugees we have allowed into the UK, we are playing our role,” she said. “But there’s no denying that what we need to do overwhelmingly is help people where they are. Many of the refugees want, in time, to be able to go back to Syria and it’s right that the overwhelming focus of our support has been on providing help to people in the camps.” Syria’s civil war has killed more than 200,000 people and displaced 6.5 million within the country.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/08/uk-pledges-100m-pounds-syrian-refugees,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/feb/08/uk-pledges-100m-pounds-syrian-refugees
2015-02-07T09:00:04Z,global-development,Global development,Afghans leave Pakistan with nothing as Peshawar massacre prompts crackdown | Sune Engel Rasmussen,"For 31 years, Sabruddin enjoyed his life in Pakistan. Though he spent much of his childhood in a refugee camp after escaping war in Afghanistan, his home country, and despite being born with a damaged left hand, Sabruddin managed to carve out a good adult life for himself as a labourer. At 40, he supported a family of eight and had a neat house in the Peshawar valley. His Pakistani neighbours treated him with friendship and respect. But recently, that changed. In December, nine gunmen killed 148 people, most of them children, at a military school in Peshawar. After the massacre, Pakistanis in the country’s north-west province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa turned their anger against Afghans with whom they have lived, side by side, for decades. The school attackers were from the Pakistani Taliban, but all were foreigners and two of them Afghan. This week, police officers came to Sabruddin’s door and threatened him with prison if he did not leave Pakistan immediately. Several people in his village had already been detained. Sabruddin, being his household’s sole provider, could not afford detention. So he bundled his family and a few belongings together and set off in a rented truck. “I could see the situation heating up so I left of my own free will,” Sabruddin said. That kind of “free will” has prompted a veritable exodus. In the past month, droves of Afghans have left Pakistan to avoid harassment and imprisonment by the country’s authorities, leaving decades of life behind. Since the beginning of January, more than 22,560 Afghans have returned “spontaneously”, as it is termed by the International Organisation of Migration (IOM), which registers returning Afghans at the border and assists the most vulnerable. At the moment, more than 100 Afghan families – roughly 650 people – leave Pakistan every day as a result of harassment and threats from authorities and their communities. That is 23 times as many as in December. As of 27 January, approximately 1,500 Afghans have also been forcibly deported, more than one-third of the total number of deportees in 2014. The returning Afghans travel over the Khyber Pass through Torkham, a bustling border crossing that is one of Afghanistan’s main commercial entry points. Every day, about 500 trucks cross the border, kicking up a beige haze of dust. Men push clattering metal carts carrying burqa-clad wives and daughters through checkpoints, as innumerable families trek across in each direction to visit relatives.
Queues build up at the border bottleneck regularly, forcing returning families to wait in the relentless sun for hours, at the mercy of nature and manmade bureaucracy. While they wait, representatives from the World Health Organisation comb through trucks and vans to vaccinate toddlers against polio, a disease prevalent in Pakistan but almost eradicated in Afghanistan. Once families are back in Afghanistan, a bleak future awaits. Many have only threads to hang on to: distant relatives or a plot of land that may have been taken over. Richard Danziger, chief of mission for IOM in Afghanistan, says that most Afghans who are returning spontaneously have spent between 15 and 25 years in Pakistan, “so they have very little to come back to”. When Abdul Qader, 55, left the northern Afghan city of Kunduz, his house was half-built. That was 32 years ago, but now he has nowhere else to go. His only option is to return to a property in unknown condition, and to a plot of land that may have been claimed by somebody else. Earlier this week, he was woken up at midnight when police broke through his front gate in Gujarat, and pushed his entire family into minibuses. “During my time in Pakistan I have seen a lot of police oppression and harassment of Afghans, but at least they were respectful to the women,” Qader said. “This time, they touched the women and shoved them into vehicles.”
Pakistan is home to at least 1 million Afghans without official documents, who are exposed to the risk of sudden eviction. Another 1.7 million Afghans are registered refugees in Pakistan. The provincial government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has announced plans to expel all undocumented Afghans from the province. The authorities did the same in 2012, but backed down after international pressure. If the current pattern continues, the high volume of returning Afghans could affect cross-border relations in a predominantly Pashtun region. Strong tribal ties have historically eased settlement for Afghans in Pakistan, even if they lacked documents. But some of the returning Afghans said those ties have now become strained. “The Pakistani people were good to us. Let me give you an example: when my house burned down, Pakistanis gave clothes to my daughter,” says Gul Agha, a labourer who crossed the Torkham border on Thursday. In early January, the police in Peshawar jailed Agha for a month, until he heeded their threats and left the country. “The army and the police were always bad,” Agha says. It was the way his neighbours started treating him differently that surprised him. “After the attack, they said: ‘How can you be Muslim and kill other Muslims?’”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/07/afghans-leave-pakistan-peshawar-massacre-crackdown-khyber-pakhtunkhwa,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/07/afghans-leave-pakistan-peshawar-massacre-crackdown-khyber-pakhtunkhwa
2015-02-06T10:06:02Z,global-development,Global development,"Ending Somali-US money transfers will be devastating, Merchants Bank warned","Proposals by the last US bank specialising in money transfers to close the accounts of companies transferring cash between the US and Somalia will have a devastating effect on the millions of Somalis who rely on remittances to survive. On Friday, Merchants Bank of California is expected to close the accounts of all Somali-American money transfer companies on its books. The bank sent out letters to customers at the end of January informing them of the decision. The bank has not responded to the Guardian’s requests for comment. If it goes ahead with its decision, it would be the second time the bank has warned Somali remittance companies of pending account closures; in October 2014, the bank reversed a prior decision to close their accounts. Remittance payments to Somalia dwarf aid spending. Overseas development assistance to Somalia is $75 (£50) per capita, including both humanitarian and development aid, compared with an estimated $110 per capita in remittances entering the country, which amounts to 35% of GDP, the highest level in the world. Somalis in the US alone send more than $200m, according to Oxfam; the UK sends more than $162m, followed by Germany and the Netherlands. But regulatory pressure is throttling the life-saving inflows. Money transfer operators, which work like Western Union, but reach remote locations at a fraction of the cost, have come under scrutiny in the past few years for potentially laundering money or funding terrorism. In response, banks have been closing their accounts. In the US, the Sunrise Community Banks based in Minnesota closed all Somali-American remittance accounts in 2011, following two high-profile prosecutions of Somali-Americans in the city. A handful of banks are understood to still be operating, keeping a low profile. Keith Ellison, congressman and representative for Minneapolis, where North America’s largest Somali population lives, said the decision to close these accounts is catastrophic. “For the past few years, I have been warning every regulator and official about the devastating effects of closing the last safe and legal pipeline to provide humanitarian remittances to Somalia,” he said in a statement released by Oxfam. “There is no doubt that a decline in remittances will exacerbate the humanitarian crisis and erode the gains Somalia has made in recent years.” According to UN’s food security and nutrition analysis unit, more than 730,000 Somalis are food insecure, and an additional 2.3 million are struggling to meet basic food needs. The remittance services sector has been choked in the UK, as well. In May 2013, Barclays, the last major bank to provide remittance services to Somalia, announced plans to close the accounts of about 250 money transfer businesses, citing concerns about money laundering. In November that year, Dahabshiil won a temporary injunction against the bank at the high court to keep its account, and the lifeline for its customers, open. “Every time a bank closes, the media asks, ‘What’s the impact?’ You tell them it’s serious, but the remittances don’t stop flowing, so they don’t see the immediate impact – they think we’re exaggerating. But it’s just a slow death,” said Degan Ali, the executive director of the NGO Adeso. “It’s a complicated chain and the links keep breaking and becoming weaker.”
As a bank that specialises in remittances, and one of a few that still does business with Somali remittance companies, Merchants Bank of California is considered one of the key links in the chain. “The potential impact of the closure of the remittance industry in Somalia would be devastating,” Ali said. “The last famine is estimated to have killed 265,000 people. Triple that number would not be able to access basic needs if the remittance flows stop.” In an advisory note published on 30 January, Oxfam and Adeso called on the US government to put in place emergency measures to mitigate the negative fallout of the closures. “For example, the treasury department can announce a special, temporary regulatory regime for banks dealing with Somali money transfer organisations, or it can designate a public financial institution, such as a Federal Reserve Bank, to transfer funds abroad on behalf of [them],” it said. “Urgent action must be taken to avoid millions of Somalis losing their lifeline of remittances.” Little aid reaches the disputed Sanaag region on the border of Puntland and Somaliland, as it is deemed too unsafe for international organisations to operate there. Along with the grasslands and herds of livestock, livelihoods have all but dried up. Every month, Khadija Hassan, a 52-year old mother of four living in Badhan, walks to the Dahabshiil broker in town to collect $300 from her daughter, who works in a supermarket in Minneapolis. With that, Hassan supports a family of 12. “There is no government, there are no banks – it is all we have,” she says. Women like Hassan are deeply concerned by rumours, which have been circulating for a few years now, that Dahabshiil will one day close. “If they took Dahabshiil away, we’d have nothing,” she says. In July, heads of state and government ministers will meet in Addis Ababa to discuss how to pay for the sustainable development goals, which will replace the millennium development goals when they expire at the end of the year. One of the debates at the third international conference on financing for development will be how remittances can be formalised to support development, such as through increased transparency and competition, making use of new technologies, launching a global non-profit platform and setting a target to lower the cost of sending money.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/06/somali-us-money-transfers-merchants-bank-remittances,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/06/somali-us-money-transfers-merchants-bank-remittances
2015-02-06T07:00:05Z,global-development,Global development,"EU countries must honour foreign aid pledge, says commissioner","EU member states must finally make good on their pledge to spend 0.7% of gross national income on foreign aid as the world prepares to agree the development agenda for the next 15 years, a European commissioner has warned. Neven Mimica, the EU commissioner for international cooperation and development, said that honouring the commitment on official development assistance (ODA) would enhance Europe’s global standing and help pressure other countries into accepting their financial responsibilities. “The EU should collectively recommit to the target of spending 0.7% of gross national income on ODA,” he said. “That would actually leverage our negotiating position at the UN when encouraging other developed countries to make the same level of financial commitment. It would also engage emerging donors from upper-middle income countries to take their fair share of their commitments on implementing the new development agenda.” So far, the UK, Luxembourg, Sweden and Denmark are the only EU member states to have hit the 0.7% target, which was originally agreed in 1970. Speaking as the European commission published its plans for the post-2015 agenda, Mimica said that July’s development finance conference in Ethiopia and September’s UN meeting to agree the sustainable development goals (SDGs) would both require demonstrations of good faith and generosity. “This financial track will be the most sensitive and delicate part of the Addis Ababa meeting,” he said. “It won’t be easy to get all the developed countries – let alone the emerging donors – to take their fair share. We can succeed – but only if we as the EU and the largest donor really set an example on committing to this important financial target.” The commissioner conceded that appealing for development funding was difficult at a time of enduring global financial crisis, but said he hoped the EU would heed “the prevailing expectations of European citizens when it comes to European development solidarity”. However, despite the call for the union to honour its ODA commitment, Mimica said aid could no longer be seen as the be-all-and-end-all of development. “We do not want all our negotiating partners in the UN process to think only of the ODA part of the development agenda,” he said. “We want people to take on board the private and public contribution to the goals, as well as the mobilisation of domestic resources and revenues, and the importance of good governance. We also want people to think about the development impact of tax, trade and technology transfer.” In May, the commission announced proposals to boost the role of the private sector in development, arguing that investment could help improve sustainable agricultural production and better the lives of women, young people and the poor. Mimica said business could be “an important engine” for development progress in areas such as resource efficiency and infrastructure building. “We would like to encourage such investments through innovative financial means,” he said. “We are ready to strengthen and broaden our blending capacities, which means bringing together our grant component with the loan capacities of the public or private sector in order to leverage the financial capacity to finance infrastructure projects. We see private-sector engagement much more along the lines of major development policy goals than along the lines of pure profit.” The commissioner said the key meetings of 2015 – Addis Ababa, New York and the UN climate summit in Paris in December – represented a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reach agreement on the sustainable development agenda. Failure to act collectively and responsibly, he said, was not an option. “I would rather not speculate on what would happen if we were unsuccessful because it would be disastrous to the overall needs of the planet,” he said. “The goals and challenges in front of us are so huge that I can’t see what kind of irresponsibility could prevent the world from coming to an agreement.” Some, however, have questioned the commission’s approach to the development agenda after 2015, when the millennium development goals will be superseded by sustainable development targets.
Tove Maria Ryding, tax justice coordinator for the European Network on Debt and Development, said the latest communication lacked ambition and dodged all the difficult questions on how the SDGs would be financed. “The European commission has suggested that the EU could recommit to the target of delivering 0.7% of GNI in official development assistance within a given timeline,” she said. “While we very much welcome a renewed discussion about how and when the EU can fulfil its commitments, we don’t think that recommitting to a 40-year-old target gives the EU the right to call itself a global leader.” Ryding said poor countries had already called for developed countries to fulfil their old aid commitments, action on the debt crisis and the creation of a UN body to address the failings of the global tax system. “The developing countries have made it clear that they don’t want to be the only ones to take on new commitments, and they want a negotiation about financing for development,” she said. “Unless the EU becomes more ambitious, there is a very real risk that the international negotiations will collapse. This could cost us both the sustainable development goals, as well as the new global climate treaty, which is supposed to be agreed at the end of the year. The EU is playing a dangerous game.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/06/eu-member-states-foreign-aid-pledge-european-commissioner-neven-mimica,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/06/eu-member-states-foreign-aid-pledge-european-commissioner-neven-mimica
2015-02-06T05:00:02Z,global-development,Global development,My mother's refusal to undergo FGM has given me licence to dream | Miriam Jerotich,"I am the second generation of a family whose mother chose to shun female genital mutilation (FGM). As a nine-year old, and then again as an 18-year-old, she refused to undergo the tradition, a mandated rite of passage for girls from the Marakwet of Kenya. The Marakwet have long practised FGM to mark transition from girlhood to adulthood. Known as kapkoro, the ceremony involves cutting the clitoris, labia minora and labia majora. After undergoing the cut, nine- to 13-year-old girls remain in seclusion for a period during which older women teach them the traditions and secrets of the community. Thereafter, girls as young as 14 consider themselves adult women ready to get married and start a family. FGM has ushered them into a new social role. Our family’s abandonment came long before the global and national campaigns against FGM took root. The abandonment didn’t even begin with the missionary-driven campaigns against the practice that punctuated the colonial period in Kenya. Instead, it began when my mother dreamed of owning a car to ease her household chores. She lived on top of the hills framing the Kerio valley and had to endure day-long journeys up and down the valley collecting salt licks for her family’s cows. What’s more, she grew up as the only girl in a family of six boys, and was required to shoulder the responsibilities of sisters who were never born. “My teacher told us that there are Luo ladies who drive cars and put men in jail,” my mother said of the dream that began to take shape. “He told us that Luo women were not circumcised.” Concluding that not being cut would grant her access to education and bring her closer to owning a car, she decided that she would not undergo FGM, even though she would be forever seen as a child in the community. It didn’t faze her. Education was more important. So, when she was nine, my mother cried when she was to undergo FGM. Culturally, it’s a bad omen if someone cries before undergoing the cut, so she was left alone. My mother left home to live with her eldest brother in Kakamega, a town in western Kenya, where she was forced to trade her studies for household chores and the care of her nephews and nieces. When she was 18, her family insisted that she ought to undergo the practice. As one of the oldest girls who remained uncut, she was preventing the younger girls in her clan from transitioning to women. What may have seemed a heroic stance against circumcision was fast becoming an embarrassment for her family. In a last resort to stop their insistence, my mother embarked on a 500km journey from Nairobi to the coastal city of Mombasa, threatening her family that they would never see her again if they forced her to be cut. Afraid for her life, they relented and allowed her back home – the first uncut woman among her contemporaries.
As I grew up, I gradually came to understand the significance of my mother’s actions. She rejected circumcision in the 1970s, at a time when no one in her community had contemplated such an idea. She did not hesitate in sacrificing her own social identity and acceptance to hold on to her educational dreams. I grew up grateful for the wealth of possibilities her painful history opened up for me. I grew up eager to accord better opportunities to my own contemporaries – fellow girls whose mothers continue to subject them to the practice. Unfortunately, the rate of female circumcision among the Marakwet remains high. In many parts of the area, FGM is still considered a prerequisite for marriage and, for many girls, it also means an end to their schooling. Deeming themselves women, the girls abhor mingling with “children” in a classroom. Unlike many of these girls, I have been lucky to remain in the classroom. My mother broke away from tradition, giving me the freedom to define my femininity and cultural identity without the pressures of rooting them within a physical ceremony. I have attended school through to university without having to worry that kapkoro might cut short my dreams. My mother has given me the licence to dream. She has imbued me with the confidence of encouraging other girls to dream alternative futures that do not rely on FGM as a prerequisite. • Miriam Jerotich is a writer and researcher from Kenya working at the Africa Coordinating Center for the Abandonment of FGM/C based at the University of Nairobi",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/06/female-genital-mutilation-kenya-international-zero-day-of-tolerance-fgm,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/06/female-genital-mutilation-kenya-international-zero-day-of-tolerance-fgm
2015-02-05T14:32:57Z,global-development,Global development,How middle-income countries became fat – podcast transcript,"SB: Sarah Boseley MdeS: Moira de Swardt SR: Sandeep Ruder JKS: Jomo Kwame Sundaram TL: Tim Lobstein NC: Norma Castillo SV: Dr Salvador Villalpando ELD: Eva Lilia Delgado AC: Alejandro Calvillo CG: Cristina Gutierrez [Jingle: The Guardian] SB: Moira de Swardt works for the St John Ambulance service as an administrator. MdeS I’m vastly obese, what they call morbidly obese. And I’m really battling now with mobility issues. I don’t actually know what my weight is because I’m over the 150kg that the scale picks up. So I have no real idea of how much I weigh exactly. SB Moira has lived in Johannesburg, South Africa, all her life. MdeS I’m on the Tim Noakes diet. This is low carbohydrates and then high fat. SB Most people think obesity is a problem for countries like the USA and the UK. But the diet and lifestyles that caused the obesity epidemics in affluent nations are being exported all over the world. Middle-income countries like South Africa and Mexico now have a massive problem and it is only a matter of time before the poorest are in the same plight. Sandeep Ruder is an endocrinologist at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital. SR South Africa is a melting pot of various cultures and even economic dynamics. So the reasons would be the traditional reasons that you see in the first world, first of all, and that would relate to urbanisation, change in diet, high caloric content foods, sedentary lifestyles. And you’ve seen that with urbanisation. So people moving into cities, more office jobs, access to high calorie foods and becoming sedentary really. There’s also a bit of a perception issue. So, within a South African black culture, being overweight, or just being larger in size, is associated with a perception of health, being rich and well off. MdeS I think South Africans eat a lot of meat, really. And I don’t know that I eat more meat than other South Africans. So I think the biggest culprits are the sugars and the carbs. SR When you look at the figures, 56% of females are overweight to obese. And in that category, predominantly it’s the black females that have the highest prevalence of being overweight and obese. Whereas in the male category, it’s the other way around; so white males are the most overweight and obese of the 25% that are overweight to obese. And black males fall last into the category; whereas mixed race and others in between. So I think it’s quite a mixed dynamic. I think with the middle class in South Africa they are more aware of body weight, they do perceive overweight and obesity at an earlier stage, and studies have shown this, whereas in black patients that perception is not there; it’s underestimated. MdeS Statistically, I think we were about number four in the world, so yes, obesity is a problem in South Africa. It’s part of the fact that South Africans don’t tend to exercise in the normal course and scope of their daily life. We hop into our cars and we drive to places that in other parts of the country we would walk to. In our particular lifestyle, I think food is ubiquitous and we are very proud as South Africans of our hospitality which comes with some of the lovely traditional cakes and foods that we make in South Africa. JKS We have well over 800 million people who are hungry, who are chronically hungry. We have well over two billion people who suffer from at least one micronutrient deficiency. SB This is Jomo Kwame Sundaram. He is assistant director-general for economic and society development at the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN. JKS In the past there was simplistic assumption that overweightness and obesity have to do with what was rather callously referred to as overnutrition or overnourishment. And it was presumed that it had to do with wealth. Now we understand, and in fact, in the richer countries of the world, the ones who are more likely to be overweight and obese are likely to be those from the lower income groups. And in fact it is in the middle-income countries where the problems of obesity and related non-communicable diseases are growing fastest. SB Tim Lobstein is the director of policy and head of research programmes at the World Obesity Federation in London. TL I think unless there’s a critical famine going on, then yes, you’ll find these patterns now in Bangladesh, you’ll find them in Zimbabwe, in Zambia and so on. You’ll find these problems of undernourishment in some impoverished areas, and then excessive fats and sugars intake, particularly in urban areas and amongst those that can afford access to these processed foods. So it’s a transition from inadequate supplies, or perhaps adequate but not commercialised, to rapidly commercialised supplies. And the commercial products coming in for lower-income countries tend to be these soft drinks, fortified noodles; various products which may have some nutrients in them, but they don’t have the full range of fruits, vegetables, lean meats and so on that we’re all recommended to eat. America is no longer number one on the obesity charts. According to a study released last month by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation Mexico just inches past – pun intended – the United States as the fattest nation … SB You could argue that this might be the price of development, that as people become more affluent, their diets change. That’s certainly the case in America and the European Union. And following in their footsteps are middle-income countries like South Africa and Mexico. SB I went to Mexico a year ago to find out how it had come to have the highest levels of childhood obesity in the world, and the remarkable campaign that was fought to do something about it. In today’s programme, we hear from some of the people I spoke to for my book, The Shape We’re In. We’ll hear from those affected by obesity, the clinicians trying to help them and the campaigners trying to turn back the tide of processed food and drink in Mexican society. I’m Sarah Boseley. That’s all to come on this global development podcast from The Guardian. Norma Castillo first took her daughter to a hospital when she was eight. It was to look at marks on her skin, so she went to a dermatological ward, but they were quickly referred to a clinic that specialises in obese children. At the time, the eight-year-old Maite was 20 kilos overweight. NC [Translated] I remember that she was always robust when she was little. Well she was a little, let’s not say fat, she was filled out. I didn’t see any problem with it. But when we came here and they told me that she was 20 kilos overweight, the truth is that I got worried. I never thought it was that much. SB This is her daughter, the now 16-year-old, Maite. Maite [Translated] I feel like food is a refuge where I can forget my problems. I like sweets a lot, they lift my spirits. SB The obesity clinic Maite found herself in was run by Dr Salvador Villalpando. SV We started out probably in 1999 when we feared that there was 24% of kids between five and 11 years of age overweight or obese. And then it started trending higher in the national survey in 2006 – it was around 32%; and now we’re around 34% which is very, very worrying. We thought there would be small changes that should be done, but they didn’t work and now it’s getting a lot more complicated. Safety in the streets, you know, kids won’t go outside to play because there’s no security. Food-size portions, you know, we have very Americanised food-sized portions. SB Eva Lilia Delgado lives with her son in Ecatepec on the outskirts of Mexico City. A place that is currently badly affected by violence. ELD [Translated] You can’t let them go and play, or go to the park, because there is lots of violence and insecurity and they steal children. And I don’t have the money to buy a stationary bike, which is what I would like to do so that he gets some exercise. SV What we do here at the hospital infantile is that we try to design interventions that work for our community. You can find in medical literature that there are many designs for trials to make kids lose weight, but they don’t have that big an impact. So what we say here is that when we get to obesity we’re too late. When we have to treat obesity we’re too late. SB The results of treatment have not been encouraging. SV We’re doing as well as probably any other clinic that has to deal with kids with obesity. So we can take 18% of the obese kids down to overweight. The big problem is that when they stay at home, they’re not coming back to the clinic, we see them after six months and we only keep like 6% of the total amount of kids without obesity of that same group. That means we have 94% of failure, 94% of failure after one year of treatment. It’s a lot of failure. SB Tim Lobstein. TL We haven’t seen very successful treatment for children. We’ve seen some successful treatment for seriously obese adults, through surgery. There are some drug trials that are proving fairly successful, but this isn’t really the way to go for preventing obesity; it is a way to go if all you’re going to do is treat it. But that’s an expensive solution, particularly if you go down the surgical route, that’s hugely expensive, and not really the way we would like to see the world develop. We don’t want to see people get obese, get seriously ill and then have surgery. That isn’t the ideal situation. But there are treatment plans available to help children. They’re not necessarily very successful because children, once you’ve got their weight down, then, if you like, throw them back into a highly obesogenic environment where they’re being encouraged to overconsume again; the ads are on television – the soft drinks and fatty foods and sugary cereals are all very cheap and highly promoted and they want them. So you end up putting children back into a situation where they’re going to put weight on again. SV Yes it’s very discouraging. But still, you see, there’s a huge problem and somebody’s got to do something about it. Kids will still be coming into the clinic and we’ll have to show some interest in their achievements. You have to set your mind on that. SB David is 13. He’s about one metre fifty tall and weighs 57 kilos. He should probably weigh around 44 kilos. David [Translated] I think everyone’s exaggerating. I think it is normal. I think it is fine really. There’s nothing wrong with being a little fat. SB So can Mexico kick its addiction? Dr Villalpando. SV How do we do it? It’s a secret! No, it’s no secret. We lower the … recommended for their age. Sometimes just stopping soda, quitting out soda makes a huge difference. I can tell you about two kilos loss in one month just because of stopping soda. SB Can sugary drinks really be the cause of Mexico’s troubles? Alejandro Calvillo is a leading consumer activist from the campaign group El Poder del Consumidor. AC We have the highest consumption of soda in all the world. We have an average 153 litres per person on soda a year. This is 30% above the United States’ consumption. That is the second country in soda consumption. SB Johan is 10 years old. He was taken to the hospital with a pain in his gall bladder. His grandmother, Cristina Gutierrez, looks after him. CG [Translated] Before we drank two bottles of soda a day in the house. Bottle are three litres. SB There are lots of reasons why Mexico has such a love of soda. In rural areas where there wasn’t clean drinking water, Coke’s phenomenal distribution system ensured there was always a bottle of Coke on the table. And even in the cities, where there is clean water, people rely on soda. Dr Villalpando. SV There was some sort of issue back in 1985 in Mexico City right after the earthquake, when water pipes were broken and polluted and they started consuming bottled water. We just lost the tradition of drinking water out of the faucet. And I think it has to do with that. And in some instances there is more availability of soda all over. Back in 2009, there was a law that forbid sodas inside schools. I know it works inside the schools, but outside of school there is no limitation on that. SB Alejandro Calvillo again. AC Coke promotion is everywhere – hospitals, the schools. Now we have regulation in schools and we are trying to implement this regulation. And also a problem is that the government not do anything in campaigns and not give a guarantee of bottled water, not for schools, not for houses. We have a problem of access to bottled water. But also we don’t have any kind of programme to promote filters in houses. And at the same time that we are the highest consumer of soda, we are the highest consumer of bottled water. SB Added to this was a government seduced by big business and afraid of losing industrial growth. JKS It was a sort of a standing joke in many nutrition communities in discussing Mexico that you could not expect otherwise – a former president of a leading popular beverage company became the president of the country. One should not be too surprised to find that there are these kinds of changes. SB Jomo is talking about Vicente Fox. He was the former head of Coca-Cola in Mexico and became the country’s president in 2000. He was there for six years. SV The previous government had a very particular trend of protecting work sources and big industries like that, like Coca-Cola. I don’t know if Coca-Cola are really big, but there has been some sort of protection for these kind of industries. And you can see that happening in junk food and soda legislation for schools. There was a lot of scientists and medical societies were against having any sort of the food inside the schools. And the last call was made by the economy ministry which was very interested in not losing a large market of foods. I don’t know the food bill was around something around $4bn a year in all the schools. So they weren’t willing to lose that market. The whole act softened because of the economy ministry. AC If you look at the economy minister in Mexico and they are not fighting, they are very close to industry. The soda tax came from the minister of finance. And the other regulations, this regulation inside the schools came from a long battle from the National Institute of Public Health and the National Institute of Nutrition. And the regulation marketing also came from the battle of many years. It’s something that I think that also I never listen to the health minister talking about that we need to have more strict regulation on marketing or better labelling. They support the level in development by the industries. SB This advert, campaigning for a soda tax, has been the result of years of campaigning. The three main broadcasters in Mexico refused to show it, but cable channels and the internet got the message across. [Mexican advert] AC The soda tax began the 1st January of 2014 and the taxes are around 10% of the price and it’s in sodas or any drink that have sugars added. SB What might be surprising is the way in which the campaign came about. Tim Lobstein again. TL We’ve seen a fascinating example in Mexico where the government was fairly reluctant to take any initiatives, it was under the thrall of food companies, largely. And then in came a $10m donation from Bloomberg philanthropists to local non-governmental organisations to campaigns and advocacy groups, who campaigned vigorously on having a soft drinks tax, on having limitations on advertising of junk food on television. And thanks to that impetus, they’ve seen those changes. Whether we’ll get a change in child obesity I don’t know, but the soft drinks tax has certainly reduced the consumption of soft drinks in that country. And we’re hoping the junk food advertising bans will also have an impact there. So that’s an interesting example, because that isn’t your usual use of philanthropic money. Normally you will see it go to places like rural schools for health education development or something for young mothers or something like this. Here, it went directly to campaigning organisations campaigning on government policy issues. And I think that’s a fascinating change and an interesting development in world policies. SB But Calvillo doesn’t think the tax in Mexico goes far enough. AC We asked for a 20% tax that all the international literature and the recommendation was to have an important reduction in soda consumption you need to improve a tax of 20%. The government we asked to put this money that came from the tax for health promotion and also to introduce drinking fountains inside all the schools. But the finance minister and the government, federal government, they denied to give … to the resources for a special tax because they say that if it happens one time, this will happen all the time. And they say they are putting more money for health issues and for prevention than the money that they are having now through the tax. SB It’s not just about Big Soda. Ten companies control most of the packaged food that is exported around the world and processed food – or as one expert I spoke to calls it, “ultra-processed” food – is causing a lot of the harm. And that’s not just in Mexico – it’s everywhere. People have stopped cooking traditional meals from fresh produce, or even if they do, they supplement it with snacks, so calories have gone up massively. And there’s precious little that can be done for those who are already obese. Cristina Gutierrez is listening to Dr Villalpando’s advice, hoping her grandson, Johan, can be one of the 6% able to keep the weight off. CG [Translated] We don’t drink soda anymore. We have changed the kind of soups, the carbohydrates, we have changed the biscuits. We used to buy two boxes of biscuits a day. We eat less dairy too. SB In the face of such odds, all the real change has to come from government. And regulation of the food and drinks industries is getting the attention of health ministers in other middle-income countries. TL There are foundations and there are movements to support these sorts of approaches. I think we may see something developing in India. We may see some actions in southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where there are moves to strengthen government policies on restricting advertising to children. And across the world there are now increasing concerns about not only breast-milk formula feeding, but also complementary foods that are being sold in place of traditional weaning foods. And there is the fear that these commercialised complementary foods transfer children not from a milk-based diet to family foods, but from a milk-based diet to a taste for highly processed foods. So that’s another area that both the World Health Organisation and our organisation are concerned about. SB Is very much happening in South Africa at the moment? TL South Africa, as far as I can recall now, they have got some legislation in process to restrict advertising to children and to improve the labelling of foods. I don’t know what sort of political opposition that is meeting, because often enough a government health department will want to promote these sorts of actions, but the ministries of economics or treasury or trade start to resist them because they see there are some economic downsides to these sorts of controls on a market. SB It is sometimes difficult to pass legislation, isn’t it; soda tax legislation or any other sort because you run up against the economic arguments, particularly in developing countries. TL Well, you certainly run up against the interested industries and they put forward economic arguments saying that there will pull out and they’ll be large unemployment or whatever. But actually, if you start doing the sums about the costs in terms of lost productivity due to diabetes and obesity, or the costs to the health services, if it’s a socialised health service in any way, then there’s a social cost to high levels of ill health. Then you start setting that against the lost economic benefits, then perhaps you see a different people. And it’s well worth doing those sums because generally you come out thinking that actually doing nothing is not an option: the health crisis will cost far too much. SB In some ways, it would be a successful solution for everybody if people went back to a traditional diet, and the farmers locally could buy the food they need which has the right sort of nutrients. JKS Yes I think this has been done not only in China to some extent, you see some encouragement of local farmers for school-feeding programmes. But these are all considered to be subsidies. And there has been in recent decades a big push against the elimination of subsidies. So it’s only countries like Brazil and China, who are big enough, who have the means to do so, who have defied international pressures to eliminate such subsidies. But elsewhere in the world, you have very little support for such schemes, so as a consequence this exacerbates the problem. But to be quite realistic with the high levels of urbanisation in the world, with the big push for farmers to produce cash crops rather than food crops, it is very difficult to see this as the solution. And in other words, we really need a solution which recognises that many of these changes which have taken place in the world are almost irreversible. SB Well that’s a really terrible thing to say, isn’t it. If these changes are irreversible then we will progress to become a much more obese planet entirely, will we not? JKS Well just to give you one instance of success. I think mid last year there was a report which suggested that in the previous decade, childhood obesity in the US had gone down by 43%. Now, that is a very impressive reduction, but it began of course with very high levels of childhood obesity. So it is reversible. And I think we should be looking towards these kinds of gains rather than in trying to reverse-organisation which is unlikely to take place, or to try to force farmers to produce food crops which might actually result in much lower incomes for them. So we need to begin to find other ways. We have health warnings on smoking, there’s absolutely no reason why we cannot have health warnings on certain types of foods, if not to prohibit such foods. AC We need to have a more strong regulation on marketing to children, not only some hours, some programmes on TV, we need to cover all TV and we need to cover internet, we need to cover point of sale. These products now in the supermarkets it’s the signs on the box of the cereals and all of these things we need to improve this regulation. TL The World Health Organisation has moved its agenda significantly from the focus on under nutrition to a dual focus now on ensuring adequate nutrition, but also preventing the development of non-communicable diseases, particularly heart disease, cancers, diabetes and so on, that are largely a result of this excess consumption of processed foods. SR And I think we’re sitting on a ticking time bomb here, because it’s a very silent epidemic and you see the consequences much later. We’re now starting to see the consequences of childhood obesity later in life. So if you’ve got a large proportion of your population that are overweight at a young age, you’re going to see the consequences of that 20/30 years down the line. TL I think obesity is here to stay as a huge issue because it’s the cause of so many other health problems, be it heart disease or diabetes or some cancers and orthopaedic problems and so on. You get a whole range of issues that are a result of obesity and which cause people to feel unwell, to get back ache, to not do their jobs so well, to lose their incomes. And these are problems for individuals, problems for families in lost income. And particularly in developing economies, you just can’t afford to have an ill labour force. And if people are moving from undernourishment to excess obesity, you’re not helping that country to grow its economy and be a healthy, thriving country. SB Losing weight long term is incredibly hard, as anyone who has ever tried to diet will know. What we need to do is prevent people becoming obese and suffering serious health problems in the first place. There is a lot to do, but top of the agenda, we have to tackle the availability of junk food and drink in every country.

2015-02-05T10:54:16Z,global-development,Global development,"Mexico's street art tells stories of grief, anger and resistance | Sam Jones","Nine years ago, as its streets filled with flames, anger and water cannon, the walls of Oaxaca began to speak. Stencilled commentaries – here a defiant fist clutching a pencil, there a hooded figure lobbing a Molotov cocktail or, more subversively, a book – appeared on buildings in the southern Mexican city as popular fury exploded over the state governor’s heavy-handed response to a pay-and-conditions strike by local teachers. Their creators were Rosario Martínez and Roberto Vega, two young graphic designers who felt the time had come to move past T-shirt slogans and flyers. With Facebook walls yet to achieve their full revolutionary potential, the pair opted to use the real thing instead. “Stencils are harder to remove,” Martínez says. “And painting a wall red says more than a little poster can – it’s like people said at the time, ‘It’s a shout painted on a wall.’” Although Martínez and Vega’s Lapiztola collective – a pun on the Spanish words for pencil and pistol – was born on the streets of their home town, its work has spread far beyond Oaxaca and the upheavals of 2006. In recent years, Lapiztola has used artworks to highlight everything from the cult of the drug lords and the use of genetically modified corn to the plight of Central American migrants and the enduring grief of the mothers who have waited decades to bury the bodies of their disappeared children.
Some are as dark as they are blunt: one shows bloody and terrified men in suits screaming as the many-tentacled beast of the drug trade descends on them; in El pastel (the cake), dozens of paper doilies decorated with limbless torsos and severed heads illustrate the way in which rival drug cartels have divided up the country.
“They didn’t care what belonged to whom, and that’s when the heads began to turn up and become so commonplace,” Martínez says. After the Zetas gang began murdering people in bars as a punishment for non-payment of protection money, many locked themselves in their homes, too scared to go out. Lapiztola responded with an installation showing birds flying from a cage and heading for the freedom of the window as a forlorn boy looks on.
Similar defiance is evident in the piece that shows an angry young face surrounded by petals, and takes its title from a line by the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda: “They can pull up all the flowers but they’ll never stop the spring.” Other murals focus on the musicians who are richly rewarded for composing the narcocorridos, or drug ballads, that glorify the violent deeds of the gangs. In one, an accordion player squeezes a tune out of his instrument while a flock of doves attacks a cartel member.
Others are more playful. Plan de vuelo (Flight plan), which chronicles the northward journey undertaken by tens of thousands of Central and South Americans, shows a figure in a lucha libre mask riding an enormous bird.
One mural, painted on the shutters of a shop in Tijuana, requires a little more explanation. It features a man with a brush scrubbing the stripes off what appears to be a zebra. However, as Vega explains, the animal is in fact a donkey painted to look like a zebra; a “zonkey”.
Once upon a time, US visitors would flock over the border to Tijuana to drink, gamble and indulge in pleasures frowned upon by the law at home. Tijuana developed on the back of such trade and, when the visitors noticed that some of the donkeys they’d posed with for photos were too pale to show up well on film, enterprising locals obliged them by painting their animals to resemble crisply photogenic zebras. The violence of recent years, however, has scared most of the tourists away from Tijuana. “Now the city has no tourists, people are trying to reclaim their identities and their city, so that’s why he’s washing the stripes off the donkey,” Vega says. “He’s saying, ‘You’re a donkey and not a zebra.’” Vega and Martínez, who are in London for the opening of an exhibition of Lapiztola’s work and to speak at a conference organised by the campaigning group Global Justice Now, hope their murals and installations will give people a better idea of today’s social and political situation in Mexico.
One mural – El abrazo ausente (The absent embrace) – has an appalling contemporary resonance. In it, a mother still waiting for news of a son who vanished during the violence of the late 1960s and 1970s hugs a dark silhouette composed, once again, of a flock of doves. “It was bad enough for the mothers of the students who were killed, but I think it’s worse for the mothers of those who were disappeared; their suffering is unending,” Vega says. Four decades on, Martínez says, many mothers have been left to clutch at straws and shadows. “They’re still waiting for news: they say, ‘He may be dead, but there’s no body so I can’t mourn him. He could still be alive.’” The parallels with the 43 student teachers who vanished in the town of Iguala last September are inescapable, as is the growing fury in Mexico. “When they started looking for the missing students, they found loads of mass graves,” Vega says. “Forty-three people disappeared and when they went looking for them, they found 50 other bodies, then another 10. Whose bodies are they?” • Lapiztola’s exhibition, Democracia Real Ya!, is at Rich Mix in east London from 5-28 February",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/05/mexico-oaxaca-murals-lapiztola-street-art-murals,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/05/mexico-oaxaca-murals-lapiztola-street-art-murals
2015-02-05T05:00:06Z,global-development,Global development,India's rural employment programme is dying a death of funding cuts | Jayati Ghosh,"Ten years ago this week, the Indian parliament unanimously passed the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). It was a historic legislation based on two interlinked goals: ensuring livelihood security to rural residents by providing at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work; and using the programme to mobilise existing surplus labour in the countryside, to unleash productive forces and generate more economic growth in rural areas. The treatment of employment as a right of citizens that must be delivered by the state involved a crucial reversal of the underlying basis of public delivery in India, which has mostly been driven by a paternalistic view of the state as delivering “gifts” to the people. Obviously, such a major transformation was never going to be easy, and there have been concerns about corruption and unevenness in implementation across states. Even so, the programme has had several tangible positive effects (pdf): increasing rural wages and reducing gender wage gaps; smoothing and stabilising consumption by poor people; enabling better access to nutrition, health and education; increasing financial inclusion because of payments through bank accounts; and reducing distress migration. In some places it has helped to improve rural connectivity and agricultural productivity by creating more sustainable forms of irrigation and production. It has also served as a built-in stabiliser of the economy during downturns.
Marking a decade of such an effective law would normally be cause for celebration. Unfortunately, not. This is now a programme that could be dying. The peak period for the programme was the fiscal year 2009-10, when more than 2.8bn days of employment were provided to members of 54m rural households. Even at its peak, total spending on the programme amounted to only 0.8% of GDP, making it probably the most efficient employment programme ever. But since 2010, the programme has declined in terms of financial outlay and employment generated. Some states (such as Tripura) have continued to show improvement, but this has been against the odds, and possibly only because of a determined state government. Essentially, central government has been slowly trying to kill this programme by starving it of essential funds. The cynical process was started by the very Congress-led government that put the law into force, but it has intensified under the government of Narendra Modi. This has been done by putting an effective cap on the amount of money central government provides to state governments for running the programme. Since the rural employment guarantee is meant to be demand-driven, with jobs being offered to all rural households who ask for it, the idea of a cap is in principle absurd – and in any case it is prohibited in the act itself. Even more absurdly, central government’s budgetary allocation is only about half of the Ministry of Rural Development’s own estimates of the “approved person days as per the labour budget”. This means that funds released to states have been rationed to the point that state governments have been unable to pay wages and have large and growing arrears. A further sleight of hand by the central government is simply to push the excess of actual spending over outlay into the next year’s spending, thereby reducing the next year’s outlay even more. In the current year, the budgetary outlay amounts to only 0.25% of GDP after taking into account the arrears from the previous year.
As a result, payments to workers have been delayed – the current official estimate is that nearly three-quarters of wage payments are held up, sometimes by as much as a year or more. Obviously, workers get disheartened and reduce their demand for work even when they need it; in other cases, the state and local authorities try to dissuade them or do not register their demand because they do not have the funds to provide the required work. State governments that do try to meet their obligations have been forced to do so by using other funds; at least five states have written increasingly desperate letters to central government demanding the release of funds, and three state assemblies have passed resolutions opposing dilution of the act and demanding an increase in funding. All this, so far, has been to no avail. Instead, central government seems happy to have reined in this expenditure and thereby reduced rural workers’ bargaining power and standards of living. The government’s mid-year review of the economy (pdf) in December states gleefully that “a dramatic change seems to have happened to rural labour markets since 2012 because wage growth has plunged. A combination of softness in the economy and reductions in MGNREGA expenditures (declines of 3 and 36% in the last two years) have played a key role. If these trends continue, rural wage growth can continue to decelerate, further moderating inflationary pressures.” The MGNREGA came into being not because of a benevolent government, but because of pressure from social movements and rural workers. Much more pressure will be needed now to save it.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/05/india-rural-employment-funding-cuts-mgnrega,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/05/india-rural-employment-funding-cuts-mgnrega
2015-02-04T12:35:16Z,global-development,Global development,Chance reunion in Calais brings home scale of migration from Eritrea | Clár Ní Chonghaile,"On a cold January day, Feruz Werede travelled from her home in London to Calais to learn more about the thousands of young people who are risking their lives to flee the country of her birth, Eritrea.
Feruz, an activist who campaigns to end rights abuses in Eritrea, wanted to interview migrants for a radio station that broadcasts by satellite to the Horn of Africa country. She expected to hear about the “never-ending national service” and to collect material for a Stop Slavery in Eritrea campaign against conscription. What she did not expect was a surreal, early-morning reunion with a high-school classmate. It was a chance meeting that highlighted her own good fortune and the scale of the exodus from a country once viewed as a poster child for liberty but now dubbed “the North Korea of Africa” because of its repressive one-party rule, arbitrary detentions and killings, and lack of an independent press. A former Italian colony, Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a 30-year guerrilla war. But fighting broke out again between the two countries in 1998-2000. Estimates of the number of lives lost in the conflict vary from 80,000 to 100,000. Since then, Eritrea has existed in a precarious state of “no peace, no war” beside its bigger neighbour. It is this relationship that defines President Isaias Afewerki’s rule. Feruz’s parents were fighters during the war against Ethiopia. After independence, they joined the government but became critical of the authorities and eventually had to flee. Feruz left with her mother and arrived in the UK on Christmas Eve 2001. She was granted asylum, finished her studies and built a new life. But she has never forgotten her home country and spends her free time campaigning to bring about change. On her recent visit to Calais, Feruz arrived on a freezing Sunday evening but was told that most migrants in the sprawl of tents known as the jungle were getting ready for their nightly attempts to sneak on to lorries to cross the the Channel. She returned the next morning at 7am, but people were sleeping, exhausted after another cold night watching and waiting for an elusive chance to complete the last leg of their complex, life-defining journeys.
Eventually, Feruz was approached by a young man, who recognised her as Eritrean and addressed her in Tigrinya. She described the encounter: “He said, ‘I saw you earlier. How are you?’ We exchanged pleasantries, and we started talking. He could tell I was from Asmara, the capital city, so he started asking me, ‘Which part of the city did you live in? Is it Geza-Manda or Gejeret?’ I said, ‘It’s Geza-Manda, but it’s been years and I can’t remember exactly where.’ “While he was talking, he mentioned my high school, and I just stood there and said, ‘You went to Santa Ana? I can’t believe it. Which year did you go?’ He said from 1996 to 2000. And I said, ‘But I was there from that time!’ It ends up that we were in the same class in year nine. “We went back and forth about our lives in high school and he started mentioning all the people that I know. He was telling me, ‘This person is my friend,’ and I said, ‘But he’s my friend, I still have contact.’ I took out my phone and I started showing him on Facebook.” Feruz’s new-old friend joked that she had been “one of the cool girls” in school and had never paid any attention to him and his friends. “We spent hours talking,” Feruz said. “He told me so many people’s names, how they died crossing the border, the people we saw every day, about how some of them didn’t make it in the Mediterranean sea, even including Lampedusa, because we lost some of our schoolmates there.”
Eritreans make up a large proportion of the illegal migrants arriving in southern Europe each year. The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, says the number of Eritrean asylum seekers rose threefold to nearly 37,000 over the first 10 months of 2014. Last October, the UN’s special rapporteur on human rights in Eritrea said human rights abuses were forcing 2,000-3,000 people to flee each month. Those alleged abuses include extrajudicial killings, disappearances, extended incommunicado detention, torture, indefinite national service, and lack of freedom of expression, assembly, religious belief and movement, the UN said. It is the indefinite national service, or what she calls slavery, that most concerns Feruz, and it is why her two former classmates left Eritrea. “Imagine, our generation in Eritrea – it is vanishing,” Feruz said. “If these kinds of stories can come out of one class, what can come out of one neighbourhood? What could come out of one town, one village and ultimately the entire country? My class consisted of about 40-something students … A few of the girls who were with me are married and have kids in Eritrea, but most left, or died trying to leave.” As Feruz chatted to her classmate, another man walked up. “How are you, Feruz?” he asked. He too had been in her class, and had recognised her. As the men told Feruz why they had left, she could not help but compare her story with theirs. “I had mixed feelings,” Feruz said. “Obviously, I did feel privileged. I finished university here [in the UK], I achieved something, I’m working, I have a life, I have children. Whereas my friends in Calais, even if they could settle right this moment, they will still feel they haven’t achieved what they should have achieved in their 30s. “It’s quite depressing and liberating at the same time, finding someone 15-16 years later. They probably had the same aspirations as I had, and to see them in Calais, it just broke me. I was emotional for a few days afterwards. “All this time that I was here making my life comfortable, they had been in the mountains of Eritrea, defending a mountain, basically. One of them told me he was found trying to escape. He was caught at the border and put in prison for four years. It’s the never-ending national service which is straight-out slavery in my eyes, and in their eyes: not being able to support your family, not being able to live. There are no prospects for them, and they tolerated it for eight, nine years but they can’t, they just can’t.” All Eritreans aged between 18 and 40 are obliged to do national service, which is meant to last 18 months. In practice, the term tends to be indefinite. According to a report presented to the UN by the special rapporteur last May, conscripts can be ordered to work on farms or construction sites as part of the government’s “development programmes”. Trying to dodge national service is perilous: the military police routinely carry out roundups, known as giffas, to catch anyone, including minors, escaping from conscription. “Opposing such a roundup can lead to on-the-spot execution, as deadly force is permitted against those resisting or attempting to flee,” the report said.
Life as a conscript is harsh. “The salary and allowances for dependants during the national service is so low that recruits are unable to fend for themselves or support their families,” the report said. “Living conditions are harsh, food rations are inadequate, there is a lack of medicines and trained medical personnel, while the paltry remuneration stops many young people from even contemplating marriage, and a long-term future.” The report concluded: “Since the length of national service in Eritrea is of an indefinite nature, it effectively constitutes forced labour.” This is what Feruz’s friends were fleeing. Once out of Eritrea, they travelled through Sudan, heading for Libya and the often deadly boats that ferry thousands of migrants from the shores of Africa. Even if they do survive the callous crews and the dangerous waves, they face new challenges as they seek to rebuild their lives and become something other than “refugees”.
“We Eritreans almost feel like we have no identity at the moment. Every single ounce of our pride, which is our country – and we are very patriotic people – is being stripped away,” Feruz explained. “When you leave the country, you are automatically a traitor to the regime, and you are an asylum seeker in your next destination. To be somewhere in between – can you imagine? – you have no identity. These people feel they have no identity, they have to seek that identity, and that identity is across the English Channel for them.” Despite her own history as an asylum seeker more than a decade ago, Feruz was appalled by living conditions in Calais’s jungle. “It was shocking. I couldn’t speak for half an hour. But when you speak to them, it’s almost normal. That’s the first vibe you get because these people have seen the Sahara desert, the Mediterranean. They’ve been chased by human traffickers who want to sell them to the Bedouin. They have seen the most horrific ordeals. Now, they are relatively safe because they are not bothered by people wanting to use them. The only thing that is difficult for them at the moment is the cold weather and, obviously, they are not settled. Apart from that, they’ve moved on from the worst things. The fact that they are still chasing their dream makes it worthwhile. “I spoke to one guy and I said, ‘How do you guys live here?’ He said, ‘Oh but Feruz, you come from a warm bed, you come from a warm house, you can eat any time. Of course, this is going to shock you. For us, where we come from, this is something we are used to.’ In a way, they have to be very positive to survive day by day. They have to crack jokes, they have to be able to laugh and bring that positive vibe. “When you speak to them in the night, they keep looking at the port, towards the ferries, and they say, ‘Our dream is just 43 minutes away by train.’ For someone who has come this close, they will keep trying.”
The British government often asserts that immigrants are drawn to the UK because of unemployment and housing benefits. Although migrants settle in many European countries, the concentration of people in Calais suggests Britain holds a special attraction. Some migrants cite the language, some their perception of a free society, while others are drawn by the relatively strong economy and the prospects for employment. “There are opportunities [in the UK],” Feruz said. “You can take opportunities and become somebody. But although I had a vision of finishing my education and supporting myself, when I first got here and walked into the Home Office – the feeling I felt when asking for asylum …” Her voice trailed off. “I know how unwelcoming the country can be, but they [other migrants] don’t. They want to go to a country where there are better opportunities, and they want to work and support their hungry families back home. Benefits and housing and this and that, whatever this country can offer – they don’t even know about that. “I called them [her classmates] a few days ago, and I said, ‘Did you make it?’ and they said, ‘No, no, we are still here.’ I said I was calling from work, and they said, ‘Oh you’re so lucky, so how much do they pay you? What’s the minimum wage?’ They want to know about the minimum wage! That means they want to work.” Feruz believes that governments can and should do more to address this growing crisis, but they should start at the source of the problem, instead of seeking to deal with the symptoms. “I always feel the world can do more,” Feruz said. “Not necessarily the UK or France or any particular European country, but the world can do more to solve issues for any migrants who are trying to flee dictatorship. One is to listen to the people and try to find the root cause of the issue. The actual disease has to be addressed and that is the dictatorship back home that is pushing every single able-bodied person out of the country.” In a debate in the House of Lords in January, Baroness Eluned Morgan, the Labour party spokeswoman on foreign affairs in the upper house, described the situation in Eritrea as “truly catastrophic”. “This is what people don’t understand,” Feruz said, “and it took me going to Calais to understand: for us, it’s very difficult to comprehend someone staying out there in the cold weather, but for them, if it means, even a year later, getting to where they plan to get to, that’s nothing.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/04/eritrea-migration-chance-reunion-calais-human-rights,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/04/eritrea-migration-chance-reunion-calais-human-rights
2015-02-04T11:40:42Z,global-development,Global development,"African Union must release South Sudan report, rights groups say","The African Union (AU) has left victims in the lurch by shelving a report into massacres, rapes and other crimes carried out during South Sudan’s civil war, human rights groups say, urging the body to immediately publish the findings. The AU’s commission of inquiry on South Sudan, headed by former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo, was expected to brief the body’s peace and security council (PSC) at a meeting in Addis Ababa last week, but the PSC decided to defer the commission’s report indefinitely, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said. The AU has compromised its commitment to justice for serious crimes and cast doubt on its engagement with its own – and the first of its kind – commission of inquiry, HRW said. “The people and partners of South Sudan have been waiting for the AU report to help bring justice for the grave crimes of the past year,” said Daniel Bekele, Africa director at HRW. “By shelving the report, the AU has left the people of South Sudan in the lurch.” The commission was set up in March to investigate the civil war, which erupted in December 2013, destroying hopes of a fresh start in the world’s newest nation. The fighting has cost at least 10,000 lives, and been marked by atrocities including rape, massacres of civilians and killings based on ethnicity.
On Monday, South Sudan’s President, Salva Kiir, and rebel commander and former vice-president Riek Machar signed yet another ceasefire agreement, meant to bring them closer to a comprehensive peace deal that would lay out the details of a power-sharing interim government. The agreement was reached in Addis Ababa, where talks were being held under the aegis of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (Igad), the regional body overseeing negotiations. HRW said Machar and Kiir agreed to end fighting by 5 March and form a transitional government. Igad has said it will punish those who violate the agreement, but previous ceasefires have been repeatedly breached. The conflict started when Kiir accused Machar of plotting a coup. In the fighting that followed, Machar drew support mainly from the Nuer group to which he belongs, while many Dinkas backed Kiir. About 1.5 million people in the oil-producing but poor country have been forced to flee their homes. In a report last August, HRW said both sides had committed “extraordinary acts of cruelty” that amounted to war crimes and potentially crimes against humanity. It said serious crimes against both Nuer and Dinka communities during Sudan’s 1983-2005 civil war, before South Sudan gained independence in 2011, were never addressed, creating conditions for the latest conflict. The concern now is that a similar failure to address these latest abuses could sow the seeds of future violence. On Friday, Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe took over as chair of the AU, and said the union needed to work harder to achieve sustainable peace on the continent. HRW said some AU officials appeared reluctant to consider the report because they believed it could upset the peace talks. “The risks of trading away justice are significant – lack of accountability can embolden people to commit further crimes and undermine respect for the rule of law,” HRW said. David K Deng, research director for the South Sudan Law Society (SSLS), wrote in an article for African Arguments that consideration of the report at the Addis Ababa meeting was deferred because of fears that it would jeopardise the peace process.
“Both Igad and the warring parties have emphasised repeatedly that people responsible for atrocities will not be permitted to serve in the transitional government,” he wrote. “To say in one breath that people responsible for atrocities will not be allowed to serve in government and in the next that people suspected of having committed atrocities cannot be named for fear of undermining the peace process demonstrates a troubling lack of consistency on Igad’s part,” he added. Amnesty International and South Sudanese civil society groups have also urged the AU to publish the report. “Not only is justice a right of victims, accountability could serve as a powerful deterrent to those who think they can kill, rape and pillage with no consequence,” said Netsanet Belay, Amnesty’s Africa director for research and advocacy. Amnesty and the other groups said the AU should consider setting up a hybrid court to allow South Sudanese and specially trained foreign investigators and judges to continue the investigations carried out by the five-member commission of inquiry and to try those suspected of crimes. “Given the pervasive weaknesses in the administration of justice in South Sudan, credible and independent investigations and prosecutions will require robust international involvement,” said Drissa Traoré, vice-president of FIDH, the International Federation for Human Rights. Several civil society organisations in South Sudan, including the SSLS, have signed a petition calling for the report to be published. “Since the outbreak of violence … despite the announcement of several government investigations into abuses, not a single person has been held accountable for the tens of thousands of civilian deaths, rampant sexual violence and recruitment of children by parties to the conflict,” the petition said. “Many South Sudanese provided information to the commission of inquiry at great personal risk, and to withhold the final report would be a great disservice to them.” HRW’s Bekele said South Sudanese people believed justice could help end cycles of violence. “The AU has taken precious time and resources to document the crimes and make recommendations on accountability. But this effort can do little good if it does not see the light of day,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/04/african-union-report-south-sudan-delayed,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/04/african-union-report-south-sudan-delayed
2015-02-04T07:00:10Z,global-development,Global development,It's not just Greece and Spain that need their debt restructuring | Jonathan Glennie,"As the news of Syriza’s victory in Greece sinks in, the question dominating the headlines is how it will renegotiate the country’s massive debt, close to twice the size of its GDP. All the signs are that the incoming government is going to renege on previous commitments to austerity, agreed with/imposed by creditors, refuse to pay its debts in the timeline agreed and, consequently, end the cycle of public spending cuts that stricter repayment has required. And Greece is not the only headache for creditors, with concerns already being raised about the impact of the country’s tough stance further afield. If Greece can go down this route, why not Spain, a far bigger economy? Podemos, the Spanish equivalent of Syriza, is the country’s most popular party, according to polls, and it is committed to following Syriza’s lead. But why stop at Spain? It is, perhaps, natural that European commentaries focus on regional problems, but the impossible situation faced by Greece, and the hard choices it implies, is precisely comparable to similar situations in far poorer countries going back decades, and still continuing today. The sacrifices being paid by Greek people are extreme for a European context, but nothing compared with the chronic shortages and poor service provision which the citizenry of poorer countries suffer, in part as a consequence of paying debts which are both unpayable and unfair. After years of battles with creditors, governments of poor countries and campaigners finally won massive debt relief at the turn of the century as part of the heavily indebted poor country initiative and follow-up actions. But despite substantial write-downs in the countries worst affected by unsustainable repayments, debt remains a major problem. An analysis published last year by the Overseas Development Institute warned of the possibility of debt crises in some of the world’s poorest countries, due to a combination of factors, not least decent economic growth, which is encouraging countries like Ghana and Senegal to take on more debt without necessarily being in shape to respond if the currently sound context turns rough. Meanwhile, the Jubilee Debt Campaign has highlighted the debts still being paid by the countries ravaged by Ebola, with Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia owing more than $480m (£318m) to the IMF alone, and still repaying millions of dollars at the height of the crisis. The self-serving arguments proffered by creditors against debt relief for the poorest countries have been similar to those doing the rounds in the Greek context. Some take the moral high ground, insisting simply that debts should be paid in full (described by Martin Wolf as “the attitude that sustained debtors’ prisons”). Others suggest that countries benefiting from debt cancellation will find it hard to borrow in the future; perhaps not a major concern when you are bleeding money and your citizens are starving. It’s also disproven by history – lenders will lend where there is interest to be made and, as the Economist has noted in the context of Argentina, “capital markets appear to have a remarkably short memory.” Podemos has promised that if it wins power in Spain it will lead a debt audit as part of its attempt to reduce repayments. This would be a first, as far as I am aware, for a western country, but the idea has been long in the offing, and some countries have already implemented it, notably Ecuador.
These audits sift through the debts racked up and determine which of them was fairly taken on and should therefore be repaid, and which were unfair, either because there was corruption involved or because due diligence was poorly performed in some other way by the lender. The public should not suffer, according to the logic of debt audits, because of the mistakes of a handful of politicians and bankers not even acting in the public interest. It is a powerful argument. This is not just a matter of left and right. The need for a “fair debt workout procedure” (pdf), in which the public good is weighed more seriously in the balance against the supposed laws of the market, is a long-standing item in global financial discussions and visionary UN outcome documents. In fact, the nearest the world got to something more sensible than ad hoc high-stakes battles played out in the media as much as in boardrooms was a proposal by Anne Krueger, then a key figure at the exceptionally non-radical IMF, for a new approach to sovereign debt. But it was blocked. A recent vote, last year, mandating the UN to begin work on a sovereign-debt restructuring mechanism was backed by the vast majority of member states. Sadly, the only 11 countries to oppose it reads like a roll call of the traditionally powerful financial players, including Germany, Japan, the US and the UK.Because of the resistance of these powerful countries, little progress has so far been made on this seminal issue, despite expert agreement across the board that such progress is needed. That Europeans have finally been hit hard by the politics of austerity and debt repayments at all cost is regrettable, but it could have positive consequences if they wake up to the need to change things globally. Perhaps this Greek crisis will spur the world into action, now that Europeans not just Africans, Latin Americans and Asians are under the cosh. Debt restructuring is on the agenda of a conference on the future of global finance for development (pdf) in Addis Ababa in July. It could be the setting to finally turn words into action, for the benefit of people everywhere, Europeans included.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/04/greece-spain-debt-restructuring,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/04/greece-spain-debt-restructuring
2015-02-03T15:28:33Z,global-development,Global development,Afghan women protest at absence of female ministers in new cabinet,"Dozens of women marched in the streets of Kabul on Tuesday, protesting against what they see as exclusion from political decision-making by the country’s new leaders. The protesters, who gathered in front of the ministry of women’s affairs, complained that in the process of forming a government, President Ashraf Ghani is reneging on campaign promises to ensure female participation. During his campaign, Ghani promised to nominate at least four female ministers. However, when Ghani and his chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, unveiled their initial list of cabinet nominees three weeks ago, it contained only three women. After parliament had scrutinised the list and put it to a vote last week, none remained. Only a minority of the nominees were approved, and Ghani and Abdullah now have to present a new batch of 17 candidates, a process activists are seeking to influence. They would like to see Ghani aim much higher than three female ministers. In the recent election, women constituted 38% of the voters, said Samira Hamidi, an activist from Afghan Women’s Network who was one of approximately 70 protesters in front of the ministry. “So we should be given 38% of the cabinet, which is nine ministers,” she said. Early in his presidency, Ghani signalled that political inclusion of women was a top priority. At his inauguration, the president spoke with affection of his wife, Rula Ghani, not only as a mother, sister and wife, but also as someone who would come to hold political influence. Rula Ghani has since been put in charge of an office at the palace that advises the government on internally displaced people. However, the authority bestowed on the first lady has failed to trickle down. As the cumbersome post-election process has wobbled along, hopes among women’s activists have withered. “Ghani did not fulfil his promises. His ambitious statements are not taking us anywhere,” Hamidi said. Though Ghani promised voters that his government would be based on merit and fair representation of gender and ethnicity, he has since come to realise that nothing comes easy in Afghan politics. “Whatever claims he made – ‘I will make this in one month, I will make this in two weeks’ – were too ambitious,” Hamidi said. For one, Ghani does not wield unilateral power. With the power-sharing agreement he cut with Abdullah, his election rival, authority to appoint ministers is effectively shared between two people, both of whom have support bases to appease. Old power brokers and new campaign-trail loyalists all scramble to get a seat at the government’s table, making it difficult for new figures to emerge. “There are lots of qualified women, but they have not been considered because they are not affiliated with any of the political groups who are in power now,” said Aziz Rafiee, a male protestor in the demonstrations. “The political will for support of participation of women doesn’t exist,” said Rafiee, who heads the Afghan Civil Society Forum. “That is very clear.” Among the women nominated for the new government is Najiba Ayubi, an acclaimed journalist known among women’s rights activists, who was picked to run the ministry of women’s affairs. However, Ayubi was temporarily withdrawn from the cabinet list, due to uncertainty about her university degree. The two other female nominees, Ai Sultan Khairi and Khatera Afghan, are almost entirely unknown, even among women’s rights proponents. Khairi’s nomination never made it to the floor, as she was accused of forging her identification papers. Afghan was resoundingly rejected, receiving the least approval votes of all the nominees. Activists suspect that Ghani and Abdullah purposely put forward flawed female nominees knowing they would fail. “Why they have done this is something we have to question,” Rafiee said. Others, like Hamidi, speculate more bluntly. She points out that a strong presence of women in the cabinet could jeopardise peace talks with the Taliban, which the government is actively pursuing. As a response to the parliamentary vote, women’s rights groups have drawn up a list of 21 women who meet the criteria of age, educational level and skill to make minister. They have delivered the list to Ghani and Abdullah’s teams, and shared it on social media. With this list, activists hope to counter claims that there are no Afghan women fit to govern. “We are not in 2001 anymore,” Hamidi said, referring to the last year of Taliban rule. “But even after one decade, rights that should be handed to us are not recognised. We still have to go to the street to take them.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/03/afghan-women-protest-absence-female-ministers-new-cabinet,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/03/afghan-women-protest-absence-female-ministers-new-cabinet

2015-02-03T07:00:00Z,global-development,Global development,The best books on Angola: start your reading here | Pushpinder Khaneka,"Rainy Season by José Eduardo Agualusa, translated by Daniel Hahn Agualusa’s novel, ostensibly about the life of Angolan poet and activist Lidía do Carmo Ferreira – who mysteriously vanished in Luanda in 1992 – depicts his country’s tortured history in the second half of the 20th century. Independence in 1975, after a long anti-colonial struggle against Portugal, brings cause for celebration but also marks the beginning of three decades of civil war. Agualusa entwines fact and fiction to introduce a host of characters whose lives interconnect, and the story flits between the colonial era, the civil war and the present. But he never loses control of his tangled web of a tale, told mostly by a journalist investigating the disappearance of Carmo Ferreira. Rivalry between the anti-colonial groups and factionalism within the ruling People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) spiral into chaos and violence. Intellectuals and artists are caught up in the internecine struggle, which devastates the country and brings new horrors as rebels and dissidents are jailed, tortured and killed. The urgent, lyrical prose brings home the torment and disillusionment as the Angolan revolution feeds on its protagonists and destroys their idealism. Haunting, anguished and sometimes harrowing, Rainy Season is both intellectually and emotionally absorbing. Journalist and writer Agualusa, who was born in Huambo, divides his time between Angola and Portugal. The Return of the Water Spirit by Pepetela, translated by Luís R Mitras Pepetela’s political fable is a stinging critique of corruption in post-colonial Angola. It’s set during the late 1980s and early 1990s as the socialist MPLA government embraces capitalism and the disgruntled Unita opposition rekindles the civil war. Carmina Evangelista, an energetic and ambitious ruling party member – and once-fanatical leftwinger – switches seamlessly from Marx to market forces, and makes a fortune supplying arms to the government. Her lazy, obsequious husband, João, consumed with playing computer games, rarely bothers to turn up for work as a government employee. Meanwhile, the buildings in the capital’s central Kinaxixi Square are mysteriously crumbling – a phenomenon dubbed “Luanda Syndrome” – baffling engineers and scientists. Is it God’s punishment for a degenerate society, sabotage by the Americans, or the water spirit, Kianda, reclaiming the land for the lagoon it once was? The only glimmer of hope comes from the grassroots “naked movement”, led by those left with nothing after their homes are reduced to rubble. The novel offers a short, sharp satire on a decaying country whose people have been betrayed by their leaders. Pepetela is the guerrilla alias and pen name of former MPLA combatant and ex-deputy minister Artur Carlos Maurício Pestana. Blue Dahlia, Black Gold by Daniel Metcalfe Welcome to Angola … a petrostate of plenty amid grinding poverty where beer costs less than bottled water and the oil-soaked rich are buying up chunks of Portugal, home of the former colonisers. Metcalfe, an intrepid traveller in this “anti-tourist destination”, has an insatiable curiosity and a determination to get under the skin of this complex and contradictory country. Weaving history and politics into his travelogue, he tells of the brutal Portuguese colonial era, the crippling 27-year post-independence civil war, and the ruling MPLA party’s iron grip on the state. An oil boom brings extraordinary wealth, but fails to benefit the vast majority of Angolans as the MPLA eschews Marxism for a cocktail of capitalism, cronyism and corruption.
Metcalfe embarks on bone-jarring journeys across the country, talking to activists, expat landmine clearers, tribal elders and citizens, unfailingly mining interesting stories. Despite facing something rotten in the state of Angola, there is no doubting people’s resilience. One woman who helps Metcalfe tackle the ubiquitous red tape has “something quietly courageous about her … like a delicate bird in a cage, she found a way to sing”. The author’s subtle wit and sharp eye are the hallmarks of this enriching and enjoyable introduction to an African powerhouse.

2015-02-02T15:43:21Z,global-development,Global development,Africa losing billions from fraud and tax avoidance,"Africa is losing more than $50bn (£33bn) every year in illicit financial outflows as governments and multinational companies engage in fraudulent schemes aimed at avoiding tax payments to some of the world’s poorest countries, impeding development projects and denying poor people access to crucial services. Illegal transfers from African countries have tripled since 2001, when $20bn was siphoned off, according to a report released by the African Union’s (AU) high-level panel on illicit financial flows and the UN economic commission for Africa (Uneca). The report was praised by civil society groups as the first African initiative to address illicit outflows from the continent. In total, the continent lost about $850bn between 1970 and 2008, the report said. An estimated $217.7bn was illegally transferred out of Nigeria over that period, while Egypt lost $105.2bn and South Africa more than $81.8bn. Trade mispricing, payments between parent companies and their subsidiaries, and profit-shifting mechanisms designed to hide revenues are all common practices by companies hoping to maximise profits, the study said. Nigeria’s crude oil exports, mineral production in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Africa, and timber sales from Liberia and Mozambique are all sectors where trade mispricing occurs. Former South African president Thabo Mbeki, who chairs the panel, said: “The information available to us has convinced our panel that large commercial corporations are by far the biggest culprits of illicit outflows, followed by organised crime. We are also convinced that corrupt practices in Africa are facilitating these outflows, apart from and in addition to the related problem of weak governance capacity.” Criminal networks engaged in drugs and human trafficking, animal poaching, and theft of oil and minerals also contributed to money leaving the continent.
Reducing these losses requires urgent and coordinated action, the report said, calling for renewed political interest in fighting corruption, increased transparency in extractive sector transactions and a crackdown on banks that aid fraudulent transfers. African and non-African governments and the private sector – including oil, mining, banking, legal and accountancy firms – were all involved in schemes designed to launder money and avoid paying corporate tax, according to the study. More than $1tn was siphoned off globally through illegal schemes between 2007 and 2009, the report said, noting that lost African revenues comprised 6% of that total. But the authors cautioned that poor data and complicated laundering networks could make the amount much higher. “Illicit financial flows from Africa range from at least $30bn to $60bn a year,” the report said. “These lower-end figures indicated to us that in reality Africa is a net creditor to the world rather than a net debtor, as is often assumed.” But efforts to stop funds reaching terrorist groups, such as Nigeria’s Boko Haram and Somalia’s al-Shabaab, have led to improved anti-money laundering institutions in many African countries, the report said. This includes passing legislation designed to stop illicit flows, creating financial intelligence units and monitoring banking activities. The report called for the UN to crack down on European and US firms that engage in tax avoidance and money laundering. Joseph Stead, senior economic justice adviser at Christian Aid, said: “This is the first time that African countries have spoken out so strongly and in unison about how these financial crimes are hurting their people. That is a big deal. “From now on, it will be much harder for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and other rich country groupings to argue that tax dodging, corruption, money laundering and so on are not a top priority for African governments.” Governments that “turn a blind eye” to illicit outflows are forcing their poorest citizens to forgo hospitals, schools and environmental protection, said Sipho Mthathi, Oxfam’s executive director for South Africa. “Oxfam estimates that Africa alone is losing almost half of the global $100bn of annual illicit financial flows,” she said. The bulk of Africa’s illicit transfers originated from west Africa, where 38% of all funds leaving the continent were generated. Profit-making activities in north Africa accounted for 28% of the flows, while southern Africa, central Africa and eastern Africa each made up about 10%, the report showed. Global Financial Integrity president Raymond Baker said the report represented a historic moment in the effort to fight Africa’s “most pernicious economic problem”. “This is a turning point in the movement to curtail illicit financial flows and promote financial transparency, both within Africa and globally,” he said.

2015-02-02T12:51:46Z,global-development,Global development,Why don't we care about older people as much as children? | Jonathan Glennie,"A collection of essays has been published by Age International and, if the roll call of interesting authors is anything to go by, it looks like the issue of ageing has finally arrived at the main hall of the global development conference centre. As most people know, older people are the most likely to vote, whereas under-18s have no vote at all, meaning that, at the national level, old people tend to be fairly well served by democratic politics. But the reverse appears to be true in international politics. Think of the plethora of international children’s charities – and then try to name more than one for old people. And though Unicef is a $4bn (£2.7bn) a year megalith at the heart of the UN establishment, there is no UN organisation for old people – although they do have a UN “day”, if that means anything any more. Old people did not have a millennium development goal, and in the draft of the sustainable development goals, there are 23 references to young people and children, compared with only three to older people. In the words of one of the contributors to the essays: “Sub-Saharan Africa’s older people receive little, if any, consideration in core development agendas.” Why the lack of concern? One reason may simply be that we naturally focus our sympathies and attention on the new generation rather than the old. There is a human instinct to give a chance to the young, innocent as they so obviously are of past errors, their parents’ or their country’s. The unfairness of their poverty is that much more obvious and inspires us to respond.
But probably more important, and more concrete, is that threats to progress and stability, national or international, are more often associated with the jobless and disaffected youth than with older people – we simply don’t see many older people hurling chairs into onrushing police cordons. And if they are not part of the problem, nor are they seen as part of the solution – they are past it, in our consciousness, whiling away time, while the youth are actively engaged in change. So, with old people not eliciting the same level of sympathy, and accounting neither for the world’s problems nor their solution, self-interested strategies as well as charitable instincts seem more likely to be aligned behind supporting youth. Age International’s impressive collection of essays invests significant effort in challenging this analysis and the myths behind it. The numbers are telling. Though we are all well aware of the youth bulge, the old bulge is not yet part of the development lexicon. But by 2050, the number of people in the world aged 60 or older will be more than twice what it is now (pdf), growing from 868 million to 2.02 billion, according to the UN. The year 2047 will be remembered, according to UN predictions, as the first year when older people (60+) will outnumber children (under 16) (pdf). Crucially, 80% of these old people will, by that time, live in what we call developing countries. The case is fairly clear and is made in essay after essay. The failure of the international community to recognise this major demographic shift, a consequence of increased life expectancy – itself one of the finest symbols of the progress of humankind in the past century – is distorting the development narrative and the policies that accompany it.
Far more than just making the moral case for investing in older people, the authors argue that older people are hard workers and relatively productive (even if their contributions to economic development are often informal), and that they are crucial to social cohesion and child-rearing. Investing in their health and wellbeing is not only a duty, therefore, but sound economic and social policy. Two thoughts. First, should those focused on children’s welfare view this as a rearguard action from the grey lobby, as competition for limited budgets and political energies? A facetious question to which, obviously, the answer is no. The most important policies required to help old people to thrive and contribute are likely, mostly, to be very similar to those that young people need, eg better basic services (free at the point of use) and better infrastructure. A deeper focus on older people would not be to the exclusion of others, but would ensure that their needs are contemplated as better systems are rolled out in fast-changing developing countries, for the good of old people and the rest of society too. Second, this issue further undermines the post-colonial us-and-them, we-help-you mentality. In one of my first blogs for the Guardian how I tried to provoke British readers by suggesting that visitors from Africa might be horrified by the way we treat our old people. You may or may not agree, but, apart from social policies in the global north being, naturally, far better funded, there is no sense in my mind that northern countries are nearer to solving the problem of how to respond to ageing societies than any other part of the world. This is an area where all countries have much to learn, and much to offer. The issue of old people is then, perhaps ironically, a thoroughly modern one in the spectrum of global development problems.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/02/older-people-elderly-children-development-goals,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/02/older-people-elderly-children-development-goals
2015-02-02T12:20:36Z,global-development,Global development,Karachi polio workers defy Pakistan militants' murderous campaign,"Chanda is too scared to permit publication of her full name or photograph. The housekeeper in Pakistan’s sprawling megacity of Karachi is terrified of the local thugs who have been targeting her son for being a polio worker. The 37-year-old Christian says the harassment started two years ago when a gang burst into the polio centre and accused the workers of “spoiling” Muslim children – a reference to the rumours that polio drops affect fertility. Now her 22-year-old son has stopped immunising children, but the family is still living in fear. It may sound extreme, but Chanda’s son is far from alone. Since 2012, 68 polio workers or police officers guarding them have been killed by militants, including the Pakistani Taliban, who oppose the vaccinations. Last month a police officer accompanying a polio team in Orangi town, an industrial area of the city, was shot in the head, while on 26 January another police officer was killed in Nazimabad. The attacks have had a devastating effect on the drive to eradicate polio in Pakistan, with cases rocketing to more than 300 last year. And health workers in Karachi – with its population of more than 20 million, communities of internal refugees from conflict zones, slums and frightening reputation for political and criminal violence – face an exceptionally daunting task. As a result the city, which three years ago had no known cases of polio, now has 23 cases of the infectious disease, while the surrounding province of Sindh has at least six more.
But in the city’s new emergency operations centre for polio eradication and immunisation, Shahnaz Wazir Ali, Sindh’s provincial co-ordinator for public health, says that, despite the terrible toll of deaths, recruiting polio workers has not been a problem. “We have tremendously brave workers,” Ali says. “Sometimes they come even though they know someone in the same area, just down the street, has been shot.” She attributes this to a “continuous engagement with the workers and constant direction with local government officials”, while others at the centre point out that even though the money the workers receive is only 500 rupees (about £3) a day, for impoverished inhabitants of Karachi, it is too good a wage to pass up – whatever the risk. The centre, set up to bring all the actors in the polio eradication battle into closer cooperation – from government officials to World Health Organisation and Rotary International representatives – opened last month. And Ali is confident that by May the team will have reached a turning point and that cases of polio in Sindh will be down to zero in the next three years – the target set by the global campaign to eradicate the disease. The city’s lack of security is the biggest obstacle to this, however. The areas of Pakistan with the most cases of polio are in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province: militant strongholds. With Karachi home to long-established communities from these regions – and increasingly internally displaced people fleeing military operations against the militants – the city reflects the suspicion and opposition to immunisation felt in the provinces, with all of the polio cases arising from communities with ethnic and cultural links to Fata and KP. “We get resistance because the families believe this vaccine is an American conspiracy,” says Ali, who adds that the case of Shakil Afridi, a doctor who ran the fake vaccination operation that confirmed Osama Bin Laden’s presence in Pakistan for the CIA, gives such theories added traction. “People say, ‘All these polio workers come and penetrate our houses and they report on us’.” But added to this are Karachi’s strains of ethnic, religious and sectarian tensions which frequently explode into violence. So while the police have insisted that each polio team in Karachi is accompanied by police officers, in reality this makes city-wide drives against polio unfeasible.
“For all our teams to have officers at one time we would need more than 5,000 officers – more like 7,000. It is just not possible to get that with the law and order situation in Karachi,” says Ali. “The police are under tremendous pressure already – the official analysis is that we need 20,000 extra policemen in Karachi anyway. So how can they give us even 2,000 officers at a time? We want the same police officers each time we cover an area, because they know how to operate there.” To counteract this, Ali says, the coordinators are targeting their efforts in smaller areas. Out of the 188 union councils that make up the city, 11 have been designated super high risk and these will be the subject of nine polio drives in total, compared with four in other councils, to stop the virus getting a chance to incubate and thrive. But wherever they go polio workers must still counter the damaging, and widely believed, rumours about the polio drops. “They say it is an anti-fertility drug. They say it is anti-Islamic and that all the elements [of the drops] are not halal,” Ali says. Others worry about the effectiveness of the drug, the side-effects, or are simply unwilling to let workers connected to the government into people’s homes. “Some frankly see it as a rent-seeking exercise,” she adds. Initiatives aimed at breaking down resistance, however, have achieved “major breakthroughs”, according to Ali. In the most high-risk areas, 340 full-time paid positions for women from communities ethnically linked to Fata and KP have been created. There are 38 new mother and baby health camps in Karachi where polio drops are given in conjunction with other medical help. Local community and religious leaders have been courted to ensure they support the polio programme and can argue against the rumours. There are immunisation efforts at transit points into the city such as railway stations and major roads. Efforts to persuade the government to improve access to clean water and sanitation in high-risk areas have proved less successful. And, Ali says, the real difficulty is still to come: ensuring that once the emergency operations against polio are over, a regular programme of vaccination for all childhood diseases is put in place when the international community turns its attention away. “That is very difficult because routine immunisations don’t get the political attention that polio does – and they should.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/02/karachi-polio-workers-pakistan-militants,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/02/karachi-polio-workers-pakistan-militants
2015-02-02T00:05:03Z,global-development,Global development,"China, Brazil and India still need British aid, say MPs","Rapidly developing countries such as India, China and Brazil still need foreign aid from the UK despite their rising wealth, according to MPs. A report from the House of Commons international development committee on Monday will say spending in such countries remains important because many of their citizens are still extremely poor. Foreign aid to such countries has come under fire from the Conservative right and Ukip, with critics pointing out that India and China both have space exploration programmes. However, the study, by a cross-party group of MPs, says the UK should stand up for this kind of development funding rather than being embarrassed about it. “The UK may no longer have a traditional aid relationship with these countries, but it is spending official development assistance (ODA) in Brazil, India and China – and is rather diffident about admitting this,” it says. “We believe the government should stand up for this course of action, rather than giving its critics opportunities by obfuscating about its – perfectly legitimate – activities in these countries.” The committee found direct grants for increasingly wealthy countries are become “less appropriate” but the UK is right to be forging new relationships that focus on cooperation in health, education, law, culture and science. It calls for the government’s approach to move beyond aid towards assistance in the areas of trade, tax, finance, policy on arms and tackling corruption. Sir Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrat chairman of the committee, said: “Aid remains essential in our modern world, to respond at times of crisis, and to help the poorest people in the poorest countries build sustainable livelihoods. We also think aid has a role to play in some middle-income countries, like India, China and Brazil, especially building new partnerships for the future. “However, the number of poor countries is falling, and those that remain often suffer from conflict, so need multiple interventions. Furthermore, rich and poor countries together must face up to big global challenges like climate change or disease epidemics that have the potential to impact on us all – and these require not just money but new forms of cooperation. “That is why development in the future will not just be about aid. When the government puts its mind to it, the results are impressive.” Its recommendations come after MPs approved plans to make it compulsory for the UK to spend 0.7% on aid, despite the strong opposition of some Conservatives. Mary Creagh, the shadow international development secretary, said: “This report outlines the weaknesses in the Tory-led government’s approach to international development which led to a slow response to the Ebola outbreak and criticisms of their projects from the National Audit Office and public accounts committee.” A spokesman for the Department for International Development said: “The committee is absolutely right to identify that there are many things beyond traditional aid that drive development and help reduce poverty, including trade, tax, conflict, corruption and disease. That is why we have directed more resource to tackle these areas with the aim of ending aid dependency once and for all.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/02/china-brazil-india--british-aid,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/02/china-brazil-india--british-aid
2015-02-02T00:01:03Z,global-development,Global development,"DfID future at risk unless it acquires greater Whitehall influence, say UK MPs","Britain’s Department for International Development (DfID) must become more integrated into the overall government machinery, and seek greater influence, particularly on security issues, if it is to remain relevant and protect its status as a standalone ministry, a parliamentary committee said on Monday. The international development committee (IDC), chaired by Sir Malcolm Bruce, said more cross-government coordination on development was essential, stating DfID had a “patchy” record. “There is more to do on security where we are concerned that DfID lacks influence; as a result, too little weight is given to conflict prevention,” the report said. Development challenges, such as security in fragile states, climate change and threats from diseases such as Ebola required a cross-government approach, especially as the international community worked to draft the sustainable development targets that will replace the millennium development goals when they expire this year. “The new approach raises questions about issues such as organisational structures, cross-government working, competences, and reporting and accountability. We believe DfID’s long-term future as a standalone ministry will be at risk unless stronger mechanisms to support cross-government working on development are put in place,” the report said. “We need to ensure that policies across government are joined up and we want DfID to have more influence both in Whitehall and in developing countries,” Bruce saidt. The report recommended that the UK maintain a “free-standing and cabinet-level” DfID to ensure that development priorities lie at the heart of government. It also recommended that cross-government working be improved. “The security sector is a case in point,” it said. “The National Security Council (NSC) should take a broader view of threats to UK security and ensure that development and conflict prevention be given the priority they deserve.” The NSC is the main forum for discussing government objectives for national security and is meant to ensure that ministers consider national security issues in a strategic way. The IDC noted that Britain’s national security adviser, Sir Kim Darroch, declined to appear before it, “citing concerns about sharing internal policy advice – prepared for the prime minister – in public”. It said improved coordination on security was crucial “given long-held concerns that the development agenda perhaps is downplayed to military priorities”. The case for DfID’s continued existence as a standalone department “will be made stronger if cross-government structures ensure collaboration with other departments is as efficient and coherent as possible”, the report continued. DfID was part of the Foreign and Commonweath Office until 1997, when the Labour government established it as a department in its own right. The IDC published the results of the first phase of its inquiry into the future of UK development cooperation (pdf) in February last year, noting that grants from the UK and other donors to developing countries, while still essential, would be of decreasing importance compared with other sources of finance. In this second phase report, the IDC said aid remained vital but that new forms of cooperation were also needed in a rapidly evolving global context, where there were fewer low-income countries but where many of the poorest states were also fragile, requiring complex and multiple interventions. “Furthermore, rich and poor countries together must face up to big global challenges like climate change or disease epidemics that have the potential to impact on us all – and these require not just money but new forms of cooperation,” Bruce said. “That is why development in the future will not just be about aid. When the government puts its mind to it, the results are impressive. The UK often leads in shaping the global agenda, as it has done, for example, on women and girls. But the evidence we received shows the record is patchy. We call on the government to up its game and make policy coherence a central priority,” he added. The report noted that Britain should not be afraid of showing its commitment to middle-income countries. “We recommend that the UK be confident about its decision to continue its ‘beyond aid’ engagement in middle-income countries. The UK may no longer have a traditional aid relationship with these countries, but it is spending official development assistance (ODA) in Brazil, India and China – and is rather diffident about admitting this,” the report said. “We believe the government should stand up for this course of action, rather than giving its critics opportunities by obfuscating about its – perfectly legitimate – activities in these countries.” The committee also praised the government’s commitment in reaching a 0.7% target of aid as a share of national income. In testimony to the IDC last November, development secretary Justine Greening said DfID had an increasingly integrated role at the heart of government strategy, noting her department’s presence in the NSC. Referring to countries in transition, she said DfID would work “to drive the domestic resource mobilisation agenda, which is going to be a big part of the ‘beyond aid’ policy approach that we’ve got because everyone recognises that ODA’s going to become a smaller part of the resourcing that countries are bringing to bear on development”. A DfID spokeswoman said: “The committee is absolutely right to say that aid agencies and NGOs must work towards a sustainable end to aid dependency. “Boosting growth and creating jobs, supporting trade, improving tax revenues and stopping conflict, disease or corruption are vital if a country is to pull itself out of poverty for good. “That is why we have directed more resource to end aid dependency through growth and jobs, placed the wellbeing of girls and women at the heart of our work and put in place new relationships with emerging powers. “We are working hard to make sure that this new approach is reflected in the next set of UN development goals.” The IDC report also said DfID must improve reporting and accountability. The department came under fire this week after parliament’s spending watchdog said hundreds of millions of pounds of public funds had been handed over without proper scrutiny to an aid agency accused of funding international criminals.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/02/dfid-future-at-risk-whitehall-influence-security-international-development-committee,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/02/dfid-future-at-risk-whitehall-influence-security-international-development-committee
2015-01-30T15:28:21Z,global-development,Global development,Robert Mugabe assumes African Union helm with familiar rallying cry,"Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe’s 90-year-old president, has assumed the chairmanship of the African Union (AU) with a call for members to improve infrastructure and tackle climate change, conflict and Ebola, and with a familiar rallying cry that Africa’s wealth belongs to Africa and not “imperialists and colonialists”. The veteran leader, who was elected head of the union on Friday, replaces President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, of Mauritania. “By electing me to preside over this august body, with full knowledge of the onerous responsibility that lies ahead, I humbly accept your collective decision,” Mugabe told the AU summit in Addis Ababa. “I do so, confident that I can always count on your full support and cooperation in the execution of the important mandate you have given me.” The president, who has led Zimbabwe since 1980, said the focus of his tenure would be on “issues of infrastructure, value addition and benefication, agriculture and climate change in the context of Africa’s development”. The continent’s underdeveloped roads, railways and air and sea networks, he said, were hampering efforts to improve trade, investment and tourism. “We need to continue – and perhaps redouble – our current collective efforts in this sector. “Given that the continent is rich in mineral resources – and resources should be seen to contribute more meaningfully to Africa’s development – they are our wealth and we must guard against their being exploited for the benefit of others.”
If Africa continued missing out on the full benefits of its mineral wealth by exporting its resources in their raw or semi-raw form, said Mugabe, people would remain unemployed and languishing “in extreme poverty”. Similarly, he said, Africa’s “vast agricultural potential” had to be harnessed by ensuring that people had access to the land on which so many depend. Mugabe said his own government’s land reforms – intended, he suggested, precisely to take land from “colonisers” and give it back to Zimbabweans – had seen his country subjected to “practical demonisation … from those who had selfish and vested interests in our land”. Nevertheless, said Mugabe, production in the tobacco sector had now far surpassed levels attained by the white farmers who worked the land before they were expropriated. But such agricultural progress could not be taken for granted. “Since we are the most vulnerable as a continent, it is imperative that we actively champion our interests within the framework of the UN’s climate change negotiations.” Referring to the ongoing conflicts in Libya, South Sudan and Central African Republic – and the turmoil in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo – Mugabe said the union needed to work harder to bring about sustainable peace on the continent. He also raised the “intolerable” atrocities perpetrated by Boko Haram. “The scourge of terrorism and all its attendant evils threatens all our gains achieved since 1963,” he said. “In the coming year we therefore should deliberate and find lasting solutions to the scourge of terrorism, the loss of innocent [life] and the destruction of property inflicted by terrorists recently in Cameroon and Nigeria.” Mugabe identified Ebola as another scourge. While he said he had been heartened to see that “a lot of ground has already been covered” in combating the epidemic, he stressed the disease still needed to be fought and eradicated. Characteristically, he could not resist gloating over recent oil reserve discoveries across the continent. “Oil, oil, oil – which the blind eyes of colonialists could not see!” he said. “God bless! It was the handiwork of the Almighty. We thank him for it. For sure, African resources should belong to Africa and to no one else except those we invite as friends. Friends we shall have, yes, but imperialists and colonialists no more. Africa is for Africans.” Despite the applause that greeted his words, the decision to appoint Mugabe as president of the AU was not universally popular within the ranks of the union. Although many Africans revere him as a hero of the liberation struggle, Mugabe’s autocratic style of rule and intolerance of dissent or opposition has left him increasingly isolated on the international stage. His use of political violence and intimidation has resulted in travel bans from the US and EU. “It’s not a very encouraging sign,” one African diplomat, who asked not to be identified, had told Agence France-Press in the runup to the announcement. “The Mugabe style belongs to a past generation, the one that takes power hostage, and this is no longer the AU creed.” Jeggan Grey-Johnson, a spokesman of the pan-African civil society coalition, the AU We Want, said Mugabe’s election would send “mixed signals and an extremely awkward message on international levels on how the AU stands on principles of democracy and good governance”. Others, however, have defended the move. “Who am I to say to the people, you have elected the wrong leader?” said Erastus Mwencha, deputy chairman of the AU commission. “The people have chosen: the important thing is that you must follow the constitution of your country.” Some diplomats attending the Addis summit have described Mugabe’s election as an “unfortunate accident” springing from the tradition of rotating the post between Africa’s regions.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/30/robert-mugabe-african-union-chairman-familiar-rallying-cry,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/30/robert-mugabe-african-union-chairman-familiar-rallying-cry
2015-01-30T14:10:59Z,global-development,Global development,"Malawi floods leave grim legacy of death, destruction and devastation | David Smith","Homes swept away like matchsticks, vast plains turned to mud, fields of precious crops drowned. An aerial view from a helicopter, rain hammering on its roof after delivering food aid, reveals the full devastation wreaked by Malawi’s worst floods for half a century. Villagers here speak of climbing up anthills or trees and waiting for three days without food or water, drenched in rain and fearing attack by crocodiles. Families describe how they have lost everything. Rescue workers tell of seeing children swept to their deaths and picking up floating backpacks only to discover corpses attached. Nearly three weeks on, the death toll remains unclear and not everyone is accounted for. The disaster has led to accusations that the Malawian government’s response is being hampered by the decision of Britain and other donors to freeze direct aid following the so-called “cashgate” corruption scandal that engulfed several senior officials. Western donors have channelled support to NGOs on the ground instead.
Among five helicopters delivering food and other supplies was a South African-owned Bell 205 that, its pilots said, flew in the Vietnam war. As the engine roared and raindrops swam up the windscreen, passenger Duncan Goose looked out on a scene of destruction. The murky Shire river had burst its banks, burying maize fields in silt, swamping flimsy wooden structures, snapping bridges and leaving mudbrick homes roofless or ruined. Entire villages have been wiped off the map and communities forced to relocate. After the helicopter swooped through a lush green valley and touched down, Goose, the founder of One, a UK-based philanthropic business that funds clean water programmes for communities in Malawi, said: “Tragic doesn’t even come close. How can you restart your life when you can’t even afford a saucepan, let alone rebuild a home?” Estimates of the death toll from the torrential rains vary from 79 to more than 200. At least 174,000 people have been displaced and 638,000 affected, according to the UN, with livestock and possessions swept away, subsistence crops lost and water sources contaminated.
There are fears of an outbreak of cholera or other waterborne diseases, while people without shelter are at greater risk of malaria. Roughly 200 camps for displaced people have sprung up, but the UN’s World Food Programme says it urgently needs $18m (£12m) to continue food assistance. Among the survivors is Elen Zinoidha, a 67-year-old great-grandmother from the village of Masanduko, south of the commercial capital, Blantyre. When the relentless downpour began nearly three weeks weeks ago, she saw water creeping towards her home. She and a neighbour ran to an anthill and climbed to the top, an estimated 7ft in height, where they were part of a group of five adults and five children. They spent the next three days there in the rain, sitting upright because there was no space to lie down, barely able to sleep and with nothing to eat or drink. “There was a dog seeking refuge on the edge of the anthill,” recalled Zinoidha. “A crocodile caught the dog, so that brought fear over whether we’d survive. When a crocodile is hungry it could climb up the anthill and grab one of us. We were overtaken by this fear so we didn’t feel hunger or thirst for three days. We were just praying to God for mercy and support.” Finally the group spotted some people in canoes. “We pleaded with them to rescue us but they were not keen, so we had to lie that one of the children was sick. They took us but there were some waves and the canoeist had to paddle carefully to not capsize.” Zinoidha made it to higher ground and is now in a camp for displaced people, where she says life is tough. At home, the maize, cowpea, beans, rice and tomato she was growing have been submerged in mud.
About 70 people took refuge at the Salvation Army church in the village of Osiyana and crowded on to the pulpit. Pastor Amos Zikatiwindu, 36, and his wife were at home and clung to the roof trestle as the waters poured in. “I saw my wall fall down, and another wall fall down, so we had no option but to look for Jesus. We prayed for sand and God answered and sand entered the house. We stepped down from the trestle and the water was up to our necks. I took a rope and threw it to my wife.” When the pair escaped, there were people crying outside, assuming they had perished. The church had also collapsed, leaving everyone exposed for three days without food or water. Eventually they were removed to safety by helicopter. Rescuers in boats had to combat driving rain and little infrastructure to reach survivors, many of whom were clinging to trees and begging to be saved. Percy Phiri, a police officer, found a woman holding on to the top of her house with water up to her waist, shouting: “Please help me!” Others were stranded in a church in waist-high water. Phiri, 31, said: “You could see bags in the water. You picked it up and there was a body attached. People were hanging in trees and were then washed away. A headteacher’s wife and son were found hanging on a tree. I saw more than 10 bodies, most of them children. It was terrible. When I sleep, I still have a vision of them.” In one incident, he added, a boat capsized with 14 adults and five children. None survived. Malawi’s president, Peter Mutharika, has said the damage will cost 23.9bn kwacha (£34m) and declared half the country a disaster zone. His government has been working alongside the UN and NGOs on recovery efforts, but some believe its response has been too slow, citing western donors’ suspension of direct aid, which made up 40% of the national budget. The decision in 2013 to freeze direct aid followed the “cashgate” affair in which leading officials were arrested and accused of exploiting a loophole in the government’s payment system to divert millions into their own pockets. Masauko Mthunzi, programme manager for water, sanitation and hygiene at the relief organisation Concern Universal, said: “The government has been impacted so it’s not able to respond to the needs as quickly or on the scale they should have. It’s got the structures but the response was generally a bit weak and slow and the delivery of supplies has been slow. I believe the response from government would have been much better if they had all the necessary resources.” It took only 12 hours, however, for Concern Universal to get the nod from Britain’s Department for International Development for urgent funding. Unicef, the UN children’s agency, has also received contributions from Britain, the EU and other donors towards its £9.6m budget for the relief effort.
Mahimbo Mdoe, the country manager at Unicef, warned that basic social services have broken down in affected areas, while in the camps there are unconfirmed reports of rapes and other assaults. “People say there hasn’t been anything this bad since 1964 and the area is quite immense. There are stories of disease outbreaks and communities that have still not been found. There is a need for a huge upscale to reach the 174,000 displaced.” At one camp in the village of Bangula, up to 14 people crowded into tents intended for 10. Camp monitor Chancy Kalolokesya, from ActionAid, said: “There is not enough shelter. Some people sleep in the open … because we don’t have enough tents. There is a food problem: we don’t know when the next supply will come. Not everyone has received a blanket or mat to sleep on. In terms of kitchen utensils, we have shortages of everything.” But some victims live in such remote locations that they have been unable to reach camps or receive official help. Tiyanjane Rodrich Lino, 20, is nursing a swollen jaw after her house of mud and straw collapsed on her while she slept. Her family in Namacha village carried her over a river where the bridge had collapsed and helped her make the three-hour walk to hospital, where only Panadol was available, then walk back. Their home now lies in a heap of mud and dried grass, so the family are among 36 villagers crammed into a tent that was previously provided by a donor in Pembrokeshire, south-west Wales, and which first saw service during the second world war. About 150 people enthusiastically helped erect the tent in an hour. Residents of several villages interviewed by the Guardian said they had never seen such rains in their lifetime. But Baton Garden, 90, who married eight times and has more than 60 children and grandchildren, can remember something worse: an invasion of locusts in 1939. “They damaged the crops more than the rain,” he mused, sitting near the ruin of his house. “You could not see the leaves, you could not see something green.” • David Smith travelled to Malawi with One",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/30/malawi-floods-grim-legacy-death-destruction-devastation,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/30/malawi-floods-grim-legacy-death-destruction-devastation
2015-01-30T13:09:51Z,global-development,Global development,Water privatisation: a worldwide failure? | John Vidal,"Jimmy Orogobeni, now 25, has been waiting all his life for safe clean water in his Lagos home. In 1999, the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation (IFC) proposed a vast expansion of the city’s water supply, raising real hope that a British or French company would lay pipes to the sprawling Ajegunle slum. The IFC plan was rejected as “appalling” by the head of the Lagos Water Corporation, who said it was unworkable and too expensive for the city. But in the following years, donor governments, banks and a succession of European and American business consortia all went to Africa’s largest metropolis with plans to take water to people such as Orogobeni. Like the IFC, most proposed awarding a single giant water company a long concession in return for providing technical expertise and millions of water connections. But the companies, banks and donors all left, unable to agree with the federal or local authorities how to satisfy corporate demands, raise the billions of pounds inevitably needed, and convince the Nigerian public that international companies would fulfil their contracts and not make unreasonable profits from the sale of what was widely seen as a public resource. For Orogobeni, his family, and more than 15 million other Lagosians, the impasse means continuing to pay local water suppliers a hefty premium for unsafe water. About 80% of Lagos’s piped water supplies are thought to be stolen, only 5% of people receive it in their houses, taps are often dry, sanitation is non-existent across much of the metropolis and the hospitals are full of people suffering diarrheal and other water-borne diseases. All that has changed since the IFC’s abortive 1999 plan is that the demand for water has grown due to the arrival of millions more people in the city.
The latest organisation to have failed to negotiate a Lagos water agreement is the IFC – again. The private arm of the World Bank, which has lent more than $75bn for water and sanitation projects around the world since 1995, has been in secret talks for more than a year with the city’s private water company about funding another possible private-public partnership (PPP) scheme. But this week it categorically stated that negotiations had broken down and were unlikely to resume for years. “Contrary to recent reports, IFC has not signed any agreement with the Lagos Water Corporation (LWC),” said an IFC statement. “LWC expressed interest in working with IFC and we had a number of discussions on how we might be able to assist the company. In the end, IFC decided not to advise LWC. We continue to support the government and people of Nigeria in achieving their development goals.” A spokesman added: “It is unequivocal. We did talk to Lagos for about 18 months and we have now decided not to continue these discussions.”
The rebuff is a blow to the IFC, which has long been the world’s largest funder of global water projects, providing advice for governments and loans for companies to take over and invest in under-resourced water and sanitation systems in developing countries, often as part of a broader set of privatisation policies. According to the IFC’s data, it completed 847 water projects between 1993 and 2013, nearly half of which were in Latin America. But water privatisation has been politically hot since Britain became the first and only country to sell off its entire water industry in the 1980s. Many IFC projects have been opposed by coalitions of political and environmental groups amid fears that market water prices would increase way above what the poorest could pay. Since the early 2000s, political anger has mounted with the result that far fewer water projects have been proposed, and many fewer people have been connected to clean water than the World Bank and G8 countries might have expected when the the millennium development goals were signed in 2000. According to the latest IFC figures, about 768 million people still lack access to clean drinking water, 2.5 billion people are without safe sanitation and roughly 3.5 million people die annually from water-related diseases. The tide has turned on privatisation Research shows that the tide of water privatisation has now turned. Many cities that rushed to sign 20-year or longer concessions with water companies in expectation of clean water at a socially acceptable cost have chosen to terminate agreements and return urban water provision to public control. A report by the Transnational Institute (TNI), Public Services International Research Unit and the Multinational Observatory suggests that 180 cities and communities in 35 countries, including Buenos Aires, Johannesburg, Paris, Accra, Berlin, La Paz, Maputo and Kuala Lumpur, have all “re-municipalised” their water systems in the past decade. More than 100 of the “returnees” were in the US and France, 14 in Africa and 12 in Latin America. Those in developing countries tended to be bigger cities than those in richer countries.
“Direct experience with common problems of private water management – from lack of infrastructure investments, to tariff hikes to environmental hazards – has persuaded communities and policymakers that the public sector is better placed to provide quality services to citizens and promote the human right to water,” said the report’s author, Satoko Kishimoto, water coordinator with the Transnational Institute in Brussels. “A growing number of water utilities that have gone through a re-municipalisation process are increasingly ready, along with other institutions, to share experiences and provide practical support. Cooperation between public services is the most efficient way to improve water services and promote the human right to water,” she said. This week, the IFC said it had no ongoing water concession projects in Africa, and was working on very few in developing countries generally. From a high of 85 major projects in 2007, only 22 were recorded as starting in 2013. Moreover, 63 projects, representing 28% of the IFC’s total water investments over the past 20 years, have failed or are in difficulty, according to the bank.
“In the last five years the failure rate of water and sewerage privatisations has increased to 34%, compared with a failure rate of just 6% for energy, 3% for telecommunications and 7% for transportation, during the same period”, said Anna Lappé, director of the Small Planet Institute. With the IFC also reporting that nearly 40% of all its complaints in 2013 were about water, even though water projects are a small fraction of what it funds, the organisation has been put on the back foot. But it insists that cities and governments are learning from one another’s experiences and that failure happens mostly when water projects are not set up properly. “Properly structured PPPs [public-private partnerships] can play a key role in addressing the global water issues of today. Long-term evaluations of its projects prove that concessions can have a positive impact on levels of access and quality of services for the population,” said a spokesman.
But this is disputed by some water activists. “It is clear that PPPs in the water sector boost corporate profits at the expense of people. Privatisation, including PPPs, just doesn’t work. Where near-universal access to water has been achieved, it has virtually always been through a public commitment to build and maintain infrastructure, which represents 75% of the cost of delivering water to residents. It invariably results in raised prices, water shutoffs for those unable to pay and drastic workforce reductions, says Corporate Accountability International’s water senior organiser, Nathaniel Meyer. “Public officials often claim that due to government budget constraints they are being forced to pursue ‘partnerships’ with the private sector. But this justification is dangerously misleading, since the private sector consistently relies on the government or taxpayers to fund infrastructure, while extracting a profit, the margin of which can even be guaranteed in concession contracts,” he said. Successes and failures The jury is out on whether privatisation is a worldwide failure, with academics citing cities like Guayaquil in Ecuador, Bucharest in Romania, and some in Colombia, Morocco and Senegal as successes. Opponents say privatisation in Bolivia, Tanzania, Indonesia and in parts of Europe has failed. But both “sides” point to cities like Manila, where the IFC designed a 25-year, $2.7bn concession in 1997, giving it part-ownership alongside other companies. The IFC claims the project is a success story because it has provided an extra 1.7 million people with clean water, reduced diarrhoea cases by 51%, and offered customers significant savings: 20 times less than per-cubic-metre rates previously charged by water vendors. But others claim that Manila’s water privatisation has led to continual price hikes, legal challenges, investigations, failures to provide certain districts with water, and has given the companies unfair returns for their work. Last week the price of water was set to rise nearly 10% in many districts. Several recent PPP projects are also hotly contested. A massive private water project in central India’s largest city, Nagpur, has raised concerns among local residents. Worries range from high prices and project delays to unequal water distribution and service shutdowns. Allegations of corruption and illegal activity have led residents to protest, and city officials have called for investigations of contract violations.
Back in Lagos, the IFC’s second failure to negotiate a PPP project with the city could finally persuade the government to explore alternatives known as a “public-public partnership”. These involve cities partnering with non-profit organisations to keep prices low by taking advantage of the economies of scale and sidestepping many of the legal and corporate hurdles that accompany PPPs. That way, says Kishimoto, public water projects can be much cheaper, much more accountable and just as efficient as anything promised by privatisation. Kishimoto also proposed that cities like Lagos partner with others to exchange technologies and experiences. Amsterdam, she says, works with many cities in Morocco, Indonesia and southern Africa to increase water accessibility. “It is easier and cheaper for partnerships to develop, compared with the costly and cumbersome takeover processes used by the private sector. “It is quite common in Europe for towns and cities to merge their water operations through inter-municipal associations. There is no reason why rich cities should not link with cities in developing countries to provide advice and expertise where needed.” PUP partnerships have often been seen as threatening by financial markets but their numbers are growing and they have been found to work well in more than 130 cities in 70 countries, including Yokohama. “The goal must be to improve cities’ water supplies. The World Bank can still fund major projects like Lagos, but it must drop its ideological commitment to privatisation. Investment in water supplies is desperately needed and governments must now seek new ways to pay for the improvements needed,” says Kishimoto. Jimmy Orogobeni, still without water in Ajegunle, would probably agree.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/30/water-privatisation-worldwide-failure-lagos-world-bank,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/30/water-privatisation-worldwide-failure-lagos-world-bank
2015-01-30T11:35:50Z,global-development,Global development,"Never mind growth, Davos delegates – how about a World Development Forum? | Lawrence Haddad","This year’s gathering at Davos discussed inequality more than ever before. The latest Oxfam report has focused us all on one figure: 1% of the world’s population is soon to hold as much wealth as the remaining 99%. I’m not one of those criticising the Davos crowd for existing: “a club for the 1% to bond”, or “an annual shindig of the top 0.0001% (approximately)” according to the New Statesman). My critique is that they are talking about the wrong thing. They should be talking about sustainable development, not economic growth. Are they not the same? Well, no. Growth is sometimes good for some of the things we care about, such as poverty reduction, but not so good for others, for example, driving down infant malnutrition or generating good quality employment. And sometimes it is downright destructive, generating greenhouse gases that undermine growth in the future. In other words, the quality of growth matters as much as, if not more than, the quantity. We can forget about ending extreme poverty if we don’t tackle inequality A new book, Growth Is Dead, Long Live Growth: The Quality of Economic Growth and Why It Matters, the result of a two-year collaboration between the Institute of Development Studies, Agence Française de Développement (AFD) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica), shows how ineffectual growth can be in driving forward critical sustainable development outcomes. The book demonstrates that we can forget about ending extreme poverty by 2030, as the World Bank has suggested, unless inequality levels decline rapidly. It shows that infant malnutrition rates are much more responsive to improvements in inclusive wealth, a measure that goes beyond standard national income accounting, than they are to GNP per capita. And it illustrates that, while unemployment is responsive to growth, informal and vulnerable employment is not reduced by economic growth. Finally, a review of growth and carbon emissions concludes that the strategy of “grow now, green later” that many low- and middle-income countries are quite reasonably pursuing is neither in their interests nor in the interests of the richer countries. Green infrastructure can be most cheaply laid down in the lower-income countries and, coupled with abundant renewables such as solar and hydroelectricity, makes it very sensible for the richer countries to invest in capacity in lower-income countries and make governance of renewables easier by improving their own governance conduct in international forums. Equity is not just for idealists What needs to happen? Well, countries do have choices. Take fiscal policy, for instance: investing in productive safety nets would reduce want now and build human and environmental capital for the future. Lifecycle policy offers another example, because preventing malnutrition in the first 2,000 days of life has much higher benefit-cost ratios than expensive tertiary investments. Other choices include better governance of windfall revenues, investments in research and development that make green growth and poverty-reducing growth compatible, and measuring what we care about now, and not what we concentrated on 70 years ago. But change will not be easy.
There are many vested interests being served by focusing on growth at all costs. The book’s title reflects the traditional proclamation announcing the instant accession of a new monarch upon the death of their predecessor. We did this for a reason: GNP has sat on the throne for a very long time. It is time to drag it off and replace it with a worldlier monarch. Civil society movements such as action/2015 are vital to put pressure on the 0.0001% at Davos (and beyond) to pay attention to the quality of growth. But paying attention to the quality of growth is also in the interests of those who think they have the least reason to change. As a recent review by one of the editors (pdf) shows, while reducing inequality is vital as a driver of poverty-reducing growth, it is also vital as a spur for growth itself. But not everything is difficult. One thing the Davos leaders could do is rename their meetings. It would no longer be the World Economic Forum, but rather the World Development Forum. It would send a strong signal to the other 99.999%, which is that “we care about sustainable development”. Currently, growth is a means to some of those ends, some of the time. No more, no less. But it could be so much more: a powerful driver of sustainable development rather than an unreliable companion. The Davos club can play a big role in reframing growth. Our findings will help them do so. • Lawrence Haddad co-edited the book Growth Is Dead, Long Live Growth: The Quality of Economic Growth and Why It Matters with the JICA Research Institute vice-president, Hiroshi Kato, and senior economist at AFD, Nicolas Meisel.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/30/growth-davos-world-development-forum-sustainability,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/30/growth-davos-world-development-forum-sustainability
2015-01-30T07:00:02Z,global-development,Global development,Jobs in Latin America: where there's a skill there's a way | Mario Pezzini and Andreas Schleicher,"In Latin America, elections used to be synonymous with economic and financial volatility, and social instability. Things are different now: 14 presidential elections took place in Latin America between 2012 and 2014 in a highly stable climate, creating a political space for proposing far-reaching reforms. But the region still has profound socio-economic inequalities that, as many analyses have shown, can adversely affect growth. Although poverty and inequality have fallen in recent years as economies have grown, poverty still affects 28% of Latin America’s population (about 164 million people). It is the world’s most unequal region; the OECD report Divided We Stand reveals that the income gap between the richest and the poorest 10% is 27 to one in Mexico and Chile. Education is the key to equality of opportunity and social progress. Despite recent improvement, only 56% of Latin Americans in the lowest income quintile attend secondary school, and only 9% continue into tertiary education. Improving workers’ skills by strengthening links with the labour market is essential to ensure that people develop the right skills. Latin America is the region with the widest gap between the skills that societies and economies require and those that schools and universities offer. A recent report by Manpower reveals significant shortages of trade workers, engineers and production technicians. Five of the top 10 countries where employers declare having difficulties filling jobs are from Central and Latin America: Peru (67%), Argentina (63%), Brazil (63%), Panama (58%) and Colombia (57%). In Latin America, 32% of employers use foreign talent to meet skills shortages. In Costa Rica, the transition to advanced manufacturing has increased demand for skilled professionals in technology-related disciplines, particularly at the PhD level. Yet the range of PhD programmes in science and engineering in the country remains very limited. Similar difficulties are faced in Colombia, where the ministry of information technology and communications has identified a deficit of 15,000 telecommunication and software engineering professionals, which could rise to 90,000 by 2018. In Peru, 67% of employers declare having trouble filing positions, especially those with language skills requirements. The scarcity of skills conditions the performance of industry in the region. The Latin American Economic Outlook 2015 shows that Latin American firms are three times more likely than south Asian firms, and 13 times more likely than Pacific-Asian firms, to face serious operational problems due to a shortage of human capital. Car and machinery industries are particularly affected by this shortage, although they are working hard to develop training programmes to cater for it, such as Volkswagen’s training institute in Mexico. Skills shortages are also evident in some prominent Latin American firms: Pemex, Mexico’s state oil and gas company, recently declared that during the next 10 years it will have to replace a third of its workforce – roughly 50,000 workers – and look for a broader range of skills such as engineers, geologists and regulatory experts. Improving education and skills can raise labour productivity, create high-quality jobs and reduce the size of the informal economy. For this to happen, vocational education and training, as well as the ties between higher education institutions and the private sector, need to be strengthened. The OECD skills strategy is helping countries to develop national skills policies from early childhood to adult education to help countries include vulnerable groups in the labour market such as young people and women and use existing skills more effectively (for example, by reducing skills mismatch). Each project starts by mapping the skills challenges facing a country, then identifies the actions needed to tackle them. The project fosters close coordination among all relevant government ministries – education, employment, innovation and finance – while also strengthening engagement with employers, trade unions and civil society. Experience in the OECD’s work with Austria, Norway, South Korea, Portugal and Spain has demonstrated the benefits of a whole-of-government approach to skills. Education, skills and innovation are key to enabling Latin America to escape the middle-income trap. Many Latin American countries remain stuck, having failed to make considerable progress in income convergence with advanced economies. In the region, only Chile, Uruguay and a few Caribbean countries are high-income countries, with annual incomes per capita of more than $12,750 (£8,433). This is very different to other countries, mainly European and Asian, which achieved sustained increases in income per capita by improving the stock and quality of education and skills, and developing an innovation-friendly environment. Resolute action is essential to ensure dynamic, equitable growth for Latin America. • Mario Pezzini is director of the OECD Development Centre and Andreas Schleicher is director for the Directorate of Education and Skills and special adviser on education policy to the OECD secretary general.

The Climate Coalition, made up of more than 100 UK organisations campaigning for action on climate change, is asking people to submit photos of things they love that they fear losing due to the effects of climate change. Submissions so far include photos of rivers, coral reefs, wildlife and “the changing of the seasons”. The UN has acknowledged that people in developing countries will be among those most affected by climate change, with a gradual rise in sea levels, higher temperatures and more unpredictable rains. The coalition’s campaign comes after the UN Development Programme head, Helen Clark, called for world leaders to acknowledge the impact climate change is having on the fight against poverty. Mohamed Adow, senior climate change adviser at Christian Aid, a member of the coalition, said the campaign was an opportunity to capture the attention of world leaders in the lead-up to UN climate talks in Paris in December. “This year is an important opportunity for tackling the ever-increasing threat of climate change,” Adow said. “The Climate Coalition’s show the love campaign aims to make sure that the government and big business know that people around the world care about climate change. “The campaign aims to show politicians who are embarking on a general election campaign that tackling climate change is important to us because it will affect the things we love most, like our lifestyles, our children’s futures, our hobbies, passions, safety and wellbeing, both here and globally.” We’d like to hear from you – what treasured things in your community could be affected by climate change?

2015-01-29T07:00:25Z,global-development,Global development,Do Ebola educators make a difference? | John Momodu Kargbo,"The initial Ebola case in Tambakha [a remote chiefdom near the Guinea border] coincided with the proper training of the first set of Ebola educators. They were deployed in mid-October to educate local people on the prevention and control of Ebola and to help monitor the advent of newcomers into their communities, possible carriers.
The first case, a woman from Freetown who was suspected to have escaped from a quarantined home, fell ill at the village of Tomparay, just over the river at the entrance to Tambakha, and died about a week later. The Ebola educator assigned there, Mohamed Bangura, documented the death and informed the government Ebola taskforce in nearby Kamakwie about this suspected case. The chief in Tambakha was informed, but he denied it was Ebola and attributed it to a traditional curse. However, the taskforce in Kamakwie decided, in the interests of safety, to cut off all cross-river movement between Tambakha and Kamakwie. Street Child urged all our Ebola educators in and around the Samaya area to step up their awareness drive and in particular to be watchful in recording sick people or those moving within these communities – especially arrivals from Tomparay. A week after the death of the first woman, her mother and younger sister died and, two days later, the uncle did too. As the situation became alarming, the district health medical team in Makeni, the regional capital, were requested to cross over to Tambakha to assess the situation further. By then, the health centre in Samaya had been infected and the nurse and her assistant died. We continued to urge our educators to be more vigilant and proactive in spreading the prevention message and to tell everybody that the virus was already in Tambakha and that they needed to avoid touching the sick and the dead and to wash hands with soap regularly. In total, 15 people died in this first outbreak in Tambakha, in just two villages – Tomparay and neighbouring Samaya. I am certain that, were it not for our work, the number could have been higher. Just look at what happened when Ebola arrived in Koinadugu, where people in a remote district had not heard about the disease and not had Ebola awareness training – it was like a massacre.
Another Tambakha example to be proud of came when, towards the end of the year, two sick people were smuggled into Sanya, a small village on the border with Guinea. Our educators in Ferekuray (the last village on the Sierra Leone side), about three miles from Sanya, reported the cases to me and the official team. They were immediately isolated and an ambulance from the new Ebola holding centre in Samaya was called to pick up the two sick strangers for immediate attention. The educators pleaded with the locals out in this border region to avoid touching the sick and to stop keeping them at home. Ebola did not spread. There are great stories from further afield too. Look at the case of Sambaia Bendugu chiefdom – it is the only chiefdom in Tonkolili district that has never recorded a single case of Ebola. It is also the chiefdom where we have 52 Ebola educators in place, one of our highest concentrations. Perhaps it is coincidence? But when a large INGO went there nearly three weeks ago to learn what the people are doing that has kept them safe, the people explained how the Street Child Ebola educators are all over the chiefdom teaching people how to prevent the disease spreading, helping to monitor the movement of people in and out of the area, and reporting the sick. Likewise in Magbaingba, where the paramount chief depended heavily on Ebola educators to promote awareness and to monitor and report sick people and people coming into the area. Magbaingba still has no cases. However, the neighbouring community, Sanda Tainderin, where we have no educators, is alas reporting cases. I believe we have helped to make a huge difference – and these are some of the stories that give me the strength to go on with this work.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/29/ebola-educators-sierra-leone,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/29/ebola-educators-sierra-leone
2015-01-29T05:45:24Z,global-development,Global development,"Hundreds of millions given to foreign aid fund that lacked scrutiny, say MPs","Hundreds of millions of pounds of British public funds have been handed over without proper scrutiny to an aid agency accused of funding international criminals, according to a report published on Thursday by parliament’s spending watchdog. The Department for International Development (DfID) faces damning criticism for failing to examine the financial management of the Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG), the agency which is meant to fund large projects in developing countries. MPs on the public accounts committee heard allegations that £19m of PIDG money may have ended up with a firm associated with the convicted money launderer James Ibori, because of a failure of control. Ibori, a petty thief who rose to be one of Nigeria’s richest men, received a 13-year jail sentence in London in 2012 after admitting fraud of nearly £50m. The Metropolitan police estimate he had embezzled £157m of Nigerian public funds. Separately, the agency gave nearly £20m to another company named as a suspect in a Nigerian financial inquiry into allegations of looting of the country’s oil revenues, the report said. MPs also complained that PIDG board members had been allowed to run up tens of thousands of pounds in air fares for fully flexible business-class tickets. Between January 2011 and July last year, more than £75,000 was paid out on just 15 flights. Some of the report’s claims have been hotly disputed by the government. A DfID spokesman claimed the alleged links with Ibori had been thoroughly investigated and “absolutely no evidence” had been found to support them, or the claims related to the looting of oil revenues. However, the committee said that neither DfID nor PIDG had provided documentary evidence to allay MPs’ concerns. The report comes amid a debate on the Conservative right over whether to support David Cameron’s commitment for the UK to spend 0.7% of its annual income on aid. Ukip has argued against the ring-fencing of aid. Margaret Hodge, the committee’s chair, said that DfID’s performance had been unacceptably poor. Civil servants had been unable to demonstrate that UK taxpayers’ money was being used for its intended purpose of helping the world’s poorest people, she said. “Every pound that is lost to fraud and corruption is a pound that could have been spent on educating a child, improving health systems or supporting economic development. “We recognise that PIDG operates in countries where standards of governance can be challenging. However the department’s oversight of PIDG has been unacceptably poor and has left it open to questions about the integrity of PIDG’s investments and some of the companies with which it works.” PIDG, funded by seven nations including Britain and Switzerland, encourages private companies to carry out infrastructure projects in developing countries. The report said there was a lack of oversight and a hands-off approach to the fund from ministers and officials. It also said that Britain did not exercise its voting rights well to control the funds and had allowed other countries equal voting rights, even though the UK provides 88% of PIDG’s money. Poor oversight by officials allowed money to sit idle in a bank account rather than funding projects, the committee concluded. Between January 2012 and February last year, an average of £27m of DfID’s money was left sitting in PIDG bank accounts managed by SG Hambros. Mary Creagh, Labour’s international development spokeswoman, said that Cameron had promised value for money on aid but the report showed he had failed to deliver. “The national audit office and now the public accounts committee have exposed that the Tory-led Government has been pouring hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money into the Private Infrastructure Development Group without checking where it went,” Creagh said. “Ministers have sat on their hands while Britain’s aid efforts have been undermined. If the Tories and Lib Dems don’t know where aid money is going then how can they measure if it is working?” A DfID spokesman claimed there was no proof that Ibori had been linked to a PIDG-backed firm. “Britain’s investment in PIDG has helped to create 200,000 jobs and driven £6.8bn of private investment into some of the world’s poorest countries, developing their economies and making them less dependent on aid,” he said. “We already have strong oversight of PIDG’s activities and have recently clamped down on excessive travel rates. An independent review of their operations, backed by Britain, will ensure they continue to kickstart growth in the developing world.” ActionAid’s head of advocacy Barry Johnston said public confidence in aid spending rested on effective scrutiny and showing the positive impact it was having on the lives of the poorest. “The Department for International Development has led globally on ensuring ever greater transparency from aid recipients – and NGOs and governments have risen to this challenge. “This report demonstrates that it’s time we applied the same relentless focus on transparency and results to funding to the private sector,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/29/hundreds-of-millions-to-foreign-aid-fund-lacked-scrutiny,https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2015/jan/29/hundreds-of-millions-to-foreign-aid-fund-lacked-scrutiny

Refugees like Jean. “This morning he went to the market to sell a pig,” says his brother, Antoine, 57. “All of a sudden they arrived. They accused him of being an anti-Balaka and they shot at him.” His body shaking, Antoine appears to be in shock himself.
Jean’s family comes from a village in CAR’s Kouango district, where mounting violence since December has forced many residents to flee. Initially, they sought shelter on one of the islands in the Oubangui river, which marks the border between CAR and DRC. Occasionally, Jean, a shepherd, dared to return home to check on his livestock. “I was with my husband this morning,” says Grace, his 26-year-old wife. She describes how they crossed the river to CAR and how Jean left her at a woman’s house to have a cup of coffee, while he went to the market. “I heard the gunshot,” says Grace, adding that she thought it was a bicycle tyre exploding. “Someone told me that it was my husband who was shot. When I heard the news, I started crying. I went to look for him, and we carried him to the river to take a pirogue to cross [into DRC].”
Jean, wincing with pain, recalls the incident clearly: “They came suddenly. I saluted them. They were three. The third person refused to greet me. They asked who I am. The one who refused to salute me told me to stand in front of him. He directed his gun in my direction and shot. The moment I was shot I fell. I wanted to sleep in the grass, but I said to myself that I had to look for my older brothers. I called my brother to transport me to the other side.” Now, in the improvised operating room, a health worker injects Jean in his side with a local anaesthetic and begins operating in an effort to locate and safely remove the bullet. After nearly an hour, the diagnosis comes. The medical team has not been able to find the bullet, but has found that Jean also has a broken rib that puts his life in danger.
Robert Anunu, a doctor from the UN refugee agency UNHCR, says the health centre does not have the capacity to save him. Jean must be evacuated. “He has to be transferred to a hospital in Bili, or in Bosobolo, and we need an ambulance.” Bili is 75km away. Bosobolo is 100km, but the road is better. The medical team makes its decision, and moments later we are laying a sleeping mat in the back of one of our vehicles, loading emergency medical supplies and asking a nurse to accompany Jean on his journey to the hospital in Bosobolo. I came to Dula, more than 250km upriver from Bangui, as the leader of a five-day inter-agency mission to assess the needs of newly arrived refugees from CAR and plan the humanitarian response. In recent weeks, at least 10,000 people have crossed into this part of DRC – and possibly two or three times that many, according to government reports. With me are aid workers from the World Food Programme, the DRC’s National Commission for Refugees and three NGO partners.
Jean’s situation is not unique. The following day our team has to evacuate two more refugees – sisters, aged 30 and 14, who were struck by gunfire while fleeing an attack in CAR. “There were troubles with the Sélékas where we lived,” says Justine, the older of the two, from her bed in Bili’s hospital. They fled to the bush two months ago, she explains, hoping to stop first to collect their coffee harvest before crossing to DRC. But their luck ran out. “The Sélékas followed us. They shot me. The bullet went through my leg and touched my sister while we were fleeing.” Her father, Kasmir, 50, describes what he saw: “It was very early. We were sleeping. We heard gunshots. We did not know what was going on. While fleeing, we saw people falling under the gunshots. Four people died. For us, we were only injured and we continued to flee to cross the river.” The bullet entered the back of Justine’s leg, shattered her tibia and came out the other side. “There is a large wound and we have to intervene quickly,” says Dr Anunu, who helped us evacuate the sisters from Dula to Bili. “Otherwise, there is a risk of amputation.”
Nadine, Justine’s 14-year-old sister, was also shot. The bullet remains lodged in her knee, putting her lower leg at risk of paralysis. “She is very young,” says Dr Anunu. “We have to do everything we can to save her knee.” The hospital in Bili also lacks the capacity to treat Justine effectively, so she must be evacuated again. Again, we convert one of our vehicles into an ambulance, this time to evacuate the sisters to a hospital in Gbadolite, the main town in the region. It is their only chance of being able to walk again. Later, Justine and Nadine are evacuated by plane to Kinshasa for more advanced medical care.

On Saturday, the energy minister, Sospeter Muhongo, resigned over his alleged role in the affair last year that saw $180m (£116m) taken from the country’s central bank. The move follows the removal from office of the attorney general, Frederick Werema, the energy secretary, Eliakim Maswi, and the housing minister, Anna Tibaijuka, who was sacked over the transfer of $1m to her private bank account. Tanzanian investigators said funds from an account formed by the state-owned power company Tanesco were transferred to offshore bank accounts held by private businessmen and government officials. The incident led international donors to withhold budget support to the country amid concerns that officials were siphoning off public funds. The country is one of Africa’s biggest per-capita aid recipients, with 29% of its annual budget coming from overseas development assistance, according to Tanzania’s public accounts committee (PAC). President Jakaya Kikwete named William Lukuvi as the new housing minister and George Simbachawene as its energy chief. Muhongo described himself as “incorruptible”, and denied any wrongdoing. “My record is clean and I challenge anyone with proof that I received the escrow cash to go public and produce the evidence,” he said. But Zitto Kabwe, head of the PAC, which investigated the scandal, said Muhongo “had to be held to account” because of his role. Muhongo misled parliament by saying the escrow money did not belong to the government, the PAC said. Chairs of three parliamentary committees have also resigned following the scandal: Victor Mwambalaswa, energy and minerals committee; Andrew Chenge, parliamentary budget committee; and William Ngeleja, legal affairs and governance committee. The resignations and sacking have been praised by Tanzania’s opposition party. Mosena Nyambabe, secretary general of the National Convention for Construction and Reform, said he wants more politicians held to account. “We are so far satisfied with the steps the government has taken against senior government officials involved in the scandal but we want further steps taken against them so that we show how committed the government is to dealing with corruption,” Nyambabe said. Tanzania is holding a general election in October. Its burgeoning energy sector is expected to be a hot topic among voters, who see corruption as a major problem.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/28/tanzania-cabinet-reshuffle-energy-scandal-jakaya-kikwete,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/28/tanzania-cabinet-reshuffle-energy-scandal-jakaya-kikwete
2015-01-28T10:35:08Z,global-development,Global development,Families in critical situation in southern Iraq as winter bites,"Thousands of Iraqis are living in penury and running out of money after fleeing fighting and settling in the south of the country, the UN’s food agency said on Tuesday, warning that the situation was becoming critical for families in Najaf, Kerbala and Babil. Jane Pearce, the World Food Programme’s (WFP) country director for Iraq, said structures had not yet been put in place to cater for the people fleeing into the three southern provinces. WFP is distributing food to 50,000 displaced families in Basra, Dhi Qar, Qadisiya, Missan, Wasit, Muthanna, Najaf, Kerbala and Babil. Many of those who fled were unable to find refuge in the crowded Kurdistan region, which hosts close to half of internally displaced Iraqi families, while others said it was too expensive to live in the north. Some of those who fled south moved in with relatives, some stayed with other families, while others were using savings to survive. However, as winter advances, those savings are being depleted, leaving people less able to sustain themselves just as prices rise, Pearce said. “I moved to Kerbala because it is expensive elsewhere and I need shelter for my children. Time has stopped for us. There is no work, no schools and no future,” mother-of-six Najat Hussein told the WFP. “We receive WFP food rations every month. Without this help, I would be begging for food,” continued the 36-year-old, whose husband was killed in Tal Afar seven months ago. Many displaced people now live in unoccupied public buildings, in mosques known as Husseineyat, which have been designated as shelters by the local authorities, or with host families. Most of the families who moved south said they had spent their savings on transportation, the WFP said. The WFP provides food assistance to about 1.4 million displaced Iraqis in its 18 provinces. The assistance includes monthly food parcels containing wheat flour, cooking oil, rice and pasta. People moving from one area to another are given special rations, including canned food, while in the north, WFP began distributing food vouchers in November. “We are going to start needing more money … It is a concern to us how long we can maintain the levels of assistance we are providing now,” Pearce said. WFP needs $292m for its operations in Iraq this year, and has a shortfall of $200m. Refugee agency UNHCR says there are about 3.1 million internally displaced people in Iraq, including 1 million who were displaced between 2003 and 2013, and 2.1 million who were displaced last year.
Angelina Jolie, the UNHCR’s special envoy, visited Kurdistan last week, and said the international community was failing the region. “We are being tested here as an international community and, so far, for all the immense efforts and good intentions, the international community is failing,” she said in Dohuk on Sunday. “It is shocking to see how the humanitarian situation in Iraq has deteriorated since my last visit [in 2012],” Jolie added. “On top of large numbers of Syrian refugees, 2 million Iraqis were displaced by violence in 2014 alone. Many of these innocent people have been uprooted multiple times as they seek safety amid shifting frontlines.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/28/families-displaced-southern-iraq-winter-food-hunger-united-nations,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/28/families-displaced-southern-iraq-winter-food-hunger-united-nations
2015-01-28T07:00:00Z,global-development,Global development,The saddest thing in the world is not poverty; it's loss of dignity | Jonathan Glennie,"In a much-awaited report released at the end of last year, UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon set out his vision for after the millennium development goals expire this year. At its heart, and in its title, is the word “dignity”. It is not uncommon for “dignity” to be rolled out in the opening salvo of UN documents, but it is a concept seldom contemplated in depth. In this report, it is used as a title to gather the goals aimed at tackling poverty and inequality under one more manageable theme – those at the bottom of the economic ladder lack dignity, and it is the job of the rest of the world to help give it to them. But that is actually a very limited interpretation of a word that, if understood properly, could mean fundamental changes to our ways of working, and the overall story we are trying to tell. The thing about dignity, and the reason it is a transformational concept, is that it knows no social, economic, gender or ethnic barriers. Some of the poorest people are the most dignified. And some of the richest lack dignity. In a world of poverty and injustice, who are the undignified? Is it the poor or the rich? Is it the victim of violence or the perpetrator? Is it those who lose out to corruption or the corrupt official? Dignity is a word that overturns traditional assumptions about north and south, developed and developing. While charity is bestowed by the haves to the have-nots, dignity does not work like that at all. If I fail to treat someone with dignity, it is me, not them, who is undignified. The dignity lens introduces an irony whereby the “less developed” can actually be more dignified. In this way, development becomes a truly global endeavour, not by the “developed” for the “developing”, but by all, for all, to achieve the dignity of all. And that is why I think we should embed dignity, properly understood, at the heart of the sustainable development goals and the post-2015 agenda. By casting global goals as universal (not to be met only by poor countries, but by all countries), this new agenda also seeks to end the rhetoric of us and them. Don’t get me wrong. Extreme poverty is undignified – sometimes communities or individuals do find themselves helpless and in need of crisis or ongoing assistance. But that isn’t a sufficient understanding of the experiences of most poor people. Whether in city or countryside, very poor people tend to work for a better life. I have worked with people driven from their land for the sake of mega-plantations or mineral resource extraction. Some became labourers, others moved to urban slums. Sometimes they may even have made more money than they did before, but they told me that, while they were poor they had their dignity, carving out a life for themselves with responsibility.
As former president of Haiti Jean-Bertrand Aristide has pleaded, rebuilding his country means “moving from misery to poverty with dignity”. Amartya Sen (and others) transformed the development lexicon by defining development as freedom rather than just economic or even social progress, and the concept of dignity takes us a step further along that road. It is said, quite sensibly, that if you can’t measure it you can’t manage it. But while it may not be obvious how to fit dignity into a spreadsheet, it is at least an attribute that is eminently knowable. While most poverty measures are disputed, dignity is perhaps the one thing that humans across the globe, in myriad different contexts, most instinctively recognise and long for. Conceptualising development as dignity certainly does not provide a systematic response to all its problems – in fact it implies as many questions as answers. But it adds a further rich perspective. In particular, it inspires us to think not only about the what of development but the how. Not just the end, but also the means. It makes development more than just achieving outcomes – it implies a different way of seeing the world and fellow human beings. As I have argued elsewhere, it is quite plausible to reach certain development targets in ways that disregard some people or communities. Development and even poverty reduction can be excuses for some heinous crimes, by totalitarian regimes of both left and right set on the path to wealth creation or industrialisation and by the liberal capitalist hegemony. Imagine if, as well as carrying out value-for-money analyses of interventions, we also just asked the simple question: is this dignified? Does this enhance our dignity and that of others? I have seen a lot of poverty, and I have seen as much happiness in poor communities as in rich ones. The saddest thing in the world is not poverty per se; it is the loss of human dignity. As we redefine development in this year of transition to the new, more inclusive sustainable development goals, let me throw this into the ring. Development is dignity or it is nothing. The opposite – development without dignity – is not worth having.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/28/dignity-sustainable-development-goals,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/28/dignity-sustainable-development-goals
2015-01-27T16:29:00Z,global-development,Global development,Bill Gates dismisses criticism of high prices for vaccines,"Bill Gates has dismissed criticism by health campaigners of the high prices of some vaccines, warning that it only serves to deter pharmaceutical companies from working on life-saving products for poor countries. In an interview with the Guardian from a major international vaccine-funding conference in Berlin, which on Tuesday announced that $7.5bn had been pledged for immunisation of children in poor countries, Gates denied that the cost of the new vaccine against pneumococcal disease was too high. “Pneumococcus vaccine saves lives for about $1,000 per life saved,” said Gates. “So if you are going to do any helping at all, ever build a hospital, ever pay a doctor, you would [be willing to] pay for pneumococcus vaccine.” The humanitarian aid organisation Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) last week called publicly for the two big pharma companies making the vaccine to drop the price to $5 per child. Each child needs three doses of the vaccine. At the pledging meeting for Gavi, the global vaccines alliance, hosted by German chancellor Angela Merkel, MSF organised a stunt featuring supporters dressed as Merkel, David Cameron, Barack Obama and others spinning “Pharma’s wheel of fortune”, claiming that whichever way the wheel was spun, the drug companies always won.
However, immunisation, Gates said, “is the cheapest thing ever done in health. This general thing where organisations come out and say, ‘hey, why don’t vaccines cost zero?’ – all that does is that you have some pharma companies that choose never to do medicines for poor countries because they know that this always just becomes a source of criticism. So they don’t do any R&D [research and development] on any product that would help poor countries. Then they’re not criticised at all because they don’t have anything that these people are saying they should price at zero.” Only two pharmaceutical companies, GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, currently manufacture the pneumococcus vaccine, which is being made available across the developing world with help from Gavi. On Monday, Pfizer offered to cut the price from $3.30 a dose to $3.10. The $7.5bn will help fund the vaccination effort in poor countries over the next five years. Gates and the UK government put in the largest sums, at about $1.5bn each. Gates praised pharmaceutical companies that were willing to invest in vaccine research and development for poor countries. These companies charge different prices according to countries’ ability to pay, he said. “We get a great price for these things, which is tiered pricing, which in all cases would be about a 50th of what the US price for these things would be. And that’s how we manage to cut childhood death in half, not by saying to pharma companies, ‘hey, you better not do poor world medicines because we’ll come and attack you’.” Although he did not name MSF, Gates made clear his opposition to the organisation’s views, as well as his admiration for its other work: “I think there is an organisation that’s wonderful in every other respect, but every time we raise money to save poor children’s lives, they put out a press release that says the price of these things should be zero. Every five years when we are raising billions – that is the most effective foreign aid ever given, that saves millions of lives. “In fact, there is a legitimate element to it, which is that we have to make sure we understand the cost structure of making those vaccines. In the case of pneumococcus, believe me – the amount we’ve studied it and gone to the factories – this thing is super, super complicated. The quality you want for these things to be made is really pretty mind-blowing. To focus on ‘why isn’t everything free’ is a misdirection that has to do with the fact that they don’t actually know anything about the costs.” Gavi says that half a billion children have been immunised through its suport in the 15 years since it was founded and 7 million lives saved. It hopes to immunise 300 million more children between 2016 and 2020. Crucial to that will be improved immunisation systems in poor countries, says Gates. Some low-income countries, such as Ghana, Ethiopia and Rwanda, do very well. If their practices could be extended to much bigger and richer countries, such as Nigeria, Pakistan and India, the extra 300 million children would be reached very quickly. “The primary healthcare system in northern India, northern Nigeria and Pakistan are not well run, so whether it is immunisations or getting antibiotics, there needs to be effort putting in international help to get those things up to be very high quality,” Gates said. Pilot projects in Bihar, which has a population of more than 80 million, had increased the vaccination rate from 35% to over 80%. Often the supply chain is the limiting factor, Gates said. Improving supply, which means a cold chain in the case of vaccines, transport over difficult terrain and information about what is missing and what is available, also takes a burden away from primary healthcare providers. It is important also to ensure families keep coming to have their children vaccinated. “When a mother brings her kids from a distance and gets to primary healthcare and [they] are told the stuff isn’t there, that breaks down the demand model,” Gates said.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/27/bill-gates-dismisses-criticism-of-high-prices-for-vaccines,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/27/bill-gates-dismisses-criticism-of-high-prices-for-vaccines
2015-01-27T13:50:34Z,global-development,Global development,South Sudan: child soldiers released following deal with state and rebels,"Three thousand South Sudanese children recruited as soldiers during the violence that has beset the young country in recent years are to hand over their guns and return home as part of one of the largest ever demobilisations of children. Some of the children, who are aged between 11 and 17, have been fighting for four years and many have never been to school. In the past year, 12,000 children – most of them boys – have been used as soldiers by armed groups as South Sudan collapsed further into ethnic violence and civil war. On Tuesday, 280 boys were released from the ranks of the South Sudan Democratic Army (SSDA) Cobra Faction and handed over to the UN children’s agency, Unicef, in the village of Gumuruk in Jonglei state, eastern South Sudan. The rebel faction, which is led by David Yau Yau and based on the Murle ethnic group, has been in revolt against the government of president Salva Kiir since 2010. In a ceremony overseen by the South Sudan national disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration commission and the SSDA, and supported by Unicef, the boys gave up their weapons and uniforms. The rest of the children will be released in batches over the next few weeks. The organisation said it believed no girls have been gun-carrying soldiers but the agency is yet to determine whether they have been used in other roles. The boys told Unicef they are looking forward to laying down their weapons and getting an education. “I know what it is like to be a soldier and it is so dirty,” said one. “I just want to go to school.” Another child said he felt too small to be a soldier. “See my size and the size of the gun. It is not good.” Another told Unicef: “Please hurry up with the schools or our minds will go back to Cobra.” According to Unicef, the children were not recruited at gunpoint or forced to commit serious human rights violations. Most seem to have been recruited to protect their communities and families, with many saying they had joined the faction to defend the Murles from discrimination by central government. Jonathan Veitch, Unicef’s South Sudan representative, said the children had been forced to see and do things no child should ever have to experience, adding: “The release of thousands of children requires a massive response to provide the support and protection these children need to begin rebuilding their lives.” Unicef said the release heralded the start of “one of the largest ever demobilisations of children”. It is providing those released with food, water, clothes and medical help, and establishing psychological support programmes to prepare them for the return to their families. Moves to trace their relatives are under way and the agency hopes to get them home within three months. As well as providing access to education and skills training programmes, Unicef is working with a further 3,000 boys and girls in the communities into which the child soldiers will be released to reduce discrimination and prevent future recruitment. “The successful reintegration of these children back into their communities depends on a timely, coordinated response to meet their immediate and long-term needs,” said Veitch. Such programmes, he added, required “significant resources”; Unicef puts the costs for the release and reintegration of each child at about $2,330 for two years. It has so far received $1.8m from the Ikea Foundation and is appealing for an additional $10m. Other donors include the EU, and the UK and German national committees for Unicef. South Sudan, which won independence from its northern neighbour in 2011, has been in a state of civil war since December 2013, when Kiir accused his vice-president, Riek Machar, of plotting to overthrow him. The violence has once again pitted South Sudan’s two largest ethnic groups against each other, with many Nuers taking up arms in support of Machar and many Dinkas backing Kiir. A Human Rights Watch report published last August said both sides had committed “extraordinary acts of cruelty” that amounted to war crimes. Tens of thousands are thought to have died in the fighting, which has displaced 1.5 million people internally and forced another 480,000 to flee to neighbouring countries. Although a much-feared famine was averted last year, the UN estimates 3.9 million people will face food insecurity in South Sudan in 2015, with 2.5 million becoming “severely” food insecure.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/27/south-sudan-child-soldiers-released-deal-government-and-rebels,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/27/south-sudan-child-soldiers-released-deal-government-and-rebels
2015-01-27T12:00:05Z,global-development,Global development,"Ethiopia's women vow to turn tide of violence, rape and murder | William Davison","Tejnesh Leweg’neh, a 15-year-old from Ethiopia’s mountainous northern Shoa region, was abducted by three men on her way to market in October. They tried to force her to agree to marry one of them. She refused, and, a day later, they pushed her off a cliff. Now Tejnesh is paralysed from the waist down. That same month, 16-year-old Hanna Lalango, from Ethiopia’s cosmopolitan capital, Addis Ababa, was abducted by a group of men from a minibus on the outskirts of the city. She was raped over several days and died in hospital about a month later from her injuries. Five men have been convicted and are awaiting sentence for the attack. Hanna reportedly identified her assailants before she died. Both these crimes were brought to light by an energised network of mostly female Ethiopian activists trying to advance women’s rights and reduce sexual harassment in the Horn of Africa country. “What united us is we believe this is our problem, it’s our responsibility to change this,” says one of them, Selam Mussie. “We all are Hannas – this could have been any of us.” Mussie, an administrator at the International Community School in Addis Ababa, is part of the Justice for Hanna campaign.Activists view these violent attacks as a consequence of a culture that places women in subordinate positions to men, which often manifests itself in the form of the frequent petty harassment they endure on the capital’s streets. “There are certain places that most of us are terrified of passing through because there are tens of men sitting around to purposely make a woman passerby uncomfortable,” says Mussie, 24. “It starts from common catcalls, to dissing, to a physical level where they could follow to grab or touch private parts.”
Liya Hailemariam, a 24-year-old activist who works in PR, says she frequently suffers attention on public transport. “And it’s not just words – people somehow just slide in their hands,” she says. “We sort of consider it normal, we pass it off as this stupid guy, this pervert.” Using the momentum created by the outrage at Hanna’s death, activists want to encourage women to speak out against the routine harassment they suffer in the belief it will reduce serious abuse. “If you fail to stop the little things, you’re literally encouraging people to do this,” said Hilina Berhanu, 22, who is part of the Yellow Movement fighting for women’s rights at Addis Ababa University and president of another group, Women for Change. There is uncertainty over the rates of abuse against women in Ethiopia due to inadequate data collection and under-reporting. A 2013 government report said 50-60% of all women had experienced domestic violence. It found “the underlying cause is the low level of status given to women in society coupled with the dominant position of men further justified by culture and religion”. The activists say the government’s attitude towards violence against women is mixed. Although the state has made strides in empowering women economically and reducing harmful practices, such as female genital mutilation, police and judges remain largely unresponsive. “Rape is not taken seriously by the police,” Ruth Bekele, another activist, says. “I was going to report one case and was told ‘we have 1,000 rape cases this week’. It’s like they don’t care.” She also believes violence against women needs to be more severely punished. “When someone slaps a woman they should get a big sentence, but here they will probably tell you not to do it again,” she says. “Today’s a slap and tomorrow’s a murder – I think that is what’s allowing people to go out and do worse.” The Yellow Movement was started by a law lecturer and students following the case of Aberash Hailay, a flight attendant who had her eyes gouged out by her jealous former husband in 2011. The group regularly discusses rights and sexuality with students at the university and is working to promote girls’ education by fundraising to provide sanitary items and stationery for girls who can’t afford them. “When you want to fight violence you have to empower people,” Berhanu says. “It’s not just about negative issues.” Women for Change, which began in September 2013, holds events where successful businesswomen talk about their path to the top. Bekele, who is part of the group, is also talking to a gallery about holding an exhibition to “fight violence through art”. Every Saturday, the Justice for Hanna campaigners visit a state school to give language lessons to poor-performing children, discuss women’s rights issues with them and develop a club to discuss gender equality. But it is going to take more to change ingrained attitudes on the streets from some men who still think rape is a woman’s fault. “Women are most responsible for rapes as they ask for it,” says Tadele Tagota, a married 42-year-old grocer in Addis. Provocative dressing and promiscuous behaviour from teenage girls leads to controversial sexual encounters, he believes. Some men have questioned whether Hanna had a relationship with one of her rapists. “Now it’s been blown up, but if she hadn’t died, it would not have been a big issue,” says Zacharias Haile, a 30-year-old civil servant.A young off-duty police officer, who asked to remain anonymous because of the nature of his work, says under-reporting adds to the problem. He says families can hide or punish young teenagers to avoid shame when they report sexual assault by relatives. “Even if you get evidence, everyone is protecting each other as they don’t want to lose social standing,” he says. Attitudes like these show “how weak society’s awareness about gender-based violence is and its consequences”, says Mussie. “Victim blaming is very common.” Tejnesh is now living in Addis with her aunt. Three men are now in custody for her attack. Campaigners have raised £980 for medical treatment, and a wheelchair has been purchased from the US, where they are cheaper. The Justice for Hanna group gave her a mattress so she could sit more comfortably. The challenge for activists now is to keep up the momentum for action. Bouts of national soul-searching following previous horrific incidents – such as that of Hailay – fizzled out quickly. This time will be different, they vow. “We all made a commitment. We said we are not going to quit,” Hailemariam says.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/27/ethiopia-women-violence-rape-murder,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/27/ethiopia-women-violence-rape-murder

The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said efforts to halt infestations over the past two years – at a cost of $28.8m – could be undone if an extra $10.6m was not provided urgently. “We need the money as soon as possible because ... with the current available funding, we cannot pursue activities in the field after the end of February,” said Annie Monard, coordinator of the FAO emergency response to the locust plague. The plague started in 2012 and the Indian Ocean island’s government declared a national disaster, as locusts infested more than half the cultivated land and pastures. As part of a joint 2013-16 anti-locust programme with the government, the FAO surveyed more than 30m hectares (74m acres) – an area almost the size of Japan – and controlled locust infestations over 1.3m hectares using pesticides and biopesticides. It said the plague was successfully halted last year.
But “the risks of relapse are high during the rainy season, which provides ideal breeding conditions”, the agency said. The rainy season ends in May. Monard said the FAO had made it clear to donors from the start that the programme would require a three-year financial commitment to stop the plague and push the locusts back into their traditional habitat in the south-west. However since then, the global situation had changed and this had affected funding, she said. “There are many more humanitarian crises around the world now than there were in early 2013. [Donors] have to face a number of high-level humanitarian crises and the situation in Madagascar is no longer in first place.” The FAO said it was especially critical to act in the first quarter of the year as the second generation of breeding was taking place with adults laying eggs, and hoppers, or wingless nymphs, developing. These hoppers are easier to eradicate as they are more sensitive to pesticides and move more slowly than winged adults. “Taking action now is critical to ensure the significant efforts made so far, financially and technically, are built upon rather than lost,” said Dominique Burgeon, director of the FAO’s emergency and rehabilitation division. Locusts are a type of grasshopper and can fly long distances in swarms that vary from less than one square kilometre to several hundred square kilometres. Each square kilometre can contain at least 40 million and sometimes as many as 80 million adult locusts. The FAO said up to 40% of crops in Madagascar were at risk from the locusts and from the droughts and cyclones that regularly batter the island. Already, more than three-quarters of people in the Atsimo Andrefana and Androy regions face food insecurity as maize and cassava production have declined sharply while rice output remains below trend.
“There are recurrent food security issues in Madagascar; any major pest or major issue like drought or hurricanes can affect an already poor situation,” Monard said. About 9 million people, out of a total population of 23.5 million, depend directly on agriculture for food and income in Madagascar, where development has also been hampered by persistent political uncertainty, most recently since a coup in 2009. Last week, the International Monetary Fund said growth could rise to 5% this year from an estimated 3% in 2014, but that uncertainty linked to political instability, weak institutions and weak governance had eroded the foundation for solid economic growth. “The costs that will result from ceasing locust control activities will be far greater than the amount spent so far, so it is critical for the international community to stay the course,” said Patrice Takoukam Talla, the FAO’s representative in Madagascar.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/27/madagascar-locusts-united-nations-food-agriculture-organisation,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/27/madagascar-locusts-united-nations-food-agriculture-organisation
2015-01-27T00:05:19Z,global-development,Global development,"UK aid risks promoting US models of democracy, MPs say","The Department for International Development’s (DfID) extensive use of US organisations to strengthen parliaments in developing countries risks using British taxpayers’ money to promote “less accountable” American-style political systems at the expense of those based on the Westminster model, MPs have warned. In a report published on Tuesday, the International Development Committee acknowledges that DfID is a major contributor to parliamentary strengthening – spending around £22.5m bilaterally last year – but urges it to ensure its long-term aid is being spent effectively by putting parliaments “at the heart of its governance work” and taking a more “hands-on approach” to the issue. It expresses surprise at the extent to which the department relies on US organisations to build up parliaments, noting that “paradoxically DfID makes significantly more use of US than UK organisations”. According to the report, seven of the current 37 parliament strengthening projects went to US managing agents, while only three went to Westminster providers. A list of key DfID suppliers shows that US-based organisations account for more than 55% of the department’s spending on parliamentary strengthening projects. “We were told that extensive use of US organisations risks using UK taxpayer money to promote US models of democracy in Commonwealth countries,” says the committee. “For example in Kenya, the State University of New York’s Centre for International Development was funded by a number of donors, including DfID and USAid, to do parliamentary strengthening work. Subsequent to this work, Kenya adopted a new constitution in 2010 with a US-style presidential model in place of its previous Westminster model.” While the UK does not “explicitly promote its national parliamentary traditions”, says the report, the situation is very different in the US, where USAid set up the Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening (Cepps) programme to provide funding for US institutions to work together to promote democracy in its country programmes. “The Cepps and National Endowment for Democracy programmes provide some US institutions with an advantage over UK institutions; they have been effectively subsidised by US taxpayers to become powerful institutions well-positioned to win DfID tenders,” says the report. “In contrast, Westminster institutions are largely unable to win bids for US money spent on promoting democracy since much of the money is reserved for core US institutions.” The committee concedes that there are advantages to using large organisations such as the UN Development Programme (UNDP) when several donors are involved in parliamentary strengthening projects, or when they are taking place in fragile and conflict-affected states. But it recommends that DfID support the development of UK suppliers and “substantially increase” its use of them over the next five years. The DfID annual report shows that the EU accounts for more than a quarter or all the department’s multilateral expenditure – “largely core funding over which DfID has little control” – while DfID provided almost £250m to the UNDP last year. The committee says it is “seriously concerned” by some of the criticisms it has heard over EU commissioning in the area, “including the use of non-specialist contractors which are adept at navigating the institutions’ labyrinthine procurement procedures and its willingness to pay far more than is needed”. Given that the UK taxpayer contributes about 15% of the money the EU spends on parliamentary strengthening, says the committee, DfID should look into the allegations “and in the light of its findings press for reform”. Sir Malcolm Bruce MP, the Liberal Democrat chair of the committee, said: “There is a demand for expertise from the ‘Westminster brand’, especially from Commonwealth countries, but funds are funnelled through large providers in other countries rather than smaller expert organisations. More thought should be given to the ‘supply-side’ and how to build UK institutions into world class providers.” Bruce said that while DfID had made improvements, it still needed to focus more on helping to forge robust parliaments to reduce poverty, conflict and corruption, and to increase accountability and security. He added: “Though difficult with frequent setbacks, strengthening parliaments in developing countries has the potential to realise these benefits at relatively low cost.” A DfID spokeswoman said the UK had designed and implemented more than 37 programmes to strengthen parliaments in 21 countries in a bid to help governments be more accountable and better equipped to tackle poverty. She added that the concerns identified in the report would be raised with the European Commission. “Strong and accountable parliaments can be a vital part of a country’s path out of poverty,” said the spokeswoman. “We work with country experts and partners to deliver effective governance based upon a country’s individual needs.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/27/uk-aid-department-for-international-development-usaid,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/27/uk-aid-department-for-international-development-usaid
2015-01-26T15:50:34Z,global-development,Global development,Ukraine at war: 'People feel abandoned' | Emilie Rouvroy,"The fighting has intensified dramatically since last week and the situation here is deteriorating rapidly. In the past five days, there has been heavy fighting. We hear the constant boom of shelling and crackle of shooting. More than 70 houses are reported to have been damaged or destroyed in the last week, and several hospitals have been damaged since the fighting began in the summer. In recent days, a building of a psychiatric institution that we’re supporting was destroyed by shelling. It’s getting more complicated to get into the areas caught in the conflict. Last week the checkpoints to cross into the rebel-controlled areas were closed and no one has been allowed to pass. Medical supply lines have been cut and little medicine is getting through, as has been the case for months. When Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) started working here in May, we focused on supplying hospitals on the frontline with kits to treat war injuries. Obviously, when you’re in a conflict zone, the frontline is where the people are being seriously injured and killed. After months of stress on the health system, it is clear that the conflict is having an impact on the whole population of the area. Basic healthcare, maternity care, treatment of chronic diseases; everything is affected. When you go to the hospitals or primary healthcare centres, many are empty because the doctors don’t have enough medicines. As soon as we get any supplies, we distribute them. But it’s not enough. The biggest problem is that there are no more psychiatric drugs, and no anaesthetic drugs we need for surgery. The doctors are desperate for supplies.
It’s not just medicines. I’ve visited orphanages and homes for the elderly and physically and mentally disabled, and I’ve seen people who are weak and are not getting enough food. They’re relying on donations and the goodwill of the people around them, but they’re hanging on by a thread. They’ll receive a bag of potatoes one day, and a cabbage another. When you visit the kitchen, there is always some food on the stove but the fridges are empty. The director of one of the old people’s homes we visited last week burst into tears in front of us: “We are still here, we are trying,” she said, “but we’re treating people with words.” There are shortages of everything: cleaning materials, soap, even nappies. If you don’t have nappies, then you have thousands of people in care homes, orphanages and hospices for disabled people, sleeping and living in their excrement all day. But they can’t be found in the market any more. We’ve ordered more than 10,000, but it will never be enough because you need millions. And now that movements into the conflict zone have been stopped, it’s even worse. Months of protracted fighting have had a huge psychological impact on people living on both sides of the frontline. A town I visited recently, around 500 metres from the frontline, has been shelled repeatedly. Houses have been destroyed, the electricity has been cut off and the people are traumatised.
The head doctor of the hospital asked us to help his staff because they’re so stressed that they can’t treat patients. We’ve just sent our team of psychologists and we’re hoping to expand our mental health work. In another town located 10km (around six miles) from the frontline, I met the mayor. He was crying as I was speaking to him; the situation is just too hard. Since then, there has been more shelling and we are going back to donate some supplies for treating war-wounded patients, as well as blankets and hygiene materials. People living here have not received their pensions in six months. People have run out of money, and there is no longer any industry. This war has destroyed so much. Doctors are still working, and some of them walk more than an hour each day because they don’t have the money to pay for transport. But they’re working for free, they haven’t been paid for more than six months. The only thing keeping the system going is the commitment and dedication of the community and the medical staff. That type of solidarity is impressive to witness, but you can’t ask people to continue like this for months on end. People are just holding on. If it goes on like this, it’s only a matter of time before they just collapse. There are many terrible things about this conflict, but one of the hardest things is that people feel abandoned. They’re grateful that we’re here, but wherever we go they ask us: “Where is everybody?Where are the journalists? Where is the international community? People are dying here every day.” • Emilie Rouvroy is MSF’s coordinator in Luhansk, eastern Ukraine",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/26/ukraine-war-people-abandoned-medecins-sans-frontieres,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/26/ukraine-war-people-abandoned-medecins-sans-frontieres
2015-01-26T14:27:26Z,global-development,Global development,Grief and anger in Congo follow violent protests against Joseph Kabila,"Arms crossed and hands on shoulders, Hortense Basila let out a moan that rose from deep inside and filled her eyes with tears. “My child!” she cried. “When will I see him again? Oh my God. May they give me my child back. My son, my Christian. We are poor people. What have we done?” Christian, 24, was shot in the head and killed during four days of violent anti-government protests that rocked the Democratic Republic of the Congo last week. He had not been involved in the demonstration but had gone out to buy medicine when he was caught in the crossfire. On Friday, Basila rose from a plastic chair under a tree in her dusty front yard and staggered forward, arms stretched wide as if pleading. A friend moved in close to console her, saying softly: “Stop crying. You told us to be united. You are a believer. Don’t lose your faith. Ask God to strengthen you.” The single mother slumped to the floor, her back against the wall of her three-room concrete house in the impoverished Ngiri-Ngiri neighbourhood of the capital, Kinshasa. “My child that I loved too much,” she continued to sob, speaking French. “I had 12 children but he was one of my best. He was not a politician. He was someone trying to manage his life.”
The nationwide unrest was sparked by a parliamentary bill seen as a ploy to extend the rule of Congo’s divisive president, Joseph Kabila. At least 42 people were killed by security forces, according to the International Federation of Human Rights, while the government put the death toll at 14 including one police officer. Panicked authorities cut off internet access for two days. The week of turmoil in sub-Saharan Africa’s biggest country prompted some to draw parallels with last year’s revolution in Burkina Faso. But by last Friday Congo’s senate appeared to bow to the protests, scrapping plans for a national census that would have made it necessary to postpone the 2016 presidential election and effectively keep Kabila in power for years. Senate president Leon Kenga Wa Dondo said: “We have listened to the street. That is why the vote today is a historic vote.” Hundreds of students took to the streets to celebrate, but none of it could comfort Basila, who was still waiting to see her son’s body four days after his death. Another son, Luxene, 19, and a friend, 37-year-old Bolonda Matunona, tried to gain access to the body at a hospital but were arrested and have not been seen since, say family members, who fear the pair will be tortured. Christian, an unemployed security guard and bricklayer, attended church regularly and enjoyed judo, said Basila. “He did not belong to any political party. We are poor: we plant vegetables, we sell maize and oil and eat. We don’t know anything about politics. All he was trying to do was survive and enjoy life.” Last Monday Christian awoke feeling ill with hypertension. He told his grandmother he was going out to get medicine from the local chemist. As street demonstrations erupted in what is an opposition stronghold, he was hit in the head by a police bullet. Christian had been taken to a medical centre and was about to be moved to hospital but, according to his sister, his body was then abandoned because of more police shooting. Basila said: “May God forgive the police officer. I can’t condemn him. I’m feeling pain. I feel in danger. I’ve lost all desire to live in my own country. The government is responsible now. I don’t have any money and my child was innocent. The government has to take care of the funeral fees.” Asked for her views on Kabila, she replied: “That’s not my problem. I have lost my child. All the rest is bullshit.” Kabila, 43, a former taxi driver, has been dubbed an “accidental president” after taking power in 2001 following the assassination of his father, Laurent. He won a second five-year mandate at disputed elections in 2011 but is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term next year. With several African leaders nearing their term limits, notably Paul Kagame in neighbouring Rwanda, the war of attrition in this vast, mineral-rich nation is being closely watched across the continent.
Congolese security forces used brutal tactics to crush dissent during and after the last election and it seems little has changed. Opposition MP Martin Fayulu, one of the organisers of last Monday’s demonstrations, said police had opened fire after a crowd he estimated at 30,000 refused to stop marching towards them. His shirt was stained with blood after people near him were shot. “No protester was armed but when they saw us coming, they started shooting,” he said. “A police officer warned me that they don’t want to arrest you, they want to injure you badly, or put you in a car and abuse you. I had a shirt with the name of my party on it. I removed it and wore only an undershirt.” Later, Fayulu claimed, he went to a hospital to give food to the injured but heard the police calling for armed support. He left quickly and three minutes later police began firing, causing more bloodshed. “It’s not acceptable,” he said. “They are acting on the president’s orders. It is a sign of desperation.” Fayulu, leader of the small Commitment for Citizenship and Democracy party, believes that despite Friday’s setback in the senate, Kabila will try other methods to buy time in office, such as organising local elections and dividing opposition provinces. But last year Burkina Faso’s president, Blaise Compaore, was forced from power after 27 years when he tried to change the constitution to extend his mandate. Fayulu said: “That’s what we are aiming for. People are saying the Congolese are not like Burkina Faso but they have demonstrated. The international community needs to take the lead in putting the two sides together. The constitution should be respected. We cannot continue to kill people.” The US, France and UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon have called on Kabila’s government to show restraint in handling the protests and urged the presidential elections to be held on schedule. On Friday, life in Kinshasa, a dilapidated tropical capital of 9 million people, returned to something like normal although armed soldiers and police crowded into pickup trucks outside the parliament building.
Albert Moleka, cabinet director of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, the biggest opposition party, put the week’s death toll at 48. He also believes the senate vote will not end the instability. He fears local elections will be used as an excuse to allow Kabila’s term limit to slide. “His camp doesn’t have one strategy but one objective: Kabila must stay. For how long even they don’t know.” The government has predicted economic growth of 10.4% this year, one of the highest rates in the world, but this has only intensified frustrations among millions of unemployed people. Describing the public mood, Moleka continued: “Anger. It’s a general condition. Extreme poverty, no job creation. This is the failure of the regime. If they don’t get their act together, it could be another Burkina Faso very soon. Kabila made his sprint too early; it’s a marathon, not 100 metres.” Asked whether the president would choose fight or flight in such a crisis, Moleka replied: “Two weeks ago I would have told you I think Kabila will value his own life. But after what happened this week, you have to look at how many casualties there were. I would say that 48 dead changes a lot of things; you can’t tell me 48 dead is equal to one article of the law. I think he’s going to fight to the end.” Government spokesman Lambert Mende claimed that such death tolls were wildly exaggerated for political gain. “It is a game here whenever such events occur,” he said. “Opposition and NGOs take opportunities to discredit the government.” He denied that police had opened fire on unarmed demonstrators. “It is a lie. They died within private property that they were looting, or when the police were repelling them trying to invade the parliament.” Mende denied that Kabila has ambitions to cling to power beyond next year. “It is a false accusation. President Kabila has never told me he wants to run for a third term. It’s written in the constitution that no one can run three times. He says he will respect the constitution. “You think we are in Burkina Faso? Kabila will end his term in 2016. That is all. He was elected for five years and that is what he will serve. People are dreaming. It is the petty politics of the opposition seeking attention.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/26/democratic-republic-congo-protests-joseph-kabila,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/26/democratic-republic-congo-protests-joseph-kabila

Her face wears an expression of exhaustion and resignation. In a small hotel room in the eastern city of Dharan, she sits on a bed staring into space as her husband puts their belongings into a bag. “We have a long journey back,” Anita says. “A full three days from here to my village of Pathekha. Two days on a bus, and then a day walking.” That was how long it took for her to get to a hospital after her miscarriage two years ago. “The travel is very difficult, and most people avoid it.” It’s why she had a home birth, like most women in her village. “I was so young. I did not even realise I was in labour.” Her voice cracks slightly. “There was no one to help me, to tell me what to expect or do.” Her husband remains quiet and stares out of the window. “It wasn’t my fault. I didn’t realise those were labour pains. I thought I was ill, and I just waited.” The prolonged labour led to further complications and left her with a severe obstetric fistula – a hole between the vagina and the rectum or bladder, which leaves a woman incontinent. Though exact numbers are hard to come by, it is estimated that hundreds of women in Nepal’s rural hinterlands are afflicted with this condition because of inadequate maternal care, underage pregnancy, or prolonged or obstructed labour. Its consequences are crippling as it leaves them unable to control their bodily functions or perform even the most basic tasks. Most live with it for years, finding themselves shunned by their families and the community, and forced to isolate themselves. Some, like Anita, are left crippled and weak, unable to work or live normal lives. “It broke my heart,” says Anita’s husband. “We were days from happiness. A child – our dream. But instead we found months of illness and suffering.” Anita picks up her bags and leaves the room. “She hasn’t been the same since,” he says. “This is a poor woman’s problem,” says Dr Mohan Chandra Regmi as he conducts his morning rounds in the immaculately clean maternity ward at the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences (BPKIHS) in Dharan. The ward is filled with young mothers from across the region, and some even from cities in India. The institute has developed an excellent reputation for maternity care, and in particular the treatment of obstetric fistula. A patient, Mohan says, is “typically a woman who doesn’t get proper antenatal care, who was married very young, and who doesn’t have proper education, who doesn’t know where to go. She hasn’t been to any hospital or health centre, and she tries delivering at home. She ends up having labour for several days, after which quite often she can develop obstetric fistula.” The BPKIHS is one of three facilities in Nepal that are certified to provide care for fistula patients, a neglected problem until a few years ago. “We expect a backlog of between 5,000 to 10,000 existing cases across the country, with several hundred new cases being added every year,” Mohan says.
Stigma and geography – women having to travel a long way to a health centre – are the main reasons that prevent many from seeking assistance. “We need more facilities, more doctors, and more educational programmes in rural areas,” Mohan says as he walks round the maternity wards. “In Nepal, about two-thirds of women still deliver outside a health facility.” By the age of 20 some women have already delivered three or four children, but a woman’s body isn’t fully developed until she is 18-20, he says. “Research shows that girls who have teenage pregnancies are more likely to have complications, more likely even to have maternal death.” Susan Lama, head nurse in the operating theatre, says more community awareness is needed. “We have our own programmess here at BPKIHS. We go to different villages and conduct outreach clinics and educate health workers. We have educational documentaries, and brochures.” Mohan says a nationwide programme is needed to address this issue. Last year, the Nepalese government finally allocated funds for the eradication of fistula, after almost four years’ campaigning by international organisations such as the UN population fund, UNFPA, to make it a national priority. Beena Kathayat, a 46-year-old woman from Khotang district, has lived with fistula for more than 26 years and undergone five surgeries to resolve it. In the process she lost not only her husband and her family, but also her links to her community. “It changed everything,” Beena says from her home in Dharan’s Ammar Basti slum. “I lost everything.” The operations helped, but could not solve the problem. “There isn’t much that they can do for me now,” she adds with resignation. “But I try to help other women, and warn them about the dangers.” As she says this, a young woman enters the room and introduces herself as Radhika. “Radhika has been living with me – I gave her a home when we met at the fistula ward. She has no family, and now I am hers and she is mine.” Radhika was married at 12, and became pregnant when she was 16. Her body could not handle the prolonged labour; the local health worker had misdiagnosed her condition and she developed fistula after the stillbirth of the baby. “I have undergone four operations,” she says. “I am a lot better now.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/26/nepal-obstetric-fistula-women,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/26/nepal-obstetric-fistula-women
2015-01-26T07:00:02Z,global-development,Global development,Why fragile cities hold the key to stability and development | John Vidal,"As some of the world’s large cities turn themselves around and thrive – just 600 now account for two-thirds of global GDP – countless smaller and medium-sized cities, mainly in Africa, Latin America and Asia, are descending deeper into violence and becoming less liveable, says a leading Latin American urban specialist. In a new paper in Foreign Affairs, Robert Muggah, research director at the Igarapé Institute in Brazil, says anarchy now rules in some places. “North, Central, and South America [are] home to a staggering 45 of the world’s 50 most dangerous metropolises. In some ways, fast-expanding cities such as Acapulco in Mexico, Caracas in Venezuela, Maceió in Brazil, and San Pedro Sula in Honduras are harbingers of what’s to come in the rest of the southern hemisphere.” The reason some cities spiral into perpetual crisis while others prosper may come down to mayors and city authorities rather than to national governments, he argues. “The city and not the state will determine stability and development in the coming decades. Civic planners in the world’s largest metropolises have learned how to make urban spaces safer and more liveable, allowing cities to recover, thanks to new approaches to policing and social investment,” he says. The first step towards making cities less dangerous and more liveable is improved communication. “In some places, mayors have opened a lively dialogue with vulnerable communities about gang violence and factors that drive it such as extreme income inequality, inadequate service provision, and weak or corrupt police and justice institutions. “This kind of honest dialogue is essential for identifying shared priorities and deploying scarce resources most efficiently. Mayors such as Enrique Peñalosa in Bogotá, Rodrigo Guerrero in Cali, and Antonio Villaraigosa in Los Angeles have all shown that a radical change of approach is possible.” Another solution is to bring fragile cities together with healthier and wealthier ones to share experience. Twinning initiatives from the 1950s onwards partnered North American cities with war-damaged European ones to aid with reconstruction. More recent initiatives have teamed US cities with African ones, Australian cities with those in the South Pacific islands, and Canadian cities with Latin American municipalities. Large foundations are getting in on the act by contributing to initiatives that enable the world’s municipal leaders to share ideas and tackle broader international challenges. “Strengthening cities requires greater attention not just to specific spaces, but also to specific groups of people. Young unemployed men with a criminal record are statistically more likely to violate the law than other residents who have not committed crimes. Indeed, only about 0.5% of people generally account for up to 75% of homicidal violence in major cities. But instead of locking up and stigmatising young men, municipal officials should support them. Proven remedies include mediation to interrupt violence between rival gangs, targeted education and recreation projects for at-risk teenagers, and counselling and childcare support for single-parent households. “The most far-reaching strategy for strengthening fragile cities involves investment in measures to boost social cohesion and mobility. Investments in reliable public transportation, inclusive public spaces, and pro-poor social policies can go a long way toward improving safety,” says Muggah. “There are many examples of how to drive down crime, but Medellín provides the most convincing case of how to do it best. During the 1990s, it was the murder capital of the world. But a succession of mayors beginning with Sergio Fajardo turned things around by focusing their attention on the poorest and most dangerous neighbourhoods. They connected the city’s slums to middle-class areas by a network of cable cars, bus transport systems, and first-class infrastructure. By 2011, homicidal violence declined by about 80%, and in 2012, Medellín was named the city of the year.” He says there are signs that “new technologies can play a decisive role, too”. Information communication technologies are already closing the digital divide between and within urban centres. New smart cities that have begun to take advantage of these tools include Tanzania’s Kigamboni, an administrative ward of the capital, Dar es Salaam, Congo’s Cité du Fleuve, Kenya’s Tatu and Kozo Tech, Ghana’s Hope City and Nigeria’s Eko Atlantic developments. In India, says Muggah, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced plans to create 100 smart cities over the next two decades, adding to India’s growing tally of “tech-friendly” urban centres like Ahmedabad, Aurangabad, Khushkhera, Kochi, Manesar, Ponneri and Tumkur. “Investments in hard and soft technologies are fuelling a virtuous cycle by supplying cities with yet more new talent and consolidating their place as hubs of innovation and connectivity. “To turn fragile cities around, public authorities, businesses, and civic groups must come to grips with the risks that will come with rapid urbanisation but also with the many available solutions. This means starting a conversation about what works and what doesn’t and sharing these findings globally. Successful mayors in developing countries will need to use lessons learned around the world to solve local problems. The more proactive among them are already doing so,” he concludes.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/26/fragile-cities-stability-development-robert-muggah,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/26/fragile-cities-stability-development-robert-muggah

But this battle is being won at a great price. We have fought a hard fight. We salute our fallen heroes and everyone who has helped in one way or the other. But despite the decrease in the infection rate and increase in numbers surviving the virus, fear, panic and worries are in no way fading in people’s lives. “Until we are told that we are Ebola-free in this country and our surrounding neighbours, we cannot be OK because you never know what will happen, just one confirmed case is a disaster,” says Edward Koroma Jr, a local volunteer, who travelled back to his home village from the city to help sensitise people about Ebola after he lost his sister to the virus. He told me he did not want any of his people in the village to experience what his sister experienced and that no family member should go through what they went through.Nevertheless, people are highly optimistic that this virus will end soon if we continue this decrease in the infection rate. The elimination of the virus must happen not just at the top of society – ordinary people have stood up to protect their own communities. Every village in this part of the country has a checkpoint which is managed by local volunteers. Before you are allowed to get through, you have to give your name, where you are from and where you are going. Then your temperature is taken. If your temperature is higher than normal, you will be asked to sit for a while and then do another check later. If it is still the same then they will have to involve the health workers. Paul is one of those volunteers who is giving up his time to help protect his community. He is just 17 years old and came back to his parents in the village after the Ebola virus closed our schools. He told me of his sister’s pregnancy and he clearly believes it is because she has been sitting and doing nothing at home. In Sierra Leone, teenage pregnancy is one of the more pervasive problems affecting the health, social, economic and political progress and empowerment of women and girls, even before Ebola. Just like Paul’s sister, many other girls have got pregnant. Even my neighbour’s daughter, who had a great future ahead of her, is now sitting at home pregnant. One district alone has had about 187 teenagers who have got pregnant during this Ebola crisis. We need to do a lot to stop this, or we are going to have a very small number of girls in schools when they reopen. Just as this virus exposed our weak health system, as well as other sectors in our country, we must not allow social issues like these to remain the way they are after Ebola. This outbreak has brought so many difficulties. As we are kicking this virus with all our remaining strength and efforts, we still have something else to worry about: hardship. Many who had been the main provider have been taken away from their families by the silent hand of death, or now live without a job to support their families. We look forward again to the moment when things can either go back to the way they were before, or perhaps even be better. Things were difficult before Ebola and the worry is that they are going to get harder after it. It’s a good thing we were not left alone to carry this epidemic because there was no way we could get this far just by ourselves. We still have a long way to go in trying to end this virus, we still have those who are afraid of going to hospitals, and as a result of this a great number of people are dying from curable sicknesses. This work has brought tears, pains, panic, stress upon me and many, but the fight is worth it; every life is important. It’s not been easy but the success stories of survivals have had a very big impact in trying to end this virus. It has been impossibly hard, as people have seen their loved ones taken away never to return. But, as we began having survivors, the story started to change. Now that we have reached more than 2,000 survivors, these great people, in spite of all the trauma and stigmatisation they went through, have played leading roles in encouraging many others to attend hospitals. Survivors who have integrated back into their communities are now trying to resume their normal lives with the help of the government, international organisations and local NGOs. 2014 and 2015 will be years we will always remember, especially survivors and those who lost loved ones. We must not forget our mistakes, our responsibilities as a country, a region and the world at large to make this place we call home a better place – not just for the rich and privileged, but also for the very poor.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/24/life-ebola-frontline-success-stories-survivors,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/24/life-ebola-frontline-success-stories-survivors
2015-01-23T17:13:04Z,global-development,Global development,Liberia schools to reopen amid warnings that hard work on Ebola is far from done,"It would be a “colossal mistake” for the world to abandon the west African countries worst-affected by the Ebola epidemic in the premature belief that the disease has been beaten into retreat, the Liberian government has warned. Speaking as the World Health Organisation (WHO) released figures showing a continuing fall in cases in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, Liberia’s information minister, Lewis Brown, asked the international community to honour its financial commitments to the region and help it rebuild its shattered health systems. While cases of Ebola in Liberia have fallen from a peak of more than 300 a week in August and September to eight last week, Brown said there was no room for complacency. “This is a virus which, given our sociology and health infrastructure, could spread again very, very quickly,” he said. “So we have to make sure that no one has any false sense that the hard work’s done. “It’s about literally rebuilding our health infrastructure and giving health workers the tools and the resources they need so we can deal with epidemics of this size should they ever occur. We don’t want to get rid of one epidemic and be waiting for the next one to happen.” Brown echoed the pleas made earlier this week by the UN’s response coordinator, Dr David Nabarro, who asked the world to pay the last third of the $1.5bn (£1bn) it has pledged to defeat Ebola. “David Nabarro called on the world to make good their commitment to our country,” he said. “It would be a colossal mistake to abandon Liberia and our neighbours at this time in the belief that it’s all done. Lives will be lost to the virus that could have been spared.” Despite the caveats, however, the Liberian government is pressing on with plans to reopen the country’s 5,000 public and private schools, which have been closed since the end of July. Neighbouring Guinea has reopened its schools, while Sierra Leone has announced that classes will resume in March. Brown said the decison to open Liberia’s schools again on 2 February had not been taken lightly. “There will always be arguments that it’s too early; that parents do not have enough [resources]; that schools may not altogether be ready, but it’s a decision that’s squarely in sync with the progress that we’ve made,” he said. “But more than that, it’s generally good for the psyche of the nation.” The government has spent between $8m and $10m to date on making schools as Ebola-proof as possible. When the country’s 373,723 students return to their classrooms next month, said Brown, they will find handwashing stations on all school campuses and have their temperatures taken at least twice a day. Ambulances will be on standby and teachers will be trained to keep a close eye on their students’ health, and to conduct random temperature checks. “Some people are rightly worried about this but, once these measures are in place, parents won’t have to keep their kids at home and the children will be in a controlled environment where teachers are trained to monitor not just their educational progress but also their health,” said Brown. According to WHO figures, Ebola has killed more than 3,600 people in Liberia and claimed nearly 8,650 lives around the world since it erupted in Guinea in December 2013. The true toll, though, is likely to be far higher, since the statistics include only reported cases and deaths that have been officially recorded. The Liberian government does not know exactly how many schoolchildren have died, but it is estimated that more than 3,000 children have been orphaned. Brown said those who have lost their parents are receiving counselling and efforts are being made to trace relatives to care for them. Brown, who described Ebola as the worst crisis Liberia has endured since the end of its 14-year civil war in 2003, admitted that the return to school would be painful for many. “We don’t expect it to be the greatest moment our children will have, but we’re hoping that like all traumatic events, time and constructive programmes will help to heal all of us,” he said. “We’re still a deeply traumatised country and we’re not fully out of the woods yet,” he said. “We’ve lost friends and loved ones but, more than that, we saw the depths to which our humanity can sink: we’ve had regular folks lying on the ground in front of very limited treatment units, literally praying that someone will die overnight so that they can have the bed space. We think these progressive actions will heal more than they will hurt.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/23/liberia-schools-reopen-ebola-warnings-guinea-sierra-leone,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/23/liberia-schools-reopen-ebola-warnings-guinea-sierra-leone
2015-01-23T14:15:02Z,global-development,Global development,Boko Haram violence leaves Nigeria with highest civilian death toll in African war zones,"The campaign of terror by Nigeria’s Islamist insurgency Boko Haram was responsible for nearly half of all civilian deaths in African war zones last year, according to research that highlights the group’s tactic of targeting non-combatants. Fighting associated with Boko Haram killed 6,347 civilians in 2014, said the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (Acled), an academic group that uses media reports to monitor violence in conflicts. The number of civilians killed in areas such as Nigeria, Central African Republic (CAR) and South Sudan rose by 30% last year to 13,508 deaths, the group said. Boko Haram, which means “western education is forbidden”, is trying to form its own state in northern Nigeria under a strict interpretation of Islamic law. This month, the group carried out its deadliest attack to date, killing up to 2,000 people in one day. Nigeria, CAR and South Sudan had the highest number of civilian casualties last year, Acled’s data showed.
More than 1 million people are thought to have been displaced by Boko Haram as civilians flee their homes fearing violence, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). The refugees are joining camps in neighbouring Cameroon, Chad and Niger, raising the prospect of a regional humanitarian crisis, IOM said. Behind the continent’s soaring death tolls and displacement rates are militias with political ambitions, as in South Sudan, and militant Islamist groups, such as Boko Haram and Somalia’s al-Shabaab, which target civilians to gain attention and demonstrate strength, said Clionadh Raleigh, director of Acled. “Through the actions of these political militias and political elites it appears that civilians are quite expendable. They’re a way to relay information about your relative strength in a conflict environment,” said Raleigh. “In order to be taken seriously, you either have to engage with the military, which I think a lot of them don’t necessarily want to do, or you can make trouble for the government – and that trouble often comes down to attacking civilians.” Experts say Nigeria’s election, scheduled for 14 February, has already been affected by violence perpetrated by Boko Haram. Writing in the Guardian, Comfort Ero, Africa director of the International Crisis Group, said: “The insurgents are hampering the work of the independent national electoral commission and have already forced it to halt elections in high-risk areas of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states. [They] may seize more communities – and more voters – before the polls.” In CAR, 2,116 civilians were killed last year, said Acled, following clashes that erupted two years ago when Seleka Muslims and anti-balaka Christians became engulfed in a conflict that shows no signs of abating. In South Sudan’s civil war, political leaders pitted ethnic Nuers against Dinkas, causing 1,817 civilian deaths in 2014, according to Acled. The data also revealed that battles between Somalia’s government and al-Shabaab led to 4,425 deaths last year, including 633 civilians. Al-Shabaab is losing ground against the Somali government and African Union forces, but the group managed to carry out deadly attacks last year. “What you often find is that groups that are losing large amounts of territory, who are clearly losing the war, will tend to take that out on civilians,” said Raleigh. Nigeria, South Sudan and Somalia were the bloodiest conflicts on the continent when combatants and deaths from riots and protests were included, Acled data showed. Acled monitors reports by media organisations, civil society groups and human rights watchdogs to compile information on deaths in African countries. It cautions that actual death tolls could be much higher, particularly in countries where media access is limited, as is the case in South Sudan. The organisation, founded in 1997, also notes that more media reports in recent years have led to more accurate coverage, meaning that previous death tolls might have been higher than reported.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/23/boko-haram-nigeria-civilian-death-toll-highest-acled-african-war-zones,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/23/boko-haram-nigeria-civilian-death-toll-highest-acled-african-war-zones
2015-01-23T13:15:20Z,global-development,Global development,Why the gender employment gap hampers prosperity | Kasia Staszewska,"It’s that time of the year again: in the mountains above Zurich, the global elite, mostly men, gather for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) to discuss the state of the world and the global economy. But while this year’s Outlook on the Global Agenda report cites income inequality and growth in unemployment as the most pressing of the top 10 trends for 2015, and prominent women rue the lack of female voices in the boardroom, the issue of women’s economic inequality remains largely out of the spotlight. To reveal the scale of this crisis, ActionAid has calculated the cost to women of inequality in pay and rates of employment. Our new briefing paper Close the gap! shows that women in poor countries could be a staggering $9tn better off if their pay and access to paid work were equal to those of men. ActionAid used data from the International Labour Organisation (ILO), UN and World Bank to calculate the increase in women’s wages that would occur as a result of closing the gap between women and men on average wages and average of rates of employment in poor countries. Although the figure of $9tn is mind-boggling, the calculation does not even factor in raising incomes to the level of a living wage, nor estimate for the contribution of the unpaid care work undertaken by women. This means that the real cost is likely to be considerably higher. Other statistics tell the same story. Globally, the participation of women in the labour force has stagnated at about 50%, while the figure for men still hovers at roughly 80%. Worldwide, more than half of employed women are in informal and vulnerable work, and in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia more than 80% of all jobs for women are unregulated and precarious. Women often work in exploitative conditions and shoulder disproportionate unpaid care responsibilities (such as child rearing, domestic chores, and caring for the sick and elderly). In India, for example, women spend 10 times as much time on unpaid care work than men, and as many as 45% of women of working age are confined solely to domestic duties. Recent experience suggests that women – and men – are pushing back. In January 2014, exasperation at years of low pay erupted into nationwide strikes in Cambodia, where women make up 90% of employees in the garment industry. While Cambodia’s GDP almost doubled between 2007 and 2013 – fuelled largely by the multibillion dollar garment industry – the gender wage gap in the country more than doubled between 2004 and 2009. This despite the fact that female labour has been a major contributor to Cambodia’s economic rise. One garment worker told us: “We want an economic system that allows people to live with dignity, not in slavery. We’re not asking to live like CEOs, but to at least get paid a living wage. Corporates are earning millions, even billions a year.” But gender inequality in work not only has consequences for women; without the subsidy that female workers provide, the world economy could not function. And women enjoying decent work and equal living wages is a path to poverty eradication, gender equality, sustainable development and inclusive growth. According to the ILO, $1.6tn in output could be generated by reducing the prevailing gender employment gap. Indeed, valuing and recognising women‘s work, both paid and unpaid, might be one of the most important factors for keeping many households out of poverty, thus driving progress and prosperity for all. Women’s economic inequality hasn’t come about by accident. As Close the gap! reveals, it is a result of the unjust politics that shape our economy, including the pursuit of growth at any cost and the fact that women’s voices continue to be silenced and ignored. It is also rooted in, and drives, wider gender discrimination in society – for example, violence against women and girls or the violation of sexual and reproductive rights. Governments, businesses and international institutions all have the power to create the conditions required to give women in developing countries the chances they deserve in and at work, and close the gaps in pay and employment. It is time for the international community and the WEF to rise to the challenge and address the issue of inequality in women’s work.

2015-01-23T07:00:08Z,global-development,Global development,Kenya hikes taxes – and even the IMF approves | Yussuf Bashir,"Like their counterparts the world over, Kenyan politicians have long been more reluctant to tax the rich than the poor. But this month, the country reintroduced capital gains tax (CGT) on companies and individuals, 30 years after abandoning it. It is not the only good news to have come out of Kenya recently. Last October, the government announced plans to retire many corporate tax holidays, in a bid to reduce bureaucratic red tape. The move will broaden the tax base and generate more resources to fund essential services, especially for people living in poverty. Despite the predictable warnings of big companies and wealthy individuals, the return of CGT and the rolling back of tax incentives are good news for the vast majority of Kenyans, who rely on public services. If those services – from midwives and ambulances to roads and policing – are to be better funded, then tax is the answer. It is cheaper than government borrowing, and more reliable and less conditional than aid. The new CGT will be levied on profits made from the sale of property and shares. Kenya suspended CGT in 1985, when the Nairobi stock exchange was started, and it has been very difficult to bring back, even though the exchange has more than 2tn Kenyan shillings (£14bn) in market capitalisation. Ministers have finally kept their nerve with CGT because they want to boost revenues in order to spend more – and even the IMF has encouraged them to raise tax to pay for greater government spending. They may also have been comforted by the fact that neighbouring Tanzania and Uganda have much higher tax rates on capital gains. Officials have reportedly estimated that CGT in Kenya – at a rate of 5% – will raise about $85m (£56m) a year. But Kenya’s CGT has had a painful birth. Like other reforms that would more fairly share the tax burden, it became difficult to get it through parliament and may be hard to implement, even now it has become law. Some parliamentarians are too easily convinced about the supposed adverse macroeconomic effects of reforms aimed at powerful institutions like the stock exchange or booming industries such as the real-estate sector. By contrast, proposals to increase the tax burden on poor people pass through parliament in record time. After all, the poor are not as organised or as obviously powerful as the elite. Nothing exemplifies this more than the speedy enactment of VAT in 2013, on the one hand, and the long struggle to reintroduce CGT, on the other. VAT is a tax on consumption. It is considered regressive because everyone pays the same amount of tax on a product, regardless of their income. This would not be a problem if VAT was levied only on luxury products like helicopters (which it is not in Kenya). But when levied on essentials like milk and bread, it threatens to put those out of poor people’s reach. Kenyan civil society has had some influence and, in 2013, the East Africa Tax and Governance Network, a Christian Aid partner, played a critical role in amending the 2013 VAT Act, to reverse the milk and bread price hikes. The network continues to campaign for additional tax bands on personal income as an alternative to VAT – and more progressive taxation is clearly needed. The UN has consistently ranked Kenya as one of the most unequal states (pdf). On the ground, this is evident in the luxury flats and high-end vehicle dealerships popping up all over Nairobi, in stark contrast to news of drought in hunger-ravaged northern Kenya. One of the obstacles to more progressive taxation is that it is difficult to distinguish between rich people and politicians. They are mostly one and the same – search who the richest Kenyans are and the list will consist of former cabinet ministers and presidents. Any minister would hesitate to go against the interests of such a formidable group, as CGT is bound to do. With the introduction of the new tax, ordinary Kenyans must hope that the frantic tax-planning efforts by some, such as selling their prime assets, will not render CGT ineffective and deter further efforts towards fairness in Kenya’s tax system.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/23/kenya-capital-gains-tax-boost-spending-poor,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/23/kenya-capital-gains-tax-boost-spending-poor
2015-01-22T17:40:59Z,global-development,Global development,"Ebola effort needs another $1bn despite decline in cases in west Africa, says UN","Amid signs that the Ebola epidemic may be waning, the UN has asked for a further $1bn dollars (£662.5m) to fund the next phase of its fight against the virus, which will include “painstaking detective work” to track and treat potential sufferers across west Africa. “The devastating spread of the disease has slowed and the epidemic has started to turn. We’re beginning to see an overall decline in the number of cases each week,” said David Nabarro, the UN special envoy on Ebola, presenting an updated overview of the UN’s financial needs in Davos on Wednesday. The sharpest decline was in Liberia, he said, where less than 10 new cases are being reported each week, compared with about 300 last September. Ebola has claimed more than 8,600 lives since it emerged in Guinea just over a year ago. “The next step … is to turn ourselves into a community of detectives who travel far and wide in the affected countries – an area that’s greater than the British Isles and only slightly smaller than France – and go to every single nook and cranny and try to find people who’ve got Ebola or are suspected of having it, making sure they come under treatment quickly,” Nabarro said. Hundreds of epidemiologists, social mobilisers, contract tracers and public health specialists were being put into the region by the UN and its partners, and by the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), he said. “This is a tougher job. We can’t put a time limit on it but what we can do is say there will be a massive effort.” The new funds will sustain this action. “In 2015, for the first half of this year from January-June, the overall costs of the international effort to get to zero [cases] is estimated to be $1.54bn. $482m is already available, so the total appeal amounts to $1.05bn,” according to the UN overview. The implementation of its Stepp strategy (stop, treat, ensure essential services, preserve stability, prevent outbreaks in unaffected countries) would now evolve to become more nimble and flexible, said the UN, enabling it to respond to multiple smaller outbreaks and focus on re-establishing and reinforcing essential services. At present there are approximately 60 localised outbreaks of Ebola spread across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the three worst-affected countries. The UN overview said funding is needed mainly for running costs, with less required for investment now that most of the infrastructure is in place. The gaps are now smaller than previously, but some services are not available in the right locations. Nabarro expressed relief that the “terrifying scenario” of an endlessly expanding epidemic, which seemed possible last August, has not come to pass. In line with this, the anticipated economic cost of the outbreak has also been revised: the World Bank said this week that the overall effect on Africa would not be as drastic as originally estimated. The bank said Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone would still lose at least $1.6bn in economic growth this year – more than 12% of their combined gross domestic product. However, the bank estimated that Africa’s total losses would fall somewhere between $500m and $6.2bn, drastically lower than the $25bn the bank predicted for west Africa alone last October. “Consumer and investor confidence has been eroded by the outbreak of the virus, and disruptions to travel and cross-border trade suggest cumulative losses of more than $500m across (sub-Saharan Africa) in 2015, outside the three directly affected countries,” the report said. The bank said the lower estimates reflected better public health responses, a lower risk of the disease spreading across borders, and fast and effective containment measures taken in Mali, Nigeria and Senegal, which have been declared Ebola-free. “Yet as welcome as these latest signs are, we cannot afford to be complacent,” Jim Yong Kim, the bank’s president, said. “Until we have zero new Ebola cases, the risk of continued severe economic impact to the three countries and beyond remains unacceptably high.” This tempering of hope with caution was also evident in Davos, where Ebola is among the global issues being discussed by policymakers, wealthy philanthropists and top officials from the world’s most influential non-governmental organisations. Valerie Amos, the UN’s emergency relief coordinator, said it was essential to work with the west African countries to maintain essential services in fragile economies still recovering from years of conflict. “We are also conscious of the fact that we need to take the lessons learned from this in terms of how we deal with any future pandemics,” she said. The World Bank said all countries must make investing in pandemic preparedness a top priority for 2015, calling for a “global pandemic emergency financing facility”. One key variable for any future outbreak will be the availability of vaccines and more effective treatments. Nabarro also said two were being tested with “some promise”, but that, even in the best case scenario, these would not be available at least until the middle of this year. Clinical trials of some experimental therapies were also being undertaken with initial results expected in about two months’ time. According to the UN’s Financial Tracking Service, a UN appeal of $1.5bn for activities from September 2014 to February this year has been 79% funded, with $1.18bn pledged. Another $1.37bn has been provided as part of a wider humanitarian response.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/22/ebola-un-funding-1bn-decline-west-africa,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/22/ebola-un-funding-1bn-decline-west-africa
2015-01-22T16:34:43Z,global-development,Global development,El Salvador pardons woman jailed after birth complications led to death of child,"Women’s rights campaigners have welcomed the decision by El Salvador’s Congress to pardon a woman sentenced to 30 years in prison for murder after experiencing complications in pregnancy. The woman, known as Guadalupe, was originally charged under the country’s harsh abortion laws. She is understood to have given birth to a stillborn baby after being raped. She gave birth at home but was taken to hospital later in the day after heavy bleeding. She was accused of trying to abort the baby. El Salvador is among a handful of countries that forbid abortion under any circumstances. The domestic worker was later charged with aggravated murder. She has served seven years of her sentence. Congress’s decision now needs to be ratified by Salvador Sánchez Cerén, El Salvador’s president. A number of women have been charged under the country’s abortion or homicide laws after miscarrying or experiencing other pregnancy-related complications. In December, a coalition of NGOs, led by Agrupación Ciudadana and the Center for Reproductive Rights, launched the Las 17 campaign calling for the release of Guadalupe and 16 other women who have been sentenced to 30-40 years in prison on murder charges after experiencing obstetric emergencies. “El Salvador has finally heard the chorus of human rights advocates across the globe calling for the release of Las 17,” said Mónica Arango Olaya, regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean at the Center for Reproductive Rights. “For decades, El Salvador has blatantly violated the fundamental human rights of these women and countless others. We stand with ‘Las 17,’ Agrupación Ciudadana and our global partners in this fight to seek justice for all Salvadoran women.” Nancy Northup, the centre’s president and CEO, added: “A woman who seeks essential healthcare has committed no crime, and she should neither fear imprisonment nor be required to seek a pardon for her actions. “Today’s action by the Salvadoran government must be followed in short order by the release of every woman wrongfully imprisoned under this oppressive law and decisive action toward the decriminalisation of abortion for all Salvadoran women.” In 2013, El Salvador’s draconian abortion laws became the focus of international attention when a pregnant 22-year-old was denied an abortion even though her life was at risk. Last year, the country was elected to the UN human rights council, which is “responsible for strengthening the promotion and protection of human rights around the globe”, as well as addressing rights violations. El Salvador is one of only six countries that have complete bans on abortion. The others are Nicaragua, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Malta and South Sudan. Many other countries only allow abortion if a woman’s life is in danger.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/22/el-salvador-pardons-woman-guadalupe-stillbirth-miscarriage-anti-abortion-laws,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/22/el-salvador-pardons-woman-guadalupe-stillbirth-miscarriage-anti-abortion-laws
2015-01-22T12:00:03Z,global-development,Global development,Helen Clark: ‘Davos must look at how war and climate change affect poverty’,"The 2,500 business leaders, academics and policymakers meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week need to look beyond current financial concerns and focus on the effects that war and climate change are having on the fight against poverty, the head of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has warned. Speaking as she prepared to travel to Davos, Helen Clark urged the forum to reflect on the global consequences of climate change, Ebola and the crises in Syria, Iraq, South Sudan and Central African Republic. “They’ll be discussing the new global context of volatility, uncertainty and unpredictability – no doubt with both the Swiss franc issue and the rouble on their minds,” she said. “But they need to look at this whole overview of what is happening with war, conflict and climate: globalisation speeds up the impact of any adverse trend anywhere.”
The former New Zealand prime minister, who will also be discussing the best ways to help the Ebola-affected west African countries recover from the epidemic, called on those at Davos – and the wider international community – to show ambition and determination during a crucial year for development. In September, the UN general assembly will meet in New York to adopt the sustainable development goals (SDGs), which will replace the millennium development goals (MDGs). Less than three months later, the UN will hold negotiations in Paris in a bid to reach agreement on cutting carbon emissions. Clark, who was in London to discuss the SDGs at the Overseas Development Institute, acknowledged the scale of the issues but said she was confident of real progress if everyone played their part. “It’s going to require leadership globally, locally and nationally to really pick up the agenda and run with it,” she said. “It’s not just something that public finance can do: it needs investment, it needs trade – and it [means] dealing with the corruption that permits the illicit financial flows that are draining developing countries’ resources.” Perhaps the biggest difference between the MDGs and their mooted successors, said Clark, was the scale of the ambitions underpinning the latter. “The MDGs were in many ways about tackling poverty with official development assistance,” she said. “The SDGs are about the way we live, behave, invest, do business, produce and consume … This isn’t just going to be ODA, it’s going to be growing economies and domestic resource mobilisation and allocation; it’s going to be bankability, which means being credit-worthy and attracting investment and facilitating trade. All of this means better governance, better regulation, an enabling environment, and the rule of law.” Vital to the new agenda, she said, was the presence of SDG 16, which calls for the promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies, the provision of access to justice for all, and the building of effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. “You don’t eradicate poverty without a number of other things going on,” said Clark. She also said that although the current shape of the SDGs – 17 goals and 169 targets – was unlikely to change dramatically, the UN was still exploring ways to simplify the agenda around six key themes: people, dignity, prosperity, justice, partnership and planet. “There’s not a great appetite for the member states to open it up again because they feel that a lot of compromise and consensus was built in the open working group,” she said. “The question is whether this idea of having the six organising or clustering principles will get some traction.

2015-01-22T09:00:00Z,global-development,Global development,Congo's women fight for the right to play a peacekeeping role | Allyn Gaestel | Allison Shelley,"Sitting at a table in a dimly lit restaurant in Goma, Chantal Rugenera Kambibi reflects on the challenges faced by Congolese women involved in peacekeeping. “We who take courage, who talk, we’re seen like women who lost their heads, who are abnormal,” says the head of mission for the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s programme of stabilisation and reconstruction of armed conflict zones (Starec) in North Kivu. Kambibi’s very presence and power at the centre of the conflict in eastern Congo would seem to speak to the increased participation of women in peace-building here. But she is an outlier, and she attested to numerous hurdles in the way of her rise. In 2000, the UN security council passed resolution 1325, which called for women to play a more active role in conflict resolution at the national and international level. It promoted gender mainstreaming at all levels of peace-building and increased participation of women in leadership positions.
In the years since, in eastern Congo, home to one of the world’s most protracted and deadly conflicts and to the UN’s largest peacekeeping force, as well as countless local and international charities, awareness about the resolution has grown. But implementation has lagged far behind, hindered, according to local women’s activists, by cultural constraints and entrenched gender roles. Those who have risen to leadership positions are tough-skinned anomalies. Many peacekeeping organisations have implemented quotas for women, which are followed to a limited extent, but even when they are present, women are often confined to marginal roles. “So many NGOs pushed for women’s participation; communities know what NGOs are looking for,” says Hannah Cooper, technical adviser at the Life and Peace Institute (LPI) in Congo, but she worries about the “qualitative input of women”. The LPI researches and supports community-level peace-building. Cooper says knowledge of resolution 1325 is widespread. “I find it positive but you wonder sometimes if people know, if they’re supposed to have heard of this thing … People have buy-in, but I don’t know if they have any ownership of it.” One of Kambibi’s responsibilities is to oversee the “permanent local reconciliation committees” (CLPCs) across North Kivu. These community-based committees hear and mediate complaints from local civilians about small-scale disputes, often over land or property rights, a massive underlying cause of the ongoing larger-scale conflict. “The big problems were once small – if we can resolve them when they are small, they won’t become so big. The war didn’t start so big, it had a source somewhere,” says Katoto Julien, who is part of the CLPC in Sake-Masisi, an area once overrun by the notorious M23 rebels, and still dealing with mass displacement and movement of civilians. The CLPCs have quotas for women’s participation, and to hear the male members of the Sake CLPC tell it, that is the only reason women are there at all. “Starec requested women be present here, from each community,” said Arnold Mudumbi, a CLPC member. “We can’t go against the government. We have to respect the government, whether it’s effective or not.”
Female committee members say they feel pressure to be docile and quiet, and face accusations of exploiting their sexuality if they take a leadership position for their work in peacekeeping – a complaint repeated by numerous activists. “There are still people who think women should stay home,” said Celine Karamba, a school secretary and member of the committee. “We’ve been trying to teach women how to become leaders,” said Judith Ndoole, who worked on peacekeeping for NGOs before joining the CLPC. “I used to be a civilian secretary, I would go to Masisi for investigations. They would say I was prostituting myself,” the mother of seven says. Even Kambibi, with her university degree and lengthy career in public service – she was provincial minister of environment and tourism before being brought in to run the stabilisation programme – has suffered derogatory remarks. “I spend all day with only men, there are women who say she must be the concubine of all these men,” she says. “It bothers me a little, but you have to try, we have to be a model to make people understand.” Immaculée Birhaheka, a longtime women’s activist who runs an organisation called Promotion and Support of Women’s Initiatives, adds: “Here, we think women should work twice as hard, like a woman has no right to err, like the country belongs to men and we are second-class citizens.”
Kambibi says awareness is improving, and some men are “starting to understand that women are like men, that women can do things”, but, “it’s still a very serious problem”. When women participate in peacekeeping, they have to fit in their work around full-time care roles. Kambibi described a daily routine starting at 5am, cooking breakfast for her family and pressing her husband’s clothes before long meetings and late nights. She calls her husband, a university professor who preaches parity and equality, “understanding”. Annie Matundu-Mbambi, head of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom in Congo, had to deal with the end of her marriage in parallel with the rise of her peacekeeping career. She has been pushing for the implementation of resolution 1325, but her analysis is pessimistic. “We haven’t had much progress 15 years later,” she says.

2015-01-22T07:00:09Z,global-development,Global development,Female UN peacekeepers: an all-too-rare sight  | Allyn Gaestel | Allison Shelley,"Major Shikha Mehrotra is a rarity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: a female officer in the UN’s peacekeeping force. That Mehrotra, who belongs to the Indian brigade, and her female colleagues form only 2% of the world’s largest peacekeeping mission reflects how little has changed since 2000, when the UN security council passed a resolution that stressed the important role women can play in peacekeeping and conflict resolution. UN resolution 1325 called for more women in decision-making positions, a gendered perspective to be “mainstreamed” across peacekeeping and for more women like Mehrotra to participate in field operations in military roles as police and as human rights observers. However, the few women serving in the UN mission in Congo (known as Monusco by its French acronym) are mostly in lower-level positions and describe a persistent, prevailing machismo culture in peacekeeping. Mehrotra, one of four women in the 5,000-strong Indian brigade, describes herself as a pioneer but for all her talk about the important role female peacekeepers can play interacting with civilians, she works almost exclusively at the base. She is a civil-military coordination officer, planning humanitarian projects the soldiers will implement, such as building water treatment plants and supporting women producing handicrafts.
“We do go into the field but not very often,” she says. “I would love to go to the community and interact.” She says children, women and families suffer most as a result of the fighting, and more female peacekeepers could help them in a conflict that uses child soldiers and rape as a weapon of war. As a trailblazer, and one of the lonely few, she feels she is anything but mainstream. Her performance at the base, she says, is closely scrutinised by her male colleagues. “Since we are the first ones, what we are doing, how we are performing, is watched by everyone. You’re always on your toes, you have to be the best,” she says. “I want to prove I’m better than a male.” The gender office at the Monusco base in Goma is a small room in a temporary container, run by one member of staff, Anne Marie Obuyo, a Congolese national who has been working there for five years. She is passionate about her work, training staff members and pushing a gender agenda throughout the mission, but she feels sidelined. “Here at the mission there are many bosses who don’t understand; they banalise it,” she says of the gender mainstreaming mission. Obuyo is a national professional officer, far down the hierarchy of UN positions. “The higher you climb, women are very rare,” she says. “They said gender is a priority but for a long time the only person staffing the gender office was a UN volunteer,” says Séverine Autesserre, a professor at Barnard College at the University of Colombia, who has written about the habits of peacekeepers and done extensive research in Congo.
Peacekeepers are soldiers from countries that commit troops to the UN mission, so it is ultimately the discretion of the member countries – and the percentage of women in national armies – that filter up to the mission. “Despite the calls of the UN, we don’t receive the numbers of women,” says Abdallah Wafy, deputy special representative of the secretary general for the rule of law at Monusco. “It’s very important to have many women in peacekeeping. Unfortunately, we have statistics that are not good,” he says. “We want to have 20%, but we aren’t there.”
The South African contingent is considered a leader in women’s integration and has the only designated gender adviser among the troops. With her sparkly magenta nails contrasting with her sharp military fatigues and blue UN helmet, Lieutenant Colonel Zukiswa Caga looks the picture of women’s integration. “Women fill every position,” says Major Steven Matodon, the public information officer for the South African brigade. “We don’t have a problem with our ladies; they can do whatever a man can do.” Still, most of the women are in lower-level positions, working mostly on communications, logistics or nursing; they rarely go into the field. There are 168 women among 1,250 South African troops in Congo. “It’s like a drop in the ocean,” says Sabina Madisha, a 30-year-old sergeant in the force. “They have around 10-15% women,” Obuyo says, “but compared to other countries, it’s really something.” Women are beginning to be present in peacekeeping in Congo, but not in positions of power where they could influence and bring the female perspective to the operation. “We must have female soldiers,” says Mehrotra. “It should definitely increase from 2%; it should be more.” Allyn Gaestel and Allison Shelley reported from DRC with support from the International Women’s Media Foundation.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/22/female-united-nations-peacekeepers-congo-drc,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/22/female-united-nations-peacekeepers-congo-drc
2015-01-22T07:00:09Z,global-development,Global development,Women still face a fight for recognition in war and peace | Liz Ford,"This year marks the 15th anniversary of a landmark UN resolution that recognised the vital role women can play in conflict resolution and peace-building. But has it made any difference? What is resolution 1325? Resolution 1325 was passed unanimously by the UN security council on 31 October 2000, following decades of lobbying by women’s rights activists. It was the first security council resolution that addressed the specific impact of war on women and girls. The key points of the resolution were ensuring women’s full participation in conflict resolution and peace negotiations; action to protect women and girls from gender-based violence in war, and the prosecution of those who carry out such attacks; as well as a recognition of the different needs of female and male ex-combatants when planning disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programmes (DDR). The resolution also called for more women in peacekeeping operations and local police forces, more funding to support local women’s peace initiatives, and to assess all peace agreements for their effect on women. It even urged the design of refugee camps to take account of the particular needs, and safety, of women and girls – such as installing lights next to toilet blocks, places that are often the site of attacks on women. Since resolution 1325, six other resolutions designed to further support and protect women in peace and conflict have been passed, including the most recent two in 2013. What difference has it made? Resolution 1325 - and the subsequent resolutions - has given much needed high-level attention to the impact of peace and conflict on women and girls, and offers activists something concrete to which they can hold governments to account. However, in terms of practical, on the ground change, an impact study, published by the UN to mark the 10th anniversary of the resolution in 2010, painted a less than rosy picture.
The report found that UN missions had “achieved little success” in improving the participation of women in peace negotiations and agreements. Women in rural areas still felt excluded. It said while some progress had been made in passing laws against sexual and gender-based violence, and improving women’s security, “conflict-related sexual violence as a deliberate strategy in areas of conflict still occurs with impunity” and had proved a “formidable challenge” for peacekeeping missions. Only modest achievements had been made in bringing a gender perspective to DDR. Last year women expressed concern that they were being excluded from a high-level conference on the reconstruction of Afghanistan, hosted by the British government. This was after the UK had committed to a leading role in getting more women involved in peace-building. According to UN Women, fewer than 3% of signatories to peace agreements are women, and less than 10% of negotiators are women. In 2011, of the nine peace agreements signed, only two – Yemen and Somalia – made specific provisions for women. Rape is still a potent weapon of war, with few prosecutions of perpetrators. Resolution 1960, passed in 2010, reiterated a “deep concern” that despite the condemnation of sexual violence in conflict, it was still widespread. Meanwhile, resolution 2106, passed in 2013, called on member states to address impunity. In June, William Hague, Britain’s then foreign minister, and actor Angelina Jolie hosted a three-day summit on ending sexual violence in conflict. The summit was part of the government’s Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative; world leaders signed up to an international protocol on the documentation and investigation of sexual violence in conflict. Campaigners will be waiting to see if this protocol makes any difference. At its launch, Liesl Gerntholtz, executive director of the women’s rights division at Human Rights Watch, said prosecution was not always a priority for women.
In his report on women, peace and security, published in October, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said sexual violence in conflict “continues to affect women, men and children with shocking frequency and impunity”. He said women were being targeted for abuse in Iraq and Syria, with reports of rape, forced marriage and forced prostitution. In parts of South Sudan, women have been disproportionately affected by mass displacement, making them vulnerable to abuse. An analysis of the implementation of 1325, published last year by the Institute for Global and International Studies, pointed to a review meeting at which participants suggested member states were too focused on addressing sexual violence, rather than gender equality and women’s empowerment, which were “at the heart” of the 1325 agenda. Another report, published in October by the Global Network of Women Peacebuilders and Cordaid, said funding for the implementation of national action plans on resolution 1325 was inadequate. What’s happening to mark the 15th anniversary? In September, Ban launched a global study to review progress and challenges since 1325 was passed, ahead of a high-level meeting scheduled for October 2015, to mark the anniversary. In October last year, member states, civil society groups and UN agencies met in New York to discuss establishing a five-year finance mechanism – with the catchy title of the “global acceleration instrument on women and peace and security” – to speed up the implementation of resolution 1325. Supporters hope to launch the initiative later this year. In April, the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom is marking its 100th anniversary, and the 15th anniversary of 1325, with a conference to discuss what sustainable peace-building actually means, and explore the root causes of conflict.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/22/women-rights-war-peace-un-resolution-1325,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/22/women-rights-war-peace-un-resolution-1325
2015-01-22T05:00:06Z,global-development,Global development,Bill Gates: digital learning will  revolutionise education in global south,"Cheaper smartphones and tablets, advances in software and better network coverage will revolutionise the way children in developing countries learn over the next 15 years, according to the Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates. Speaking as he and his wife, Melinda, publish the seventh annual state-of-the-world letter from their eponymous foundation, Gates said recent progress in communications technology had been hugely encouraging. “The educational software is still not such that every five-year-old could sit there and do their alphabet or try their math out,” he told the Guardian. “But I’m seeing things in the lab now which, given time, really will be pervasive. “Over the next 15 years, that quality will get so good that the free or very low-cost stuff will be pervasive and anyone with a cell phone or cheap tablet will have access to that – and it really will change education.” Gates, whose foundation is best known for its investment in health and agriculture, said he had been keeping an eye on the potential applications of phones and tablets over the past few years, and funding a lot of research and development. “The networks still aren’t there yet, but as they get out into poor countries, and as the device prices get to around the $100 range, that creates the possibility that you can use it as a financial digital debit card, or to inform a farmer about what’s going on with the weather and when they should plant, or to help healthcare workers to track their activities and inventories,” he said. “All sorts of ways of gathering data to get these systems working at high quality become possible with these digital tools.” In their letter, the philanthropists predict that the lives of people in poor countries will improve faster over the next 15 years than ever before, with the number of child deaths halved again, polio eradicated and the end of malaria in sight.
They also wager that better crops, fertilisers and infrastructure will allow Africa to feed itself by 2030, and that mobile phones and digital banking will transform the lives of poor people over the same period by giving them access to savings accounts, credit and insurance. Despite the plentiful optimism, though, the couple recognise that not everyone on the planet is likely to see their lives improve. “A sceptic would look at the world’s problems and conclude that things are only getting worse,” they write. “And we shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that a handful of the worst-off countries will continue to struggle. But we think the next 15 years will see major breakthroughs for most people in poor countries.” Asked how the upbeat predictions sat with the ongoing crises in Syria, Iraq, South Sudan and Central African Republic, Gates said violence was a “huge setback” to development. “As countries get wealthier, the chances of civil war and violence go down a lot,” he said. “But you still see eruptions in countries like Syria that aren’t poor, and the refugee tragedy there is pretty unbelievable.” The situation in Nigeria, he said, was another case in point. Despite its booming economy, the country is still struggling with corruption, and the disruption and bloodshed caused by Boko Haram. However, said Gates, efforts made to improve basic health provision were paying off even amid the violence. “We have Boko Haram, which is doing horrific things up in the north, where we are working with some of the primary healthcare systems, in places like Kano state, and we’re really getting it working well and getting the vaccines out to more kids,” he said. “For the first time ever, we’ve gone over six months with no polio cases anywhere in Africa – including Nigeria, which was our big problem.” He added: “Setbacks come in headlines and improvements come one life at a time.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/22/bill-gates-digital-learning-revolutionise-education-developing-world,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/22/bill-gates-digital-learning-revolutionise-education-developing-world
2015-01-21T13:31:16Z,global-development,Global development,"Israel ignoring deaths of Thai workers on farms, Human Rights Watch says","After toiling in the sun on an Israeli farm for 17 hours, Praiwan Seesukha, a 37-year-old Thai migrant worker, went to sleep next to other exhausted labourers in a crowded shed. He did not wake up. Israeli authorities failed to investigate Praiwan’s death and speculation is mounting among rights groups that poor working conditions on Israel’s farms could be behind the death of migrant workers like him. About 25,000 Thai nationals work in Israel, mostly farming vegetables, fruit and seeds, according to a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report published on Wednesday. An estimated 122 Thai migrant farm workers have died in the country since 2008, including 43 from a heart condition known as sudden nocturnal death syndrome, according to Israeli newspaper Haaretz. The cause of death of 22 migrants is unknown because, as in Praiwan’s case, the authorities failed to investigate. The report, based on interviews with 173 Thai workers in farms across Israel and produced in partnership with Israeli rights watchdog Kav LaOved – Worker’s Hotline, calls on the Israeli government to enforce its own labour laws, which set a minimum wage and limit the amount of hours a person can work. “The success of Israel’s agricultural industry depends to a large extent on the labour of Thai migrant workers, but Israel is doing far too little to uphold their rights and protect them from exploitation,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and north Africa director at HRW. Israel exported $0.9bn of agricultural goods to the EU in 2012 (pdf), according to the government’s statistics office. Whitson said: “Israeli authorities need to be much more active in enforcing the law on working hours and conditions, and in clamping down on employers who abuse workers’ rights.” Israel restricted the number of Palestinians who could work in the country in 1993, which left an employment hole for private companies. In response, an agreement between Israel and Thailand was signed in 2012, paving the way for a stream of migrant workers from south-east Asia to travel to Israel. The workers hoped to send money to their families back home.
The migrants, who mostly come from Thaliand’s north-western provinces, are paid “significantly” below Israel’s minimum wage and work up to 17 hours every day, according to the report. Labourers told HRW that they “felt like dead meat” after milking cows and harvesting avocados from 4:30am to 7pm. They said their employers treated them “like slaves”, using binoculars to spy on them while they were working. “Workers at several farms complained of headaches, respiratory problems and other maladies, including burning sensations in their eyes that they attributed to spraying pesticides without adequate protection,” the report said, adding that many of the migrants struggle to access medical care or change employers. Thai workers are promised the opportunity to change employers in Israel if they encounter any problems. One Thai migrant worker told HRW that he tried to change employers because hot weather and dust were giving him respiratory problems. More than a year later, his request still had not been answered. Israel’s population, immigration and border authority and its economy ministry are responsible for enforcing labour rights in the country’s agricultural sector. Both declined to comment on HRW’s report, the organisation said. • This article was corrected on 21 January 2015 to clarify that Israel has not banned Palestinians from working in the country, but has restricted the number it allows to be employed.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/21/israel-thai-workers-farms-human-rights-watch,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/21/israel-thai-workers-farms-human-rights-watch
2015-01-21T07:00:02Z,global-development,Global development,Sustainable development is only possible if women's health is prioritised | Ann M Starrs,"“Let the 21st century be the century of women.” These were the words of the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, when he launched his report on the post- 2015 development agenda. “The empowerment and rights of girls and women must be at the heart of everything we do,” said Ban. Let’s hope the member states were paying attention. In September, UN delegates will come together in New York to decide on the content of the sustainable development goals (SDGs), which will drive the global agenda on social, economic and environmental development for the next 15 years. Work thus far has resulted in 17 draft goals and 169 specific targets. The goals are broad and ambitious, but improving women’s health is not mentioned specifically in any of them and is referenced in just two targets. Even a glance at the list of proposed goals makes clear that universal access to contraception and other sexual and reproductive health services is vital to achieving many of them. How can we end poverty if women and couples cannot determine whether or when to have a child, or how many to have? How can we ensure equitable education for all if so many girls drop out of school due to unwanted pregnancy? How can we achieve gender equality if women’s reproductive rights are not fulfilled? The answer to all of these questions is the same: we can’t. But these are the questions that must be asked in September as UN delegates and civil society groups negotiate a final version of the SDGs. For negotiations to take women’s wellbeing into account effectively, they must start with the basic facts. While more women are practising modern contraception today than a decade ago, contraceptive use has barely kept pace with global population growth. New research from the Guttmacher Institute shows that a shockingly high number of women in developing regions still do not receive the services they need to protect their health and that of their newborns: 225 million women who want to avoid pregnancy are not using contraceptives and 43 million pregnant women face health risks by giving birth outside a health facility. In addition, while increased access to antiretroviral therapy has changed the course of the Aids epidemic globally, increasing life expectancy significantly, nearly half of women who need treatment for HIV do not receive it. The consequences are devastating: 74m unintended pregnancies, 28m unplanned births and 20m unsafe abortions each year. Some 290,000 women and 2.9 million newborns die each year, largely because of the lack of access to good-quality care during childbirth. In addition, 273,000 infants become infected with HIV during pregnancy and delivery or breastfeeding. The rewards for providing these women and their newborns with the services they need are tremendous: unintended pregnancies would drop by 52m; 200,000 fewer women and 2 million fewer newborns would die every year and new HIV infections in newborns would be virtually eliminated. Fully satisfying women’s need for modern contraception would also make healthcare investments more affordable overall. For every additional dollar invested in contraception in developing regions, the cost of pregnancy-related care –including HIV care for women and newborns – is reduced by about $1.50 (about £1). Beyond these striking health gains, there is a huge payoff in terms of other social and economic returns. Girls and young women are more likely to be able to stay at school, improving their future participation in the labour force and earning potential. In turn, household savings and assets receive a boost. Poverty is reduced, living conditions improve and communities are better off when women can fully participate and contribute. All these benefits have direct impacts on a wide variety of other development goals. In the months ahead, government negotiators and civil society will grapple with many competing priorities as they try to reach a consensus on a new global development agenda. And, undoubtedly, socially conservative countries and activists who are hostile to sexual and reproductive health rights will lobby against addressing these issues in the final goals. But these core principles must not be compromised or negotiated away. UN delegates need to pay attention to the evidence that clearly establishes how investing in sexual and reproductive health benefits women, their families, their communities and their nations. If they don’t, half of humanity will continue to lag behind and true sustainable development will be impossible to achieve. • Ann M Starrs is president and chief executive of the Guttmacher Institute",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2015/jan/21/sustainable-development-is-only-possible-if-womens-health-is-prioritised,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2015/jan/21/sustainable-development-is-only-possible-if-womens-health-is-prioritised
2015-01-20T17:40:46Z,global-development,Global development,"OccupyPlayGround: police used teargas on our children, but for now we celebrate the win | Boniface Mwangi","On Monday, I was among a small group of concerned Kenyan citizens and former students who headed to Langata Road primary school in Nairobi to join a peaceful protest against attempts by a developer to seize the school playground. The idea was to join the pupils on their first day back at school to reclaim the grabbed land through games and football. Appropriately and somewhat poignantly in view of what happened, Monday was Martin Luther King day. The Langata school serves the neighbouring Kibera slum – one of Africa’s biggest informal settlements – and also the children of wardens from a nearby prison. The playground was “grabbed” during the December school holidays and the contractor hired goons to guard construction workers as they hurriedly erected a perimeter wall. This denied the children access to their play area. When the school’s headteacher learned of the seizure, he reported the matter to Langata police station, but no action was taken and the private developer continued to construct the wall. When we arrived at the school on Monday, we found armed police, some in riot gear, surrounding the playground. What happened next has been beamed around the world, and here in Kenya has sparked a timely debate about the all-too-common process of landgrabbing by powerful personalities in our country. At break time, the children trooped towards the playground. But because there was now a wall in their way, they had to try to get in through a gate along the busy, nearby highway. The children carried twigs as a sign of peace because Kenyan police are notorious for brutally dispersing people.
The police refused to allow the children into the playground so the youngsters started singing Haki yetu (“It’s our right” in Kiswahili), while banging on the gate. Their teachers and a few parents were directly behind the pupils. Suddenly there was a loud bang as teargas canisters exploded at the feet of the singing pupils. Everyone stampeded away. A few children were hurt while trying to escape and others fell into a roadside ditch. There were loud screams and some children called for their mothers as they choked on the gas. The children were rushed back into the school compound where teachers, former students and parents offered help. Students with more severe injuries were rushed to hospital by good samaritans. One girl is still in hospital. After the situation calmed a little, the children regrouped and, with their teachers, started to demolish the wall blocking access to the playground. One side of the wall soon came tumbling down, and some of the children ran into the playground. They kicked balls and enjoyed traditional games. But then the police charged, and attempted to arrest some of the activists. More police arrived with dogs but the pupils were undeterred and continued chanting, “Shame! Shame! It’s our field”. The police insisted the playground was private property, and ordered the children to leave. More teargas was fired, and emotions reached boiling point. Someone threw a stone at a police officer, injuring him. We tried to get that person arrested but he escaped.
The back-and-forth continued. More of the wall came down. Two people, an activist and a photo-journalist, were detained. The use of teargas and dogs to respond to a peaceful effort to reclaim property rightfully belonging to the school was an unfortunate blight on the triumph of the day. It was unnecessary, and innocent children were hurt by the security forces’ reckless response. Children know an injustice when they see one and they react, as we all do, with a demand for justice. I firmly believe the children got that justice. Kenya’s interior minister, Joseph Ole Nkaissery, visited the school on Tuesday and apologised to the pupils. Nkaissery gave the developer 24 hours to clear the land. President Uhuru Kenyatta has described the incident as deplorable. While that is commendable, it is not enough because we do not yet know who the powerful landgrabber is. It’s not likely he will be named if there is no prosecution. Kenyan police will not stop using excessive force against demonstrators unless there are serious public consequences for those involved in the heavy-handed response. A report last year by an education taskforce showed that 46 schools in Nairobi have reported a lack of clarity with regard to their boundaries. Out of every 10 schools visited, at least one had seen encroachment by private developers, religious organisations or illegal settlements. For now, we celebrate the win.

That obviously reverses the intention of the target on recognising the value of unpaid and care work. Second, the target on unpaid care work has to seek much more explicitly to increase male engagement in this work and REDUCE female responsibilities for unpaid and care work. Women’s near-exclusive responsibility for the care of the young and the elderly, as well as their over-involvement in unpaid work on farms and family businesses, is a huge factor in their subordination. It means they get no rest, and have little leisure time. And one of the most important things people do with spare time is engage in civil or political mobilisation.

2015-01-20T11:36:24Z,global-development,Global development,UN Ebola chief calls for final funding push to defeat virus in west Africa,"Half a billion dollars of aid pledged to end the Ebola outbreak in west Africa still hasn’t been paid, according to the UN’s response co-ordinator. Dr David Nabarro, in London and on his way to Davos to discuss progress against Ebola and future plans, said about two-thirds of the promised $1.5bn had been paid so far. “This last third is the most precious money but probably the most difficult money,” he told the Guardian. “My focus over the next few days here and in Davos is trying to ensure we have enough money to enable the task to be completed. “Part of my job is to make the point to everybody that now we need money more than ever. It is the money that people least like to give – into the secretary general’s trust fund that could be distributed to whoever needs it in response to demand. “It is going to be tough, but I suppose I’m confident that nobody wants the job to be half done.” The biggest pledges were made by the US government and the World Bank, followed by the UK. The African Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund are also substantial donors. At least three philanthropists – the Gates Foundation, Mark Zuckerberg and the Paul G Allen Family Foundation – have contributed. Nabarro said he was not sounding alarm bells and he praised the British contribution to the fight against the disease that has ravaged Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, which has included sending military personnel and NHS volunteers as well as the efforts of NGOs. Arguably the response has continued to lag behind events. The treatment centres that were constructed and opened, sometimes with a big fanfare, in Sierra Leone in recent months are not full because the numbers of people becoming ill are dropping, albeit less quickly than happened in Liberia.
But Nabarro said: “I’d rather have empty or minimally filled treatment centres than overflowing treatment centres. “When I started in August, pretty quickly I said to myself look at the outbreak curve and the speed with which treatment centres are being built. We really need a massive ten to twentyfold build up.” But it usually takes two to three months to build treatment centres, he said. “By December I was seeing really hopeful evidence of a strong response. There were treatment centres open all over Sierra Leone and Liberia and increasingly Guinea. You need to have the treatment centres there and not worry if they are empty.” It was possible, he added, that the treatment capacity could be “slightly scaled down” in Sierra Leone and it would be useful if it could be capable of being moved – because as one outbreak of Ebola in a region is overcome, others flare up in previously unaffected places. But he continued: “We must not make the mistake of ever saying we are no longer needed because there are only a few cases.” Discussions are already underway to ensure that the global response to any future epidemic will never be as slow as it was for Ebola in west Africa, where the first case occurred in December 2013 but no diagnosis was made until March 2014 and the World Health Organisation (WHO) only declared an emergency in August. “I always wish we [the UN] could be that bit quicker and more mobile. Our secretary general and the bosses in New York are all saying we want to be quicker. Just about every leader everywhere who has been focusing on Ebola is saying what lessons can we learn for the next time,” he said. It will be up for discussion at Davos on Friday and later at the African Union and other meetings are scheduled for February and March. Nabarro predicted a new capacity to deal with outbreaks would be put in place, but preparedness was difficult to finance, he said. The WHO has been criticised for cutting back on its outbreak response capacity. Nabarro was involved in dealing with the H5N1 avian flu pandemic of 2005. “At that time in 2005, money could be raised,” he said. “People were worried about it. Then gradually as the threat receded and as people felt if there is a flu pandemic it won’t be too bad, the money died away.” Then H1N1 swine flu took off in Mexico in 2009 and much the same thing happened. Asked if the money to prepare against another Ebola outbreak or some other epidemic might also disappear once the current threat is over, he said: “Preparedness is something that governments don’t really want to invest in in a sustained way. It is often the first thing to be cut. “I think this time there will be enough anxiety to really put in place sustained preparedness. I’m confident that say by the World Health Assembly in May there will be new arrangements in place which will mean the lag time between the alert being sounded and the response stepped up should be shorter.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/20/un-ebola-chief-calls-for-final-funding-push-to-defeat-virus-in-west-africa,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/jan/20/un-ebola-chief-calls-for-final-funding-push-to-defeat-virus-in-west-africa
2015-01-20T10:32:49Z,global-development,Global development,Help us crowdsource vaccine prices around the world,"Aid agency Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) has called for pharmaceutical companies GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer to cut the cost of a life-saving vaccine that risks being priced out of national immunisation plans. In a report comparing vaccine prices around the world, MSF found that domination of the market by a small group of pharmaceutical companies has caused prices to soar, with the cost of a basic vaccine package increasing by 68% in the past 14 years, putting some vaccines out of the reach of some developing countries’ health budgets. Of particular note was the pneumococcal vaccine, which protects children from pneumonia – the biggest killer of children under five in developing countries. The vaccine accounts for 45% of the total cost of vaccinating a child, and MSF wants the vaccine reduced to $5 per child in poorer countries. The report said there is a striking lack of data on vaccine prices, leaving countries with limited information to guide them in negotiations with pharmaceutical companies. We want to know how much the pneumococcal vaccine costs where you live. While some governments fully subsidise the cost of the vaccine, others require payment from parents. If you know how much it costs to receive the pneumococcal vaccine in your country, let us know in the form below.

2015-01-20T07:00:05Z,global-development,Global development,Can countries still trade their way out of poverty? | Arancha González,"Can countries still trade their way out of poverty? After decades of growing twice as fast as the global economy, world trade has barely kept up with output since 2012. IMF and World Bank research suggests this slowdown is more than just a temporary consequence of sluggish demand within Europe. In both China and the US, the ratio of imports to GDP stopped rising well before the great recession. Market conditions do not appear to favour a renewed trade boom. In all advanced economies, income is well below pre-crisis trend lines. There is no sign the US, the best of a bad lot, wants to – or should – resume its role as the global consumer of first resort. China’s economy, the world’s main motor since the crisis, is cooling. US economist Paul Krugman views the trade slowdown as the untroubling aftermath of one-off boosts from liberalisation and shipping containerisation. But other economists, such as Gavyn Davies, fear plateauing trade means forgoing the efficiency gains that come with increased specialisation and scale. For poor countries, in either case, the implications of what the Financial Times dubbed “peak trade” are sobering. Trade-led growth is the most successful development strategy the world has seen. Trading in value-added goods and services has improved resource allocation within countries’ economies, from Japan to Brazil, Botswana to Malaysia. In developing countries, tradable activities tend to be much more productive than the rest of the economy. As a result, getting people and capital out of subsistence work and into firms dealing in tradable goods and services tends to make for a more productive economy overall. All countries that have sustained high growth long enough for it to transform people’s life prospects have used the burgeoning global marketplace as a source of demand, ideas and technology. So what happens when the global marketplace is no longer booming? The IMF and World Bank findings indicate that the phenomenon that drove the especially rapid expansion of trade in the 1990s – the fragmentation of international production into multi-country supply chains across east Asia and the Pacific – has largely matured. Coastal Chinese firms are increasingly sourcing components from the country’s poorer interior, instead of importing them as they used to. This has caused trade volumes to fall. But not all the news is bad. While the US-China engine of trade growth “appears to have exhausted its propulsive energy for now”, the researchers found considerable scope for increasing the international division of labour in regions such as south Asia, Latin America and especially Africa, areas that have not yet made the most of supply chains. In today’s less buoyant global environment, however, seizing these underexploited opportunities will be harder than ever. The new World Trade Organisation agreement on trade facilitation (pdf) should help with some of the more obvious reforms: bad infrastructure and interminable waits at borders have made much of Africa, despite low wage levels, a high-cost location for labour-intensive light manufacturing. Other reforms extend beyond infrastructure. Many countries, for instance, still have considerable scope to cut import duties on inputs and equipment, and to open their telecommunications and logistics sectors to greater competition. Regional economic integration would help firms find markets close to home: research by the International Trade Centre (pdf), which I run, shows that African exports often face higher trade barriers in neighbouring countries than they do elsewhere. Other interventions are more complicated: enabling entrepreneurs based outside established centres of production to connect to new customers and markets is easier said than done. Such entrepreneurs need access to capital and trade finance, technical assistance to meet standards and other non-tariff measures, and a supportive policy climate. Matching international buyers to small and medium-sized sellers can yield impressive gains that are disproportionate to the volumes of trade involved. These gains may be especially pronounced when those firms are owned by women, who reinvest 90% of their incomes in their families and communities, more than twice as much as men do. Risk-sharing for small- and medium-sized companies that try to enter new export markets, or supply to international supply chains, would encourage companies to keep trying. Some of these policies are unfashionable. Some have been misused in the past. We should admit that some will fail. But the potential gains are enormous: growth and job creation in the parts of the world that most need it, and new markets for rich countries and companies facing diminished sales growth along established value chains. Integrating marginalised economies into international production networks requires governments, trade policymakers, the private sector and the aid community to work in concert. The UN’s new development agenda could do for trade what the last one did for public health, and stimulate new thinking, funds and cooperation to help marginalised economies thrive in world markets. A hard-nosed focus on trade competitiveness should keep trade and investment promotion efforts from derailing. With the low-hanging fruit of trade-led development dwindling, it is time for us to look higher. • Arancha González is executive director of the International Trade Centre, the joint agency of the UN and the World Trade Organisation",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/20/countries-international-trade-poverty-development,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/20/countries-international-trade-poverty-development
2015-01-20T05:00:02Z,global-development,Global development,Pharmaceutical companies told to slash price of pneumococcal disease vaccine,"Two giant pharmaceutical companies should lower the price of a new vaccine against pneumococcal disease that is needed by children in developing countries, but is unaffordable for some of their governments, say the volunteer doctors of Médecins sans Frontières (MSF). In a new report on vaccine pricing, MSF says British company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and US giant Pfizer should slash the price of the vaccines to $5 (£3.20) per child in developing countries. At the moment, the two big pharma companies are the sole manufacturers of the pneumococcal vaccine. The secretive nature of the industry means that prices are not disclosed in all countries, but, where they are known, there is huge variation. Hospitals in Morocco pay nearly $64 and in Tunisia $67, whereas the manufacturer’s price in France is less – at about $58.
“We have an irrational situation where some developing countries like Morocco and Tunisia are paying more for the pneumococcal vaccine than France does,” said Kate Elder, vaccines policy adviser for MSF’s Access Campaign. “Because of the astronomical cost of new vaccines, many governments are facing tough choices about which deadly diseases they can afford to protect their children against.” MSF says the pneumococcal vaccine is a big contributor to the soaring cost of vaccinating a child in the poorest countries – it accounts for 45% of the total. GSK and Pfizer have collectively reported more than $19bn in global sales of the vaccine since it launched. The full vaccination schedule which every child should receive includes 12 vaccines. Since 2001, the cost of the full package has risen dramatically, says the report, The Right Shot: bringing down barriers to affordable and adapted vaccines. “The price to fully vaccinate a child is 68 times more expensive than it was just over a decade ago, mainly because a handful of big pharmaceutical companies are overcharging donors and developing countries for vaccines that already earn them billions of dollars in wealthy countries,” said Rohit Malpani, director of policy and analysis for the MSF campaign. “Donors will be asked to put an additional $7.5bn on the table to pay for vaccines in poor countries for the next five years, with over one-third of that going to pay for one vaccine alone, the high-priced pneumococcal vaccine; just think of how much further taxpayer money could go to vaccinate more children if vaccines were cheaper. We think it’s time for GSK and Pfizer to do their part to make vaccines more affordable for countries in the long term, because the discounts the companies are offering today are just not good enough.” The report is published before next week’s meeting in Berlin, where donor governments will be asked to top up the coffers of Gavi – the vaccine alliance. Gavi subsidises the price for the poorest countries, but middle-income countries are increasingly struggling to pay, says MSF. More than a quarter of countries now eligible for Gavi support will lose it next year, as they “graduate” because of their increasing per capita income. Angola, for instance, will lose support in a year, which will push up its vaccines bill by 1,500%. MSF has difficulty affording the costs of vaccinating children in the emergency situations where it works. “MSF faces increasing challenges in offering full immunisation to children in our projects. The rising price of the basic vaccines package means that we can’t afford to protect kids living in crisis, and nor can many countries who want to protect their children,” said Dr Greg Elder, MSF deputy director of operations, in the report.
In a statement, GSK said its pneumococcal vaccine is “one of the most complex we’ve ever manufactured, essentially combining 10 vaccines in one”. It added: “For Gavi-eligible countries, we are providing this vaccine at a deeply discounted price. At this level, we are able to just cover our costs. To discount it further would threaten our ability to supply it to these countries in the long-term. Nevertheless, we continue to look at ways to reduce production costs and any savings we make we would pass on to Gavi.” Pfizer said 60% of the world’s poor children are covered by the Gavi programme at a price that is “far below” the cost to manufacture the vaccine. In a statement, Pfizer aded that it had committed to providing Prevenar 13 until 2025 at a reduced price to countries who no longer qualify for Gavi support. “This gives countries the best chance of maintaining their pneumococcal vaccination programmes and sustaining the significant public health gains these programmes provide, even after Gavi support ends.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/20/pharmaceutical-companies-pneumococcal-vaccine,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/20/pharmaceutical-companies-pneumococcal-vaccine
2015-01-19T16:52:51Z,global-development,Global development,One in five adolescents not in school as ‘education for all’ promise is broken,"Around 63 million adolescents have been denied their right to education, making them twice as likely to be out of school than primary school-age children, according to a report published on Monday. The report urges governments to shift policies and resources to avoid losing the gains made in expanding access to education in recent years. In total, 121 million children and adolescents have either never started school or have dropped out, with children living in conflict, child labourers and those facing discrimination because of ethnicity, gender and disability the most affected, the joint report (pdf) by two UN agencies said. With progress on increasing enrolment rates stalled since 2007, there is a growing risk that previous gains in expanding access to education will be eroded, said the report by the cultural and heritage body Unesco’s Institute for Statistics and the UN children’s agency, Unicef. “Business as usual strategies based on more teachers, more classrooms and more textbooks are not enough to reach the most disadvantaged children,” said Unesco’s director general, Irina Bokova. “We need targeted interventions to reach the families displaced by conflict, the girls forced to stay home, the children with disabilities and the millions obliged to work. But these policies come at a cost. This report serves as a wake-up call to mobilise the resources needed to guarantee basic education for every child, once and for all,” she said. The report, Fixing the Broken Promise of Education for All, was released at the start of a critical year for global development, with UN member states due to meet in New York in September to finalise a new set of targets – the sustainable development goals (SDGs) – to replace the millennium development goals (MDGs) that expire at the end of this year. A draft set of 17 SDGs has been drawn up, and the proposed goal four requires member states to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”. Pressure is mounting to include universal secondary education as a target, the report said. Under the MDGs, countries were asked to ensure that, by 2015, children everywhere would be able to complete a full course of primary schooling. UN figures show that the adjusted net enrolment rate for primary education rose from 88% in 1990 to 90% in 2012, but millions of children are still outside the education system.
“The progress made has not been equitable: it is the most disadvantaged children who are still left behind. What’s more, progress has stalled. While access to education expanded considerably at the beginning of the 2000s, there has been little or no change in the global number of out-of-school children since 2007. The global primary out-of-school rate has stagnated at around 9% for the past seven years,” the report said. The situation is even worse for adolescents. The report, which was funded by the Global Partnership for Education, said about 63 million adolescents between the ages of 12 and 15 were being denied their right to education. That meant one in five adolescents were not in school, compared with one in 11 primary school-age children. If trends continue, 25 million children – 15 million girls and 10 million boys – may never set foot inside a classroom, the report said. The greatest barrier to education remains poverty. In Nigeria, two-thirds of children in the poorest households were not in school, while only 5% of the richest children were out of school. The highest out-of-school rates were in Eritrea and Liberia, where 66% and 59% of children, respectively, do not go to primary school, the report said. “To realise the promise of universal education for every child, we need a global commitment to invest in three areas: getting more children into primary school; helping more children – especially girls – stay in school through the secondary level; and improving the quality of the learning they receive throughout their schooling,” said Unicef executive director Anthony Lake. Unesco and Unicef said new policies should focus on the most marginalised children – a recommendation that falls in line with the UN’s stated aim of leaving no one behind with the SDGs. The report’s authors said more reliable data collection was needed to identify the most vulnerable children, especially children with disabilities who are among the least visible. “As the international community renews and expands its commitments as part of the post-2015 development agenda, we must focus on these children, and the millions of others struggling to realise their right to an education — and to fulfil their dreams for a better future,” the report said. “By working together and promoting greater investment, we can and must dismantle the barriers that stand in their way, one by one — and in doing so, deliver on our global promise of education for every child.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/19/one-in-five-adolescents-not-in-school-as-education-for-all-promise-is-broken,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/19/one-in-five-adolescents-not-in-school-as-education-for-all-promise-is-broken

2015-01-19T13:31:59Z,global-development,Global development,Sustainable development goals: all you need to know,"What are the sustainable development goals? The sustainable development goals (SDGs) are a new, universal set of goals, targets and indicators that UN member states will be expected to use to frame their agendas and political policies over the next 15 years. The SDGs follow and expand on the millennium development goals (MDGs), which were agreed by governments in 2001 and are due to expire at the end of this year. Why do we need another set of goals? There is broad agreement that, while the MDGs provided a focal point for governments – a framework around which they could develop policies and overseas aid programmes designed to end poverty and improve the lives of poor people – as well as a rallying point for NGOs to hold them to account, they were too narrow. The eight MDGs – reduce poverty and hunger; achieve universal education; promote gender equality; reduce child and maternal deaths; combat HIV, malaria and other diseases; ensure environmental sustainability; develop global partnerships – failed to consider the root causes of poverty and overlooked gender inequality as well as the holistic nature of development. The goals made no mention of human rights and did not specifically address economic development. While the MDGs, in theory, applied to all countries, in reality they were considered targets for poor countries to achieve, with finance from wealthy states. Conversely, every country will be expected to work towards achieving the SDGs. As the MDG deadline approaches, about 1 billion people still live on less than $1.25 a day – the World Bank measure on poverty – and more than 800 million people do not have enough food to eat. Women are still fighting hard for their rights, and millions of women still die in childbirth. What are the proposed 17 goals? 1) End poverty in all its forms everywhere 2) End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture 3) Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages 4) Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all 5) Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls 6) Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all 7) Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all 8) Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all 9) Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation, and foster innovation 10) Reduce inequality within and among countries 11) Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable 12) Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns 13) Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts (taking note of agreements made by the UNFCCC forum) 14) Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development 15) Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification and halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss 16) Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels 17) Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalise the global partnership for sustainable development Within the goals are 169 targets, to put a bit of meat on the bones. Targets under goal one, for example, include reducing by at least half the number of people living in poverty by 2030, and eradicating extreme poverty (people living on less than $1.25 a day). Under goal five, there’s a target on eliminating violence against women, while goal 16 has a target to promote the rule of law and equal access to justice. How were the goals chosen? Unlike the MDGs, which were drawn up by a group of men in the basement of UN headquarters (or so the legend goes), the UN has conducted the largest consultation programme in its history to gauge opinion on what the SDGs should include. Establishing post-2015 goals was an outcome of the Rio+20 summit in 2012, which mandated the creation of an open working group to come up with a draft agenda. The open working group, with representatives from 70 countries, had its first meeting in March 2013 and published its final draft, with its 17 suggestions, in July 2014. The draft was presented to the UN general assembly in September last year. Member state negotiations followed, and the final wording of the goals and targets, and the preamble and declaration that comes with them, were agreed in August 2015. Alongside the open working group discussions, the UN conducted a series of “global conversations”. These included 11 thematic and 83 national consultations, and door-to-door surveys. The UN also launched an online My World survey asking people to prioritise the areas they’d like to see addressed in the goals. The results of the consultations were fed into the the working group’s discussions. Are governments happy about the proposed 17 goals? The majority seem to be, but a handful of member states, including the UK and Japan, aren’t so keen. Some countries feel that an agenda consisting of 17 goals is too unwieldy to implement or sell to the public, and would prefer a narrower brief. Or so they say. Some believe the underlying reason is to get rid of some of the more uncomfortable goals, such as those relating to the environment. Britain’s prime minister, David Cameron, has publicly said he wants 12 goals at the most, preferably 10. It’s not clear, though, which goals the UK government would like taken out if they had the choice. Amina Mohammed, the UN secretary general’s special adviser on post-2015 development planning, said it had been a hard fight to get the number of goals down to 17, so there would be strong resistance to reducing them further. Some NGOs also believe there are too many goals, but there is a general consensus that it is better to have 17 goals that include targets on women’s empowerment, good governance, and peace and security, for example, than fewer goals that don’t address these issues. How will the goals be measured? The indicators are still being thrashed out by an expert group. Each indicator is being assessed for its feasibility, suitability and relevance, and roughly two for each target are expected. The indicators are due to be finalised in March 2016. How will the goals be funded? That’s the trillion-dollar question. Rough calculations from the intergovernmental committee of experts on sustainable development financing have put the cost of providing a social safety net to eradicate extreme poverty at about $66bn (£43bn) a year, while annual investments in improving infrastructure (water, agriculture, transport, power) could be up to a total of $7tn globally. In its report last year, the committee said public finance and aid would be central to support the implementation of the SDGs. But it insisted that money generated from the private sector, through tax reforms, and through a crackdown on illicit financial flows and corruption, was also vital. A major conference on financing for the SDGs, held in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa in July, failed to ease concerns that there will not be enough cash to meet the aspirational nature of the goals. The UN said the Addis Ababa action agenda (AAAA for short) contained “bold measures to overhaul global finance practices and generate investment” for tackling the challenges of sustainable development. It included a recommitment to the UN target on aid spending – 0.7% of GNI – set more than 40 years ago and pledges to collect more taxes and fight tax evasion. But civil society groups were less impressed, saying the summit had failed to produce new money to fund the goals, or offer ways to transform the international finance system.

2015-01-19T07:00:11Z,global-development,Global development,Somalis torn between hunger in Dadaab and uncertainty at home,"On 8 December, a blue and purple bus made a highly significant and somewhat controversial journey, 350 miles across the tatty scrubland that forms the border between Kenya and Somalia. Inside the vehicle, bumping across the plain, were 91 people travelling from their old home, the Dadaab refugee camp in northern Kenya, to an even older one: the port city of Kismayo in southern Somalia, from where they had fled war and famine nearly four years ago. The bus was the first in a pilot project run by the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, facilitating what is called “spontaneous, voluntary returns” of refugees to Somalia. Four more buses have since departed for Somalia, returning home a total of 602 people. A sixth was postponed due to security concerns. The controversial aspect is that Somalia is still at war, food shortages are widespread, and access for humanitarians is difficult along roads blocked by fighting and checkpoints established by the insurgent group al-Shabaab. The same month as the returns began, the UN humanitarian coordinator in Somalia, Philippe Lazzarini, appealed for nearly $900m in 2015, warning: “For the first time since the 2011 famine, the number of people in need of life-saving assistance has increased. Over a million Somalis are unable to meet their basic food requirements. A further 2.1 million people are on the verge of acute food insecurity, bringing the total number of people in need of humanitarian assistance to 3.2 million.” Kenya has waged a long campaign to encourage the refugees to return, even invading Somalia in 2011 in part to create a safe area where the refugees could be settled. In November 2013, two months after the Westgate shopping mall attack by al-Shabaab, that pressure culminated in the signing of a tripartite agreement on voluntary return between Kenya, Somalia and the UN, even though conditions in Somalia are still bad. The Dadaab refugee camp is the world’s largest, with a population of about 357,000, and approximately 1,000 births a month. UN officials have said they expect it still to exist in 10 years’ time. Though the numbers going back are tiny, the return agenda is shaping both policy and individual refugee decisions. Donors have been quick to encourage returns and trim budgets in Dadaab. Last year, NGOs leapt to pitch for programmes supporting returns while cutting other activities in the camp. And when, at the end of last year, the World Food Programme (WFP) ran short of money globally and asked rich governments for help, Syria, South Sudan and Central African Republic were prioritised while the Kenya operation was among those that took a hit. In November and December, the WFP was forced to halve food rations – normally about 3kg of dry sorghum and maize a person weekly. A group of vulnerable women left their babies at the gates of a Dadaab food warehouse in protest. Despite a vigorous WFP campaign explaining otherwise, to the refugees it was all part of the same conspiracy: to force them back to Somalia. “1.5kg a week? A person cannot stay here,” said Mohammed, a long-term resident of Ifo camp who came as a child in 1992 and whose five children were all born here and have never left.
Refugees are supposed to be offered one of three durable solutions to their displacement: return to their country of origin, integration into their country of asylum, or resettlement to a third country. Kenya, however, is unwilling to grant the refugees citizenship, even seeking to impose a new security bill this month with a clause limiting the amount of time refugees can stay. Meanwhile, resettlement slots to the US and Europe have all but dried up, falling from thousands a year in the 90s, to a few hundred now. Feeding people whom the world has confined to camps is an obligation under international law, but as donors tire of protracted refugee situations such as Dadaab, budgets begin to fall. Earlier in the year, Médecins sans Frontières condemned appalling conditions in Dadaab and warned that humanitarian needs must be met in the camp as donors’ attention shifts elsewhere. The leader of Mohammed’s block went on a UN-sponsored trip to Kismayo to see for herself conditions for return. She was not impressed. “No schools, no hospitals, no security,” she reported back to her constituents. Nonetheless, more people are signing up for the return package, which includes three months of rations and a cash grant of $150 (£99) a person. For Mohammed, raised in the camp, Somalia is a foreign country, and a scary one at that. “I fear that place,” he said. “But if the food stops, there is no reason to stay in the camp.” From one perspective, the picture of those buses bouncing across the no man’s land could be a good news story. From another, it could be the last resort of desperate people forced to choose between hunger and war. • Ben Rawlence’s book, City of Thorns: Fear and Longing in the World’s Largest Refugee Camp, will be published by Portobello in 2016",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/19/somalia-dadaab-refugee-camp-kenya,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/19/somalia-dadaab-refugee-camp-kenya
2015-01-17T09:00:03Z,global-development,Global development,Mauritania activists jailed as police quash resurgent anti-slavery protests,"Police used teargas to disperse protesters, after three anti-slavery activists – including a presidential runner-up – were jailed amid a resurgent anti-slavery movement in the nation with the world’s highest rate of the practice. Biram Ould Abeid, the head of an anti-slavery group, who came second in presidential polls in Mauritania last year, was handed a two-year jail sentence alongside fellow human rights defenders Brahim Bilal and Djiby Sow. Himself the son of freed slaves, Ould Abeid and seven others were arrested in November, after they began criss-crossing the desert country to raise awareness of land rights among Haratines, or black Mauritanians, who were historically enslaved by lighter-skinned compatriots. Haratines are often forced to give up a portion of their crops to the traditional masters. But Mauritanian authorities accused Ould Abeid’s Initiative for the Resurgence of the Abolitionist Movement of spreading “racist propaganda” during its caravan, arresting him and shutting down the organisation’s headquarters in the capital, Nouakchott. Bilal and Sow were arrested for calling for protests against the detention of their colleague. All three men were charged under anti-terrorism laws for “belonging to an illegal organisation, leading an unauthorised rally, and violence against the police”, said defence lawyer Brahim Ould Ebetty, who added that they would appeal. “The verdict is arbitrary and political. Just because a Haratine is fighting against slavery in Mauritania … he is condemned to prison.” Ould Abeid had accused the president, Mohamed Abdelaziz, of rigging the elections after he won 82% of the vote. Seven others on trial were released. Supporters, many of whom had also flocked to the awareness workshops set up by the group, reportedly stormed the courthouse in the southern city of Rosso, and surrounded the prosecutor’s office while others smashed the windows of the police van that was carrying the three men. Police responded with teargas, leaving four people injured. “The conviction of these activists for taking part in peaceful protests on charges which are vague and open to abuse violates their human rights to free expression and freedom of peaceful assembly,’’ said Gaetan Mootoo, a west Africa researcher for Amnesty International. “Their conviction appears to be politically motivated with members of the group targeted on account of their peaceful activism.” Anti-slavery activists have stepped up campaigning recently in Mauritania, which in 1981 became the world’s last country to officially abolish slavery. But the practice has continued to flourish in remote desert outposts. Figures are notoriously difficult to confirm. The Walk Free Foundation said recently that up to 151,000 people in the country are thought to be slaves. Activists suggest the number could be five times higher. But there has been only one successful conviction since slavery was criminalised in 2007. In the face of repeated official denials, former slaves speak of a rigid caste system that favours “noble-born” Beydan, or white Mauritanians. Darker-skinned Mauritanians and black Africans say that zealous efforts to brand the country an Arab republic have left them on the the edges of society by concentrating power and wealth among overwhelmingly lighter-skinned people. Disenfranchisement is often insidious. “We are reaching a point where it’s getting hard to see how we can peacefully regain our rights,” said Ibrahima Ndiaye from Nouakchott. Last year, the 52-year-old organised a 10-day, 400km march through the Sahara to protest against black citizens being held in what he said amounted to “slave camps”. About 100 marchers were among almost 30,000 black citizens who fled systematic ethnic killings by security forces in the early 1990s. Roughly 6,000 later returned under UN escort in 2008, but have been denied national identity cards repeatedly, depriving them of land ownership, employment opportunities and even the ability to travel freely in a country littered with military checkpoints. “We’re effectively refugees in our own country,” said Ndiaye, adding that children of returnees frequently can’t go to school. The lack of papers means the former farmers, who are unable to regain their lands, have instead been rehoused in camps without water or electricity supplies. “These are people who once worked their own fields, had homes and animals, and are now living in terrible conditions,” said Alassane Dia, a friend of Ould Abeid who runs his own pressure group, Ne Touche Pas à ma Nationalité (“hands off my nationality”). Returnees were told the government had sold their land to anonymous buyers, or given it to Haratines. “It’s a deliberate, calculated strategy by the state with the aim of pitching two oppressed [black] groups against each other. It is done so they don’t unite,” Dia added. Ne Touche Pas à ma Nationalité has also led protests after the government announced plans to include race categories on national identity documents. Only four ethnicities – Moorish, Soninké, Fulani and Wolof – would be recognised, disenfranchising the Haratines.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/17/mauritania-anti-slavery-activists-jailed-biram-ould-abeid,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/17/mauritania-anti-slavery-activists-jailed-biram-ould-abeid
2015-01-16T16:20:00Z,global-development,Global development,Peru labour law sparks backlash from enraged youth amid calls for repeal,"Thousands of young Peruvians have marched through central Lima, chanting: “We don’t want to be cheap, exploited manpower”, in the latest protest against a controversial labour law which demonstrators claim robs them of basic rights, but which the government argues will boost employment. Thursday’s march, which was joined by trade unionists, ended in a violent standoff with police, who fired tear gas at the protesters. About 20 people were arrested and 16 officers injured, according to the interior ministry. There was no immediate information on whether any protesters were injured. Dubbed the “Ley Pulpín”, or Pulpín Law, the youth employment law’s derogatory moniker has its origins in a brand of fruit juice that is targeted at children and often carried in school lunch boxes. The term “Pulpín” has come to mean an innocent or immature young person who can be exploited. The law came into effect in mid-December and has been opposed bitterly by many of the 18-24-year-olds it is intended to benefit. The protest in Lima was mirrored in 10 other cities, and there has been an outpouring of criticism on social media. The law aims to foster the creation of jobs by lowering costs for employers who hire young people. Holiday entitlement will be cut from 30 to 15 days, social security and life insurance will be reduced, and two annual bonuses and severance pay will disappear. The government insists the law will enable many young people to join the formal economy because companies will be encouraged by the lower costs to create more jobs for young workers who lack experience. But many of those targeted say the legislation simply allows companies to exploit young people. “We’re standing up for our rights, faced with a government that wants to suppress us by taking away our labour rights,” said Katerina Troncos, a 23-year-old journalism student, as she marched in Lima. PR student Carla Montoya, 21, said: “This law affects me personally. Even if we are on staff, this law cuts a load of our rights. We hope it will be repealed: if it’s not, there could a general strike.” Julio Arbizu, Peru’s former anti-corruption prosecutor, agrees. “We must tell the government that these are rights. They’re not benefits or the employers’ acts of generosity. They are rights that our fathers and grandfathers won in the streets and these rights are inalienable,” he said as he took part in Thursday’s march.As the march unfolded, hackers known as @anonymousperu downed a dozen Peruvian state websites, including those of the Congress and the interior ministry, in coordinated cyber attacks. The World Bank describes Peru as one of South America’s fastest growing economies, pointing out that poverty rates were more than halved between 2005 and 2013, from about 45% to 24 % of the population. However, growth last year was hit by a drop in manufacturing and a slowdown in mining, which accounts for about 15% of GDP. So far, President Ollanta Humala’s government has rejected calls to repeal the controversial law. Such action would amount to the Peruvian state “turning its back on those 1.8 million young people who today have nothing and with this law could successfully enter the labour market, improving their ability, education, their CVs and, as a result, their employability,” said the labour minister, Fredy Otárola, on the eve of the latest protest. The youth employment law would also oblige companies to provide on-the-job training and help employees to complete their education, he said. But critics say the Pulpín law is a heavy-handed effort to exploit the young. The campaign has been joined by several local celebrities, ensuring coverage and increasing the pressure. “The government says that a big portion of Peruvian youth don’t have [labour] rights so they will give them something. That’s their argument … that, in a democracy, is unacceptable,” said the actor Jason Day. Other critics claim the law’s true beneficiary is big business. Javier Neves, a professor of labour law at Lima’s Pontifical Catholic University, said Peru’s powerful, private industry employer’s confederation, CONFIEP, had lobbied for the new labour law. “The government has looked for a way to hide this by saying that the law will improve training for young people and promote their employability, but it’s not really trying to achieve this. What it’s trying to do is drastically reduce labour costs for medium-sized and big businesses,” he said. Neves said the perception that there is an unemployment crisis among 18-24 year-olds is also false. He cited official statistics showing that between 2008 and 2013 employment among 18-24 year-olds rose from 25% to 63% % while underemployment dropped from 65% to 28%. “This is a rushed, mendacious law which should be repealed. Young people will be able to better insert themselves in a labour market when there’s a real investment in quality education,” he said. The law will be debated in Congress on 28 January and, until then, protesters are likely to keep up the pressure on the streets of Lima and other cities, as well as on social media.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/16/peru-labour-law-pulpin-youth-employment-protest,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/16/peru-labour-law-pulpin-youth-employment-protest
2015-01-16T16:00:58Z,global-development,Global development,Crises in Middle East and Africa lead to fourfold increase in migration to Europe,"The number of migrants landing on Italian shores quadrupled last year, as more than 170,000 people from the Middle East and Africa fled humanitarian crises, piling pressure on the EU to form a long-term migration strategy. Syrians fleeing civil war and Eritreans escaping forced conscription comprised nearly half of all Italian boat arrivals in 2014, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). Refugees from Mali, Nigeria and Gambia were also common. Many migrants brave a perilous journey across the Mediterranean to Italy before travelling overland to other European countries. Last year, a total of 170,100 refugees arrived in Italy by boat, the IOM said. This marked a rise of nearly 300% from 2013, when Italian authorities recorded 42,925 arrivals.
“Many of these people are fleeing war, persecution and totalitarian regimes,” said Federico Soda, the IOM’s head of Italian operations. Refugees used to attempt crossings only in warmer months, but a growing desperation to gain asylum in Europe has created a year-round smuggling business, the IOM said. As a result, more ill-equipped boats are journeying across the Mediterranean, leading to a sharp rise in migrant deaths. More than 3,200 fatalities were recorded last year; in 2013, the total was 700. “These figures suggest that the flows are linked to the deteriorating multiple and complex humanitarian crises near Europe’s external borders, including the war in Syria and the unrest caused by the political instability in Libya,” Soda said. The sharp rise in Syrian and Eritrean refugees journeying to Europe is a major factor in rising migration flows. Last year, more than 11,000 Syrians landed in Italy, while this year more than 40,000 made the crossing. Nearly 35,000 Eritreans came to Italy in 2014, up from just less than 10,000 in 2013.
The hazardous nature of the journey across the Mediterranean faced by many migrants was highlighted in 2013, when a boat carrying mostly Eritreans sank near Lampedusa, off the coast of Italy, killing nearly 300. For Eritreans, many of whom have fallen victim to torture and trafficking in Sudan and Egypt over the past 10 years, travelling overland has often proved equally unsafe. Syrian migrants have started paying “unscrupulous smugglers” up to $6,000 (£3,943) to be smuggled on Turkish cargo ships destined for southern Italy, the IOM said.
Operation Mare Nostrum, run by Italy’s navy, saved about 85,000 lives last year, according to the IOM. But its high cost has raised concerns that it may be discontinued unless the EU agrees to contribute funding. “It is urgent to respond collectively to these migratory flows. Migration can only be managed by the EU as a whole: and its scale and complexity necessitates cooperation and collective action,” said Soda. In November last year the EU’s border agency, Frontex, launched its Triton operation, which monitors migration using two aircraft, three ships and seven teams of officers for “debriefing/intelligence gathering and screening/identification purposes”. The operation has €2.9m a month in funding, but this expires in 2015. Triton has less funding and a more limited geographic scope than Mare Nostrum, according to Judith Sunderland, Human Rights Watch’s senior western Europe researcher. “It took a long for the EU to even take up the migration issue … their primary focus is surveilling maritime borders, but of course they are involved in rescue operations,” said Sunderland. Sofa said: “This is not a crisis of an excess of migrants reaching Europe and overburdening the continent – an area with a population of about 500 million people. It is an emergency in the sense that more migrants now need protection, aid and safe migration channels.” • This article was amended on 19 January to correct the number of people killed in the October 2013 Lampedusa boat sinking.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/16/migration-to-europe-middle-east-africa-fourfold-increase-2014,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/16/migration-to-europe-middle-east-africa-fourfold-increase-2014
2015-01-16T13:47:27Z,global-development,Global development,DfID rallies against criticism of UK spending £1bn on aid in two months,"The Department for International Development (DfID) has defended its decision to spend £1bn in two months in order to ensure the government kept a promise to devote 0.7% of the UK’s income to foreign aid, despite concerns that the rushed move may have resulted in “missed opportunities”. In 2013, Britain became the first G7 country to meet the UN target of spending 0.7% of its gross national income (GNI) on official development assistance (ODA), with £11.46bn – or 0.71% of the country’s income – going to overseas aid and development. All three main political parties made manifesto promises to put the 0.7% measure into law and pledged to do so in the 2010 coalition agreement. In order to achieve the goal, DfID’s budget was increased while those of most other departments were reduced as the government sought to cut spending. However, according to a new report from the National Audit Office (NAO), pressure to hit the target meant that DfID was required to spend an additional £1bn in November and December 2013. The money was used to increase the UK’s humanitarian support in Syria and the Philippines, and to boost the UK’s contribution to the global fight against Aids, TB and malaria. It said pressure to hit the target had led DfID to change its spending plans with scant notice, “which constrained choice”, adding: “Given the limited time available the department could only choose activities where funds could be paid out during 2013. It may therefore have missed opportunities to get the best outcomes from this spending.” The problem, said the NAO, was that DfID has to work to two different year ends: while the target relates to cash expenditure over a calendar year, the department’s financial year ends in March. “This difference is likely to represent more than an accounting difficulty because of the need to hit a target with little or no flexibility, causing significant decisions to be made late in the year and at short notice,” it said. The report also said that assessing whether or not the target had been reached was further complicated by changes in how GNI is calculated. In October 2014, for example, DfID published four different figures for the ratio of ODA spending to national income, which ranged from 0.67% to 0.72%, depending on how GNI was calculated. Sir Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrat chairman of the international development select committee, said that while governments should not be let off the hook on aid, a way needed to be found to stop sudden spending spurts. One option, he said, would be to allow the 0.7% target to be met over the average of two years. DfID said that the 0.7% commitment was something to be proud of, adding that all UK aid was subjected to “a rigorous value for money assessment” and went only where it was most needed. A spokeswoman for the department said: “Using available GNI estimates, DfID sets a clear strategy each year to deliver its ODA target and works with the Treasury to monitor and manage this through the year. It is normal practice and good financial management for organisations to take stock of priorities and emerging pressure through the year.” She said the nature of DfID’s activities – which include responding rapidly to humanitarian emergencies such as the Ebola outbreak in parts of west Africa and Typhoon Haiyan, which affected more than 11 million people in the Philippines – meant it was vital to have built-in financial flexibility. After becoming secretary of state for international development in September 2012, Justine Greening lowered the threshold for ministerial approval for all projects from £40m to £5m. The move, she said, was designed “to make sure that we truly have the chance to drive value for money across the board”. Rocco Blume, policy manager at the global children’s charity Plan UK, said the management and allocation of the 0.7% budget called for the highest standards of transparency and accountability, but added: “The challenges raised by a percentage target are not insurmountable and as a point of principle and a guarantee to the world’s poorest, this is one commitment that politicians should not be deterred from.” Efforts to fulfil the coalition pledge to enshrine the 0.7% commitment in law have been protracted because of backbench Tory attempts to kill the private member’s bill brought by the former Lib Dem cabinet minister Michael Moore. One opponent of the move, the Conservative MP Philip Davies, memorably described the legislation as little more than a way to placate “Guardian-reading, sandal-wearing, lentil-eating do-gooders with a misguided guilt complex”. Others disagree. “British aid has a proven track record of transforming the lives of some of the world’s poorest people,” said Blume. “A legal commitment to devoting 0.7% of our national income to international aid would be a powerful example to the world, ensuring our ability to securely plan projects in the long-term and so helping us to reach the most marginalised groups, such as adolescent girls.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/16/dfid-national-audit-office-criticism-uk-aid-spending-1bn-two-months,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/16/dfid-national-audit-office-criticism-uk-aid-spending-1bn-two-months
2015-01-16T07:00:09Z,global-development,Global development,Nigeria's elections promise a genuine contest – but avoiding unrest is vital | Comfort Ero,"With less than a month to go before contentious polls, Nigeria is facing a perfect storm. Elections on 14 and 28 February are not only about choosing a new president and political representatives; they also constitute a critical test for Nigeria’s unity, particularly after five years of insurgency by the radical Islamist group Boko Haram. A public pledge for a peaceful election and the avoidance of violence after the polls has been signed by the seven presidential candidates, including the two front-runners: President Goodluck Jonathan and the former head of state, Muhammadu Buhari. It is certainly a positive first step, but it will be seriously undermined without full support and respect on the ground. Past elections have been violent, but the February polls could be particularly destabilising because they mark the first nationwide contest in decades between two relatively equal political parties – the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), which has held the presidency and most state governments since the return to democratic rule in 1999, and the All Progressives Congress (APC), a merger of the four largest opposition parties. This genuine contest is a sign of progress. But the acrimony between the parties, aggravated by regional and religious claims of entitlement to the presidency, has created a volatile environment. Jonathan is a Christian from the south, while Buhari is a Muslim from the north. Violence intensified in January, and included a gun attack on seven opposition members, allegedly by PDP agents. In northern Kano state, PDP supporters have been unable to campaign for fear of lynch mobs. Jonathan’s campaign bus was attacked and burned in Jos, Plateau state. Supporters of both candidates have threatened violence if they feel their man has been cheated. Boko Haram’s attacks make the vote still more hazardous. The insurgents are hampering the work of the independent national electoral commission (Inec) and have already forced it to halt elections in high-risk areas of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states. The insurgents may seize more communities – and more voters – before the polls.
At the time of writing, the electoral commission is still struggling to get permanent voter cards to more than 15 million registered voters (about 22% of the electorate). It has asked voters to collect them instead, which for many will necessitate an arduous journey. Despite a senate resolution, in December, ordering Inec to make provisions that would enable internally displaced persons to vote – a move that would allow probably in excess of one million to participate in the election – this has not yet happened. As most displaced persons are from areas that traditionally support the opposition, this could disproportionately affect the APC, increasing the likelihood of the final results being disputed. Pro-PDP bias in security agencies also heightens tensions, raising doubts about how they will deal with potential post-election violence. The security services’ inadequacies have been exposed by Boko Haram, leaving many citizens to wonder if they will actually be safe at the polling stations. The police are dysfunctional and have suffered immense retaliation at the hand of insurgents, and the army is reeling from casualties, corruption and mismanagement. Four key steps must be taken to lower the political temperature. First, political parties and the presidential candidates, who bear the primary responsibility for preventing violence, need to tone down their rhetoric and hold their supporters accountable. In the event of contested results, aggrieved parties must turn to the courts, rather than to violence or unconstitutional arrangements. Second, Jonathan and his military chiefs must contain Boko Haram while avoiding heavy-handed tactics that alienate northern regions. As the governors of the three most affected states have demanded, the federal government should urgently deploy more troops and intelligence personnel both to repel Boko Haram and to protect voters. Boko Haram’s recent attack on Baga, a village on the border with Chad, shows the government must enhance its cooperation with neighbouring countries to stem cross-border operations. Third, the electoral commission must act quickly to ensure that millions of voters are not disenfranchised. When it is unable to deliver new voter cards, it should allow voters to use their old ones. Fourth, institutions overseeing security agencies and monitoring respect for citizens’ rights, including the police service commission, national human rights commission and relevant committees of the federal parliament, should publicly condemn partisan acts and other excesses by security agencies. Nigeria’s religious, civic and media leaders have a critical role in urging politicians to take these steps to limit the risk of widespread violence. Nigerians cannot afford to continue with politics as usual; it is ruining their country.

2015-01-15T16:51:48Z,global-development,Global development,"Give us a better, safer future, British teenagers urge Cameron and Miliband","World leaders must demonstrate a renewed and unambiguous commitment to tackling the interlinked issues of development and climate change over the coming months, according to a young ambassador for a new global initiative that aims to make 2015 a landmark year for action on poverty and the environment. As events to launch the action/2015 campaign kicked off in more than 50 countries across the world on Thursday, Niamh Griffin, a 15-year-old activist from London, called on politicians to face up to their responsibilities. “We need to tackle the environmental issues – climate change and global warming – as well as inequalities, because inequality affects poverty,” she said. “As long as inequality exists, many countries will be prohibited from developing in a fair and sustainable way. Take gender discrimination: if you’ve only got half of your population being educated, that’s half your potential income being wasted.” Griffin, one of 15 teenage British campaigners chosen to argue for greater political progress as part of the action/2015 initiative, said the world needed to heed the voices of the young people who will bear the brunt of the decisions made at two key UN summits this year. “We’re ready and we’re prepared to put the effort in to make the positive change that we feel the world needs,” she said. “I think there’s a lot more attention being paid to young people through things like action/2015, and that is important because it’s going to be us who are taking on these new challenges.” Griffin and the 14 other young campaigners handed in a letter to Downing Street on Thursday afternoon calling on David Cameron to ensure that 2015 ends with “a global compact – an agreed pathway to a better, safer future for people and planet that will inspire the citizens of the world”. Action/2015 is backed by more than 1,000 organisations around the world as well as activists, business people and celebrities such as Malala Yousafzai, Muhammad Yunus, Ben Affleck, Bill Gates and Richard Branson. The campaign is pressing for action as the UN meets in New York in September to agree the sustainable development goals (SDGs), which will replace the millennium development goals (MDGs), and in Paris in December to seek a new international agreement on climate change. Some of the young British campaigners met the leaders of the three main political parties this week to argue the case for swift and concrete agreements. Speaking at a school in north London on Thursday morning, the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, said that the MDGs had shown what could be achieved when consensus was reached. “As a result of the millennium development goals – 15 years later – 17,000 fewer children die every day in our world as a result of vaccines and other efforts and – this is an extraordinary figure – 58 million more children go to primary school across our world,” he said. “There’s still a long way to go in getting kids to go to primary school – something we all take for granted – but don’t believe those people who tell you that nothing can change, that extreme poverty is always going to be here, and that nothing’s ever going to be different.” Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, has also acknowledged the campaign’s importance, saying that whatever the result of May’s general election, the UK needs to “seize 2015 as a crucial opportunity to take big global decisions”. Speaking at the UK launch of action/2015 in London, Jamie Drummond, the founder and executive director of the advocacy group ONE, said the campaign connected civil society from the global south and global north, as well as groups working on a diverse range of issues, from human rights, climate justice and transparency to gender equality, poverty and hunger. “We’ve got the whole kit and caboodle … uniting to demand leaders do better this year [on their promises] and then demand they keep them. We don’t want vague UN promises, we want specific, accountable plans to back up visionary goals, where financing for plans is clear and everyday people can follow the details,” said Drummond, a veteran of anti-poverty coalition campaigns, including Jubilee 2000 in the 1990s and Make Poverty History in 2005. Jonathan Glennie, director of policy and research at Save the Children, said there had been “immense progress” in reducing poverty over the past 20 years. But over the same period, levels of inequality have risen and climate change has got worse. He pointed to research from the University of Denver that suggests the number of people living in poverty by 2030 could increase by 886 million, to 1.2 billon, unless leaders agree a strong set of sustainable development goals and take decisive action on climate change. Conversely, the number of people in poverty could fall to 360 million. “If we get some measures wrong, we could live in a world with more people in poverty,” said Glennie, who added that the outcome of a major meeting in Addis Ababa in July to discuss how to finance the new set of goals will be crucial. The 17 proposed SDGs – which include ending poverty and hunger, women’s empowerment, climate change, accountable governments and employment and education – are the result of 18 months of debate by 70 countries on the UN open working group, consultations with people in 130 countries, and the contribution of 7 million people who took part in the UN’s My World survey. It represents the largest body of evidence collected by the UN in its 70-year history. Among the top four priorities for people who took part in the survey were honest and responsive governments. “This was not in the last set of [millennium development] goals. They are in this set of draft goals. It may not be in the final set if some governments have their way. There are real things at stake here,” said Drummond. Next Monday, member states will begin negotiations to finalise the goals, which will be ratified by the UN in September.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/15/action-2015-campaign-poverty-climate-change-british-teenagers-david-cameron,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/15/action-2015-campaign-poverty-climate-change-british-teenagers-david-cameron
2015-01-15T09:00:09Z,global-development,Global development,"Gorillas, guns and volcanoes: on patrol with Congo's first female rangers | Jessica Hatcher","A Kalashnikov, a cartridge magazine, some spare casings and a pink plastic hand mirror are strewn across Francine Bwizabule Muhimuzi’s roughly made bed at the staff accommodation on the edge of Virunga national park. She is one of the first tranche of women who last year became rangers – “gardiens du parc” – at Africa’s oldest national park. Muhimuzi has just returned from a week stationed halfway up Mount Nyiragongo, one of the world’s most active volcanoes. “I’d see the volcano as a child from Goma, but I never thought I’d go up there,” she says. Today, she makes the 2,000m ascent, Kalashnikov on her shoulder, without breaking a sweat. “There is not yet equality, but in the park, we see it is improving, because they have begun to recruit women.”The 27-year-old, who was forced to flee her home in Bukavu, South Kivu, in 2004, when CNDP rebels took the town, says she is putting her career first; marriage is not in her plans right now. “I had nothing, and to get married with nothing? Men would be walking all over me.”With few jobs available in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, many women work in the informal sector, where income is erratic and benefits such as holiday and maternity leave don’t exist. There are only 300,000 formal private-sector jobs for the whole country, with a population of 68 million, according to the World Bank. Growth in the east of the country has been particularly stunted by insecurity and poor infrastructure. Around Virunga, in North Kivu, formal work opportunities are largely limited to jobs with non-profit organisations, battling nepotism to secure a job as a public servant, or joining the army, where living conditions are notoriously bad, and wages poor and irregularly paid. Born into a polygamous family, Muhimuzi is the youngest of 21 children from four wives. Having a career, she says, means she will have fewer children: “just four”. Congo has one of the highest birth rates in the world, and is reliably in the top 10 for teenage pregnancies, according to the World Health Organisation, a significant factor in the high maternal mortality rate; 730 women die for every 100,000 live births, according to World Bank figures. Virunga national park, a state institution, is widely seen as an exemplary public employer. Rangers are paid twice what the government allocates them, thanks to donor support, and living conditions are good. Rangers’ working hours are long – they often work 24-hour shifts – but they say wages are generally paid on time, while holidays and days off are well regulated, and the park now provides for maternity leave in the rangers’ contracts.
By the end of last year, 14 women had graduated from the gruelling six-month ranger boot camp. Doing the same exercises as men, they learned all the skills needed to protect the park, from close combat to securing zones. The threats they must prepare for include encounters with armed groups and poachers, looting and the illegal invasion of protected land. It can be dangerous work: more than 150 rangers have been killed in the line of duty. But for 25-year-old Alina Masika Kisambya, the attraction of the job outweighed the risk. As a child, she was captivated by the region’s dense forest. “You see it from the outside, and it so beautiful. I wanted to know its secrets,” she says, while accompanying tourists on a gorilla trek. When, two hours into the forest, an exuberant blackback beats his chests and launches a mock charge on the tourists, Kisambya swiftly moves into his path. She bends down and beats the ground, grunting gently. The gorilla relaxes immediately. Alina once faced an aggressive lone buffalo, among the most deadly mammals in Africa, but wasn’t afraid: “This is what I’ve been taught to do.” Women have applied to be rangers in the past, but the 2014 graduates were the first to pass the selection and complete the training, run by former Belgian commandos. Gilbert Dilis, the security officer for Virunga and an ex-commando himself, describes the first four women to pass, including Muhimuzi, as “very motivated”. One, he says, has already proved she has the authority to lead a section on the field. Male ranger Andre Bauma says some unemployed men are not happy about women getting jobs while they remain jobless, but claims the majority are pleased. “It’s an education for the other girls to understand how they can take charge of themselves and become independent. It’s the beginning of equality in our region.” The International Women’s Media Foundation supported Jessica Hatcher’s reporting from the Democratic Republic of the Congo",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/15/gorillas-guns-volcanoes-congo-virunga-park,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/15/gorillas-guns-volcanoes-congo-virunga-park
2015-01-15T07:00:07Z,global-development,Global development,"Kenyans frustrated by drip, drip approach to search for water | Martin Plaut","They come from across east Africa. Some come on foot. Others with their few possessions piled on to rented trucks. Their destination is the camps at Kakuma. Set in the flat, barren plains of north-western Kenya, this is an unlikely location for refugee camps. Yet families from as far afield as Darfur in Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia arrive here. “They come to Kakuma because it is secure – life can get better for them,” says Dominic Gachanja of the Lutheran World Federation, which administers the camps. “They have grown into a small town,” he adds. The camps house 170,000 refugees, most of them fleeing fighting in South Sudan. Kakuma is in Turkana county – one of the poorest and driest parts of Kenya where it is blisteringly hot. Providing water for the growing refugee population has been a struggle, until now. The discovery of vast underground sources of water, announced in September 2013, has transformed the lives of these people. Since then, seven boreholes have been dug. “All have been yielding, or high-yielding,” says Gachanja. Some produce as much as 60 cubic metres of water an hour, and a new well providing 110 cubic metres is about to come into operation. “Before, water was scarce; now there is enough.” The Lutherans were provided with a satellite-based mapping technology developed by a French company, Radar Technologies International (RTI). This uses ground-penetrating radar to locate water in aquifers. Twenty-eight aid workers were trained to use the laptop, GPS system and maps that indicate where the best prospects for drilling are. The transformation has been remarkable. “In 2011, before we had this technology, we drilled 10 boreholes,” Gachanja says. “Six were dry, and the best well provided just 25 cubic metres of water an hour.” Life at Kakuma is hard. Last November the World Food Programme – running short of funds – halved rations for the refugees. Many people could only afford to eat once a day, while others had to beg. However, international donors responded to WFP appeals and the rations have now been restored to their previous levels. But at least there is sufficient water. It has meant families have enough for their own needs, and gardens have sprung up around their homes. Vegetables are grown for sale and refugees can keep chickens to feed their families. The town of Lodwar and the nearby village of Napuu have also benefited, according to a follow-up study conducted by RTI.
One giant aquifer, fed from the mountains in neighbouring Ethiopia, is estimated to be recharged at an annual rate of 3.4 billion cubic metres, nearly three times the water use of New York City. When the find was made, the government, supported by Unesco, announced that a nationwide groundwater mapping programme would be launched, to locate similar aquifers in the country. The most arid counties would be targeted first, to relieve the acute scarcity of water that many people face. Since then the programme has gone strangely quiet. According to Abou Amani of Unesco, planning has been under way behind the scenes. A budget is in place, of 1.5bn Kenyan shillings (£10.9m). “We are looking for funding from the stakeholders,” says Amani. Chrispin Juma, the interim director of water resources in the Kenyan government, confirmed that planning was under way, but said the plans were “restricted” and referred inquiries to the ministry. Getting a clear indication of just why the search for water appears to have been put on hold, when so many Kenyans face scarcity, is difficult to fathom. No one doubts that the giant aquifers in Turkana exist, nor that others could be found if similar surveys are conducted. Professor Norbert Akech Opiyo, of the University of Nairobi, attended a water summit in Turkana late last year. “We are all perplexed by the lack of progress,” he said. “People are still doing further studies, although the finds have been proven.” He thinks the reorganisation of government brought about by the introduction of a new Kenyan constitution in 2010 has left considerable uncertainty. “Nobody is quite sure who does what.” Others have more conspiratorial explanations for the inertia, ranging from government budgets being misspent to the suggestion that key officials have little concern for the plight of poor people in remote, rural communities, far from the capital.
The environmental and wildlife campaigner Dr Paula Kahumbu believes that, in time, the discoveries will transform Kenyans’ perception of their country. “We see ourselves as water-poor, but this is not the case.” She believes that Turkana could be a net food exporter, if the underground aquifers are properly exploited. Wildlife could also benefit. “Now there is competition between wild animals and domestic livestock. If we could generate revenue from our water we could set aside larger areas for wildlife,” she says. Kahumbu accepts that the new constitution has increased uncertainty, and that there is a need for a new community land act, which will define just who owns the water beneath their soil. “But this is such a huge opportunity. It shouldn’t be on the back burner – we should have seen a faster rollout.” • Correction: In a previous version we stated that people in Kakuma had been reduced to one meal a day after rations had been halved in November. In fact rations were restored to their full previous levels in January.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/15/kenya-water-turkana-aquifer-kakuma,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/15/kenya-water-turkana-aquifer-kakuma
2015-01-14T22:00:00Z,global-development,Global development,"Celebrities push to make 2015 year of action on poverty and climate change
","Celebrities and campaigners including Matt Damon, Bill Gates, Jody Williams and Malala Yousafzai are joining forces to launch an international campaign to persuade the planet’s leaders to make 2015 the defining year in the fight against world poverty and climate change. The campaign action/2015 – which launches on Thursday backed by more than 1,000 organisations across 50 countries – is focused on securing successful outcomes for two pivotal UN summits, one in September on remodelled development goals, and the other in December in Paris on a new international agreement on climate change. In Britain, the campaign’s specific aim is to ensure politicians do not put the issues on the backburner during a general election that will inevitably be dominated by domestic issues. In a letter to David Cameron, the celebrities, businessmen and Nobel peace prize winners tell the prime minister that the summits represent “the opportunities of a lifetime, yet with months to go few leaders are playing the leadership roles we need”. They add: “If this does not change, we fear you and your fellow leaders could be sleepwalking the world towards one of the greatest failures of recent times.” Other signatories include Bono, Desmond Tutu, Richard Branson, the entrepreneur Mo Ibrahim, the actor Aamir Khan, the Avaaz network founder Ricken Patel and Queen Rania of Jordan. Cameron, who flew to the US on Wednesday, met some of the campaigners before he left. And in a speech on Thursday, Ed Miliband will endorse the campaign. The Labour leader will say: “I know tackling climate change, global poverty and inequality are not as fashionable as they once were. But I also know they are more important than ever. “For me, they are not luxury items in our programme for change. They are not part of a branding exercise. They go to the heart of my beliefs and the reason why I entered politics.” Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, also acknowledged the campaign’s importance, saying: “Whatever the colour of the next government, I want the UK to seize 2015 as a crucial opportunity to take big global decisions.” The campaign’s vast international scale has meant the aim at the outset is as much raising awareness of the importance of the summits as pushing specific demands. The goals include: • An end to poverty in all its forms, including UK backing for zero-based targets in strategic development goals such as poverty and child mortality. • Meeting fundamental rights and tackling inequality and discrimination, and for this to be a priority for the UN framework agreement. • An accelerated transition to 100% renewable energy, requiring UK commitment to this as the long-term goal for UN climate change negotiators. Speaking for action/2015, Ben Jackson of Bond, the umbrella body for UK non-governmental organisations, said: “If we get this wrong, we could see the number of people living in poverty increase for the first time in our generation. But if we get it right – tackle poverty, inequality and climate change – we could eradicate extreme poverty within a generation. “The UK has the potential to play a critical galvanising role on these issues, but we’re worried, with a UK election in the middle of the year, they might take their eye off the ball.” According to new research, almost a billion extra people face a life of extreme poverty if the two summits fail to agree ambitious goals backed by financing packages. The data, released by the action/2015 coalition, shows that the number of people living in extreme poverty – defined as less than $1.25 (80p) a day – could be reduced dramatically from more than 1 billion to 360 million by 2030. Based on work by the University of Denver, in the year 2030, about 4% of the global population would live in extreme poverty, compared with 17% today, if critical policy choices on inequality, poverty investment and climate change are made this year and implemented thereafter. Under the best case scenario the number of people living in poverty could be reduced to 360 million by 2030. In the worst case scenario the number of people living in poverty could increase to 1.2 billion, a difference of 886 million.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/14/action-2015-poverty-climate-change-united-nations-summits,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/14/action-2015-poverty-climate-change-united-nations-summits
2015-01-14T13:55:25Z,global-development,Global development,What will shape women's rights over the next 15 years? | Carla Kweifio-Okai,"Decisions made in 2015 will help shape the women’s rights agenda for the next 15 years. In September, world leaders will endorse a new set of development goals at the UN. The proposed sustainable development goals (SDGs), which will replace the millennium development goals (MDGs), feature a standalone goal on gender, which encourages the world to “achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls”. Goal number five of the SDGs currently features nine targets, which are: End all forms of discrimination against women and girls everywhere Eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation Eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilations Recognise and value unpaid care and domestic work, and the promotion of shared responsibility within the household and the family as nationally appropriate Ensure women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights Undertake reforms to give women equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property Enhance the use of enabling technologies, in particular ICT, to promote women’s empowerment Adopt and strengthen sound policies and enforceable legislation for the promotion of gender equality A target in goal number three – promoting healthy lives and wellbeing – calls for universal access to sexual and reproductive health services. Discussions about the content of the goals, which will apply to all countries, began in 2013, and a final draft was published in July. The UN starts negotiations next week on finalising the SDGs. Do you think these targets are sufficient? Has anything been missed out or lost in the discussions? What do you think should be a priority in your country? Are LGBT rights being ignored? Will a requirement to ban FGM make the final document? How will countries that have a poor record on women’s rights view the SDGs?

2015-01-14T12:34:48Z,global-development,Global development,Half of Malawi declared disaster zone after flooding,"The Malawi government has declared half the country a disaster zone and appealed for international humanitarian help after torrential rains killed at least 48 people, left 70,000 homeless, and destroyed bridges and roads. Downpours and flooding have also hit neighbouring Mozambique, where 25 schoolchildren were swept away by torrents on Monday, and where 18 other people have been reported missing. The heavy rains of the past few days have damaged crops in Malawi, which last year harvested a bumper 3.9m tonnes of the staple maize crop – a surplus of almost 1m tonnes. The country’s Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services has warned of heavy rainfall and flash floods for the next two to three weeks. Late on Tuesday, Malawi’s president, Peter Mutharika, said: “It is estimated that 69,995 people have been displaced by the floods and 48 people have lost their lives. The floods have also damaged a lot of hectares of crops, washed away livestock, and damaged infrastructure such as roads and bridges.” He said many people remained stranded and would need to be rescued from low-lying areas prone to flooding. Mutharika added: “I declare all the 15 districts that have been affected by floods disaster areas … I appeal for humanitarian assistance, from the international donor community.” The crop outlook in the southern African country – where much of the agriculture is still done by subsistence farmers – has deteriorated after a late start to rains in the summer planting season, which usually gets under way in October or November. “Delayed and overall below-average cumulative rains since the start of the rainy season in October last year have adversely affected the 2015 cereal crops, but prolonged heavy rains may worsen the situation,” said Jeffrey Luhanga, principal secretary in the ministry of agriculture. In Mozambique, which has been hit periodically by catastrophic floods in the past, the newly elected government has declared a “red alert” for the central and northern parts of the country and is sending rescue boats and aid to stricken areas after several bridges collapsed. Roads and rail lines have been destroyed by flooded rivers which, according to officials, have also swept away bystanders, people seeking to flee rising waters in canoes and sleeping families whose homes were suddenly overcome by rushing torrents. The region is likely to face at least two more days of torrential rain carried by late summer storms, according to meteorologists.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/14/malawi-flooding-torrential-rain-mozambique,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/14/malawi-flooding-torrential-rain-mozambique
2015-01-14T12:16:11Z,global-development,Global development,UN Barbershop conference aims to get men talking about women's rights,"The governments of Iceland and Suriname are hosting a high-level conference designed to change the way men and boys think and engage in discussions about gender equality. The two-day Barbershop conference, which begins on Wednesday at the UN in New York, will bring together heads of state, male leaders and activists to share ideas and devise strategies for addressing discrimination and on the role men can play in achieving equality. The conference will also discuss ways to combat violence against women and girls. The event attracted criticism when it was first mooted last year for not inviting women. Many campaigners for women’s rights – women and men – believed an event to discuss women’s rights that was solely aimed at men and attended by men would do little to change the status quo. Gunnar Bragi Sveinsson, Iceland’s minister for foreign affairs, told the Guardian that women would be allowed through the doors – and even on a panel. He said the criticisms were a “misunderstanding of what the conference is about”, but had been helpful in drawing more attention to the event – the first of its kind to be held at UN headquarters. “The aim is to have a room full of men talking about these issues. But that does not shut out any women who want to attend some of the sessions,” he said. “The idea is to … bring together men to talk about these issues that have been mostly talked about by women so far.
“We can’t leave out the men and the boys. They are a big part of the problem. If there is violence, most likely there is a man around. We’re not going to see miracles at the conference, but hopefully it’s a step in the right direction.” In 2013, about 85% of Iceland’s aid spending had gender equality and women’s empowerment as a principal or significant objective. Joni van de Sand, coordinator and advocacy manager of MenEngage, a global alliance of NGOs and UN partners that seeks to engage men and boys in promoting gender equality, said there was value in conferences like Barbershop, but they only went so far. “A lot can be said in favour of creating spaces where a group of people who share similar problems can meet, feel at ease, and safely talk about what affects them. This has long been an argument of women’s rights advocates too, and there continue to be many projects around the world which focus on creating spaces for women. “The same can be said for creating safe spaces where men can talk among themselves about masculinities and power, about their experiences with violence, fatherhood, sexuality and health.” She added: “What is key is that for real change the work with women abnd girls and the work with men and boys have to come together. After all, gender equality is a matter of relations between people, as part of larger systems that perpetuate inequalities. You cannot address those by working in isolation. The barbershop is a public space, in particular a political forum. It is still far from common that women are participating in such spaces, let alone their voices actually being heard. Iceland’s foreign minister wondered ‘where are the men?’, but the fact is that when it comes to diplomacy, in most cases it is still men who do the majority of talking and negotiating.” Nicky McIntyre, executive director at international women’s fund Mama Cash, said she was pleased to see men “stepping up their efforts to address their role in gender equality”. But, she added: “I ask the men at the Barbershop conference to think about what they can do to help resource the hands that do the heavy lifting when it comes to gender equality. Women’s hands, that is.” In 2012, a review of data on violence against women from 70 countries, over 40 years, concluded that feminist movements were the critical factor when it came to improving policy and practice on gender-based violence. However, research by Mama Cash found that feminist movements were severely underfunded. Less than 5% of funding goes to women’s, girls’ and transgender people’s human rights work. The Barbershop event is a response to an invitation to men to join in the gender equality conversation made by the actor Emma Watson, UN Women’s goodwill ambassador, in September. Iceland and Suriname hope it will build on the HeForShe campaign Watson launched, which has so far encouraged 204,978 men to pledge their support to the cause. Organisers said the barbershop theme was adopted because barbers have traditionally been spaces for men to talk.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/14/un-barbershop-conference-men-womens-rights,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/14/un-barbershop-conference-men-womens-rights
2015-01-14T11:11:50Z,global-development,Global development,Tanzania: illegal logging threatens tree species with extinction,"Illegal logging gangs in Tanzania are smuggling hundreds of tonnes of trees every month and driving some species to the brink of local extinction, officials have warned. In a trend similar to the poachers laying waste to African wildlife, armed loggers are slipping into forests at night and transferring their natural wealth to highly organised syndicates, seemingly with impunity. Shamte Mahawa Mangwi, village executive officer in the district of Rufiji, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation: “The loggers seem to be very well-organised and armed. Unfortunately, our local forest guards do not have the capacity to confront them.” Indigenous tree species such as mninga and mpodo are facing local extinction due to high demand for their wood in the construction and furniture industries, according to district records. More than 70% of the total volume of wood harvested in the forest is unaccounted for, causing huge losses of government revenue from levies, taxes and fees. Nurdeen Babu, a Rufiji district commissioner and chairman of the forest harvesting committee, said illegal harvesting threatens the survival of natural forests, but insisted that the government is fighting back. “We have beefed up security by increasing the number of forests guards,” he said. “Anyone who is found to be doing anything illegal in the forest will be arrested and charged.” But local villagers complain that fines imposed on those caught are too low to act as a deterrent. They also accuse some district forest officials of colluding with illegal loggers, helping them to move the wood through unofficial routes while pretending to detain them. Justin Mfinanga, who lives in the village of Ikwiriri, said: “I don’t have any trust with the police force. They sometimes arrest suspected criminals and release them without charge.” Police have denied the allegations. Tanzania has 33m hectares (82m acres) of forests and woodland but has been losing more than 400,000 hectares of forest each year for two decades, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation’s most recent Global Forests Resources Assessment found. The east African country’s controller and auditor general report in 2012 said 96% of trees cut are illegally harvested. Illegal cutting is the result of poor planning and the government’s inability to manage its forestry resources, it added. A 2013 report by Global Witness found that collusion between political elites, civil servants and logging companies is systematically robbing people of their livelihoods in African countries including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, Ghana and Cameroon. Greenpeace Africa has warned that logging is the single biggest threat to the Congo basin rainforest.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/14/tanzania-illegal-logging-tree-species-extinction,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/14/tanzania-illegal-logging-tree-species-extinction

Mary Creagh, the shadow secretary of state for international development, said that while major emergencies such as earthquakes and epidemics would always require a swift humanitarian response, more thought had to be given to long-term development. Although the UK has pledged £230m to the fight against Ebola, she said the Department for International Development (DfID) had missed an opportunity to combat the disease by not investing more in health systems in west Africa. “This government had cut money in Sierra Leone and Liberia prior to the Ebola outbreak: penny wise; pound foolish,” Creagh said. “How much have we put into Sierra Leone now – £230m? Way more than we were doing beforehand as bilateral aid. If we had worked to build a health system, it would have been an early investment, and early money is like yeast: it grows and you get a better return on your investment.” Emergency aid, she said, was the most expensive form of aid – and arguably the least effective in development terms: “It’s about keeping people alive in tents and fed and dealing with their health and education needs.” Ahead of the UK general election on 7 May, Creagh argued that there needed to be a greater effort to help the people in countries such as Central African Republic and South Sudan before their circumstances worsened still further. She also criticised DfID’s “unfortunate” decision to end bilateral aid to Burundi six years after the country emerged from more than a decade of civil war. “We need to focus on fragile states and countries that have been affected by conflict because, increasingly, that is where the poorest people in the world are living,” she said. “That is the hard part of development; that’s the stuff that isn’t easily accounted for. You’re working in very difficult areas with difficult people and, in some cases, traumatised communities. But we’ve seen the amount of spending on those areas reduced under this government.” She said development could not be treated as a microwave dinner: “You don’t just put it in, wait a couple of minutes and then expect it to pop out, ready to eat. It’s a long, slow, complex process and it requires a long-term commitment and means staying in there when the going gets tough.” Creagh also criticised the Tories and the Liberal Democrats over the tortuous parliamentary progress of the coalition promise to enshrine in law a commitment to spend 0.7% of national income on foreign aid. Although the bill to protect the spending survived Tory attempts to kill it in December, it was extraordinary, she said, that a part of the coalition agreement should have had to be introduced as a backbench bill by the former Liberal Democrat cabinet minister Michael Moore. “It shows that Cameron is the prisoner of his party’s right wing and it also shows the weakness of the Liberal Democrats in government,” said Creagh. “I think it’s a scandal that having made that commitment, they failed to meet it. Cameron used aid as a way of detoxifying his party, but when it came down to it, he didn’t put his money where his mouth is.”
Creagh said another development priority was ensuring the private sector behaved responsibly when it came to their social, environmental and tax practices – and that aid money was not used to ensure compliance in large companies. With the formulation of the sustainable development goals – which will replace the millennium development goals next year – reaching its final stages, more attention had to be paid to universal healthcare and human rights, she said. Equally important was the need to stop treating development and climate change as two unrelated issues. “The big risk is the hurricane and the typhoon and the water shortage or the air pollution that destroy the development gains,” she said. “We need to help people move to green growth. But DfID were nowhere in the Lima [climate change] negotiations; there doesn’t appear to have been much ministerial crossover there.” It is not the first time the government has been criticised over its financial approach to Sierra Leone and Liberia. In October last year, Sir Malcolm Bruce, head of the international development select committee, said Britain’s reduced funding to the west African countries could have helped undermine their health systems. “In the midst of this devastating epidemic … it is wrong for the UK to cut its support to these two countries by nearly a fifth,” he said, adding that the planned termination of further UK funding to the Liberian health sector was “especially unwise”. A DfID spokesman defended the department’s record on fighting Ebola in Sierra Leone, saying: “Britain was already the largest bilateral donor to Sierra Leone before the Ebola outbreak and has so far committed an additional £230m to tackle this disease. The outbreak is unprecedented and few health systems in the world would have managed without additional help.” He also said it was incorrect to suggest that DfID had cut its support for fragile countries. “In 2010, DfID refocused aid spending towards fragile and conflict-affected states which now make up 21 of the department’s 28 priority countries. Equally, we continue to ensure that UK aid goes where it is most needed and will see value for money, which is why in 2011 we cut the number of countries receiving direct support.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/14/mary-creagh-labour-attacks-governments-record-on-ebola-and-aid,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/14/mary-creagh-labour-attacks-governments-record-on-ebola-and-aid
2015-01-14T06:00:05Z,global-development,Global development,Campaign aims to raise awareness of Fairtrade gold,"A human ‘ring of gold’ will be formed outside St Paul’s Cathedral on Wednesday to mark the start of a new campaign encouraging couples to tie the knot with Fairtrade wedding bands. The “I Do” campaign backed by top designers including Katharine Hamnett will urge brides and grooms to buy Fairtrade gold to help improve the lives of the people who mine gold, and the environment. The initiative from the Fairtrade Foundation (FF) also aims to increase consumer awareness of Fairtrade gold, which was introduced in the UK in 2011 but is less well-known than mainstream Fairtrade food and drink products. More than half of people in an ICM survey undertaken last February thought that buying Fairtrade products was the responsible thing to do, but only 16% had heard of Fairtrade gold, compared to 64% who knew of Fairtrade tea and coffee. The FF estimates that if 50,000 couples chose Fairtrade-certified gold wedding rings, £650,000 could be generated to help the poorest mining communities in the world transform their lives, health and working conditions and support community projects such as schools. Around the world, some 15 million artisanal and small-scale gold miners produce 10-15% of the world’s supplies, but they work in notoriously dangerous conditions and are poorly paid by middlemen for their gold. Gold mining is one of the world’s most dangerous industries with miners earning as little as $1 per day. Daily contact with toxic chemicals used to process gold such as mercury, cyanide and nitric acid means workers risk disease, serious injury, premature births and even death. Securing Fairtrade certification guarantees a fair price – 95% of the London Bullion Market Association price – for mining groups’ gold, and a premium of $2,000 (£1,300) per kilogram. Since achieving certification in 2010, mining organisations in Peru have invested in healthcare, education and improved equipment.
To meet Fairtrade standards, mining groups are helped to improve their working conditions, with safety measures implemented in the mines, safer handling of the mercury used to extract the gold and children banned from working in the mines. The UK initiative will feature an exhibition showcasing the work of designers working with Fairtrade gold, including Pippa Small, whose jewellery is sold at fashion website Net-a-Porter and at Harrods. Stephen Webster and Beaverbrooks the Jewellers also stock Fairtrade jewellery. Amy Ross, project manager for the Fairtrade Gold and Precious Metals programme at Fairtrade International, said: “By putting the interest of the most disadvantaged miners around the world, and the environment, at the centre of their work, Fairtrade jewellery designers are revolutionising the industry and paving the way for a fairer, and truly beautiful, wedding ring for UK’s couples.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/14/campaign-aims-raise-awareness-fairtrade-gold,https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jan/14/campaign-aims-raise-awareness-fairtrade-gold
2015-01-13T07:00:00Z,global-development,Global development,"Ethiopia dam will turn Lake Turkana into 'endless battlefield', locals warn","People living near Lake Turkana in northern Kenya have little understanding that the fresh water essential to their development is likely to dry up when a huge hydoelectric dam in neighbouring Ethiopia is completed. Fishermen, farmers, teachers and others living near the world’s largest desert lake say Turkana’s volume has reduced significantly over the past 30 years because of higher temperatures and changing weather patterns. But few of the 100 people interviewed by a Kenyan researcher for International Rivers watchdog said they had been consulted or warned what could happen when the reservoir of the Gibe III dam, one of Africa’s largest hydropower projects, is completely filled in about three years’ time. The $1.8bn construction project, which is 90% complete, will start limited power generation in June. The downstream impact of the dam is hotly contested. Some hydrologists have predicted that Ethiopia’s expansion of water-intensive sugar and cotton plantations on the Omo river, which the Gibe 111 dam allows, could reduce flow to Lake Turkana by up to 70%. This would kill ecosystems and greatly reduce the water level of the lake. This, says International Rivers, could make the difference between marginal livelihoods and famine for the tens of thousands of already vulnerable people who depend on the lake for their livelihoods. When told of the possible impact of the project, ethnic groups and communities near the lake predicted widespread conflict, hunger and cultural devastation. “If the Gibe III dam is constructed, the lake will dry up and this will lead to desertification and there will be depletion of resources: there will be no fish, no farming, and low humidity [and less rain]. If that is the case, the community will be finished,” said Sylvester Ekariman, chairman of the council of elders in Kakalel pastoral village.
Currently, the lake, which could split into two if incoming water is restricted, helps to prevent conflict between communities in Ethiopia and Kenya, and locally between the Turkanas and the Rendille ethnic groups, who live on opposite sides of the lake. If the lake shrinks, conflict is much more likely, says the report. “This place will turn into an endless, uncontrollable battlefield,” said Joseph Atach, an assistant chief at Kanamkuny village. Helen Alogita, a seed seller, told researcher Narissa Allibhai that she feared the people living on the other side of the lake. “They will come and kill us and that will bring about enmity among us as we turn on each other due to hunger. Find the person [building the dam] and ask them where they expect our communities to go? Where are our Kenyan leaders? If famine and hunger will make us die of starvation, where will they get votes from?” Fisherman Dennis Epem said: “When the lake goes back, our enemies, which are the people of Ethiopia, will be reaching here. They have weapons, but we don’t have weapons. How will we defend ourselves when the people of Ethiopia cross? This lake is our security.” Many of the people interviewed in the 14 communities said they were angry that an Ethiopian dam should affect Kenyans. “Not a single country [should] harm the other one by taking its waters without discussing with the other countries, because water is life. It should not be decided by one country. Who is funding these Gibes? They should withdraw their assistance or the loans they are giving,” the researcher was told.
“Awareness of the dam’s impacts and development process is extremely low,” said Allibhai. “A majority of interviewees were extremely uninformed. Any consultations with local communities were either minimal or non-existent. People in the villages had either heard about the dam only through local NGO Friends of Lake Turkana’s awareness-raising or through rumours; misinformation was rampant. “Those in the towns were slightly more informed, especially the few with access to the internet – but even so, not one interviewee was sure of the details of the upstream developments, agreements and progress,” she said. “All community members are opposed to the dam and irrigated plantations, as it will deprive them of their livelihoods and lead to increased famine, conflict and death. Their messages to the Kenyan and Ethiopian governments and the international community reflect their despair, and feelings of helplessness, anger and betrayal.” Many older people said the developments in Ethiopia could tip the region into a crisis because climate change had made them more vulnerable. The lake was already much smaller than it was 30 years ago and villages like Impressa Beach, Lokitoenyala and Nachukui used to be under water, said locals. Rains are unpredictable and temperatures and wind have increased. “These water grabs will disrupt fisheries and destroy other ecosystems upon which local people depend,” said Lori Pottinger, International Rivers’ Africa campaigner. “Local people have not been consulted about the project nor informed about its impacts on their lives.” Both the Kenyan and Ethiopian governments have strongly backed the dam, which they maintain will increase development by providing more electricity. The World Bank, which has been strongly criticised for funding developments that force evictions, is supporting the transmission line from the dam to Kenyan cities. The Ethiopian government this week strongly rejected claims that the dam would harm Lake Turkana. A spokeswoman said: “The dam will provide a regular flow of water to Lake Turkana, which gives the possibility of providing a water supply throughout the year, whereas the lake is currently short of water in the dry season. The regular flow of water will also improve the aquatic life of Lake Turkana, providing a better livelihood for people living round the lake. “The project … is instrumental in forging regional integration – the Gibe III dam will have a role in the realisation of close economic cooperation between Ethiopia, Kenya and the countries beyond. Kenya [will] obtain more than 300MW of electricity from Ethiopia. “Campaigners are consciously trying to distort all these positive developments … in order to incite misunderstanding between the fraternal countries of Ethiopia and Kenya.” she said. The Kenyan government was invited to respond to the report but has so far declined. Suggestions for action by the communities ranged from using force to stop the dam, persuading the the Kenyan government to stand up for the people of Turkana and Marsabit, pressing for donors to withdraw funding and requesting compensation.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/13/ethiopia-gibe-iii-dam-kenya,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/13/ethiopia-gibe-iii-dam-kenya
2015-01-13T05:00:09Z,global-development,Global development,Condoms and contraceptive pills reach rural Laos,"Bounthone Kongphongma knows family planning arrived too late for his generation in rural Laos. The former military medic and his wife had 14 children, the youngest of whom they raised during the country’s secret war, often escaping to the jungle on the outskirts of their village to avoid airstrikes. Only eight of his children survived to adulthood, and those who died were not victims of war, but of what Kongphongma thinks was malaria. “It was hard for us to raise a large family and we were poor,” he says. “This [family planning] project came too late for us, but not for our children.”
Kongphongma has advised his four daughters to space their pregnancies, as he has all the young people he counsels in Lao Luang, in the Vilabouly district of southern Laos. He is a voluntary community-based distribution (CBD) worker, trained by the Laotian government and the UN population fund (UNFPA) to spread the word about family planning and distribute free contraceptives in his community. Kongphongma considers this his national duty. “Contraception, or we can say family planning, can help reduce poverty in our country,” he says.
While CBD workers like Kongphongma are proving critical in reaching remote and mountainous areas once cut off from family planning services, there is an important element missing – women. According to a Laos government spokesperson, of the 74 CBD workers in four provinces of the country, only one is a woman. Dr Kobkeo Souphanthong, deputy director of the government’s maternal and child health clinic in the capital Vientiane, says it is hard to recruit women. “In these remote areas, the villages are hard to reach. It takes six or seven hours for them just to reach a village, and they spend many days away from their family,” Souphanthong says. “Also, in some of the rural areas women are still dominated by men, and the women are told they should stay at home.” Despite the government’s admission that too few women have been engaged as CBD workers, it has no strategy for their recruitment. UNFPA Laos deputy representative Rizvina de Alwis says more must be done to actively recruit women as family planning workers. “I think it’s very important, particularly since we are talking about something that is very sensitive and very personal for some women to talk about, and they don’t necessarily want to discuss it with men,” de Alwis says. “We do, however, have many women working as midwives. And one of the difficulties we face in recruiting women as CBD workers has to do with the attitudes that still exist, where women might not see a role outside their homes, so it adds to the barriers that they have in becoming a volunteer.” With support from UNFPA, the country has trained 1,500 midwives since 2008, most of them women, but the majority work in health centres in provincial capitals. This means women can speak to female health workers when they are pregnant, but may not get the same opportunity when they are planning to avoid or delay pregnancy. De Alwis says despite the lack of women working as CBD workers, the programme has helped to increase contraceptive rates and demand for the services is increasing. “It’s not a perfect programme but it is definitely filling a gap, because CBD workers are the only ones reaching these remote villages where no one can access the health centres because they’re too far away, and these are villages where women have to walk for days to get to a health centre.”
One woman, who lives in the same village as Kongphongma but did not want to be named, says having a CBD worker in the community meant she was able to choose when to have children. “The worker comes to me and my husband and we talk about this together,” she says. The woman, 27, says she is unable to travel to a health centre to collect contraceptives because she is busy looking after her three children and two nieces. “This is the only way I can collect the pill, because the centre is more than two hours away. Maybe I would like to go so I can speak to a woman, but I am happy we get to have these contraceptives so speaking to a man is good too.”
In Laos, where about 70% of the population live in rural and remote areas, CBD workers are a critical element of the country’s plan to provide contraceptives to all who need them. Currently, 48% of married women do not use a method of family planning, and at least 20% of women would like to delay or avoid pregnancy but do not have access to contraceptives. Health workers agree that the next step is to see more women not only receiving family planning advice, but giving it too. “It is a service that we have to provide, and we have male CBDs providing this service, but I do believe we need to recruit more women – that will make this programme even more effective,” de Alwis says.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/13/condoms-contraceptive-pills-laos-birth-control-family-planning,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/13/condoms-contraceptive-pills-laos-birth-control-family-planning
2015-01-12T16:50:24Z,global-development,Global development,China denies building empire in Africa,"China has adamantly denied the oft-repeated charge that it is building an empire in Africa just as the European powers did in the late 19th century. Beijing is Africa’s biggest trade partner and has frequently been accused of an ethically deaf “resource colonialism” – extracting the continent’s mineral wealth at knockdown prices to propel its economic growth. But foreign minister Wang Yi, on a five-nation tour of Africa, insisted: “Politically, we always speak up for African countries and uphold justice. Economically, we help African countries to enhance development to achieve prosperity. “In China’s exchanges and cooperation with Africa, we want to see mutual benefit and win-win results. I want to make clear one point, that is, China will never follow the track of western colonists and all cooperation with Africa will never come at the expense of the ecology, environment or long-term interests of Africa.” The comments were made to Chinese Central Television while Wang was in Kenya, where he met President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday. Chinese firms are carrying out a $653m (£430m) expansion of the main airport in the capital, Nairobi. China’s rivalry with the west on the African stage has been much debated, but it is rare for one side to draw comparison so publicly. Last year, at the biggest gathering of African leaders ever held in Washington, US president Barack Obama said pointedly, “We don’t look to Africa simply for its natural resources,” but declined to mention China by name. Only in a diplomatic cable, published via WikiLeaks in 2010 and not intended for public consumption, did a US official admit: “China is a very aggressive and pernicious economic competitor with no morals. China is not in Africa for altruistic reasons. China is in Africa for China primarily.” Previously, Beijing has said its cooperation with African nations ranges across agriculture, health and infrastructure-related projects from schools to stadiums. The $200m headquarters of the Africa Union in Addis Ababa was a present and a “symbol of deepening relations”. China maintains that more than half its foreign aid – more than $14bn between 2010 and 2012 – goes to Africa. It says the support comes with no strings attached and that it will never interfere in countries’ domestic affairs. But by default, critics argue, this means it effectively shores up the rule of Angola’s José Eduardo dos Santos, Sudan’s Omar al-Bashir and Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, three of Africa’s most tenaciously authoritarian rulers. Last month, however, Beijing announced that it will send 700 combat troops to join the UN peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, signalling an unusually robust intervention. Speaking to reporters in Sudan on Sunday, Wang defended China’s mediation efforts in South Sudan, rejecting the claim that it was acting out of self-interest after investing heavily in oil. “China’s mediation of South Sudan issues is completely the responsibility and duty of a responsible power, and not because of China’s own interests,” the minister said. Wang’s itinerary spans Kenya, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/12/china-denies-building-empire-africa-colonialism,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/12/china-denies-building-empire-africa-colonialism
2015-01-12T14:58:08Z,global-development,Global development,Ebola takes mental health toll where 'life has frozen' in Sierra Leone,"Ebola is causing mental health problems in Sierra Leone, with the country’s overstretched health system unable to deal with the psychosocial legacy of the outbreak, according to a report by the International Medical Corps (pdf). Fear, panic, stress, shame and isolation are increasingly common feelings, says IMC, an NGO that conducted interviews, focus groups and surveys in the town of Lunsar – the capital of Port Loko and one of the worst-hit districts in the country. The area was neglected in the earlier stages of the outbreak before IMC opened a hospital in December. The NGO warns that psychosocial and mental health need to be considered part of the Ebola response in treatment facilities and community outreach, as well as in the longer term to make mental health an integral part of the country’s health system when it can rebuild. The closure of hospitals, schools and businesses and the imposition of travel restrictions have caused psychosocial problems for communities, it said. With fewer opportunities in education and employment for young people, teenage pregnancies and consumption of alcohol are rising. “Many of the issues that people reported are normal reactions to distressing events and many people will be able to recover with time,” said Georgina Grundy Campbell, IMC’s psychological coordinator and lead author of the report. “However, with reduced access to support systems and normal coping strategies in the communities, there is an increased risk that some people will develop mental health problems.” She added that the health system in Sierra Leone “is not equipped to deal with large numbers of people seeking mental health support”. Some interviewees said life had frozen or gone backward. Survivors at holding centres and in ambulances reported not being fed and being given only one drink a day; hydration is one of the main treatments for the disease. They said staff were afraid to touch them and left medication in the corner of the room. One man nearly overdosed on paracetamol because he did not know how many tablets to take. “Many survivors described being ‘sealed’ into the back of ambulances and driven around for hours picking up different people,” sometimes with dead bodies, said the report. Many said that on being discharged they were promised survival packages that never arrived. “They feel abandoned,” said IMC. The loss of family members is causing pain and a challenging change of roles. One man said he was having to learn how to be a mother after his wife had died and “he does not know how to do that”. Children and young adults left without parents are struggling to cope with becoming head of the household. “They admit they do not know what to do,” the report said. Survivors, already stigmatised and isolated, are now more afraid of dying from malaria, typhoid or cholera, diseases that can share symptoms with Ebola but for which there is less care available as resources are diverted to tackling the outbreak. The stigma has also depleted survivors’ economic power. Those who earned money by cooking before the illness cannot return to their livelihoods as customers call their cooking “Ebola food”. People have reported an increase in theft to make ends meet because petty trading is restricted. According to interviews conducted by IMC, young women and men report an increase in teenage pregnancies because “there is nothing for young people to do” as schools are closed. For the same reason, young people say they are starting to drink alcohol. The closure of schools and universities is a major challenge for the country. The president said in his New Year’s Day address that he hoped schools would reopen soon but they are unlikely to do so imminently in Port Loko, where the virus is not under control. Daily life has been marred by the crisis, with women saying there is not enough money for food to feed their families and men saying that because “there is no work and no economy, you cannot go to work or distract yourself”. The report says people affected by Ebola need additional support now and in the longer term to rebuild their livelihoods and adapt to new roles, regenerate social ties and use survivor networks. Health systems will need rebuilding and strengthening in the longer term, including training doctors and nurses in treating mental illness such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Kevin Noone, executive director of IMC in the UK, said the long-term effects of the Ebola crisis in west Africa are only just becoming apparent. “The mental health consequences need to be addressed now to prevent another crisis months down the line.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/12/ebola-mental-health-sierra-leone-depression,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/12/ebola-mental-health-sierra-leone-depression
2015-01-12T00:21:45Z,global-development,Global development,"Aid, cholera and protest: life in Haiti five years after the earthquake | Sam Jones","The diggers and rollers laying the road at the foot of Village Solidarité groan and roar as they stir up clouds of dust that powder the air and leave the trees a spectral grey. In her hilltop home, high above the noise and grime, Miliana Delvard sets a cup of tea on her lap as she recalls the events that took place five years ago in Haiti’s capital, 50 miles away. She and her four children were in the home they rented in east Port-au-Prince when the 7.0 magnitude earthquake that struck on 12 January 2010 rattled the city to pieces. “The house started to shake, and I didn’t know what was happening,” she says. “I saw other people running out, so we ran out too. All we could see was dust and smoke and people screaming. It still rings in my ears.” Delvard, 56, has been back to Port-au-Prince once since the quake, the trauma of which left her with migraines and high blood pressure; she will not set foot in the capital again. “I’m too scared. If I need to buy things, I go to the border with the Dominican Republic instead.” Loud noises still frighten her 16-year-old son, and the idea of her children returning to live or work in the city quickly brings tears, which she wipes away with her blouse.
She and her family are now well settled in Village Solidarité, a housing project built by Christian Aid and the Haitian NGO Garr (Le Groupe d’Appui aux Rapatriés et Réfugiés) for some of those displaced by the quake. A chest freezer in Delvard’s living room holds bags of ice and lollies, sales of which bring her $10 (£6.61) a week. The sloping garden behind the house is planted with papaya, bananas and aubergines. Further down the hill, in the two-bedroom house she shares with her husband and four children, Gabriella Pierre likewise remembers the dust and the screams. Her younger sister – the family’s breadwinner – died in the earthquake, as did her aunt, who had come to visit from France. Like Delvard, Pierre has no intention of returning to Port-au-Prince. “I lost too many people and saw too many others lose limbs and eyes,” says the 35-year-old teacher. “I can’t cope with the thought of it: there were lots of robberies and rapes in Port-au-Prince before the earthquake, and it got even worse afterwards.”
Things are far better in Village Solidarité. “This is my kingdom,” says Pierre, only half-jokingly. “I feel safe here. We don’t have everything but it’s a nice place.” Similar contentment is scarce in Port-au-Prince, where violent anti-government protests last month led to the resignation of the prime minister, and where the effects of the quake – which is estimated to have killed between 90,000 and 316,000 people and displaced more than 1.5 million – are still inescapable. Piles of rubble and cracked buildings fringe the Champs de Mars, where the national palace once stood, and the four-wheel drives favoured by the UN and NGOs are almost as ubiquitous as the garish, home-welded “tap-tap” buses that crawl past the shoeshiners and women selling toothpaste, cigarettes and bottles of rum on the steep streets. There are also unmistakable signs of recovery. New ministries, their concrete shells caged in wooden scaffolding, are rising in the city centre where their quake-razed predecessors once stood. A new Marriott hotel nears completion, and souvenir sellers hover by their stalls hoping to glimpse a tourist. But while reconstruction is slowly progressing, the country faces a growing political crisis. Towards the end of last year, hundreds of Haitians took to the streets to protest against President Michel Martelly’s administration and his delay in holding legislative and municipal elections that were due in 2011. The demonstrations turned violent, with UN peacekeepers firing on the crowd, and the prevailing mood remains one of discontent. On Saturday, about 1,500 anti-Martelly protesters burned tyres and threw missiles at riot police in downtown Port-au-Prince. The authorities responded with tear gas and water cannon. In December, against this backdrop of violent unrest, the Haitian prime minister Laurent Lamothe bowed to calls for him to step down. Lamothe, who took office in May 2012, said he was resigning “with a sense of accomplishment” after seeing the country experience “a deep and dynamic transformation and a real change in benefit of its people”.
Not everyone agrees with that analysis. Graffiti on the wall of a downtown school sets out the protesters’ simple manifesto – “Lamothe’s gone, Martelly’s next” – while Pierre Esperance, executive director of the National Human Rights Defence Network (RNDDH), says it is impossible to predict what will happen now. The fifth anniversary of the earthquake also coincides with the end of the terms of members of Haiti’s senate and chamber of deputies. If a deal to extend the terms is not thrashed out soon, Martelly will rule by presidential decree. “The situation in Haiti now is out of control,” says Esperance. “When you look at what the president has done since he was elected, there’s arrogance, corruption, impunity and no respect for Haitians and the key state institutions. If the president can’t fix the situation, people get angry – and that’s why they’re on the streets.” Still, he says, not all the blame can be laid at Martelly’s door. If many foreign agencies and NGOs had been less arrogant and had consented to work with Haitians, Esperance believes money would have been spent more wisely and the country would be in better shape. “When foreigners come to third world countries, they think they know everything; they think they’re experts,” he says. “Yes, you can be a humanitarian aid expert, but you can’t be a humanitarian aid expert in every country. Each country has its own reality and you need to work with local actors to learn about that.” Lamothe, meanwhile, argues that Martelly has faced a near impossible task in trying to rebuild the country after the “Armageddon” of an earthquake that “literally set us back 50 years”. Not only was there no money to invest in reconstruction when Martelly assumed office in May 2011, says Lamothe, but the president also quickly found he had no support in parliament and among the traditional political class despite “a vast social mandate”. Given all that, he believes the government has done remarkably well. “Most of the 1.5 million people who were displaced by the earthquake and who found themselves living in makeshift tents now live in acceptable housing that has restored their human dignity,” he says. “Haiti’s reconstruction programme has been fully under way. Throughout Haiti, massive infrastructure programmes are visible including roads, bridges and social housing.” The former prime minister points to the fact that school enrolment rose from 55% to 95% during his period in office, and to the construction of the industrial parks that now employ thousands of Haitians as further proof of his legacy. Perhaps most boldly of all, Lamothe says that police reforms have increased public confidence in the institution and made Haiti “among the safest countries in the Americas”. The homeless families evicted by police from their shacks in the shanty towns that have sprung up on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince would doubtless take issue with the last claim, but it would be a mistake to assume all the anger that Haitians feel is directed at the ruling class. Many blame the UN for the cholera epidemic that has killed nearly 9,000 people since October 2010, and which infected more than 21,000 people last year. A report published four years ago said the evidence “strongly suggests” that UN peacekeepers from Nepal brought a strain of the disease from their home country, and it subsequently spread through the waterways of the Artibonite region and elsewhere in Haiti. Lawyers seeking compensation for Haitian victims of the epidemic have filed three lawsuits against the UN in US courts, but the organisation has refused to accept responsibility. It is little wonder, says Esperance, that the UN mission has a bad reputation in the country. “It costs $33m a month but it has done nothing,” he argues. “UN soldiers have been involved in rapes and human rights violations and they brought cholera to Haiti, so the UN is not popular … They say they’re here to improve things and work on the rule of law, but there’s been no impact.” Pedro Medrano, an assistant UN secretary general and the man responsible for coordinating the organisation’s cholera response, admits that such issues pose a challenge to its operations in Haiti. Asked whether he agrees with Lamothe’s statement that the UN took “moral responsibility” for the outbreak, Medrano’s reply is characteristically diplomatic: “[There’s a] moral responsibility in the sense that there’s a major humanitarian challenge and we are bound by our mandate to deal with this … The secretary general has said that, as an international organisation facing humanitarian challenges like those in Haiti, we have a moral obligation to be part of the response. But not in the legal sense.” The assistant secretary general, who is a defendant in one of the cases, is keen to remind the world that the poorest country in Latin America is still in the throes of a massive health crisis. “In Haiti, we have perhaps the highest number of cases of cholera in the whole western hemisphere,” he says. “[And yet] for many donors, it’s not an emergency – and that’s something that’s reflected in the funding. When you have the view that it’s not an emergency, the international community focuses on other emergencies around the world. But any country with this many cases would consider this an emergency.” The latest UN statistics show that a lack of funding is leading partners to withdraw and resulted in the closure of 91 of the 250 cholera treatment facilities in Haiti in 2014. According to Medrano, the situation has been exacerbated by Haiti’s turbulent past: decades of neglect and a lack of investment in water and sanitation are manifested in the country’s malnutrition and child mortality rates, which are the highest in the region. If Haiti is ever to catch up with its neighbours’ development levels, says Medrano, it desperately needs both stable national institutions and $2.2bn from the international community to eliminate cholera and fund a “Marshall Plan for water and sanitation”. As of last month, donors had pledged $407,046,770; 18.3% of the total. While familiar theories about US involvement in the political unrest do the rounds in Port-au-Prince, from the markets to the smart bars and restaurants of Pétionville, one man takes an even longer view of Haiti’s troubles. Pasteur Clément Joseph, secretary general of the Mission Sociale des Eglises Haïtiennes, a network of evangelical churches, believes that 60% of the population lives in terrible poverty because of a 200-year-old structure of social and economic and social injustice. For him, the world’s first black republic remains a country of slavery and socioeconomic apartheid to this day. “When black Haitians have enough money, they behave like the colonials and want to keep the rest of the country in chains,” he says. “There’s a lack of basic moral leadership, and there always has been. People here can buy a $100,000 car in a country where there are no roads. They buy a $100,000 car to drive over piles of rubbish and mosquito-infested puddles. That is immoral.”
Joseph returned to Port-au-Prince from his hometown two days after the quake to find a dog chewing the corpse of a friend, and respect for law and life ebbing away. Yet he still feels hopeful about the future. “We are a peaceful and hardworking people and we are generous,” he says. “Who supported Haiti most after the earthquake? Poor rural Haitians.” The cautious optimism is shared by Prospéry Raymond, Christian Aid’s country manager for Haiti and the Dominican Republic. With 10-15 years of sustained investment in housing, healthcare, water and sanitation, education and food production, he says, Haiti could get back on track to development. Raymond, who spent two hours buried in the rubble of his office after the earthquake before local teenagers dug him free, finds inspiration in Haiti’s history. “The world isn’t quite sure where Haiti fits in, but back in the 19th century we were a black republic in the middle of the western hemisphere,” he says. “We got our freedom; we didn’t buy it. In 200 years we’ve managed to create a language – Creole – and a religion: voodoo. And we’ve managed to be tolerant and to help other countries win their freedom – look at South America and Simon Bolívar.” In the Village Solidarité community centre, with its five internet-connected computers and posters for the local youth club – “We are the future of this country” – 10 villagers are contemplating their own futures. Ask how many of them would return to Port-au-Prince, and no one says anything. Ask who wants to stay, and 10 hands shoot into the air and laughter erupts. But it soon subsides into seriousness. “There’s no one dying in the streets here,” says one villager. “Why would we want to go back?”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/12/haiti-earthquake-five-years-on-village-solidarite,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/12/haiti-earthquake-five-years-on-village-solidarite
2015-01-09T14:05:38Z,global-development,Global development,Obama urged to press for ban on arms sales to South Sudan combatants,"Barack Obama has been urged to call for an international ban on arms sales to all factions involved in South Sudan’s civil war, with the country braced for renewed hostilities as the rainy season ends. The combatants in the conflict, which started in December 2013 after a power struggle in the ruling party, between president Salva Kiir and vice-president Riek Machar, turned violent, have shown a “complete disregard for international human rights and humanitarian law”, said a group of nearly 30 organisations in an open letter to the US president. The letter’s signatories, which include 14 South Sudanese human rights groups, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch (HRW), Global Witness and Humanity United, are pressing Obama to table a UN resolution , arguing that the prospect of renewed warfare in a struggle that has cost at least 50,000 lives and displaced 1.9 million people makes an arms embargo an urgent necessity. In June, reports emerged that the South Sudan government had purchased $38m (£25.1m) of military hardware from the Chinese firm Norinco. Beijing, which imports about a third of South Sudan’s oil, said in September that it had stopped these arms shipments.
The organisations wrote in their letter: “The US should immediately table a draft [UN] resolution imposing a comprehensive arms embargo on South Sudan and do all it can to ensure its passage. This is the only way to deny the parties further opportunities to arm themselves and continue to commit serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law while they pursue their political ends.” An arms ban would “help to halt the supply of weapons to individuals and groups who have committed serious violations of human rights, war crimes and crimes against humanity, and protect civilians at grave risk”, the letter said. The US has suspended military assistance to the country and repeatedly called for peace. Despite this, Washington has not submitted a resolution to the UN security council calling for an arms embargo. The US state department was not immediately available for comment. Skye Wheeler, South Sudan researcher at HRW, said: “The US has this role to begin the process and make it happen … it’s disappointing that we haven’t seen them already take the lead and present a draft resolution calling for an arms embargo.” Geoffrey Duke, head of the South Sudan Action Network on Small Arms, said Obama must exert his influence at the UN to protect the lives of civilians in South Sudan. “More weapons will mean more fuel to the fire, more attacks on civilians, arbitrary killings, rape, burnings and pillage. President Obama should do everything he can to ensure that this year is not a repeat of the horrific past year for the South Sudanese.” Both sides are now amassing troops at new military hotspots, according to Edmund Yakani, the executive director of Community Empowerment for Progress Organisation, who warned that fresh fighting is imminent. “We feel that both parties are still likely to settle their differences militarily,” he said. Kiir and Machar are due to hold talks in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa on 18 January. Previous discussions have dragged on while yielding little, but Yakani said imposing an arms embargo on both leaders before they meet would promote meaningful talks. The African Union said in December that it would release a report this month detailing human rights abuses committed during the conflict. It will be the first credible estimate of the human cost of the conflict, according to HRW. The letter added: “[An arms embargo] is the only way to deny the parties further opportunities to arm themselves and continue to commit serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law while they pursue their political ends.” • This article was amended on 12 January 2015.

2015-01-09T07:00:11Z,global-development,Global development,Ebola workers in Sierra Leone: 'I'm here to help the sick',"Sierra Leone is one of the west African countries worst affected by the most serious outbreak of Ebola ever known. The UN children’s agency, Unicef, is helping the governments of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea to build, staff and equip community care centres, allowing patients with Ebola symptoms to be treated near their homes. Treating people without them travelling too far will help limit the spread of the disease. Patients receive care from trained community health workers at the centres. Unicef spoke to some of the staff at Panlap community care centre in Bombali District, Sierra Leone.
Zainab D S Bangura, cook I sell small items to earn enough to raise my children and send them to school. I’m here at the centre to help to cook, because if people take medication without food they will not get well. Looking at the situation now, it looks like Ebola wants to kill everyone in our country. My husband’s eldest sister and their eldest sons caught Ebola. She was a nurse at Connaught hospital in Freetown. They took her to Kailahun, but she didn’t make it, she died. People are afraid of coming closer to Ebola victims and survivors. I decided to come and lay down my life to cook for the people, to give them good food so that – after medication – the good food will keep them going. I follow the instruction of the nurses concerning the diet of the patients. If they need soup, if they need any other thing – whatever they need, or ask of me – I make it for them.
Susan B Koroma, cook I’m the chairlady of the Women’s Association of Panlap community, and I work with World Hope as mothers’ group leader. I discovered that if people are sick and there’s no food for them, they will continue to weaken, so that is why I am here: to help the sick, to cook for them and to give them strength when they eat. I cook three times a day, both for the workers and the patients. If somebody is sick, they need medicine. If they continue to take medicine without food, they will not get well. When I come with the food, I don’t interact with the sick people, I just come and serve the food and go back, so I have no business with the sick people. My children advise me to be careful and take caution in whatever I do. My children regularly give me advice, I believe that God’s time is the best. If God says it’s time to go, I’ll go. I’m ready to lay down my life for the people of my community.
Samuel J Bangura, sprayer When someone is coming in who is infected, I am the one who is going to cool down the disease. That disease will not have the power to transmit to anyone else who is not yet affected. I’m going to dress first and take my machine, from there I walk behind him or her. After every step they take, I spray there – until the end of the ward. I was a bike rider before. They elected me to be the chairman of the Panlap bike riders’ association. Some of my colleagues and friends got infected with the disease. We used to play and do everything together ; some of them have died. So that’s why I decided to come and help, for this disease not to be existing. I give thanks to God [that], since this disease was in Sierra Leone, not one of [my family has been] infected. [My wife] is worried about me. Because I’m working at the community care centre, she’s thinking that I’m going to be infected. We went south for training at the primary health care [centre] for a good two days to know how to use these machines [sprayer bottles] and to know our purpose of being here.
Joshua A Bangura, cleaner I am a student, and I’m self-employed. I came here to fight [Ebola]. We are the Bangura family, who provided the land for this community care centre so that our people will live safely. I am a science student and would like to be a doctor. The reason I would like to be a doctor is because I have experience with the sick, this disease that has come to take over, to kill us. I thank God I am still alive and for my family that are still alive. Not all of them are infected, only my uncle. My main purpose for being here as a cleaner is to care for patients and, at the same time, to care for our community, to care for our county, and our neighbours. To fight this disease is my concern.
David Sesay, cleaner I’m a student, but this disease is now disturbing us students, that’s why I’m here to help people at the centre, cleaning the wards for the patients. I’m here now to help them, even though it’s not much. I help them also to clean their beds. One of my brothers was infected by Ebola, he has already died. They took him from the village and to Kailahun. We never see him again. I’m now very glad these community care centres are here in Panlap.
John Bangura, security I went to school until this Ebola virus came to Sierra Leone. Many of my friends have passed away through Ebola, so I give my life to work at thiscommunity centre, to prevent people being infected and help stop this Ebola virus. Maybe after Ebola you go to school, maybe not. The friend that I lost is my best friend. We studied at the same faculty – arts – from primary level till secondary. When he passed away, I felt the pain. My job is not as someone’s boss, it is security, so that’s where I can help the community. Through holding this thermometer to look at the temperature of the people coming in and out. We have visitors come in every day, and if we have people who are sick, infected, I have to tell them. The patients, they are familiar faces, so they don’t disturb us, they take the treatment. We live around the community; we don’t have any fear, so they come.
Beatrice Kargbo, maternal child health aide Before Ebola my son used to go to school at 7am. I used to hire an okada [a motorbike] to come and collect him and go to school, and then I went to work just in front of the [nurses] quarter. After 1pm the bike went back to pick him up [and] bring him back; we lived together, played together. But now he’s just inside, no going out, just inside. Not going around to play with his colleagues [friends], just inside. He wants to go out, he wants to ride the bicycle, to go to the streets. He used to go out in the evening with his colleagues on his bicycle, riding around, but now – no chance. Hecomplains, but no way. Ebola is just around us. Just the next house. They went yesterday, took one woman, suspected Ebola. So that’s why we don’t leave him to go and walk around. At the PHC [Public Health Centre] we were not protected. I’m responsible for [baby] deliveries. They just gave us these short gloves. You have to do deliveries on women, you know you must touch, no matter what. So I thought, ‘Let me go somewhere that I will be protected, and to take care of people.’ That’s why I decided to leave the PHC for now and come over here. Just to console them, to give them hope everything is not lost {and that] there is life after Ebola. So it’s more encouragement for them.
Alfred Thompson, site manager My job, my responsibility as the site manager here, is to oversee the running of the centre’s day-to-day activities and see everything is going smoothly. I report to the authority wherever we have any constraints or sources of failure. I come from Freetown, but we’ve been at Makini for three years. I am a clergyman, but I was attracted to this job because I saw the way people died, especially as I lost my best friend and my wife also lost her best friend through this epidemic. So it moved me to come out and help the people. My wife is doing the same work because she’s a senior sister; she works at the DHMT [district health management team]. They are the supervisors that are going around. But as a husband I see her effort, I want to join hands because I see this thing is going bad, people are dying. I feel it’s my responsibility to go in and help, to contribute in my little way to the community. Before when people were sick, we went to burials, we did everything in common. Since Ebola came, all that has been eradicated. But people are still doing it in some stubborn areas, that is why the Ebola is still there. People are buried at night, [and people] continue to go to burial homes; they go to sick people, and touch sick people, which the government has announced we should not do right now. People are saying there is no Ebola. We want to tell people that it exists. Ebola is killing people: people are dying on a daily basis. If you go to a holding centre or a treatment centre, you’ll see a lot of patients lying in anguish, looking for treatment.
Michael S Bangura, cleaner and sprayer Since this Ebola epidemic started, my two brothers have died. So I decided to volunteer so that I can help with fighting the epidemic. Because I’m already trained by Unicef, I take the precautions. I wash my hands, I wash all over my body before going home. I take soap and water to wash clean before I step home. So I take those precautions.
Memunata Kallon, nursing aide I think it is necessary that we join hands together and fight Ebola for our country, because people are dying. The owner of the house [I live in] has already given notice for me to leave because I am working [with] Ebola. So that is the stress I’m having right now, no shelter for me. He thought that, since I am working [with] Ebola, I am going to take the Ebola and carry it to the houses [laughs]. This is the problem I’m having. I explained I’m not working at the Ebola centre to take the Ebola back to my home, it’s just that we have to help our people. Because if we just sit down, don’t do anything, more will die. My husband has already abandoned me with a six-month baby because I do this Ebola work. The day I went for training, when I went to explain to him that I’ve got this job with Ebola patients, so that we have to assist in taking care of them, he said no, he won’t accept this kind of job. But if you have knowledge, you have to expand, [to share] it with other people, so that’s why I made up my mind to come and work at the centre. And he went away for good: no call, no visiting, no response. Every day, house owners speak a lot to us about this work we are doing, so we are having very many difficulties. I tried to explain to them, for them to understand that this is my job: I won’t [just] sit down and watch my people dying. If we say we have to sit down watching people die, then all of us will die. Now that I am working here, my mind[set] is always that I am working directly with Ebola patients, so I will be very careful. When I come to work in the morning, I wash my hands regularly. I dress with full protective clothing to see the patients, give them medicines, give them food. We even check their backs; we do laundering for them, then we comfort them, for them to know that they will be well [and] not all is lost in their lives.”
Saffiatu Kanu, community health nurse I love my people because I’m Sierra Leonean. I am not afraid of treating my people. I know if I am afraid, this sickness will spread; I know Ebola is the fastest to kill people, so I just help my people, work for my people, treat them as human beings. That’s why I am here. My fiance abandoned me, yes. I have three children, two twins and one son. I explained to him that I want to come and work for my people, because our colleagues are dying, [but] if we all sit down, it might be me, it might be another person. So we, the health workers, just go work in teams; we fight Ebola. Because if we don’t fight Ebola from this country, all of us will die and our children will suffer. It’s three months now since we started to work with Ebola. I started at the Health Centre Arab. I worked there for two months and then this programme came. Unicef brought the community care centre, Panlap. I also decided to come and work. I went for the training. I’m not afraid to work for my people because I have studied it, so I don’t have any fear. I treat my people simply, like a human being. We feed them, we bath them, we give them food, we encourage them, we talk to them.
Isata Kabia, community health nurse I do this job because I love my career. That’s why I’m here, to see these things are finished in this country. I am not afraid of the Ebola. I stand by my work to save people. I will continue to save people. That’s all I need.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/09/ebola-workers-sierra-leone-panlap-community-care-centre-unicef,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/09/ebola-workers-sierra-leone-panlap-community-care-centre-unicef
2015-01-08T13:00:09Z,global-development,Global development,Bolivia builds women's independence to curb domestic violence | Sara Shahriari,"Honoria lives on the edge of Cochabamba, a city in central Bolivia, in a small adobe house on the side of a dusty hill. When she decided to leave her abusive husband after 11 years together, she faced a series of obstacles. She didn’t have money to hire a lawyer and had difficulty understanding legal documents in Spanish – she is more comfortable using her local language, Quechua. She worried she would lose her house, and wondered if she’d get child support. That’s when one of her neighbours, who had trained as a community educator with the Voces Libres Foundation, stepped in. The neighbour brought Honoria to the organisation’s centre for legal aid and shelter for abused women in Cochabamba. Today, Honoria still has her house and her children, and is a community educator herself. Now it’s her job to go from house to house along the dirt roads in her neighbourhood as part of the Voces Libres initiative to reach women who live in the city’s poorest and most distant areas. The idea is to relay information to the women about their rights and sexual health, and to tell them about the legal centre and shelter. “I tell them that I lived with violence, but not any more, and I feel free,” Honoria says. Laura, who has spent several months in the shelter with her four children, says: “My husband mistreated and hit me a lot, and was always making me suffer over money, not giving me enough to feed the kids.” Like Honoria, she learned of the support through a community educator. “I’m not going back, I’m going to go forward with my children. Thank God, here I’m learning to sew and, even if it’s not much, with that I can get ahead.” More than half of Bolivian women aged 15 to 49 have experienced intimate partner violence, according to a Pan American Health Organisation and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that analysed data from 12 countries over the past 12 years. Of the Latin American and Caribbean nations surveyed, Bolivia ranked the most violent in terms of women who had experienced such violence.
Voces Libres hopes its programme to assist women in Cochabamba, which has been running for two years, will serve as a model for other legal assistance programmes and shelters in terms of offering multi-faceted support by addressing the legal, economic and emotional aspects of violence. In the same building that houses the shelter, lawyers work to establish protective measures and push cases forward, therapists talk with women and their children, job training is offered, and small no-interest loans assist with tools for work, such as sewing machines. The potential for economic independence is a key part of the programme. “Many times we see women [who] are afraid to report their partners because of the economic factor. It’s a big issue, and because they’re afraid of not being able to support their family they endure a lot in their homes,” says legal programme coordinator Pamela Limache Galindo. “Women leave here empowered, with an economic vision and with tools … She is not frightened or fearful of confronting her reality.” There is an expectation among some people in Bolivia that women should put up with abuse to keep the family together. That was the case for Elena, who recently reported her husband after he beat her with a metal rod. She has eight brothers and sisters but ended up in a shelter in the Andean city of La Paz. “They don’t support me,” she says. “They said: ‘You have to put up with it for your children.’ But I can’t.” Although Elena is safe in a shelter for now, she has no job or money. There are only a few publicly funded shelters for abused women in Bolivia, along with a handful that are privately operated, like the one run by Voces Libres – but more are expected. In 2013, Bolivia passed a law designed to increase support for abused women and enforce harsher punishment for abusers. Next year, the country’s regional and local governments must dedicate a percentage of their budgets to build and equip shelters and strengthen legal and psychological aid. For women like Honoria, Laura and Elena, that could be a lifesaver.

2015-01-08T00:01:08Z,global-development,Global development,Australia aid cuts 'jerk around' Marshall Islands and hit development,"Successive Australian aid cuts have “jerked around” the Marshall Islands and severely hampered development projects, according to the Pacific nation’s foreign minister, Tony de Brum. The latest round of “reprioritised” aid funding, announced by the Australian treasurer, Joe Hockey, in his mid-year economic and financial outlook, stripped another A$3.7bn (£1.9bn) from the country’s aid budget. The move has further weakened Australia’s influence in the Marshall Islands’ capital, Majuro, where what De Brum referred to as Australia’s “backsliding” on climate change had already led to dismay; for the low-lying Marshall atolls, rising sea levels are a key issue. Since taking office in 2013, the Coalition government in Australia has cut the foreign aid budget by more than A$11bn. De Brum said Australia’s aid promises had “derailed” vital infrastructure projects in his country. In the middle of last year, he said, Australia pulled funding from water, energy and sewage projects in his constituency of Ebeye, setting them back “a full year”. “We appreciate all the assistance we can get from our partners, but not in this kind of way when we get jerked around and it doesn’t result in a well-thought-out, well-run, well-operated, well-executed plan,” De Brum said. The cuts, De Brum said, reduced Australia to an “insignificant” aid partner for the Marshall Islands, which has a long-standing funding arrangement with the US and also influential Asian partners in Taiwan and Japan. The foreign minister was also scathing about Australia’s decision to cut back ABC’s international news service Radio Australia. “Now, not only are we getting cut, we can’t find out [in the news] if we get cut or not.” A spokesperson for Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) said the government’s aid program was “generous”, especially when it came to the Pacific. “We have focused Australia’s aid program on our immediate region, and the Pacific is a particular focus. It is here that Australia has the most influence and can do the most good. We continue to work closely with Pacific partner countries and regional organisations to build resilience and manage the impacts of climate change on economic development.” Aluka Rakin, director of Youth to Youth in Health in Majuro, said the organisation’s clinic is falling apart. The organisation provides sexual health advice and treatment for young people in the nation’s most populated atoll, and has been able to rely on Australian funding in the past. But two years ago, cash for infrastructure and maintenance dried up – although volunteer help continued. Rakin said further cuts in Australian aid can only make it harder. “It will really have a negative effect on the services we provide,” he said. According to Rakin, the situation is even worse in Ebeye. Teenage pregnancy rates are high and sexually transmitted infections including HIV are increasing. There is no clinic for young people or safe-sex counselling service. “We are desperate for funding for the new clinic,” he said. “Now, with all the [Australian] assistance being cut, we are seeking help from Taiwan and Japan.” Alson Kelen, who runs Waan Aelon in Majol, an organisation aimed at providing skills training and other programs for young people who do not finish school, said he has had to be creative to survive the reduction in Australian assistance. “Instead of having three programs fully funded, we are getting one fully funded and spreading it over three … We see that Australian aid is shifting a bit. The Marshall Islands is getting less and it’s affecting a few of us at the grassroots level. We used to have a few programs supported by Australia, but now there are less opportunities for us.”
Kelen said the people of low-lying island states feel that countries like Australia have a responsibility to look after them, as the effects of climate change will hit them hardest and soonest.“We look at big countries and the effect we are getting from their economic development, like climate change … it’s hurting us,” Kelen said. Australia recently announced it would make a A$200m contribution to the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which will help vulnerable nations adapt to climate change. But the money will come from its aid budget. Small nations, such as the Marshall Islands, may have received some of this money directly from Australia as bilateral aid. But now, De Brum said, the tiny nation would have to compete for funding with countries around the world. Contributing to the GCF by taking money from the aid budget had moved Australian money “further away” from the Marshall Islands, he said. “Australia should take a leadership role and be part of the Pacific. When it comes to climate change they should advocate for their neighbours and not behave as if there is nothing around Australia except its coal and its bottom line, and ballot boxes,” De Brum said. On De Brum’s criticism of the source of Australia’s donation to the GCF, the Dfat spokesperson said the government had already made headway on increasing climate resilience in the Marshall Islands through its aid programs outside the GCF. “Australia is also working with all countries, including our Pacific islands neighbours, to develop a new global climate change agreement that establishes a common playing field for climate action from 2020. Our support for Pacific programs, such as those administered by the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Program have delivered real outcomes in [the] Republic of Marshall Islands by enhancing water security and other forms of economic and environmental resilience.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/08/australia-aid-cuts-jerk-around-marshall-islands-and-hit-development,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/08/australia-aid-cuts-jerk-around-marshall-islands-and-hit-development
2015-01-07T16:40:00Z,global-development,Global development,"5.5m people displaced over first half of 2014, says UN refugee agency","New and continuing conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan and Somalia contributed to the displacement of an estimated 5.5 million people over the first half of 2014, bringing the number of people under the care of the UN’s refugee agency to an almost 20-year high. A total of 13 million refugees and internally displaced people were being given shelter and assistance under the mandate of the UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as of June 2014, the highest number since 1996, the agency said on Wednesday. The Syrian conflict displaced about 3 million people over the first six months of last year, while 2.7 million were forced to leave their homes in Afghanistan over the same period, according to UNHCR’s mid-year trends 2014 report (pdf). In Somalia, about 1.1 million people either left the country or fled to another area, it said.
A “record high” 46 million people were now being helped by UNHCR, when including resettled people, those voluntarily returning to their countries of origin, and existing displaced populations, the agency said. Of the 5.5 million people displaced in the first half of 2014, 1.4 million fled across international borders. Pakistan hosts the most refugees and internally displaced people of any country, with about 1.6 million, who are mostly from Afghanistan. Lebanon hosts 1.1 million, while Iran hosts 982,000.
Ethiopia and Pakistan bear the greatest economic strain of the world’s biggest refugee-hosting countries, while Lebanon and Jordan host the most refugees relative to the size of their own populations, UNHCR said. The UN’s high commissioner for refugees, António Guterres, said: “In 2014 we have seen the number of people under our care grow to unprecedented levels. As long as the international community continues to fail to find political solutions to existing conflicts and to prevent new ones from starting, we will continue to have to deal with the dramatic humanitarian consequences. “The economic, social and human cost of caring for refugees and the internally displaced is being borne mostly by poor communities, those who are least able to afford it. Enhanced international solidarity is a must if we want to avoid the risk of more and more vulnerable people being left without proper support.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/07/55m-people-displaced-over-first-half-of-2014-says-un-refugee-agency,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/07/55m-people-displaced-over-first-half-of-2014-says-un-refugee-agency

2015-01-07T15:21:20Z,global-development,Global development,Surrender of senior aide to Joseph Kony is major blow to Lord's Resistance Army,"The manhunt for Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony has been boosted by the surrender of one his most senior aides, a former child soldier accused of directing a campaign of murder and enslavement. Dominic Ongwen of the rebel group the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), who is wanted for crimes against humanity and war crimes, gave himself up in Central African Republic (CAR), it was confirmed on Wednesday. Analysts said the move deals a “major blow” to the LRA and time could be running out for its leader, a fugitive who came to worldwide prominence in the viral Kony 2012 video campaign. Ugandan army spokesman Paddy Ankunda said Ongwen had first surrendered to CAR’s Seleka rebels and was then handed over to US forces, which joined the hunt for Kony in 2011. “His surrender puts the LRA in the most vulnerable position,” Ankunda told Agence France-Presse. “It is only Kony left standing.” Ongwen, in his mid-30s, is being held in the south-eastern CAR town of Obo, close to the border with South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. “We are working out procedures,” Ankunda added. He said now only Kony remains at large among the five LRA commanders charged by the international criminal court (ICC) almost a decade ago. But it remains to be seen whether Ongwen will be handed over to the court in The Hague. The US is not a signatory to the ICC while Uganda has threatened to withdraw from it, accusing its prosecutors of targeting only African leaders. The LRA had been blamed for the deaths of more than 100,000 people and kidnapping of at least 60,000 children during a three decade-long campaign across five countries in east and central Africa. It is notorious for chopping off limbs as a form of punishment, as well as raping young girls and abducting them for use as sex slaves. The group is now believed to comprise no more than a few hundred fighters. Abducted by the LRA when he was 10, and forced to fight as a child soldier, Ongwen was quickly singled out for his loyalty and tactical ability, and rose through the ranks, becoming a major at 18 and a brigadier by his late 20s. He allegedly directed bloody campaigns in northern Uganda in the early 2000s, where thousands were killed or abducted, as well as carrying out attacks on civilians in DRC. The US State Department accuses him of “murder, enslavement and cruel treatment of civilians”, and had offered a $5m (£3.3m) reward for information leading to his arrest. Former fellow LRA child soldiers who fought with Ongwen told AFP their ex-commander should be put on trial. Richard Ojwang, 37, a carpenter, said: “None of the commanders should be pardoned. Ongwen should be brought to see the terrible things he and Kony did to us. They abducted us and forced us to fight. The LRA killed my parents and friends.” Julius Komakech, a motorbike taxi driver, added: “It is the tail end of LRA. He was one of the few surviving top commanders. If Kony hears of the news about Ongwen’s capture, he must be worried.” Kony, a self-declared mystic who claimed spirits had ordered him to seize power and rule Uganda according to the biblical 10 Commandments, has long been reported to be based in the Sudanese-controlled Kafia Kingi enclave. The Enough Project, a US-based human rights group, welcomed Ongwen’s defection. Kasper Agger, its LRA expert and Ugandan-based field researcher, said: “The surrender of Ongwen is a major blow to the LRA. Ongwen has been one of Joseph Kony’s top proteges, rising in the ranks since 1990, when he was abducted as a child soldier at the age of 10. As part of the LRA’s core command, his surrender is a very significant step in the efforts to bring a final end to the LRA.” Sasha Lezhnev, associate director of policy for DRC, the Great Lakes Region and the LRA at the Enough Project, said: “Ongwen’s defection is strong evidence that the African mission against the LRA is working, slowly but surely. It will have a major psychological impact on other LRA commanders. But this is not the end – the US and European Union must deepen the mission to counter the LRA’s illicit trafficking networks in ivory, diamonds and gold, or else a revitalised LRA could come back in 2015.” Amnesty International called for Ongwen to face justice at the ICC. Michelle Kagari, its deputy regional director, said: “The people of northern Uganda have waited almost 10 years for the warrants issued by the ICC against leaders of the Lord’s Resistance Army to be executed. Dominic Ongwen now needs to be held to account for the numerous charges he faces of murder, mutilation, forced recruitment of child soldiers and use of sex slaves – crimes he allegedly committed when he was a senior commander of the LRA.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/07/surrender-aide-joseph-kony-blow-lords-resistance-army,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/07/surrender-aide-joseph-kony-blow-lords-resistance-army
2015-01-07T10:56:54Z,global-development,Global development,Aid without faith – is there a place for religious NGOs in the 21st century?,"Is there a place for religious international NGOs in the 21st century? The majority of students who responded to our question said yes. They argued that religion was deeply rooted in many communities, and therefore it made sense for faith-based NGOs to work in those communities. Those who disagreed claimed religious NGOs attempt to convert the people they work with. Here are five of our favourite responses, and you can add your thoughts in the comments section below. Religion has spearheaded social change Yes. Religious NGOs play an important role as social service providers, and through their faith-based approach they have the ability to develop deeper relationships with communities in developing countries. Wendy Tyndale, in her 2003 analysis of a World Bank survey that collected voices from around the world, found that “no other organisations are more firmly rooted or have better networks in poor communities than the religious ones”. This ability to foster deep connections in communities cannot be overlooked. Yes, religion has in some cases led to extremism, but it also has spearheaded social change. For example, much of Latin America (where Christianity and notably Catholicism has had tremendous influence) has undergone rapid social changes with a view to the oppressed and impoverished through liberation theology. Liberation theology has its roots in Latin America and understands Christianity to operate with a “preferential option for the poor”. This change in theological understanding has brought the plight of the marginalised to the foreground. Religious NGOs continue to have this ability to fight for the marginalised and combat extremism through representing different faiths under the golden rule of all religions: “Do unto others as you would have them to do unto you.” Religious NGOs need to continually reflect this and, if done faithfully, their ability to connect with communities and promote a positive message for the religious may be the best way in which to combat extremism and advocate for positive social change. Adam Faber, Dalhousie University, Canada Only secular NGOs can claim to be independent The complementary role that NGOs have in supporting and advancing development efforts is widely recognised, as assistance from locally based organisations and NGOs are given the difficult task of addressing poverty alleviation, social inequities and environmentally focused initiatives where governments’ and the private sector’s actions are simply falling short. However, religious NGOs (especially evangelical Christian) are often a remnant of western colonialism and imperialism, as the primary goals of economic and political exploitation are pursued through manipulating attempts of conversion of faith. By entering a community and establishing a powerful base of converts, there is the potential to influence the educational system, economic activities, social policy, government bureaucracy, and even military affairs. Of course, there are a plethora of examples where religious NGOs have accomplished fulfilling noble projects of improving human wellbeing, but the underlying foundational concept of converting the population to a given faith cannot be ignored. Such initiatives are nothing less than subversive tactics with the intention of changing cultures and communities to subscribe to a foreign ideology, so that ulterior economic and political motives may be pursued. With the growing trend of religious fanaticism across a variety of faiths, to continue to promote the presence of religious NGOs in areas of potential religiously influenced conflict is to stoke an age-old battle of domineering dogmas. Therefore, if a humanitarian worker truly wishes to remain independent, then he or she must choose to work with a secular organisation. Otherwise, there will be undeniable pressure to persuade vulnerable people to convert. Patrick Rulong, University of Waterloo, Canada Faith-based NGOs attract more donations Faith is a phenomenon that has shaped and molded the sociopolitical landscape for millennia. No other phenomena can illicit as big a response from a group as large and diverse and as quickly as faith can. This has had extremely ugly and devastating consequences as well as significant humanitarian benefits in modern history. In the context of humanitarian organisations, faith has been a double-edged sword. Often, faith-based humanitarian organisations have used aid as a pretext for spreading their faith, resulting in controversial programmes in which individuals are not given aid until they convert, as has been done by several controversial evangelical missionary organisations in Africa. This results in faith-based organisations being used as tools to establish cultural and religious imperialism. Furthermore, the bad actions of a few faith-based organisations causes deep mistrust and resentment by the local population that is sometimes vented indiscriminately at foreign aid organisations, as has been the case in Afghanistan and Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. However, in the modern era, many secular aid organisations such as USAid can be accused of similar corruption in goals as governments such as the United States government use them as tools of diplomacy and intelligence rather than for the intended goal of humanitarian aid. The US Central Intelligence Agency has been accused of using humanitarian organistions and programmes as fronts for its intelligence operations. This came into light when a fake hepatitis B vaccination programme in Pakistan was used to identify the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden. In short, in the large pool of humanitarian organisations there will always be bad apples with corrupted goals, whether they be evangelical missionary organisations with the goal of religious conversion or western governmental aid agencies with the goal of serving the diplomatic and intelligence goals of their government. This will remain true regardless of whether organisations are faith-based or secular. The key difference between secular and faith-based organisations is their ability to attract donors. While, in recent decades, secular humanitarian organisations have drastically increased their donor pools and funding resources, they cannot match the donations that faith-based organisations are able to procure speedily. Often, significant amounts of money donated to secular organizations are given by numerous small faith-based ones. The fact that charity is an important tenet in religions such as Islam and Christianity is a driving factor that causes individuals who would otherwise be apathetic to global humanitarian issues to donate to help solve such issues. In a world where individuals are increasingly apathetic about global humanitarian issues, faith-based organisations will have a much easier time fundraising for global causes than their secular counterparts. It is this key ability of faith-based organisations that makes them not only tolerable but necessary in the coming decades. Noorsher Ahmed, Occidental College, US Religious or secular – they both do inspiring work Though some may feel that religious belief is a now defunct reasoning behind “good works”, no one can deny the massive impact it has had across the world over the centuries. I support the work of both religious and secular NGOs and I applaud the very difficult work these organisations do. The dangers faced by aid workers are similar, whether or not they are working with a religious group. Although religious groups take different ethical and moral stances on issues such as sexuality, this should not (and, I believe, usually does not) prevent them from offering aid to all in need. Working in communities alongside different religions is a challenge, but an extremely rewarding one, and it can lead to greater understanding and increased trust between people. The world stage is now so crowded and wide that it is only necessary that we each learn about the other’s beliefs, while figuring out how to work alongside one another despite our differences. As a Christian and a medical student, I am very interested in becoming more involved in humanitarian work in the future. Whether this is with a faith-based organisation or a secular one, I know I will be doing my work with the same goals in mind: first, to love my God “with all my heart and soul and mind” and, second, to “love my neighbour as myself” (Matthew 22:37-40). Sophie Gerring, University of Aberdeen, Scotland Religious NGOs are fine, as long as they do no harm This is an issue that we should regard from a pragmatist perspective. There are about a million difficulties that an aid worker can encounter when working in a cultural environment that is different from their own, from problems with language to accidentally offending people because customs are not known. This is not limited to faith-based NGOs, and in most cases the development work the NGO does makes up for the trouble it creates. It only becomes a real problem when they do more harm than good. But if it turns out that an NGO does create an unacceptable amount of damage in a certain area, for example, an NGO discourages the use of condoms in a place where HIV is the main cause of death, it should get out. Not because it is faith-based, but because it does more harm than good. We cannot judge religious NGOs as a matter of principle; their effectiveness needs to be viewed on a case-by-case basis. The only thing we can regard as a matter of principle is that we should not ban religion-based NGOs from places where people practise a different religion from their own. We do not want to impair people who want to do good because they have a religious reason for wanting to do so. This, in a way, would also be doing more harm than good because aid is denied where it could had been given. We need to have faith in religious NGOs.

2015-01-07T07:00:13Z,global-development,Global development,Life on the Ebola frontline: 'Things will never be the same in Sierra Leone',"As we celebrated Christmas and the new year quietly in our houses, we wait for the day just like the one when our former president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah said “the war is over”. We are praying and fighting to hear the very special words that we are Ebola-free. But as we wait, we continue to strive, with prayers in our hearts for our heroes and heroines who have lost their lives, and fight to be rid of this virus. When I think back to the end of 2013, so much was happening at that time. From the club house, town halls, city fields, homes to churches, you could feel the mood, the celebrations of people all around you. We prayed that 2014 would be better than 2013, but disaster entered our beautiful land. We have lost so many loved ones and as we progressed to the ending of the year we were still losing so many people. Most non-essential workers were given a break to be with their families. But quarantine and burial teams did their jobs just like any other day. To end 2014 this way was something we were not hoping for. The streets were empty, the normal New Year’s Eve services in churches were banned. People went for the Christmas service but were asked to return home just after as every church activity should stop at 5pm. Instead, people were asked to stay at home and no one was allowed to travel to other districts. Even smaller villages stop people, especially health workers without passes, from entering their villages. They believe health workers can easily get infected and pass the virus on. The ban on celebrations was highly effective in villages, more so than in big towns, as homes in cities did have music and people dancing within their houses but this Christmas and new year is one we never want again to celebrate this way. For Newman though, this Christmas was the best ever. “We didn’t have to worry about buying so many things, or worry about thieves breaking into our homes, or spending too much money going out.” For those who are greatly affected by Ebola, this Christmas was the worst ever, as loved ones they celebrated with last year are not here to wish again for a better 2015. The normal Christmas songs were covered with information about Ebola. It was a very difficult moment for survivors, even when some were brought together you could still see sorrow in their eyes, but lots of support is being given to most survivors now. “I had my dreams for 2014, I was supposed to get married, continue my business but Ebola brought me down to nothing, leaving me with trauma, stigmatised and no one to stand by me when I had fully integrated into my community. I will never be able to express the pains, the sorrow of seeing my fiance die in front of me. But I thank God for being alive today,” one survivor who was infected by her partner told me. In my line of duty, I have heard so many survivors’ stories and all of them, in one way or the other, have mentioned something about their faith in God. We have prayed month after month, having faith that this virus will end soon. Faith has played a very important role in our fight to end this virus, while our brothers and sisters have died and are still dying, while others are still being infected, while our freedom has been reduced, while we are suffering, starving, while many have been stigmatised and traumatised, many lost their livelihoods, even when fear overpowers us, we have hung on to our faith, because we are people of faith. Every village in Sierra Leone will either have a mosque, a church or both. “I was so worried to death when I was told my result came positive, but I hang on to my faith in God because he is the author and finisher of my life,” one survivor says. Many survivors are thankful to God, because they believe it was only God who saved them, many having only that to hold on to when they thought everyone had abandoned them. I am a Christian and believe that God can be the only one to protect me from this virus, even though I always follow every precautionary measure to ensure that I do not become infected.
My morning and evening prayers, just like many, have been that of ending this virus in our beautiful land. We want to have that time again when we can hug, celebrate, visit loved ones, live without fear and worries, think about development, do the normal things we used to do. But things will never be the same again in Sierra Leone, never, especially for survivors and those who have lost dear ones. Religious leaders have played a great role in trying to end this virus. As a leader in my church, I have seen how easy it is for people to believe and do whatever I say about Ebola. We have put everything aside to help get this virus out of our country, but faith has helped so many people to get this far. As we continue our work with survivors, we have seen lots of development from the government in trying to help them, but more will need to be done to see that no one will ever again have to go through the things they went through. The survivors I have met are thankful to all who, in one way or another, have helped them during these difficult times. This virus has pushed us to our limit and we are determined more than ever to see the ending of it. We still have big challenges: there are still those who don’t believe that this virus is real. People are still having a hard time to get through to the 117 helpline. Survivors are still being stigmatised. People are still washing dead bodies before calling 117. The sick are still being kept in houses. But we will surely win this fight.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/07/life-ebola-frontline-sierra-leone-religion,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/07/life-ebola-frontline-sierra-leone-religion

2015-01-06T12:35:17Z,global-development,Global development,Strike over risk pay at Sierra Leone Ebola hospital called off,"A hospital in Sierra Leone that was closed because of a dispute over risk allowance pay for treating Ebola patients has reopened after staff called off their strike. About 130 nurses and doctors downed tools on 24 December at the Magbenteh community hospital, leaving Makeni, the fourth largest city in the country, without any maternity cover. It usually sees about 30 pregnant women a day. Staff said the government had failed to pay the $45 a week hazard payment since September despite aid flooding into the country. Henry Conteh, representative of the staff, told the Guardian that the district Ebola coordinator had met the payments “on the spot” after publicity both locally and internationally. “It was pressure from the media. Pregnant women went crazy and went to radio and TV. The president heard about it and that was when we got our payments.” Conteh said back payments were being made for November and December and that it had also been promised funds to pay for regular salaries. The charity that runs the hospital is running out of money. Over the past three months, the Swiss Sierra Leone Development Foundation has paid only half of staff’s basic pay. Its founder, Harald Pfeiffer, has appealed for aid since the Ebola outbreak began and has been promised a grant of $350,000 from the government. It is also waiting on a consignment of two containers of food and medical supplies organised by two radiographers in Dublin. Figures released by the UN Ebola mission Unmeer at the end of December showed signs that the incidence of the disease in Sierra Leone is no longer increasing, although infection levels remain a concern. There were 979 cases reported in the three weeks up to 28 December. In the same period, Guinea and Liberia together reported less than half that number (438). In his New Year’s Day address, the president of Sierra Leone, Ernest Bai Koroma, said schools would reopen soon, although it is unlikely that this will be on a national level. Liberia has already announced plans to reopen schools next month. The latest figures show that infection rates in the country have dropped to just over four cases a day. Liberia had no confirmed Ebola cases on 31 December and 91 cases in the three weeks up to 28 December.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/06/strike-sierra-leone-hospital-ebola,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/06/strike-sierra-leone-hospital-ebola
2015-01-06T10:09:31Z,global-development,Global development,Ebola shuts schools in Sierra Leone but teachers use skills to stop disease | John Momodu Kargbo,"I have been a social worker for more than 10 years. For the past six years, a big focus of my work has been bringing the first schools to some of the remotest parts of northern Sierra Leone. In that time, we have recruited and trained more than 400 community teachers. Over the past four years, we have seen big changes – where previously there were virtually no schools, earlier this year, access to education delivered by trained and qualified teachers was mostly a reality. For the past five months, though – since Ebola entered Sierra Leone – we have been unable to continue the programme. Due to the state of national emergency, all the schools have been closed down, and there is no sign of them being reopened. So education in these forgotten parts of the country has drawn to a standstill once more. After the schools closed, the teachers we had trained were calling out to be put to work in preventing the spread of the virus. I soon realised that these teachers could be very useful in helping their communities by educating their own people in the attitudes and behaviour they needed to adopt to remain safe from infection. We set up training sessions and started working with 145 teachers in Tambakha, one of the most remote chiefdoms in the country. The training aimed to facilitate the process of giving them the basic education they needed to pass on: “Don’t touch the sick. Don’t touch the dead. Wash your hands with soap frequently.” These were three of the simple messages that our new Ebola educators would take door-to-door to about 200 people per teacher.
We also wanted our educators to monitor the local population of the villages, registering every individual. This monitoring on subsequent visits not only helps to keep track of anyone who falls sick but allows our teachers to check whether there are any newcomers in the area, and to monitor where the newcomer has come from – particularly whether he or she has come from an Ebola-affected area. The teachers can then refer people to hospitals or medical facilities and report the status of any village to the local Ebola taskforce. After three days of intensive training and armed with simple tools, our first teachers took their messages into 160 communities across the Tambakha chiefdom. As they are highly respected and influential in their communities, teachers are ideally placed to change people’s mindsets about Ebola. When they work among their own people, our teachers are seen as “children of the village” so the community will trust them. Rural villages can be suspicious of people coming to talk to them. Their own son or daughter finds it easier to carry the messages that we need to disseminate. Even then, however, our educators face detractors who tend to preach a negative message. Before we commence our training programme, it is common for a community to believe that Ebola is not real. Others will say the virus has been brought by outsiders, or is even a tool of the government to gain influence in the stronghold of the opposition. Many people find it difficult to accept the fact that Ebola is actually a disease like malaria. It is common for people to associate the virus with devils or evil spirits. I’ve visited villages where people stay awake at night because they believe the disease is being spread by people deliberately poisoning their water wells. Some people even have misconceptions about the hospitals, imagining that they poison patients to contain the spread of the disease. So our educators face many challenges – particularly as elements of the message we’re bringing can be hard to accept. It is common practice for a family to wash a dead relative’s body for burial – especially after they have died of an illness. Previously, telling people not to touch the body was seen as completely anti-cultural and it was difficult for people to come to terms with that. But, through our teaching on how the virus can spread and by showing examples of how funerals have affected entire communities as a result, gradually people began to comply. Immediately after we started our work, we saw a difference. In Tambakha, we helped to ensure that the disease never reached beyond the first two villages at the river entrance to the chiefdom. We’ve now trained more than 1,200 educators nationwide. We’re covering 28 chiefdoms, supporting the safety of more than 300,000 people.
Other communities are getting in touch and calling for our support. The biggest problem is that the local government Ebola taskforces are so few in number that their work is not really effective. Because of the number of teachers we have, we are able to make a real impact on areas that no one else has been able to reach. Rural communities are engaging with the programme simply because it helps to keep them safe in places that are extremely difficult to reach – places that 4x4 ambulances and health personnel will always struggle to get to. Of course, we need to reach the teachers first so that we can train them ourselves, and that presents real challenges. We’ve taken up this task at a time when rural road networks are at their worst as a result of rainy season in September and October. Making your way through forests, rivers and hilly terrain in those conditions is no easy task. At times, we have to move for miles on foot along narrow bush paths to meet teachers at a central location before heading back along the same routes. To reach the village of Fanbukura, which is 75 miles from Kabala over very dense terrain, for example, we had to leave the car and go on foot just to get to one village that was an Ebola hotspot. Fifteen teachers had gathered for training. We had to walk three miles through forested areas where there are many dangers. When you have togo on foot, there may be times when you almost run over a snake and you can’t rule out the possibility of wild animals. Back home in Makeni, my family miss me for days – even weeks – and continue to worry about my welfare. Most of these places have no reception for mobile phones so there’s no way for me to keep in touch. But I keep encouraging my family. I tell them that this is their own contribution in saving the lives of people that desperately need our help in the fight against Ebola.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/06/ebola-schools-sierra-leone-teachers-disease,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/06/ebola-schools-sierra-leone-teachers-disease
2015-01-06T07:00:05Z,global-development,Global development,Made in India? Why manufacturing is the best route to development | Jostein Hauge,"China’s president, Xi Jinping, recently said “the combination of the world’s factory and the world’s back office will produce the most competitive production base”. He was referring to China and India, respectively. The world’s two most populous economies have been growing at impressive rates, but China has been climbing the ladder faster and laid a more solid foundation for future development. How? Xi’s statement inadvertently provides the answer: China has expanded its manufacturing base while India has specialised in services. But whereas the former is a necessary precondition for sustained economic growth, the latter is a less certain development path. Since the industrial revolution, almost all countries that have managed the transition from low to high income have undergone industrialisation, diversifying and upgrading their production structure, relinquishing dependence on agriculture and natural resources. The east Asian Tigers – the most successful examples of late developers – all had targeted industrial policies. Only a few countries with valuable natural resources, and with small populations, have gone through a period of sustained economic growth without advancing manufacturing production, like Botswana and Oman. And the poorest countries all have negligible manufacturing bases.
Productivity growth and technological advancement lie at the root of economic development, which is why manufacturing is so important. Most technological breakthroughs have been associated with the manufacturing sector, such as the steam engine, the internal combustion engine, aeroplanes, steel ships and semiconductors. In fact, efficiency across all sectors of the economy has improved as a result of technology diffusion from the manufacturing sector. The world’s most productive farms use the most advanced machinery, pesticides and chemical fertilisers while the most industrious services use state of the art transport equipment and computers (pdf). Manufacturing is also important for creating good jobs. The International Labour Organisation says countries with a high share of employees in industry tend to have more people in wage-employment, rather than in informal, vulnerable jobs. For the past 40 years, the output and employment shares of manufacturing in the world’s economies have declined, and those of services have increased. With the increased scope for productivity growth and tradability of services, some developing countries have started to believe that they can skip the industrialisation phase.
India is often described as the poster child of a developing country successfully riding on the back of services-led growth. The growth of services in information technology and business process outsourcing has led to significant job creation and poverty reduction. And services do have more economic advantages than 40 years ago. Technological advance is more easily incorporated into telecommunications, financial and business services. In some digitalised services, the cost of expanding production is getting close to zero. The revolutions in information and communication technology and transport equipment have also made services more tradable. But most services still require the producer and consumer to be in the same location, like cleaning, utilities and education, whereas, in theory, all manufacturing products can be traded. Services have been stuck at about 20% of international trade since the 1990s. For the past 10 years, India has had a trade surplus in services that covers only one-fifth of its trade deficit in goods. This is a balance of trade constraint that the country will have to tackle eventually. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, the former chief minister of Gujarat – a manufacturing powerhouse in western India – has proclaimed grand plans for expanding the manufacturing sector and improving infrastructure, so it is likely India will gain world shares in manufacturing production in the near future. But the country has yet to experience the economic transformation that has swept China in the past 30 years thanks to expanding manufacturing production in almost all areas – from textiles, garments and toys to cars, ships and electronics. China’s story, like most economic success stories before it, is a testament to a simple yet highly relevant policy recommendation for today’s developing countries: if you want to prosper, you need to make stuff.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/06/india-china-manufacturing-services-development,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/06/india-china-manufacturing-services-development
2015-01-05T14:23:05Z,global-development,Global development,Kenya's tech entrepreneurs shun Konza 'silicon savannah',"Kenya’s plan to catapult itself into an elite club of technology hubs by splashing out $14.5bn (£9.3bn) on a city dubbed a “silicon savannah” will not solve fundamental financing problems facing the country’s burgeoning tech industry, say people working in the sector. Leading figures say Konza Techno City, which the Kenyan government plans to complete by 2019, will fail to attract top talent because it is too far [37 miles] from Nairobi. Funds allocated for Konza would be better spent giving commercial lenders incentives to invest in new startups, they say. Chris Asego, co-founder of Eneza Education, an SMS-based teaching service, says he supports the idea of Konza, noting it could spawn innovation if planned and built well. But he is acutely aware of the need to spur more investors to put money into companies like his. “Our company doesn’t have a single Kenyan investor,” he said, adding that they had one African investor so far but were keen to find more local funding. “You realise when you go to Nairobi that most of the technological hubs are in one location – we have iHub, the Nailab, the m:lab, then you drive 100 metres from that building and you get other labs close by. Most of these hubs are supported by people who are not even Kenyans.” Kenya’s information and communication technology (ICT) sector contributed about 12% to gross domestic product last year, showing steady growth from 2006 when it made up 9% of the economy. The Konza Technopolis Development Authority (KTDA) says that by 2020 the city will create 100,000 jobs and bring in $1bn a year.
But east Africa’s booming tech sector, which is anchored in Nairobi, would benefit more from private-sector partnerships and better ICT training and education programmes, says Josiah Mugambi, executive director of iHub. “I support the idea behind [Konza city], but I’m just not sure that it’s what’s needed right now. Many [in Kenya’s tech community] are sceptical about [Konza city]. Density is important but growing those companies that would eventually fill – or better still, would be able to build – such a city I think is more critical.” Kenya’s national development plan, known as Vision 2030, includes a target to transform Konza into a bustling city with 200,000 people working in business outsourcing in the next 20 years, with the larger goal of becoming a world class destination for tech business, education and research. “Konza will serve as a hub for the east African technology industries, attracting leaders from the region and beyond. Konza is not meant to compete for Nairobi business, but will complement growth. This is similar to many countries globally where there are satellite cities to decongest the capital cities,” says Catherine Adeya-Weya, chief executive of KTDA. But not all Kenyan tech entrepreneurs think Konza is a bad move. Ken Mwenda, managing director at eMobilis Mobile Technology Academy, says: “You need to start somewhere and [Konza] is that somewhere. There have been many other disjointed government efforts and initiatives but the scale of this project means that one would have to try hard not to notice that Kenya is seriously committed to its tech industry.” Kenya, which has long been seen as a leader in mobile technology, has 32.2m mobile subscribers giving it a 79.2% mobile penetration rate, according to the most recent quarterly report (pdf) from Kenya’s communications authority. Many of the country’s projects focus on developing products that reach Kenya’s poorest through SMS services available on basic mobile phones. Kenya-based journalist Tom Jackson says in a blog post: “There are concerns that Kenya might be getting ahead of itself in building Konza before its ICT capabilities are up to scratch. Konza may be a brave attempt at revolutionising the sector, but many feel that it should not be the first step on the road to a booming tech sector. Local interest in investment in Konza was low.” But multilateral organisations such as the World Bank are keen to pump funding into developing countries’ tech sectors, with Kenya touted as a model for others to follow. Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, said: “What we’re seeing in Kenya is what we need to see in every part of the developing world. We also need to find ways of building business environments that will allow the development of small and medium-sized enterprises to create jobs, and we know that jobs are really the way that we’re going to end poverty.” • This article was amended on 15 January to clarify that while Enza Education is looking for more local investment, it does support Konza Techno City.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/05/kenya-technology-entrepreneurs-konza-silicon-savannah,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/05/kenya-technology-entrepreneurs-konza-silicon-savannah
2015-01-05T11:51:12Z,global-development,Global development,Bolivian women bank on sweet success of quinoa bars | Sam Jones,"Behind curtains of plastic sheeting in a small room off the main square of a highland town, four women are doing something novel, tasty and very nearly healthy with quinoa, Bolivia’s ancient grano de oro (golden grain). They mix the tiny spheres of the Andean staple with coconut, peanuts and sugar syrup, before pressing and cooking them. Some are left as they are when they emerge from the oven; the lucky ones are half-dipped in Bolivian chocolate. After being packaged and sealed, the 800 energy bars they produce each day await distribution. A quarter will end up at an exclusive gym in La Paz – where they sell for five bolivianos (about $0.70) each – others will provide breakfast for local children, while the rest will be sold at a discount to local shops and families, or swapped for the milk, yogurt and cheese processed by a nearby dairy co-operative. The business, which is run by an association of women from the town of Tumarapi, an hour-and-a-half’s drive from Bolivia’s administrative capital, La Paz, was started after the 100 or so local families who produce quinoa began to look for new ways to sell their produce. Growing demand for quinoa led many local farmers to abandon potato cultivation in favour of the grain. The focus on a single crop brought a huge surplus of produce – and declining prices. In partnership with Soluciones Prácticas, the Latin American branch of the UK NGO Practical Action, the women’s association decided to add value to the raw quinoa by turning it into energy bars.
Although they are still struggling to get their products to the market in sufficient numbers, the women hope that the business will continue to grow. The current premises are only temporary – on the outskirts of town, other members of the association are cutting metal rods and bending them into beams that will support the roof of a purpose-built factory, to comply with health and safety standards. Once the factory is ready, the women hope to see a rise in sales commensurate with the pride they have in the business. As well as providing an income, it has afforded them more independence and a greater role within the community. “I look forward to putting on my uniform and coming to work,” says Clara Tambo Rivas, 18. “But we only work here a day or two a week because we can’t sell enough at the moment. I would like to work here more, but we need to sell more bars.” Her colleague Eduarda Ortega Tambo, 27, who has three children, far prefers making cereal bars to the back-breaking, knee-shredding work of harvesting their main ingredient. “We would be in the fields every day,” she says. “We used to have to crawl along the earth to sow it and thresh it by hand. We would all work and thresh all morning, and return home in the afternoon. And then I used to have to look after the children.”
But the fruit of their labours was, quite literally, chicken feed; with more quinoa than they could use, the surplus was fed to their livestock. Ortega uses the extra money she earns from the bars to buy more fruit and vegetables for her children. She hopes that the benefits of having the factory – in which the bars will be mixed and baked – will extend beyond the economic and nutritional. “It makes me feel like I am helping my children to have better opportunities and better conditions in their lives,” she says. “They can also see I am happy in my work, and that encourages me to work but also encourages them to do so as well.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/05/bolivia-women-quinoa-energy-bars,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/05/bolivia-women-quinoa-energy-bars
2015-01-05T07:00:09Z,global-development,Global development,The best books on Algeria: start your reading here | Pushpinder Khaneka,"What the Day Owes the Night by Yasmina Khadra, translated by Frank Wynne Khadra’s novel of a young Arab boy growing up in 20th-century French Algeria is an epic tale of family, love and war. The narrator, Younes, is the son of a poor Arab farmer who loses his land and, in search of work, drags the family to a slum in the city of Oran. The father, ground down by poverty, eventually agrees for Younes to be brought up by his uncle, an educated and affluent pharmacist. It’s a life-changing experience for the young boy, who, renamed Jonas, moves with his new family to the town of Rio Salado, where he goes to school among Europeans. Jonas acquires a tight coterie of friends, but racism – both subtle and overt – is never far away. The group’s friendship is sorely tested when the arrival of the beautiful Emilie brings painful lessons about love. But it faces a much greater challenge as Algeria’s grisly war of independence reaches Rio Salado and racial tensions erupt. His idyllic life shattered, Jonas is forced to choose between two worlds – Algerian and European. This rich, captivating novel offers Younes/Jonas as a trenchant witness to both colonial and colonised Algeria. Yasmina Khadra is the pen name of Mohammed Moulessehoul, a former Algerian army officer who adopted his wife’s name to evade military censors. He lives in France. Fantasia by Assia Djebar, translated by Dorothy S Blair In the first novel of her Algerian quartet, Djebar intertwines the autobiographical story of a young girl’s coming of age with the history of French conquest in 1830 and the war of independence in the 1950s. She uses a colourful mix of fictional and reconstructed history from archives to counter colonial as well as patriarchal attitudes – sometimes reflecting the parallels between the two. The novel reclaims the role played by Algerian women in society and emphasises their role in the country’s history – their suffering, but also their tenacity and resilience. In the latter part of the book a tapestry of first-person female voices conveys the experiences of participants – rebel fighters, torture victims, exiles – in the vicious struggle against France. The raw, emotional prose reflects both passion and compassion as the narrator recounts the stories of women struggling for Algeria’s independence and their own. She says she is “writing … above all, to resurrect so many vanished sisters”. This unconventional novel’s elaborate construction can be frustrating at times, but it presents a memorable account of lives lived under French repression. Assia Djebar is the pen name of the Algerian novelist, academic and film-maker Fatima-Zohra Imalayen. She lives in France, and was elected to the prestigious Académie Française in 2005. Algeria: Anger of the Dispossessed by Martin Evans and John Phillips After a long and bloody war to end colonial rule, Algeria emerges in 1962 to become a darling of the non-aligned movement. But, as Evans and Phillips reveal, beneath the veneer of a revolutionary, progressive state lurks a repressive and increasingly corrupt military dictatorship. The post-independence generation, meanwhile, unemployed, disenfranchised and alienated, finds itself at odds with the official myths of Algeria’s liberation struggle. Pent-up anger explodes on to the streets in 1988’s Black October, and the protests are brutally suppressed. As many young Algerians turn to political Islam for solutions, the government tries, and fails, to contain the movement. Violence escalates, and the regime – in desperation – calls elections in 1991. But when the Islamists look like winning, the military promptly cancels the vote. The ugly civil war that ensues – in which unspeakable atrocities are committed by both sides – lasts more than a decade and claims about 200,000 lives. The violence has subsided but, say the authors, Algeria’s agony is not yet over. The “anger of the dispossessed” remains – “a fury that has the potential to endure for decades to come”. The British historian Evans and Phillips, a journalist, have years of experience in north Africa, and their engrossing and lucid book offers a fascinating insight into Algeria’s opaque politics.

The Delhi student, 16, came up with the idea of recycling the unwanted rice husks and straw into an alternative building material. “I’d go to my family’s farm, where my dad grew up, for the holidays, and see them burning piles and piles of it. The harvesting months are the worst and the black smoke gets quite harmful, causing people to have problems breathing, as well as polluting the environment,” Deu said. More than half of the world’s people eat rice as a staple food and, for every five tons of rice harvested, one ton of husk is produced. The cereal residue has little commercial value for farmers, but Deu hopes to change that. “I want to provide cheap and affordable housing material to people, because many live in homes made of mud, which can’t always withstand the weather. This would mean farmers also have a new source of income,” she said. After asking farmers how they would like to use the recycled product, Deu took to her mother’s kitchen to create a prototype, with support from the Social Innovation Relay initiative. Mixing the waste with a resin and pressing the mixture into particleboards, she came up with what she calls “green wood”.
She says the product is fungi- and mould-proof, making it a viable option for building houses. Deu also plans to use the material to build low-cost school furniture. “I think it could be a local, sustainable solution to some of the problems we see here,” she said. Deu is still perfecting her prototype but has received interest from Indian businesses. “I’ve made a few designs now and I’m still improving it. Since I’m in a crucial grade of studying, I’m working on both the green wood and school right now, but I’m hoping to have it available to as many people as soon as possible.” Deu’s innovation was featured in Unicef’s 2015 state of the world’s children report alongside offerings by other young inventors, including four Nigerian students who created a urine-powered generator and a Colombian student who invented a vibrating device to help hearing-impaired people negotiate traffic. Deu, who plans to study economics at university, said she was inspired after meeting other young innovators. “It was the best experience, and I discovered that there are many young people like me trying to find solutions to our problems. It showed that we, the youth, can think outside of the box.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/04/rice-waste-green-wood-low-cost-homes-india,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/04/rice-waste-green-wood-low-cost-homes-india
2015-01-03T09:00:13Z,global-development,Global development,Luxury skincare product promises to nourish Kenyan employment | Jessica Hatcher,"Marula oil is a relative newcomer to the world of luxury skincare. Marula trees grow across southern Africa and in parts of east and west Africa. The oil is extracted from the hard kernels of its fruits. Until the late 1990s, the sole major commercial use of marula oil was for the South African cream liqueur, Amarula. That changed when a women’s cooperative in Namibia began to develop the oil for use in the cosmetics industry. Within a year it was discovered by the Body Shop; by 2011, the company was using it in more than 140 products, sourced exclusively from Namibia, according to a case study by the World Intellectual Property Organisation. With higher levels of antioxidants and omega 9 acid than argan oil, another skincare superstar, marula oil provides some of the best natural protection against environmental damage and free radicals that lead to early ageing. Marula oil will soon be commercially produced and marketed in east Africa, thanks to Philip Leakey, a Kenyan farmer with 6,000 marula trees growing naturally on his 3,000 acre farm. He is planting a further 50,000. Leakey and his business-partner and wife, Katy, have so far produced more than 6,000 litres of marula oil on their farm, Ol Kerii, in Kenya, selling it in the US through the Leakey Collection, a fair trade company they built to promote entrepreneurial opportunities that complement the environment and culture of rural Kenyans. This year, they will launch new marula oil products at a lower price for the east African market. Most mass-produced marula oils are obtained by crushing the kernel, sometimes together with the nut and flesh, and extracting the oil using heat and chemicals. However, this process destroys the oil’s natural antioxidant properties. To avoid this, Leakey has built a modular, mobile cold-press system that extracts the oil. His team cuts the kernels by hand first to remove the rancid ones. To date, much of the selection of marula trees by international agricultural organisations has been for fruit size, to produce more pulp, rather than for kernel size. “Scientific selection for pulp is the opposite to what you want for oil, we’ve found on the farm,” Leakey says. He is now selecting trees based on the size of the kernel. Concessions of trees have been carefully selected from across east Africa so that nuts are ripening at different times of the year in different areas. Harvesting is spread over 10 months, which makes labour, production chains and storage easier to manage. Ol Kerii’s marula oil gives regular work to about 800 people, 95% of them women. There is no factory, no clocking-in and clocking-out. Workers, once trained, can do as many (or as few) hours as they want, so it doesn’t interrupt the demands of daily life. But pay-scales rise in line with how much work you do, to incentivise production. For a full day, an average worker might take home $10 (£6.40). According to the UN, rural wages in Kenya usually vary between 3,000 and 9,000 shillings – $35-104 – a month. Leakey believes that marula oil could develop into a multibillion-dollar business, and estimates that the Ol Kerii business alone could create work for 10,000 people. The communities currently hacking down marula trees to make way for farmland, he fears, are missing out on a huge opportunity.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/03/marula-oil-skincare-kenyan-employment-philip-leakey,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/03/marula-oil-skincare-kenyan-employment-philip-leakey
2015-01-02T12:00:10Z,global-development,Global development,"Golf, fishing and wildlife: the changing face of Angolan tourism | Klas Lundström","Fishermen lay nets in the Kwanza river at dusk. The tide is low and the silence is a far cry from Angola’s busy capital Luanda, an hour’s drive away. The river was an important gateway into Angola for slave traders during the colonial era. Now, the government has started to search for oil along the riverbanks, while Kissama national park is adjusting to life after civil war. The park reopened in 2002 with species including elephants and the endangered giant sable antelope, imported from Botswana and South Africa, which had been wiped out by hunger and poaching. The Kwanza river is important to thousands of Angolans. There is now competition over catches between locals and established fishing lodges with modern equipment and speedboats. Kwanza Lodge is a popular weekend fishing resort, owned by a relative of Angola’s President, José Eduardo dos Santos. The manager is a South African called Manny Milner. Angola is developing as a result of the influx of expats and oil revenues in one of the world’s fastest growing economies. But the new Angola isn’t accessible to everybody. Nine out of 10 visitors this weekend are expats: Portuguese soap opera actors, Chinese engineers and Brazilian construction workers. Milner believes that eco-tourism is the future for Angola. “It’s a way to protect the rural community from a large-scale tourist industry,” she says. In 2016, Luanda will host a large professional golf tournament where enthusiasts of the sport will be encouraged to visit Kissama national park. Angola’s official tourist plans focus on wealthy visitors who will sample luxury and stability experienced by only a minority of the Angolan people. According to Paul Wesson, a South African who runs Eco-Tur, Angola’s 12 years of stability have finally opened up the country to the outside world. “There’s always been interest,” he says. “Angola is the only country in southern Africa left for well-travelled people to explore, who’ve already seen the Serengeti and Kalahari. This is the final frontier of wildlife tourism in southern Africa.” One of the attractions of tourism in Angola is fishing, an industry threatened by demand from locals for food and tourists for sport. But, according to Roland Goetz, director of Kissama national park, fishing in the Kwanza river is unregulated, which could disturb both the river and the park’s ecosystems.
In 2007, the regional thinktank Institute for Security Studies warned of the permanent degradation of the marine environment in southern Africa as a result of overfishing. Its report, The crisis of marine plunder in Africa, concluded: “This in turn will continue to adversely impact on food security and economic development, with coastal communities dependent on fishing being the hardest hit.” This is already the case in Namibe province, where fishermen risk their lives in small rowing boats on rough seas, lacking equipment and earning next to nothing. Not far away, modern fishing equipment and robust boats rest in the sand at tourist lodges. Namibe province accounts for 65% of Angola’s fish production and has in recent years gained the interest of the global fishing industry. Before the second world war, when Angola was a Portuguese colony, only Lisbon’s freighters were allowed in these waters. Now, with the market open to foreign investors, even Angola’s waters have become pieces of a geopolitical jigsaw puzzle. There is no way for Namibe’s fishermen to compete with the larger boats: while the former do small-scale fishing, vessels from South Africa, the EU, Russia and China operate in eco-certified areas. Pedro Soares is a former fisherman who now works as a chef at a fishing resort. He’s worried about the Angolan people’s place in society. He wants the tourist industry to blossom and provide jobs, but not if it means catering only for foreigners. “That’s the case with the oil,” he says. “We need to break through as a people and claim jobs outside the service sector. As now, the region’s best fish goes to Luanda while we’re left with the scraps.” Soares believes that Angola’s young people can change this. “We must mature, educate ourselves and make wise decision[s], which I’m sure we’ll do. We want more out of life than just providing the rest of the world with oil and fish.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/02/angola-tourism-fishing-development,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/02/angola-tourism-fishing-development

I’m Hugh Muir. This month, something different. We’ll be returning to some of the people and issues we’ve talked about this year and finding out what happened next. We’ll also be touching on what we can expect in 2015. We’ve updates on Ebola in west Africa and how the world looks after climate change talks in Peru. Here’s what happened after we uncovered corruption in Mali; Nato’s pulled out of Afghanistan, how will that impact on development there? All of that coming up and more on this bumper Global development podcast from the Guardian. And we begin this month’s podcast where we left the last: Lima and the Cop 20 climate change talks in Peru. You’ll have read the gist of it by now. Pretty hopeful. A key first step but plenty left to do. Let’s unpick that summary now with the Guardian’s US environment correspondent, Suzanne Goldenberg. She’s in Peru now. And our environment editor, John Vidal, he’s here with me in London. Hello to both of you. JV Hello. SG Hi. HM Suzanne, let me start with you. We expected a compromise, one that no one was really happy with, that got us closer to a deal. Is that basically what we’ve got? SG Oh yeah. I mean we’ve got an agreement that came out at the eleventh hour that everybody is unhappy with. So if that’s the definition of a compromise then this is a compromised deal. HM Is that what was likely, that everyone was going to come out of this happy? One would have thought not? SG Oh no, no everyone’s unhappy. Everyone’s a little bit unhappy. HM Isn’t that what you thought going into it, that’s where we would be? SG You know, what I think happened is that everyone’s optimism was boosted going into the talks because there had been this deal between the two biggest carbon polluters, the US and China. And they agreed between them to cut emissions. Money had begun to sort of dribble into the green climate fund. There was a sense of momentum. So then people thought, well, maybe for once we can actually accomplish something at these talks. And then, the inevitable roller coaster arc of these things, we thought the talks would collapse. And they did actually emerge with something that ticked the boxes for the big constituent blocks here. So I think there are some good things that come out of this judging by the very modest standards that we have come to expect from such meetings. HM John Vidal here in London, all countries will have to make cuts in carbon use – is that enough? Is that enough to make you happy? JV Yeah. It probably is a very good thing, but frankly these are voluntary cuts, so every country will be able to choose effectively what it wants to do, what it can do. So we’re going to get lowest common denominator stuff and we’ve no idea if that’s going to be in total anywhere near enough to get us down to the maximum of one degree or two degree centigrade rise in temperatures, which the cuts will need. I can’t personally see it happening. So all countries by end of March are going to have to say what they’re going to cut. And then, by November next year, the UN will have crunched those figures and we’ll be able to see exactly whether we’re on target or not to keep the temperatures down. And I feel we’ll be well, well, well away – and there’ll be an almighty confrontation in Paris next year. HM Is voluntary not binding? Who do we have to keep an eye on; who are likely to be the laggards here? JV Take your pick! SG Everybody! HM I suppose it’s good that they had some sort of agreed text but it does seem to water down previous commitments, Suzanne, on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. You’ve written one particular phrase “common but differentiated responsibilities” – what’s that about? SG Basically, 20 years ago, when the international community began dealing with this issue, there was this idea that the countries responsible for the problem – which is the US and Europe, the rich countries, the industrialised world – should take responsibility for climate change, that they should be the ones that should cut emissions. Now what’s happened since then is that countries like China, India, Brazil have begun to develop, and they’ve begun to do so and to grow their economies on a very polluting pattern. In fact, China now produces more greenhouse gas emissions than the United States. So the United States, and to a lesser extent Europe, has managed to reshape the nature of these talks so that, from hereonin, China, India and other countries are going to have to cut their emissions as well. So that’s a big deal, that that language is in there. You also see a sub-clause in there, so common but differentiated responsibilities means that China and the other emerging economies don’t have to do as much as the US. And then there’s another sub-clause that says, well, they actually do have to do something. So that’s a big deal. HM That’s the devil in the detail though, isn’t it John, the differentiated responsibilities – one could see people and countries arguing about that until the year dot. JV Hugh, it’s the key to the whole thing because what’s happened is they’ve built up this enormous resentment by the poor countries, which now are absolutely furious that the rich countries are not going to have to lead anymore. And this is unjust. This is a climate injustice of the first order. And so they’re not going to let them get away with that in Paris next year. HM That’s interesting, because when you read the headlines you kind of think that’s good everyone has a common level of responsibility. But in one way it’s just the big countries palming off some level of their responsibilities to smaller ones, isn’t it? JV What you’ve got is historical responsibility as well. The mess we’ve got ourselves into now is not actually very much to do with China and India, it’s much more to do with what happened 50-100 years ago in Europe and America and the industrialised countries. Now in the past, those countries took historical responsibility and said they would lead the world out of this mess. And now what’s happened is, as Suzanne has rightfully said, it’s everybody’s responsibility. HM But doesn’t that just mean no one’s leading? JV Well, exactly. The poor countries don’t mind cutting their emissions, that’s not a great problem, I mean they want money to help them and everything like that. But they do mind if the rich countries don’t take a lead, and that’s what we’re not seeing and that will be the faultline later on, I sense. HM Suzanne, is that the nightmare, that the poor countries go away with a piece of paper and it all looks very good, and then they get home and they read it and they think, “Oh, this is not what we thought it was, this is not as good as we thought it was”? SG What I found interesting about this particular Cop, which is what they call these annual meetings, was that I don’t think you can, and this is a success from US and European diplomacy in a way, in that I don’t see that those distinctions quite so clearly between rich and poor countries. You’ve got the alliance of poor countries that has begun to fracture in all sorts of different ways. So you have big developing countries such as India, China, Brazil and South Africa. Then you’ve got this group of Latin American countries such as Peru and Mexico and Colombia that are going along with the US line quite clearly, to the extent that they’re putting money into climate finance. That they are not in some intermediate rich/poor group where they are helping to pay for other countries. So you’ve got India, China the big developing countries; you’ve got the middle countries; and then you’ve got the poorest of the poor countries that have also been co-opted a little bit by the United States. So the big divide of rich country/poor country is shifting around a bit. And I think that is why the US and Europe have been able to reshape this conversation into this idea that everybody has to do their fair share rather than [say]: “Look, we’ve been the cause of the problem.” JV I think the danger is we’ve got now very little negotiating time left before we get this supposed final deal in Paris. And it’s not in anybody’s interest to sign up to a deal which is not going to help them in any way. The big other elephant in the room is the finance, the money. And here the rich countries have really come up with derisory offers. Suzanne wrote a very good piece about this. HM Give us some idea. SG Basically, it’s a quarter of what they raised before. In 2010, 2011, 2012 they managed to get $10bn a year. Now after saying, “Woo-hoo Green Climate Fund”, they’ve managed to get $10bn over four years. And some of that is not new money, some of that is just moving money from one pot to the other, especially with Australia. And yet developing countries are supposed to take from this some kind of reassurance that somehow the rich countries and the middle-income countries are going to mobilise enough money to reach $100bn every single year by 2020. That’s a huge gap. HM What is that gap going to mean, John Vidal? JV The gap is getting bigger, not smaller – that’s the whole point. It means that unless they come up with real, cast-iron assurances by October/November next year, unless we see real money on the table, these talks will collapse. I’m absolutely certain of it. HM Suzanne, you’re leaving Lima this afternoon along with delegates and negotiators from around the world. What happens next? SG Well, what happens next is that people have until March officially to really show what they’re going to do. They have to put forward a figure for emissions reduction targets. Now you’ve seen the targets coming forward from the US and from the European Union and from China; now the pressure is on for others to begin to put forward those targets. And countries are crunching those numbers and seeing what they can offer. And so by the end of March, hopefully, we’ll get an idea of how serious countries are. HM Quick prediction from you, John Vidal, what do you think will happen in the next year? JV There’s going to be some grotesque arm-twisting, in fact call it bullying, from the rich countries over the poor countries. And money will be offered and there will be blood on the tracks. HM OK. Suzanne Goldenberg, John Vidal thank you very much. We will be here, we’ll monitor and see if those predictions are right, here on the Global development podcast. JW Hello, this is Jonathan Watts, I’m Latin America correspondent for the Guardian. For me this has been a year that’s been a mixture of elections on the political side, of course the World Cup on the sports and entertainment side; but underlying them all and dearest to my heart it’s been a story of increasing deterioration of the regional environment. And by that I mean we’ve seen more and more mining companies, hydroelectric companies, roadbuilders, loggers, drug dealers using the Amazon, the world’s biggest forest, pushing through it and transforming some of the world’s most biodiverse areas. Even in the best case scenario, all that will have happened is that the rate of deforestation has slowed down; it hasn’t stopped, it’s just slowed down. So more and more of the Amazon is being cleared. I’ve been here in Latin America now for two and a half years. The longer I’m here, the more often I’m visiting the Amazon and the more I’m coming to realise just how threatened it is and how it’s being broken up by all of these different projects that are now taking place. And we’re seeing this transformation not just in Brazil but in Peru and in Ecuador. So the news on the environmental front has pretty much been negative across the border, unfortunately. Some of the most striking stories of the year, although they didn’t always make the front pages, have been about new infrastructure projects. And in particular last week and the week before that, I’ve seen the two biggest projects in Latin America. The biggest one currently taking place is the construction of the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam in Pará state, Brazil. This is well under way, and by August next year the engineers are saying that they will be able to close off the river and a few months later the first turbine will start to produce electricity, and the whole project will be finished by 2019. There’s been a lot of impact already. You can see swaths of area deforested. The indigenous people have essentially given up the battle. In return, they’ve been compensated with new motorboats, four-wheel drives, iPods – you name it, they’ve been given everything that they asked for. But at the same time they’re saying, “Well you’ve given us all these things from your culture but we’re losing the essence of our way of life”, which is running water and a means of food because they used to fish in the river. So you’re seeing a lot of destruction from that project, although it will provide a phenomenal amount of electricity, 11,000 megawatts, which Brazil definitely needs. The argument, of course, is whether that’s the best way to get it and environmentalists would definitely say no. But it is a climate friendly, if you like, if not environment friendly way of producing electricity. The other really big project that I went to report on, although it hasn’t yet started, is the plan for a new canal across Nicaragua. This will be a rival to the Panama Canal – it will stretch from the Atlantic to the Pacific. It will be, if it gets underway – and everybody in Nicaragua that I spoke to said it will get underway – very, very much bigger than the Panama Canal. It will be longer, more than twice as long. It will be wider, it will be deeper. And it will involve a greater removal of earth than any other project that has ever taken place, according to the engineers who are planning this. This will be an utterly transformative project; the whole GDP of Nicaragua is no more than $12bn a year. This project alone promises at least $40bn to go into the Nicaraguan economy. So you’re going to see a transformative effect that should propel development in Nicaragua, which is the second poorest country in Latin America. But at the same time you’re going to have a huge impact on the environment, particularly Lake Nicaragua, which is the biggest source of fresh water in Central America. So these two projects – and there are many others that I could cite, but let’s just concentrate on these two – for me these are absolutely spectacular developments that are changing the face of Latin America. Yes, lifting living standards but at the same time putting a lot of extra pressure on the environment. EGH My name’s Emma Graham-Harrison, I’m international affairs correspondent for the Observer, but I’ve just moved back to the UK after living in Afghanistan for more than four years. The way the Afghans participated in the election, the turnout of the people in the polling stations – women and men in bad weather conditions – that was a fantastic slap in the face of enemies of Afghanistan, and a big punch in the face of those who believe Afghanistan is not ready for democracy. So 2014 was a pretty historic year for Afghanistan because you had the first ever peaceful, largely democratic transfer of power. The outgoing president, Hamid Karzai, had ruled Afghanistan since 2001. A lot of people had expected that he would try to hold on to power one way or another, perhaps do something like Putin and Medvedev did and create a prime ministerial role for himself or arrange for a puppet candidate to win the election. But in fact he relinquished power. However, things haven’t been entirely resolved by the fact that he’s handed over power because although you have a new president, Ashraf Ghani, a very interesting man who’s a former academic, but he’s now got to move from the world of academia and theories into putting them into practice in a very, very difficult environment. “This is the aftermath of an attack on the Afghan Intelligence Agency in Jalalabad. Six people were killed and over forty wounded when two suicide car bombers …” EGH I think he’s got two main things on his to-do list: one is don’t be defeated by the Taliban, don’t let your government collapse. And number two is sort out the country’s finances; Afghanistan is almost bankrupt. It’s heavily dependent on foreign aid. Well over half of the national budget is provided by donors. The taxation system is very inefficient. The economy’s feeble. And he also has to deal with terrible, terrible corruption. I mean, Afghanistan a couple of years ago had the world’s biggest bank scandal, if you look at the size of the bank relative to national GDP; a bank called Kabul Bank nearly collapsed. The theft was nearly a billion dollars, $925m had gone missing. Ghani, one of the very first things he did when he came to office was order the arrest of two of the main people responsible for that; the guy who had been chairman of the bank and another senior official. And that was a very clear way to send out a signal that he was serious about tackling corruption. “The threat here in Afghanistan was from al-Qaida and al-Qaida training camps. That has been removed, and that is real progress.” EGH But the Taliban definitely see this as a chance to assert themselves militarily to perhaps try and put the Afghan army, the Afghan police on the back foot. You know, very recently, there was a day where Kabul opened the day with a suicide bombing on an army bus that killed several people. And then the day ended with another suicide bombing, this time on a play. One of the very few cultural venues left in Kabul; they were actually performing a play about suicide bombings and the impact of them. And during the performance a teenage bomber detonated a suicide vest, killing at least one person and injuring many more. And the Taliban said afterwards in a statement that they specifically targeted that play because it was spreading lies about jihad and about what they were doing. So I mean you can see with an attack like this the Taliban are sending a very brutal but very sophisticated message. HM That was Emma Graham-Harrison; and before that Jonathan Watts in Brazil. Now to Africa. Monica Mark is the west Africa correspondent for the Guardian. She has contributed to many of our reports this year including our coverage of Ebola, and she’s on the line now. Monica, how has Nigeria coped with the outbreak? MM Nigeria was basically able to draw on its polio surveillance system that’s in place because it’s one of three or four countries in the world where polio is still endemic. So that system could also be used to track people down … I think tens of thousands of contacts. HM So it just had a better infrastructure to start with? MM It had a better infrastructure as well … The Liberian man when he flew in he went to a private clinic because doctors were on strike for much the same reason that doctors are on strike in Sierra Leone right now: they’re not being paid enough and they work in dismal conditions. So doctors happened to be on strike in public hospitals so that meant that only one small clinic was dealing with this Ebola case and they reacted – it’s hard to tell what might have been the case if Sawyer had been exposed to a lot of people. HM Let’s broaden out a bit because obviously the worst thing Nigeria needed I suppose was a medical emergency at the same time as all the other problems, particularly the security emergency that there’s been throughout a lot of the year. Talk to me a bit about that and how that’s evolved? MM It’s been a bad year for security. Nigeria has had a problem with Boko Haram in the north of the country for about five years now, so it’s nothing new. It was this year that 200, almost 300, schoolgirls were kidnapped. We’ve never seen anything on that scale before. So that was pretty terrible. But the thing was in context, those girls being kidnapped, not on that scale, but it’s something that’s happening every day. It happened earlier this week, I think about 40 women were kidnapped from a village in the north. HM Once they’re kidnapped are they staying kidnapped or are they drifting back and we’re just not really monitoring the story properly? MM Part of the reason why Boko Haram continue unchecked is because they’re almost sort of like Nigeria’s dirty secret. It’s almost as if they want to wash it away. And obviously Nigeria is a country of 180 million people, it’s a big country, and people worrying about their own issues on a day-to-day level; infrastructure’s bad, there’s no electricity, running water is patchy. So they try not to think about what’s going on elsewhere because it’s just sort of too much. HM Those girls, we all read about those girls, their plight went around the world, are they still in the clutches of Boko Haram to any large degree, in large numbers? MM To date, apart from girls who were able to escape in the initial hours of their school being raided, only one girl … has been reported to have escaped. So yeah, it’s not a straightforward situation for the government because obviously they have to consider do they want to set a precedent for doing hostage swaps, and it’s very difficult to rescue even just one person who’s being held by Islamists who are not worried about killing their hostages; they have nothing to lose by killing them. So obviously if you have 200-odd girls, it’s pretty much impossible to successfully rescue them. So it’s tough for the government. But one thing they don’t, as far as we can tell, progress hasn’t been made is in terms of dialoguing with this group. Again it’s hard to dialogue with a group that has the ideals that Boko Haram does. There seem to be moderate elements in the group and it does seem their brutality is kind of making people turn against them who initially may have sympathised with some of their ideals. And the government were not aware that they are reaching out to these elements, more moderate elements and making progress with them. HM Is this is on the front pages there in Nigeria; isn’t there a continuing scandal? MM It’s not front-page news any more, it’s just sort of a background … It is covered, but it’s not really front-page news. With the elections coming up, obviously security is going to be one of the main campaigning issues so that might change over the next few months. And what we’ve seen even just in the runup to the primaries is a spike in bomb blasts going off in major cities rather than rural areas, which is where Boko Haram has been concentrating. HM Is it really possible that good Goodluck Jonathan’s government can go into an election with 200-odd girls kidnapped, not having got them back, and still win an election? MM In Nigeria that is entirely possible, and it’s likely as well that the incumbent will win. Not least because people are sort of, better the devil they know, that’s kind of their attitude. HM Monica, obviously you’ll be looking forward to the elections in Nigeria but what else are you looking forward to, what will be the other big stories in the region? MM It’s a big year for elections across Africa, and west Africa in particular. Togo, Benin and Ivory Coast will be particularly interesting to watch. Their first elections since Alassane Ouattara came into power in 2011, that election basically it triggered a sort of bridge that … civil conflicts that was the culmination of years of conflict that had been building up. So it will be interesting for the first time in a really long time to have a democratic election in Ivory Coast to see how people feel about the incumbent, Ouattara, who was when he came in he was an IMF, French-educated, former IMF director, a real technocrat. Some people had high hopes that he could restore Ivory Coast to the position it had once been in, which was the shining star of west Africa. So it will be interesting to see what issues come up around his election and how he handles that. And particularly in context of Burkina Faso’s recent political troubles. Blaise Compaoré who has been president for 27 years tried to extend the constitution and that led to his being swept out. So there’s a whole generation of young people in Burkina Faso who have grown up with just one president. HM I’m sure it will be good and bad, and fortunes will rise and fall, but do you go into 2015 optimistic for Africa? MM Realistically, it’s hard to imagine there’s going to be any sort of dramatic changes, but I am hopeful that quite a lot has been learned in what’s been quite a tough year, and that that will have a positive impact going forward. HM Monica, thank you. I’m sure we’ll hear from you on our Global Development podcast throughout 2015 but for now, thank you very much. Let’s stay with west Africa, because the Guardian’s health editor, Sarah Boseley, has just been in Sierra Leone and Liberia. She’s been speaking to local health workers and NGOs on their continuing struggle against the Ebola epidemic. This is her report. SB In large letters, on a hoarding at a traffic junction is a public health warning. It runs: “Ebola is real. ABC – avoid body contact. NHS – no handshake.” MA “We’re trying to bring in some food items as well as non-food items to households that are quarantined. They are locked up, they cannot move out in search of food. So they rely on what we supply them.” SB Mori Amadou is a project manager for Plan International. He distributes food to villages in quarantine. Are people happy to stay in their homes if they get the package of food? MA There is … for them to go in search of food to get their daily livelihoods. If they are quarantined and they are given proper support then definitely there is no reason for them to feel bad about staying home in order to prevent the further spread of the infection. That’s basically why Plan International is helping with all this food and non-food items with support from … SB Is it difficult sometimes to get to these homes because they’re built in places that are hard to access? MA Yes, it is really very difficult – as you saw today. In fact, most of the locations you really have to mind your steps, it’s rocky and bumpy and the footpaths are really narrow and they’re full of steps. It’s really difficult. There’s no car access. People have to help carry the load, so bring it as close as the street can take us to, or the car can take us, and then we go meet the people discuss with them, give them their papers, sensitise them on their package and what it entails and the reason why we are giving the package. And then we tell them to ask their neighbours who can afford to come and help them collect their food stock on their behalf. SB Sierra Leoneans are being asked to make fundamental changes to their behaviour. It goes beyond funerals, where families now know, although they do not all accept, that they must not touch the body of those who have died. A hug or a handshake is now considered dangerous. That is hard in a tactile society. MR Today, I’ve already picked two bodies. SB And what sort of people were they? MR Male. They are men. SB In the western areas of Freetown, Mustafa Rogers works for the Red Cross burial teams explaining to families why their loved ones must be taken away. MR My job is … beneficial communication. I always talk to the people who’ve lost their loved ones, encourage them, talk to them – just give them encouraging talks so that they will not feel bad of what is happening now or what has been going on in Sierra Leone, this Ebola crisis situation. SB And I think you talk to them and also to all the rest of the community about the dangers of Ebola and how to keep safe. MR Yes I did that because at any time we arrive at a community since this Ebola breakout come in this country, we have other people who have been telling communities about the dangers of Ebola. So when we come as volunteer Safe and Dignified Burial team, we’re also emphasise on it again that you should keep away from Ebola, don’t touch body contact – we have to tell them, you see, just for them not to come in contact of Ebola. And we break the chain; we try to cut the chain of Ebola so that the country will be free from Ebola. SB Does the community get very upset when you pick up the bodies or do they accept this now? MR No, they accept us because we are the volunteers of the Safe and Dignified Burial team. Whenever we reach a community we try to talk to them in a manner so that they will not get annoyed at us. So they appreciate … very much picking bodies in the communities. SB This is Dr Ramona Sunderworth, an emergency paediatric physician working in Lunsar. RS I have a bit of an advantage, since I grew up in Brazil, but it is very hot. Even before you get into … you’re sweating, and then once you get into it you have 10 pieces of equipment that cover you from head to toe, including goggles and masks and gloves – double, triple sets of gloves. So it gets quite wet in there, I must say. And in the tents where the temperature is a good 10 degrees higher than even in the ambient air, it can get quite drippy, I would say. SB It isn’t the usual way round that things are in medicine. The patient doesn’t come first, actually, the rest of the community comes first. Because there’s no treatment, people have to be kept away if they have the virus so the rest of us are safe. And a lot of the doctors out there struggle slightly with this. This is public health rather than medicine. Obviously, everybody’s doing as much as they possibly can for those people who fall ill, but they have no treatments, there are no drugs. And so at the moment all they can do is to keep them apart. RS We don’t stay in there for more than two hours maximum, usually about an hour and a half, maybe an hour 50 minutes – in the middle of the day that’s about all one can really be functional in those suits. But a part of it is just staying focused on the job you’re doing and being safe, being very aware of where you are, not focusing on the heat. Because the main issue is not the heat, it’s the safety of the healthcare providers and the care that you’re giving the patients, so that helps forget about the heat for a little while. SB You can see the emotional danger they’re in. They want so much to cure these young people, and the older ones too, and are investing so much by coming here, that the deaths hurt, badly. They can still make the odd joke about Ebola – they need to be able to. One suggests a new way to get rid of persistent but unwanted male admirers back home: give them a kiss on the mouth and remark, “I’ve just come back from working in an Ebola treatment centre!” But it’s not just Ebola that they’re fighting in western Africa. In Liberia, Médecins Sans Frontières, or MSF, is about to distribute malaria tablets to almost two and a half thousand families living in West Point, a slum area of the capital. Malaria kills more people than Ebola, particularly pregnant women and small children. The symptoms are identical to Ebola – fever, headache, vomiting. That means there is a risk somebody suffering from malaria will end up in an isolation unit where they may pick up the lethal virus from those who really do have it. Claimonbes des Moulier is a logistician with MSF who has planned these early morning hand-outs in incredible detail. CDM Today’s situation went pretty well. We started at 5:30 it’s now ten to seven and we almost distributed 2,300 kits, so for 2,300 families. People were well respecting the no-touch policy, which is great to avoid any cross-contamination. This is our main challenge. SB You have to take some very serious precautions, don’t you, before you come into these areas. CDM The challenge is about gathering people together. We have to make sure that they will not come all together after they reach the distribution spot to make sure they will not push each other, rush, fight and, especially, touch each other and trying to avoid, as much as possible, any contact. This is for all the beneficiaries. But on the other side, for the people that are working on the site, the distributor, the sensitisation team, drivers, supervisor, is to protect themselves from any contact as well. So we are following very strict rules of protection, prevention with some safe area where we are working in. We have some buffer area to avoid any direct contact with the people, especially at the distribution point. SB And what is the reason for doing this; is it just to do with malaria or is it about Ebola? CDM It’s about both at once. So malaria is still here and is killing a lot of people every year. Also malaria first symptoms – fever and weakness and vomiting – are quite similar to Ebola. So first of all that was to help the Ebola treatment unit to have less people in the … centre and in the transit centre. Now the idea also is to avoid cross-contamination for people who are suspected of having Ebola, but who actually get only malaria. And in case they are brought to the suspect area, they can be contaminated and become some Ebola cases. SB MSF tells its staff: don’t touch anybody, don’t touch anything, don’t sit down. It’s not as easy as it sounds. A small crowd of women gather as I speak to one or two, and move in close. Then one of them, impatient of my attempts to understand the spelling of her name, grabs my pen and writes it in my notebook. Does it matter? Very likely not, but I felt obliged to spray the pen with chlorinated water afterwards, as well as the hand she touched. HM Sarah Boseley there. And you can follow her Ebola diary at theguardian.com/global-development. DS I’m David Smith. I’m the Africa correspondent of the Guardian and I’m based in Johannesburg, South Africa. 2014 the narrative of “Africa rising”, as it’s often described, really continued. There were many conferences for investors where they liked to hold up the cover of the Economist magazine from 2000, which described Africa as “a hopeless continent” and then about a decade later a headliner “Africa rising” or “the hopeful continent”. And particularly in terms of development, I think the two stars that are often held up as models tend to be Ethiopia and Rwanda. Both of these countries have done very well on many of the millennium development goals. Rwanda in particular, where we are slashing maternal mortality and great improvements in education and on other counts. What of course does not get mentioned at these conferences, even the words are almost taboo, are issues like democracy and human rights. And human rights watchdogs are extremely critical of both the Ethiopian and Rwandan governments. What we also are very concerned to watch and worry about is the ongoing conflicts in the Central African Republic and South Sudan. In December, it will be one year in South Sudan since the outbreak of civil war and there’s been a slight lull in the fighting really because of the weather, due to seasons, but a lot of the international aid agencies are warning that they expect a resurgence in fighting there. And I should also mention Kenya: the president, Uhuru Kenyatta, had charges against him dropped at the international criminal court. In the meantime, a year after the terrible attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, there was no let-up from the al-Shabaab militants. More attacks, dozens of people killed in cold blood, sort of raising questions about the Kenyan military operation in Somalia. Despite that, actually, you could argue Somalia was very unusually one of the happier notes of 2014. Still some terrible atrocities going on, but actually in Mogadishu itself a gradual incremental change for the better. Journalists love writing stories about the first florist, the first laundrette; this year we saw the first cash ATM in Mogadishu and I think the first postal service for 20 years. But clearly still a long way to go there, despite the glimpses of optimism. ADS I’m Alex Duval Smith. I did a podcast in September looking at how corruption is affecting development in Mali. “There’s also been some flaws.” ADS Are you referring to the presidential jet? “Yes the presidential jet. So it’s created a lot of talk around it.” ADS The podcast looked at the impact of the purchase by the Malian government of a presidential jet and the extension of a credit facility of $200m for the purchase of defence equipment. This irritated the donors, in particular the IMF, which froze its direct budgetary support to the Malian government. It mainly looks like accountants are now happy with the 2014 books that Mali can present. It’s not entirely clear that the government is going to be any more transparent in future, even though it’s pledged that it will be. AodB We, the IMF, we don’t generally take issue with specific spending items, but you can imagine if you were a donor you may want to reconsider your budget support. ADS In the podcast we heard from Anton Op de Beke, who is the representative of the IMF here in Mali, and he’s become quite a celebrity. He’s seen by local civil society groups as really having produced the biggest shock to Ibrahim Boubacar Keita’s government since it was elected in August 2013. Another person we heard from was Coumba Bah. Interestingly, Coumba Bah has now moved on to have quite a prominent role in civil society, leading a good-governance NGO which is making waves. CB Yes the Malian diaspora send a lot of money in. But I have a feeling that 90% of the money that is sent by diaspora is … for no business development whatsoever. ADS I think it’s going to be interesting to watch the extent to which aid manages to penetrate northern Mali. There are attempts, constant attempts, to restart work on a road which is EU-funded, which will eventually connect Bamako and Timbuktu on tar – which is very important for the opening up of northern Mali; and in the process of opening up northern Mali, development aid, but also investment can reach the north. At the moment the north is still very much in the hands of smugglers and a parallel economy which essentially dominates the north. CB But has anybody done an evaluation, an audit, of the productivity and the meeting of a goal. We put 30bn in this agriculture sector to have this much done in rice. Can we go and see if that rice has been produced. And if the rice has been produced, has it been stored properly? What is meant to be shipped out of the country, sold, to have value added, is that being done? But the government just sits and sends you a report. ADS Since the election of Ibrahim Boubacar Keita at the end of 2013, Mali has emerged very much as a country whose hand is being held by France and the international community, in terms of its sovereignty, its defence and its development aid. The government has no social programmes whatsoever. It would be interesting to see if more pressure was put on the government to live up to, for example, the Abuja declaration, to spend more money on social issues such as health, such as education, which is still very much considered, it seems, by the government as somebody else’s problem; in other words the international community’s problem. HM That was Alex Duval-Smith. And you can follow her stories from Mali on Twitter. That’s @AlexDuvalsmith.

2015-01-02T10:28:07Z,global-development,Global development,Uganda has little to show for African trade agreement after 14 years │Alon Mwesigwa,"When Uganda recruited more than 1,400 women from rural villages and took them to the country’s capital, Kampala, in 2002, the east African state dreamed big. The women were told that they would work in a textile firm, which would export clothes made in Uganda to the US under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa), generating a lot of revenue for the country. They were promised good pay, better working conditions and a “bright future”. They were employed by Tri-Star Apparel from Sri Lanka, which had set up in Uganda to take advantage of the Agoa initiative. But relations between the company and its workers soon turned sour. A year later, in 2003, the women went on strike, citing mistreatment by their employer and pitiful pay. Each woman earned just $40 (£26; about 75,000 Ugandan shillings at that time) a month. As a result of their protest, roughly 300 women were fired. Despite huge subsidies, including tax waivers and loan guarantees to boost its production, Tri-Star Apparel went bust in 2006. Their dreams shattered, most of the Agoa women went back to their villages; others sought petty employment in the city. The episode was perhaps the first sign that Uganda would benefit little from Agoa. The act was signed into law by Bill Clinton, the US president at the time, in May 2000. It was designed to allow goods from sub-Saharan African countries’ – except firearms – to enter the US tax and quota free. With more than 6,500 product lines eligible for export to the US under Agoa, including live animals and animal products, the initiative looked like a good deal for countries such as Uganda. It was hoped that the act would raise production at home, boost employment and improve people’s livelihoods. Agoa’s architects reasoned that trade, not aid, could fight poverty on the continent. In a special advertisement supplement published in the New York Times on September 19, 2002, Uganda’s president Yoweri Museveni sounded certain of the benefits. “We are on the threshold of a strategic breakthrough,” he said. “We have carried out all the reforms and what is most important for us is market access. Now we have it. In five years’ time, Uganda will be a totally different story – once we can take advantage of what is in front of us.” However, nearly 15 years later, Gerald Sendawula, who was Uganda’s finance minister in the early 2000s, and pushed for the country to endorse Agoa, said: “We don’t have anything to show. I haven’t seen anything going to Agoa.” It appears some countries, including Uganda, did not have the capacity to reap fully the benefits from Agoa. Uganda has the highest youth unemployment in Africa, estimated at 62%.
Last year, Uganda’s exports to the US were worth $47m, up from $34.8m in 2003. Meanwhile, US goods exported to Uganda had reached $125m in 2013. Last year, Uganda’s top exports to the US included spices, tea, freshwater fish, crafts, and live trees. Uganda’s neighbours are doing well. While Kenya exported goods worth $389.5m in 2012, Uganda could only manage $34.5m. Tanzania earned $114m that year. One of the problems is that Uganda has no major manufacturing facilities. It was expected to capitalise on its potential in agriculture, which employs three-quarters of the population, and cash crops such as coffee and cotton were to lead the way. The landlocked country was regarded as one of the best cotton producers in the world ; it would have an edge over rivals in the global market. Ironically, when Tri-Star Apparel arrived, the company imported cotton from Pakistan, even though Uganda had the capacity to supply the factory. Meanwhile, Uganda’s position as one of the biggest producers of coffee on the continent has been eroded, with volumes dwindling and some farmers battling coffee wilt. The majority of Uganda’s exports – including coffee, vanilla beans, fish, cocoa beans and tea – already enter the US duty-free under the Most Favored Nation (MFN) programme, which means they are not counted as Agoa products. “Uganda’s first mistake was that it failed to empower local farmers to be able to produce for Agoa,” said Dr John Mutenyo, an academic at Makerere University’s school of business. “Yet this was the main intention of Agoa.” According to Martin Okumu, secretary general of the Uganda National Chamber of Commerce, the country was never ready for the US market. He argued that, instead, Uganda should have focused on markets closer to home in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Uganda was earning $240m in exports from South Sudan annually before fighting broke out in the country in December 2013 – far above what it got from US, according to the Bank of Uganda. “Are you going to enter the US market with tomatoes?” says Okumu. “We can’t compete with US farmers, who are heavily subsidised.” Unlike Kenya or Tanzania, Uganda failed to establish an Agoa strategy to mobilise and guide those producing goods through the initiative. “It is in Uganda where an investor who wants land, or [who wants to] have a transformer connected to their factory, must see the president personally. Genuine investors don’t want such things,” said Fred Muhumuza, a senior manager at the audit firm KPMG Uganda and also a former adviser to Uganda’s finance minister. The World Bank’s Doing Business report 2015 ranks Uganda 150th out of 189 nations. The report cited red tape and high transport costs as big turn-offs to investors. Erin Truhler, information officer for the public diplomacy section at the US mission in Uganda, said the countries who have benefited most from the scheme are those that “have done the most to create an attractive business environment, both for foreign investors and domestic firms, by encouraging investment and trade”. Agoa is due for renewal in September, and Uganda will be seeking an extension. Last month, Museveni announced a new firm, Fine Spinners Uganda, to lead the country’s Agoa efforts if it is extended. The firm will process and export textiles. “We have not benefited from Agoa,” he said. “I am happy that other African countries are benefiting. I would be happier if Uganda benefited too.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/02/uganda-african-trade-growth-and-opportunity-act-us-14-years-on,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/02/uganda-african-trade-growth-and-opportunity-act-us-14-years-on
2015-01-02T07:00:05Z,global-development,Global development,Homework goes mobile for school pupils in Lesotho  | Dan Griliopoulos,"There can be no doubting Lesotho’s commitment to education. In 2000, the country began making primary education free; a decade later, in 2010, it became compulsory. Now the country is trialling a startup that sends homework to pupils via mobile phone. Sterio.me sends homework lessons and quizzes to basic phones that have limited access to data. Phones of this type have more than 86% penetration in Lesotho. The programme is undergoing trials in local schools, supported by the Vodacom Foundation, the ministry of education and the local teachers’ union, before being rolled out across the country. The project was started by Christopher Pruijsen, Danielle Reid and Dean Rotherham during the 2013 StartupBus Africa hackathon, run by ampion.org. “We originally saw the potential to use something as simple as a mobile phone to deliver powerful information, especially across literacy, internet access and device barriers,” says Pruijsen, now CEO of Sterio.me. “We also wanted to make sure that the experience was simple and effective for teachers, by saving them time creating, distributing and marking homework.” The Sterio.me team generates homework and quizzes for teachers, with the content relevant to what students will be learning in the next term. The teachers approve the content before the school year starts. “We can say that, as of December 2014, we have more than 1,000 questions across the Lesotho junior secondary curriculum, approved by active local teachers,” Pruijsen says. Currently, the curriculum covers maths, geography, English and agriculture. When the programme is running, students receive a call covering the day’s work. A text-to-speech programme reads out several multiple-choice questions that the pupil can answer using the phone’s keypad.
The collected data is fed back to improve learning outcomes, teaching methods and the school curriculum. Teachers can see the data in real time, checking which pupils have completed assignments and monitoring their progress while also seeing where they could improve their teaching methods. To aid with policy formation, the data is accessible to government agencies. The Sterio.me team hopes to use the collected data to filter for cheating. “With any type of out-of-classroom or remote form of learning and quizzing, there is a risk of cheating – paper-based homework is the same,” Pruijsen says. “We believe that with the wealth of data we will gather via mobile engagement of the students, both via voice and SMS, we can use big data analysis to filter for ‘high risk of cheating’ scenarios, such as when students who normally take a longer time to respond suddenly take 0.1 second to input the correct answer. We can also scramble the order of correct answers, so that the correct answer for one student might be the ‘1’ key on a given multiple choice quiz, and for another student it would be option ‘3’. “For the moment, feedback from students has been so positive that we trust they will complete the quizzes for their own personal benefit, as they are motivated to improve their education and with this their opportunities at a better life. Students are looking to improve their own comprehension and are excited about new ways to do that.” The project has been a work of passion for the team. “We’ve done everything to make the concept a reality, from sleeping on couches for months to taking on personal loans as founders, all to make Sterio.me a success,” Pruijsen says. In its Lesotho trial, the Vodacom Foundation pays for the airtime, making the system free for students. The team hopes to extend the project’s reach to mobile English language learning in Asia and Latin America, and to expand its basic operation globally.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/02/homework-goes-mobile-for-secondary-school-pupils-in-lesotho,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/02/homework-goes-mobile-for-secondary-school-pupils-in-lesotho
2015-01-01T09:00:06Z,global-development,Global development,Local Ethiopians miss out as big agriculture firms struggle in Gambella | William Davison,"As dusk envelops the grasslands of Gambella in western Ethiopia, a weary Jakob Pouch sits on a jerry can, resting his chest against a wooden staff. The 45-year-old evangelical preacher from the Nuer community has just made the three-hour walk from the banks of the Baro river, where he tends to his large family’s small plot of corn. His daughters are preparing cabbage and cobs to be cooked on an open fire. In the opposite direction, across the asphalt road that leads to South Sudan, lies the farm of BHO Bioproducts, an Anglo-Indian company growing rice and cotton on the 27,000 hectares (67,000 acres) it has leased. Pouch says the company doesn’t care about the people of his village, Wath-Gach. Grazing land has been lost, and BHO has built a wooden cage around a water pump to prevent locals using it. “From the beginning we did not have a good relationship,” he says. “It was given without consultation. There has been lots of negative impact.” The company didn’t respond to a request for comment.
BHO’s operation, which began in 2010, is one of many concessions Ethiopia’s government has granted in Gambella, including one plot leased to the Indian company Karuturi Global of 100,000 hectares. Commercial farmers are expected to bring knowhow, technology and jobs to one of the country’s poorest and most remote regions. By converting uncultivated bush into productive farms, officials believed food security and export revenues would improve in a country dominated by subsistence agriculture. But despite those worthy ambitions, progress has been hampered by Gambella’s logistical difficulties, and a failure to ensure local communities benefit. The village of Ilea is home to people from Gambella’s other main indigenous group, the Anuak. It’s also been the headquarters of Karuturi’s operation for the past five years. In the village, a group of men shelter from the afternoon heat, passing round a tobacco waterpipe. Behind them, women draw water from a well built by the government. Karuturi’s project has stalled after managers discovered that four-fifths of the land is in a floodplain. The firm also failed to build relations with residents, according to the elders. Complaints include reduced land for farming and hunting, no promised health clinic, cattle dying from ingesting pesticides, the burning of unwanted maize, and only a handful of jobs for villagers. “The government benefits from the tax but the community does not benefit,” says Obang Wudo, one of the elders.
The gripes of Ilea’s residents about Karuturi are compounded by their concerns about nearby land parcelled out to Ethiopian investors from outside Gambella. They say they frequently lobby the regional government to act, but nothing has been done. That region’s president, Gatluak Tut Khot, expresses support for investors engaged in “very difficult work”. The regional government can’t force companies to pay more, he explains, but his administration has held meetings to improve relations. “They have to respect the interests of the community and those who need jobs from them,” he says. Gambella has been the focus of a political fallout between the central government and advocacy groups such as Human Rights Watch and the Oakland Institute – with donors uncomfortably positioned in the middle. The critics claim that a resettlement programme to move scattered rural populations to larger settlements was coercive and designed to clear the way for investors. Ethiopia says rights groups from the global north are ideologically opposed to its state-heavy development model and that the voluntary resettlement programme was to make public service delivery more cost-efficient. The UK’s Department for International Development and the World Bank are facing legal inquiries for funding the salaries of civil servants who staffed the enlarged villages. Bikrum Gill is studying the impact of Indian investors on Gambella’s people for his doctorate, with a specific focus on Karuturi. He found that locals had hoped to access more food and better farming technologies, but were often disappointed. Instead, communities lost land and flooding worsened. Speaking specifically about the Karuturi investment, Gill says: “It’s difficult to ascertain, what, if any, benefits this project has brought to affected local people.” Karuturi farm managers at the site referred inquires to the company’s head office, which didn’t respond to attempts to contact it. One farmer from Ethiopia’s highlands, who did not want to be named, tells a different story. He thinks the wave of commercial farming will transform an economic backwater. “They were sitting on the side of the riverbank,” he says about locals. “If investors are coming, their life has changed, they are operators, technicians.” He pays 50 birr (about £1.60) a day – above the average for manual labour in Ethiopia – and provides transport for his workers. Eight houses have been built for teachers, he says, and 25 hectares cleared for the community to plough. Some larger enterprises are also reaching out. At the request of the regional administration, Saudi Star Agricultural Development’s four-year-old rice farm in another part of the region has hired 40 local professionals, while district governments will each get two tractors for young people to use. “We know we’re creating job opportunities, transforming skills, training locals,” says the firm’s chief executive, Jemal Ahmed. “The community has to profit from the project and we have social responsibility.” He is fully aware of local sensitivities about the company’s work. The farm, bankrolled by Ethiopian-born Saudi billionaire Mohammed al-Amoudi, was attacked by gunmen two years ago and has been criticised as a land-grab. Ahmed says no one was displaced from Saudi Star’s 10,000 hectares, which were earmarked in the late 1980s by the previous government for large-scale agriculture. “It’s not part of any villagisation, it’s not been grabbed – that’s a fact,” he says. “But people who have their own agenda, – Oakland Institute and Human Rights Watch – fabricated stories and campaigned against this project.” Gill says part of the problem is that investors are “not seeing the people on the land … It precludes the possibility of engaging with locals. To succeed you have to build out of local diversity and knowledge.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/01/local-ethiopians-miss-out-as-big-agriculture-firms-struggle-in-gambella,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/01/local-ethiopians-miss-out-as-big-agriculture-firms-struggle-in-gambella
2015-01-01T07:00:03Z,global-development,Global development,Palestinian TV to raise awareness of violence against women and girls,"A comedy series and a ‘Judge Judy’-style show will be among the programmes aired across the Palestinian territories in 2015, as part of a multimedia project to raise awareness of, and seek to prevent, violence against women and girls. The Ma’an Network, an independent, non-profit media organisation that broadcasts across the West Bank and Gaza, will use a £730,000 grant from the UK government to air shows that tackle often taboo subjects, such as marital rape, over the next three years. The programmes will be supported by a series of workshops in more remote, conservative areas to discuss violence prevention. The workshops will be aimed at women, men and children, and religious and local leaders will be encouraged to attend. Ma’an has already set up a gender unit, staffed by three people – a journalist, a lawyer and an education expert – to oversee content. The court room programme will use actors to simulate real-life cases of violence, which will be brought before a professional judge and lawyers. The comedy sketch show – Put yourself in my shoes – will have women and men switching roles. The sketch show is likely to be broadcast in the evenings during Ramadan, a time with traditionally high viewing figures. The network will also run a series of programmes profiling inspirational Palestinian women. “Violence against women in my country is still widespread,” said Raed Othman, founder and general director of the network. “Women are still killed because of ‘honour’… if families think they have a sexual relationship outside of marriage. Still in my country there is significant violence against women – economic violence against women, social violence, verbal violence against women. “So in the court we will choose real stories. Serious issues that don’t come up, like the rape of a wife. No woman will go to court and declare her husband raped her. What we will do is discuss these issues in court, let women in society understand their rights in law and how they can deal with it.” According to a report published by the Palestinian Authority in 2011, culture and tradition were often the main justifications for violence against women in Palestine. The continuing Israeli occupation was also having a disproportionate effect on women. “The occupation increases the burden on Palestinian women by destroying infrastructure and endangering their human security, further contributing to the denial of their basic rights,” said the report, which set out an eight-year national strategy to tackle the problem. A 2009 study conducted by UN Women, cited in the report, found that violence against women increased in the aftermath of military strikes on Gaza in December 2008. Surveys carried out by the Women’s Security Index Coalition, formed by Palestinian and Israeli women’s rights organsations, found that women living in Palestine feared rape, domestic violence, discrimination, economic uncertainty and intimidation by the police and the army. The Ma’an Network project is the first of its kind in this region, and aims to reach more than 4 million people. “It is the first time we have had this big media activity,” Othman said. “Normally, women’s organisations have something like this, but on a small scale. They have a TV spot for example, about not hitting your wife, or a talk show to discuss one issue. But this is the first time we’ve created a sustainable three-year project with a lot of activities.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/01/palestinian-tv-to-raise-awareness-of-violence-against-women-and-girls,https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/01/palestinian-tv-to-raise-awareness-of-violence-against-women-and-girls
